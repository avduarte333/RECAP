However, those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel herself, for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled, the anchor a-cockbill, the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing by the side of the pilot, who was steering the Pharaon towards the narrow entrance of the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity and vigilant eye, watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each direction of the pilot.\nThe vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much affected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the vessel in harbor, but jumping into a small skiff, desired to be pulled alongside the Pharaon, which he reached as she rounded into La Réserve basin.\nWhen the young man on board saw this person approach, he left his station by the pilot, and, hat in hand, leaned over the ship’s bulwarks.\nHe was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with black eyes, and hair as dark as a raven’s wing; and his whole appearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from their cradle to contend with danger.\n“Ah, is it you, Dantès?” cried the man in the skiff. “What’s the matter? and why have you such an air of sadness aboard?”\n“A great misfortune, M. Morrel,” replied the young man, “a great misfortune, for me especially! Off Civita Vecchia we lost our brave Captain Leclere.”\n“And the cargo?” inquired the owner, eagerly.\n“Is all safe, M. Morrel; and I think you will be satisfied on that head. But poor Captain Leclere——”\n“What happened to him?” asked the owner, with an air of considerable resignation. “What happened to the worthy captain?”\n“He died.”\n“Fell into the sea?”\n“No, sir, he died of brain-fever in dreadful agony.” Then turning to the crew, he said, “Bear a hand there, to take in sail!”\nAll hands obeyed, and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the crew, sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and outhaul, topsail sheets and halyards, the jib downhaul, and the topsail clewlines and buntlines. The young sailor gave a look to see that his orders were promptly and accurately obeyed, and then turned again to the owner.\n“And how did this misfortune occur?” inquired the latter, resuming the interrupted conversation.\n“Alas, sir, in the most unexpected manner. After a long talk with the harbor-master, Captain Leclere left Naples greatly disturbed in mind. In twenty-four hours he was attacked by a fever, and died three days afterwards. We performed the usual burial service, and he is at his rest, sewn up in his hammock with a thirty-six-pound shot at his head and his heels, off El Giglio island. We bring to his widow his sword and cross of honor. It was worth while, truly,” added the young man with a melancholy smile, “to make war against the English for ten years, and to die in his bed at last, like everybody else.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "On February 24, 1815, the watchtower at Notre-Dame de la Garde signaled the approach of the three-masted ship, the Pharaon, arriving from Smyrna, Trieste, and Naples. Following the usual procedure, a pilot boat immediately set out. It rounded the Château d’If and boarded the vessel between Cape Morgiou and Rion island. As was customary, the walls of Fort Saint-Jean soon filled with onlookers; the arrival of a ship was always an event in Marseilles, particularly when it was the Pharaon, built, rigged, and loaded in the old Phocee docks and owned by a local merchant. The ship sailed closer, having successfully navigated the narrow passage formed by a volcanic tremor between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands. It then rounded Pomègue and slowly and steadily entered the harbor area under its topsails, jib, and spanker. Its deliberate pace caused the bystanders, driven by a premonition of trouble, to wonder what misfortune might have occurred onboard. However, those with nautical experience could see clearly that if there was a problem, it wasn't with the vessel itself, as it was handled with obvious skill. The anchor was ready, the jib-boom ropes had been loosened, and standing beside the pilot, who was guiding the Pharaon towards the inner harbor's narrow entrance, was a young man. This young man, with swift action and sharp focus, monitored the ship's every movement and repeated the pilot's instructions. The general unease among the crowd so affected one man that he didn't wait for the ship to dock. He quickly boarded a small skiff and asked to be rowed alongside the Pharaon, reaching it just as it was turning into La Réserve basin. Spotting this man approaching, the young man on the ship left his position near the pilot, removed his hat, and leaned over the railing. He was a handsome, tall, slender youth, about eighteen to twenty years old, with dark eyes and hair like a raven's wing. His overall bearing reflected the composure and resolve typical of individuals raised facing danger. \"Ah, Dantès, is that you?\" the man in the skiff called out. \"What's wrong? Why do you seem so troubled?\" \"A great tragedy, Mr. Morrel,\" the young man replied, \"a terrible loss, especially for me! Off Civita Vecchia, we lost our brave Captain Leclere.\" \"And the cargo?\" the owner asked anxiously. \"It's all accounted for, Mr. Morrel; I believe you'll be satisfied on that point. But poor Captain Leclere...\" \"What happened to him?\" the owner inquired, his tone accepting. \"What befell the good captain?\" \"He passed away.\" \"Did he fall overboard?\" \"No, sir, he died of brain fever after terrible suffering.\" Then, addressing the crew, he ordered, \"Hands to the sails!\" The entire crew responded instantly. The eight or ten sailors rushed to their assigned spots for the spanker brails and outhaul, topsail sheets and halyards, the jib downhaul, and the topsail clewlines and buntlines. The young sailor quickly checked that his orders were carried out swiftly and precisely, then turned back to the owner. \"And how did this unfortunate event happen?\" the owner asked, resuming their conversation. \"Alas, sir, it was entirely unexpected. After a lengthy discussion with the harbor-master, Captain Leclere departed Naples quite distressed. Within twenty-four hours, he was struck by a fever, and he died three days later. We performed the standard burial rites; he rests now, sewn into his hammock with a thirty-six-pound shot at his head and feet, off the island of El Giglio. We are bringing his sword and cross of honor to his widow. It truly seems ironic,\" the young man added with a sad smile, \"to have fought against the English for ten years, only to die in his bed at the end, like everyone else.\"",

As was the custom, a pilot set out immediately and boarded the ship between Cape Morgiou and Rion island after passing the Château d’If. The fortifications at Fort Saint-Jean were soon lined with onlookers, as the arrival of a ship—particularly one constructed and loaded at the local docks for a Marseille owner like the Pharaon—was always a notable event. The Pharaon navigated carefully through the strait formed between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands, then rounded Pomègue and approached the harbor under some sail. The ship was moving so slowly that the curious spectators began to worry something had gone wrong aboard. However, those familiar with sailing could tell that the vessel itself was undamaged and being handled skillfully. Standing beside the pilot and repeating his orders was a young man attentively watching over the ship's movements. The growing unease among the crowd led one particularly anxious person to row out to the Pharaon before it had even docked. When he drew near, the young man respectfully greeted him. The young man was tall and slim, about eighteen or twenty, with dark eyes and hair, and he looked resolute—a man used to facing danger. The man in the boat called out, \"Is it you, Dantès? What's wrong? Why do you seem so sad?\" Dantès replied, \"A great misfortune, Monsieur Morrel, especially for me. We lost our brave Captain Leclere near Civita Vecchia.\" Morrel asked, \"And the cargo?\" Dantès reassured him that it was safe and satisfactory, but lamented the loss of their captain. \"What happened to him?\" Morrel pressed. \"He died,\" Dantès said. \"Did he fall overboard?\" Morrel asked. \"No, sir; he died of brain fever, in terrible pain.\" Then Dantès directed the crew to take in sail, and the sailors quickly moved to their stations. Morrel asked how it happened. Dantès explained, \"After a troubling conversation with the harbor-master in Naples, Captain Leclere became ill within a day and died three days later. We gave him a proper burial at sea, sewn in his hammock with a heavy cannonball at his head and feet, off El Giglio island. We are bringing his widow his sword and cross of honor. It's strange, after fighting the English for ten years, that he should die quietly in his bed like anyone else.\""

He seized a rope which Dantès flung to him, and with an activity that would have done credit to a sailor, climbed up the side of the ship, while the young man, going to his task, left the conversation to Danglars, who now came towards the owner. He was a man of twenty-five or twenty-six years of age, of unprepossessing countenance, obsequious to his superiors, insolent to his subordinates; and this, in addition to his position as responsible agent on board, which is always obnoxious to the sailors, made him as much disliked by the crew as Edmond Dantès was beloved by them.\n“Well, M. Morrel,” said Danglars, “you have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us?”\n“Yes—yes: poor Captain Leclere! He was a brave and an honest man.”\n“And a first-rate seaman, one who had seen long and honorable service, as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as that of Morrel & Son,” replied Danglars.\n“But,” replied the owner, glancing after Dantès, who was watching the anchoring of his vessel, “it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so old as you say, Danglars, to understand his business, for our friend Edmond seems to understand it thoroughly, and not to require instruction from anyone.”\n“Yes,” said Danglars, darting at Edmond a look gleaming with hate. “Yes, he is young, and youth is invariably self-confident. Scarcely was the captain’s breath out of his body when he assumed the command without consulting anyone, and he caused us to lose a day and a half at the Island of Elba, instead of making for Marseilles direct.”\n“As to taking command of the vessel,” replied Morrel, “that was his duty as captain’s mate; as to losing a day and a half off the Island of Elba, he was wrong, unless the vessel needed repairs.”\n“The vessel was in as good condition as I am, and as, I hope you are, M.

This, combined with his role as the ship's supercargo, which is often disliked by sailors, made him just as unpopular with the crew as Edmond Dantès was well-loved. \"Well, Mr. Morrel,\" Danglars said, \"have you heard about the misfortune that has happened to us?\" \"Yes, yes: poor Captain Leclere!\" Morrel replied. \"He was a brave and honest man.\" \"And an excellent seaman, someone who had years of honorable service, as was appropriate for a man overseeing the interests of such an important company as Morrel & Son,\" Danglars agreed. \"But,\" the owner said, watching Dantès as he oversaw the ship's anchoring, \"it appears to me, Danglars, that a sailor doesn't need to be as old as you suggest to know his job.

You hailed me, I think?”\nDanglars retreated a step or two. “I wished to inquire why you stopped at the Island of Elba?”\n“I do not know, sir; it was to fulfil the last instructions of Captain Leclere, who, when dying, gave me a packet for Marshal Bertrand.”\n“Then did you see him, Edmond?”\n“Who?”\n“The marshal.”\n“Yes.”\nMorrel looked around him, and then, drawing Dantès on one side, he said suddenly—\n“And how is the emperor?”\n“Very well, as far as I could judge from the sight of him.”\n“You saw the emperor, then?”\n“He entered the marshal’s apartment while I was there.”\n“And you spoke to him?”\n“Why, it was he who spoke to me, sir,” said Dantès, with a smile.\n“And what did he say to you?”\n“Asked me questions about the vessel, the time she left Marseilles, the course she had taken, and what was her cargo. I believe, if she had not been laden, and I had been her master, he would have bought her. But I told him I was only mate, and that she belonged to the firm of Morrel & Son. ‘Ah, yes,’ he said, ‘I know them. The Morrels have been shipowners from father to son; and there was a Morrel who served in the same regiment with me when I was in garrison at Valence.’”\n“Pardieu! and that is true!” cried the owner, greatly delighted. “And that was Policar Morrel, my uncle, who was afterwards a captain. Dantès, you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him, and you will see it will bring tears into the old soldier’s eyes. Come, come,” continued he, patting Edmond’s shoulder kindly, “you did very right, Dantès, to follow Captain Leclere’s instructions, and touch at Elba, although if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the marshal, and had conversed with the emperor, it might bring you into trouble.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Turning to the young sailor, the shipowner said, “Dantès, come here!” “Just a moment, sir,” Dantès responded, “and I’ll be right there.” Then, addressing the crew, he ordered, “Drop the anchor!” The anchor was immediately released, the chain rattling loudly as it fed through the hawse-hole. Dantès remained at his post, even with the pilot present, until this maneuver was finished. He then added, “Lower the flag to half-mast, and align the yards horizontally!” “See that,” Danglars remarked, “upon my word, he’s already imagining himself captain.” “And in fact, he is,” the owner stated. “Except for your and your partner’s official endorsement, Mr. Morrel.” “And why shouldn’t he receive that?” the owner asked. “He’s young, I admit, but he seems to me an exceptionally competent and fully experienced sailor.” Danglars’ expression darkened. “My apologies, Mr. Morrel,” Dantès said, approaching, “the ship is now secured at anchor, and I’m at your disposal. You called for me, I believe?” Danglars took a couple of steps back. “I wanted to know why you stopped at the Island of Elba?” “I don’t know the reason, sir; it was to fulfill the final instructions of Captain Leclere, who, while he was dying, gave me a package intended for Marshal Bertrand.” “So you actually met him, Edmond?” “Who?” “The marshal.” “Yes.” Morrel looked around him, then drew Dantès to one side and suddenly inquired, “And how is the emperor?” “Quite well, from what I could observe upon seeing him.” “You saw the emperor, then?” “He entered the marshal’s living space while I was there.” “And you had a conversation with him?” “Well, actually, he initiated the conversation with me, sir,” Dantès replied with a smile. “And what did he say to you?” “He asked questions about the vessel – when she departed Marseilles, the route she took, and what she was carrying. I believe if she hadn’t been loaded and I had been her master, he might have purchased her. But I informed him I was only the first mate, and that she belonged to the company Morrel & Son. ‘Ah, yes,’ he said, ‘I’m familiar with them. The Morrels have been involved in shipping for generations; and there was a Morrel who served in the same military unit as me when I was stationed at Valence.’” “By heavens! That’s true!” the owner exclaimed, clearly delighted. “And that was Policar Morrel, my uncle, who later became a captain. Dantès, you absolutely must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him; you’ll see it will bring tears to the old soldier’s eyes. Come, now,” he continued, giving Edmond a kind pat on the shoulder, “you did completely correctly, Dantès, to follow Captain Leclere’s directions and touch at Elba, although if it became known that you delivered a package to the marshal and spoke with the emperor, it could potentially land you in trouble.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "“Dantès,” the shipowner called out, “come here!”\n“I'll be right there, sir,” Dantès replied. He turned to the crew and commanded, “Let go!”\nImmediately, the anchor was dropped, and the chain clattered through the opening. Even with the pilot aboard, Dantès stayed in his position until the maneuver was finished, then ordered, “Lower the flag halfway and set the yards!”\n“You see,” Danglars remarked, “he already thinks he's the captain, I swear.”\n“He practically is,” the owner responded.\n“All that’s needed is your approval and your associate's signature, Mr. Morrel.”\n“And why not?” the owner said. “He may be young, but he seems to be a skilled and experienced sailor.”\nDanglars frowned.\n“Excuse me, Mr. Morrel,” Dantès said as he approached. “The ship is anchored now, so I’m at your service. Did you need me?”\nDanglars stepped back. “I wanted to ask why you stopped at Elba?”\n“I’m not certain, sir; it was to carry out Captain Leclere’s final orders. As he was dying, he entrusted me with a letter for Marshal Bertrand.”\n“So, did you see Bertrand, Edmond?”\n“Who do you mean?”\n“The marshal.”\n“Yes, I saw him.”\nMorrel looked around, then pulled Dantès aside and asked quietly—\n“And how is the emperor?”\n“He seemed well, as far as I could tell.”\n“So you saw the emperor?”\n“He came into the marshal’s room while I was there.”\n“And did you speak with him?”\n“Actually, he spoke to me, sir,” Dantès replied, smiling.\n“And what did he say?”\n“He asked me about the ship—when we had left Marseilles, our route, and our cargo. I think if the ship had been empty and I had been the captain, he would have bought her. But I explained I was only the mate and that she belonged to the Morrel & Son company. ‘Ah, yes,’ he said, ‘I'm familiar with them. The Morrels have been shipowners for generations, and one Morrel served in the same regiment as me when I was stationed in Valence.’”\n“By heaven! That’s true!” exclaimed the owner with excitement. “That was my uncle Policar Morrel, who later became a captain. Dantès, you must tell my uncle the emperor remembered him—it will move the old soldier to tears. Well done,” he continued, kindly patting Edmond’s shoulder, “You did the right thing by following Captain Leclere’s orders and stopping at Elba, but be careful—if people learn you took a message to the marshal and spoke with the emperor, it might cause you trouble.”"

Morrel, for after this first visit has been paid I have another which I am most anxious to pay.”\n“True, Dantès, I forgot that there was at the Catalans someone who expects you no less impatiently than your father—the lovely Mercédès.”\nDantès blushed.\n“Ah, ha,” said the shipowner, “I am not in the least surprised, for she has been to me three times, inquiring if there were any news of the Pharaon. Peste! Edmond, you have a very handsome mistress!”\n“She is not my mistress,” replied the young sailor, gravely; “she is my betrothed.”\n“Sometimes one and the same thing,” said Morrel, with a smile.\n“Not with us, sir,” replied Dantès.\n“Well, well, my dear Edmond,” continued the owner, “don’t let me detain you. You have managed my affairs so well that I ought to allow you all the time you require for your own. Do you want any money?”\n“No, sir; I have all my pay to take—nearly three months’ wages.”\n“You are a careful fellow, Edmond.”\n“Say I have a poor father, sir.”\n“Yes, yes, I know how good a son you are, so now hasten away to see your father. I have a son too, and I should be very wroth with those who detained him from me after a three months’ voyage.”\n“Then I have your leave, sir?”\n“Yes, if you have nothing more to say to me.”\n“Nothing.”\n“Captain Leclere did not, before he died, give you a letter for me?”\n“He was unable to write, sir. But that reminds me that I must ask your leave of absence for some days.”\n“To get married?”\n“Yes, first, and then to go to Paris.”\n“Very good; have what time you require, Dantès.

'You weren't delayed for long.' 'No. I gave the customs officials a copy of our shipping list, and for the other documents, they sent a man with the pilot, to whom I entrusted them.' 'So you have nothing more you need to do here?' 'No, everything is settled now.' 'Then you can join me for dinner?' 'I truly must ask you to excuse me, M. Morrel. My first stop must be to see my father, although I am no less appreciative of the honor you've offered me.' 'Understood, Dantès, perfectly reasonable. I always knew you were a devoted son.' 'And,' Dantès inquired, with a slight hesitation, 'do you happen to know how my father is?' 'Well, I believe he's well, my dear Edmond, though I haven't seen him recently.' 'Yes, he prefers to stay secluded in his little room.' 'That proves, at least, that he hasn't lacked anything while you were away.' Dantès smiled. 'My father is a proud man, sir, and even if he had no food left, I doubt he would have asked anything from anyone, save from God.' 'Very well, then, after you've made this initial visit, we will look forward to seeing you.' 'I must again beg your pardon, M. Morrel, for after this first visit is made, I have another I am most eager to pay.' 'Ah, yes, Dantès, I forgot that there is someone at the Catalans who anticipates your return no less impatiently than your father – the beautiful Mercédès.' Dantès blushed. 'Ah, ha,' said the shipowner, 'I'm not surprised in the least, as she has come to me three times, asking if there was any news of the Pharaon. Heavens! Edmond, you have a very attractive mistress!' 'She is not my mistress,' the young sailor replied seriously, 'she is my fiancée.' 'Sometimes they amount to the same thing,' Morrel said with a smile. 'Not for us, sir,' Dantès countered. 'Very well, my dear Edmond,' the owner continued, 'don't let me keep you. You have handled my business so efficiently that I should grant you all the time you need for your own. Do you require any money?' 'No, sir, I have all my earnings to collect – nearly three months' salary.' 'You are a prudent young man, Edmond.' 'Let's say I have a father who is poor, sir.' 'Yes, yes, I know what a good son you are, so hurry off now to see him. I have a son myself, and I would be quite angry with anyone who kept him from me after a three-month journey.' 'Then I have your permission to leave, sir?' 'Yes, provided you have nothing else to say to me.' 'Nothing.' 'Captain Leclere didn't give you a letter for me before he passed away?' 'He was unable to write, sir. But that reminds me that I must ask for your leave of absence for a few days.' 'To get married?' 'Yes, that first, and then to go to Paris.' 'Excellent; take all the time you require, Dantès. It will take about six weeks to unload the cargo, and we cannot get you ready for sea until three months after that; just be sure to be back in three months, because the Pharaon,' the owner added, patting the young sailor on the back, 'cannot sail without her captain.' 'Without her captain!' Dantès exclaimed, his eyes shining with excitement; 'please be careful what you say, as you are touching upon the most cherished desires of my heart. Is it truly your intention to make me captain of the Pharaon?'

The owner addressed Dantès: “Well, are you free now?” Dantès replied, “Yes, sir.” “You weren’t kept long,” the owner remarked. Dantès explained, “No, I gave the custom-house officers a copy of our bill of lading, and sent the other paperwork with the pilot.” The owner asked if Dantès had any more duties, to which Dantès said everything was settled. The owner invited him to dinner, but Dantès politely declined, saying his first visit must be to his father, though he thanked the owner for the invitation. The owner approved, saying Dantès was a good son. Dantès hesitantly asked about his father, and Morrel said he believed his father was well, though he hadn’t seen him lately. Dantès said his father enjoyed staying in his room, which at least meant he hadn’t been in need while Dantès was away. Dantès smiled, adding that his father was proud and wouldn’t ask for help from anyone but Heaven if he needed it. Morrel said that, after Dantès’s visit to his father, he hoped to see him again. Dantès again asked to be excused after seeing his father because he had another important visit to make. Morrel remembered and teased that Mercédès at the Catalans waited eagerly for him too. Dantès blushed, and Morrel commented that she was a beautiful lady. Dantès clarified she was his fiancée, not his mistress, which Morrel joked could be the same thing but Dantès insisted otherwise. Morrel urged him not to delay his visits, acknowledging Dantès’s good management of the ship’s affairs and asked if he needed money. Dantès replied he didn’t, as he still had nearly three months’ wages to receive, saying he was careful because of his poor father. Morrel acknowledged his devotion as a son and told him to hurry to see his father, adding that he would be upset himself if his own son was detained after a long voyage. Dantès asked permission to leave, which Morrel granted, and checked if Dantès had anything more to say or if Captain Leclere had left a letter. Dantès said the captain had been unable to write, but he asked for some days off. Morrel asked if it was for marriage, and Dantès replied yes, and then a trip to Paris. Morrel agreed, saying unloading would take six weeks and they couldn’t sail for three months, so Dantès could be away but must return in three months, as the Pharaon couldn’t sail without her captain. Dantès was thrilled and asked if Morrel really meant to make him captain. Morrel said if he were the only owner, he’d agree on the spot, but he had a partner and quoted the Italian saying that a man with a partner has a master. Still, Morrel said the decision was mostly made since he supported Dantès and would work to secure the partner’s approval."

Morrel, I thank you in the name of my father and of Mercédès.”\n“That’s all right, Edmond. There’s a providence that watches over the deserving. Go to your father; go and see Mercédès, and afterwards come to me.”\n“Shall I row you ashore?”\n“No, thank you; I shall remain and look over the accounts with Danglars. Have you been satisfied with him this voyage?”\n“That is according to the sense you attach to the question, sir. Do you mean is he a good comrade? No, for I think he never liked me since the day when I was silly enough, after a little quarrel we had, to propose to him to stop for ten minutes at the island of Monte Cristo to settle the dispute—a proposition which I was wrong to suggest, and he quite right to refuse. If you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the question, I believe there is nothing to say against him, and that you will be content with the way in which he has performed his duty.”\n“But tell me, Dantès, if you had command of the Pharaon should you be glad to see Danglars remain?”\n“Captain or mate, M. Morrel, I shall always have the greatest respect for those who possess the owners’ confidence.”\n“That’s right, that’s right, Dantès! I see you are a thoroughly good fellow, and will detain you no longer. Go, for I see how impatient you are.”\n“Then I have leave?”\n“Go, I tell you.”\n“May I have the use of your skiff?”\n“Certainly.”\n“Then, for the present, M. Morrel, farewell, and a thousand thanks!”\n“I hope soon to see you again, my dear Edmond. Good luck to you.”\nThe young sailor jumped into the skiff, and sat down in the stern sheets, with the order that he be put ashore at La Canebière. The two oarsmen bent to their work, and the little boat glided away as rapidly as possible in the midst of the thousand vessels which choke up the narrow way which leads between the two rows of ships from the mouth of the harbor to the Quai d’Orléans.\nThe shipowner, smiling, followed him with his eyes until he saw him spring out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng, which from five o’clock in the morning until nine o’clock at night, swarms in the famous street of La Canebière,—a street of which the modern Phocéens are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world, and with that accent which gives so much character to what is said, “If Paris had La Canebière, Paris would be a second Marseilles.” On turning round the owner saw Danglars behind him, apparently awaiting orders, but in reality also watching the young sailor,—but there was a great difference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the movements of Edmond Dantès.",

A higher power looks after those who are worthy. Go to your father; go and visit Mercédès, and then come back to see me.”\n“Would you like me to row you to shore?”\n“No, thank you; I’ll stay here and look over the accounts with Danglars. Were you satisfied with him during this voyage?”\n“That depends on how you interpret the question, sir. Are you asking if he was a good fellow? No, because I don’t think he’s liked me since the day I was foolish enough, after a small argument we had, to suggest we stop at the island of Monte Cristo for ten minutes to settle our disagreement—a suggestion I shouldn’t have made, and he was quite right to refuse. If you’re asking about his competence as an officer, I believe there’s nothing to criticize about him, and you’ll be pleased with how he carried out his duties.”\n“But tell me, Dantès, if you were in charge of the Pharaon, would you be happy to have Danglars remain?”\n“Captain or mate, Mr. Morrel, I will always hold in high regard those who have the owners’ trust.”\n“Exactly, exactly, Dantès! I see you are a truly excellent man, and I won’t keep you any longer. Go, as I can tell you are eager.”\n“Then I have your permission to leave?”\n“Go, I said.”\n“Could I borrow your skiff?”\n“Certainly.”\n“Then, for now, Mr. Morrel, farewell, and my sincerest thanks!”\n“I hope to see you again soon, my dear Edmond. Good fortune to you.”\nThe young seaman quickly climbed into the skiff, seating himself in the back, and ordered the oarsmen to take him ashore at La Canebière. The two rowers bent to their task, and the small boat sped away as fast as it could amidst the countless ships that clog the narrow passage leading between the two lines of vessels from the harbor entrance to the Quai d’Orléans.\nThe shipowner watched him with a smile until he saw him jump out onto the quay and vanish into the large crowd that fills the famous street of La Canebière from five in the morning until nine at night—a street of which the people of modern Marseilles are so proud that they state with absolute seriousness, and in the accent that gives such character to their speech, “If Paris possessed La Canebière, Paris would be merely a second Marseilles.” Turning around, the owner saw Danglars behind him, seemingly waiting for orders, but in truth, also observing the young sailor. However, there was a significant difference in the expressions of the two men who were following Edmond Dantès’ departure.",

Morrel,\" cried the young sailor, his eyes filled with tears as he grasped the owner's hand, \"Thank you, on behalf of my father and Mercédès.\" \n\"That’s enough, Edmond. Good fortune watches over those who deserve it. Go visit your father and see Mercédès, then come back to me.\"\n\"Would you like me to take you ashore?\" \n\"No, thank you. I’ll stay to review the accounts with Danglars. Were you satisfied with him during the journey?\"\n\"That depends on what you mean, sir. As a companion, not really—he’s disliked me ever since I once foolishly suggested we stop at the island of Monte Cristo to settle a disagreement, a suggestion he rightly refused. But as a responsible agent, I have no complaints, and I think you’ll be pleased with his work.\"\n\"If you were to command the Pharaon, would you want Danglars to stay?\"\n\"Whether as captain or mate, M. Morrel, I will always respect those trusted by the owner.\"\n\"Very good, Dantès! I can see you’re a fine man, and I won’t keep you any longer. Go on—I can tell you’re eager.\"\n\"Then I have your permission?\"\n\"Go, I say.\"\n\"May I use your skiff?\"\n\"Of course.\"\n\"Then goodbye for now, M. Morrel, and thank you!\"\n\"I hope to see you again soon, Edmond. Good luck.\"\nThe young sailor quickly climbed into the skiff, sat at the stern, and told the rowers to set him ashore at La Canebière. The oarsmen set to work, and the little boat sped off through the crowded channel lined with ships between the harbor entrance and the Quai d’Orléans.\nThe shipowner watched Edmond with a smile until he saw him leap onto the quay and vanish among the crowds that fill La Canebière from early morning to night. The people of Marseilles are so proud of this famous street that they claim, with sincerity and their distinctive accent, \"If Paris had La Canebière, it would be another Marseilles.\" Turning around, the owner noticed Danglars behind him, waiting for instructions but also watching Edmond—yet the feelings revealed on the two men's faces as they followed Edmond's departure were very different."

The news of the arrival of the Pharaon had not yet reached the old man, who, mounted on a chair, was amusing himself by training with trembling hand the nasturtiums and sprays of clematis that clambered over the trellis at his window. Suddenly, he felt an arm thrown around his body, and a well-known voice behind him exclaimed, “Father—dear father!”\nThe old man uttered a cry, and turned round; then, seeing his son, he fell into his arms, pale and trembling.\n“What ails you, my dearest father? Are you ill?” inquired the young man, much alarmed.\n“No, no, my dear Edmond—my boy—my son!—no; but I did not expect you; and joy, the surprise of seeing you so suddenly—Ah, I feel as if I were going to die.”\n“Come, come, cheer up, my dear father! ’Tis I—really I! They say joy never hurts, and so I came to you without any warning. Come now, do smile, instead of looking at me so solemnly. Here I am back again, and we are going to be happy.”\n“Yes, yes, my boy, so we will—so we will,” replied the old man; “but how shall we be happy? Shall you never leave me again? Come, tell me all the good fortune that has befallen you.”\n“God forgive me,” said the young man, “for rejoicing at happiness derived from the misery of others, but, Heaven knows, I did not seek this good fortune; it has happened, and I really cannot pretend to lament it. The good Captain Leclere is dead, father, and it is probable that, with the aid of M. Morrel, I shall have his place. Do you understand, father? Only imagine me a captain at twenty, with a hundred louis pay, and a share in the profits! Is this not more than a poor sailor like me could have hoped for?”\n“Yes, my dear boy,” replied the old man, “it is very fortunate.”\n“Well, then, with the first money I touch, I mean you to have a small house, with a garden in which to plant clematis, nasturtiums, and honeysuckle. But what ails you, father? Are you not well?”\n“’Tis nothing, nothing; it will soon pass away”—and as he said so the old man’s strength failed him, and he fell backwards.\n“Come, come,” said the young man, “a glass of wine, father, will revive you. Where do you keep your wine?”\n“No, no; thanks. You need not look for it; I do not want it,” said the old man.\n“Yes, yes, father, tell me where it is,” and he opened two or three cupboards.\n“It is no use,” said the old man, “there is no wine.”\n“What, no wine?” said Dantès, turning pale, and looking alternately at the hollow cheeks of the old man and the empty cupboards. “What, no wine? Have you wanted money, father?”\n“I want nothing now that I have you,” said the old man.\n“Yet,” stammered Dantès, wiping the perspiration from his brow,—“yet I gave you two hundred francs when I left, three months ago.”\n“Yes, yes, Edmond, that is true, but you forgot at that time a little debt to our neighbor, Caderousse. He reminded me of it, telling me if I did not pay for you, he would be paid by M. Morrel; and so, you see, lest he might do you an injury——”\n“Well?”\n“Why, I paid him.”\n“But,” cried Dantès, “it was a hundred and forty francs I owed Caderousse.”\n“Yes,” stammered the old man.\n“And you paid him out of the two hundred francs I left you?”\nThe old man nodded.\n“So that you have lived for three months on sixty francs,” muttered Edmond.\n“You know how little I require,” said the old man.\n“Heaven pardon me,” cried Edmond, falling on his knees before his father.\n“What are you doing?”\n“You have wounded me to the heart.”\n“Never mind it, for I see you once more,” said the old man; “and now it’s all over—everything is all right again.”\n“Yes, here I am,” said the young man, “with a promising future and a little money. Here, father, here!” he said, “take this—take it, and send for something immediately.” And he emptied his pockets on the table, the contents consisting of a dozen gold pieces, five or six five-franc pieces, and some smaller coin. The countenance of old Dantès brightened.\n“Whom does this belong to?” he inquired.\n“To me, to you, to us! Take it; buy some provisions; be happy, and tomorrow we shall have more.”\n“Gently, gently,” said the old man, with a smile; “and by your leave I will use your purse moderately, for they would say, if they saw me buy too many things at a time, that I had been obliged to await your return, in order to be able to purchase them.”\n“Do as you please; but, first of all, pray have a servant, father.

He quickly climbed four flights of a dark staircase, holding onto the banister with one hand while the other pressed against his chest to calm his heart. He stopped before a door that was slightly ajar, allowing him to see into a small room. This room belonged to Dantès' father. The news of the Pharaon's arrival hadn't reached the old man yet. He was standing on a chair, finding pleasure in gently guiding the tendrils of nasturtiums and clematis that were climbing over the trellis outside his window with his shaky hands.

Take it; buy some provisions; be happy, and tomorrow we will have more.\" \"Slowly, slowly,\" said the old man, with a smile; \"and if you don't mind, I will use your money sparingly, for if they saw me buy too many things at once, they would say that I had been forced to wait for your return to be able to afford them.\" \"Do as you wish; but, first and foremost, please hire a servant, father.

Not wanting trouble for you, I paid him.”\n\n“But it was only 140 francs I owed.”\n\n“Yes,” his father admitted.\n\n“And you managed on sixty francs for three months?”\n\n“You know I need little,” said his father.\n\n“Forgive me,” Edmond said, kneeling, “I’m hurt to the core.”\n\n“Don’t mind—it’s all better now that you’re here.”\n\n“Yes, I’m back, with a bright future.

He was a man of twenty-five or six, and held a piece of cloth, which, being a tailor, he was about to make into a coat-lining.\n“What, is it you, Edmond, back again?” said he, with a broad Marseillaise accent, and a grin that displayed his ivory-white teeth.\n“Yes, as you see, neighbor Caderousse; and ready to be agreeable to you in any and every way,” replied Dantès, but ill-concealing his coldness under this cloak of civility.\n“Thanks—thanks; but, fortunately, I do not want for anything; and it chances that at times there are others who have need of me.” Dantès made a gesture. “I do not allude to you, my boy. No!—no! I lent you money, and you returned it; that’s like good neighbors, and we are quits.”\n“We are never quits with those who oblige us,” was Dantès’ reply; “for when we do not owe them money, we owe them gratitude.”\n“What’s the use of mentioning that? What is done is done. Let us talk of your happy return, my boy. I had gone on the quay to match a piece of mulberry cloth, when I met friend Danglars. ‘You at Marseilles?’—‘Yes,’ says he.\n“‘I thought you were at Smyrna.’—‘I was; but am now back again.’\n“‘And where is the dear boy, our little Edmond?’\n“‘Why, with his father, no doubt,’ replied Danglars. And so I came,” added Caderousse, “as fast as I could to have the pleasure of shaking hands with a friend.”\n“Worthy Caderousse!” said the old man, “he is so much attached to us.”\n“Yes, to be sure I am. I love and esteem you, because honest folks are so rare. But it seems you have come back rich, my boy,” continued the tailor, looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which Dantès had thrown on the table.\nThe young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eyes of his neighbor. “Eh,” he said, negligently, “this money is not mine. I was expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in my absence, and to convince me he emptied his purse on the table. Come, father” added Dantès, “put this money back in your box—unless neighbor Caderousse wants anything, and in that case it is at his service.”\n“No, my boy, no,” said Caderousse. “I am not in any want, thank God, my living is suited to my means. Keep your money—keep it, I say;—one never has too much;—but, at the same time, my boy, I am as much obliged by your offer as if I took advantage of it.”\n“It was offered with good will,” said Dantès.\n“No doubt, my boy; no doubt. Well, you stand well with M. Morrel I hear,—you insinuating dog, you!”\n“M. Morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me,” replied Dantès.\n“Then you were wrong to refuse to dine with him.”\n“What, did you refuse to dine with him?” said old Dantès; “and did he invite you to dine?”\n“Yes, my dear father,” replied Edmond, smiling at his father’s astonishment at the excessive honor paid to his son.\n“And why did you refuse, my son?” inquired the old man.\n“That I might the sooner see you again, my dear father,” replied the young man. “I was most anxious to see you.”\n“But it must have vexed M. Morrel, good, worthy man,” said Caderousse. “And when you are looking forward to be captain, it was wrong to annoy the owner.”\n“But I explained to him the cause of my refusal,” replied Dantès, “and I hope he fully understood it.”\n“Yes, but to be captain one must do a little flattery to one’s patrons.”\n“I hope to be captain without that,” said Dantès.\n“So much the better—so much the better! Nothing will give greater pleasure to all your old friends; and I know one down there behind the Saint Nicolas citadel who will not be sorry to hear it.”\n“Mercédès?” said the old man.\n“Yes, my dear father, and with your permission, now I have seen you, and know you are well and have all you require, I will ask your consent to go and pay a visit to the Catalans.”\n“Go, my dear boy,” said old Dantès; “and Heaven bless you in your wife, as it has blessed me in my son!”\n“His wife!” said Caderousse; “why, how fast you go on, father Dantès; she is not his wife yet, as it seems to me.”\n“No, but according to all probability she soon will be,” replied Edmond.\n“Yes—yes,” said Caderousse; “but you were right to return as soon as possible, my boy.”\n“And why?”\n“Because Mercédès is a very fine girl, and fine girls never lack followers; she particularly has them by dozens.”\n“Really?” answered Edmond, with a smile which had in it traces of slight uneasiness.\n“Ah, yes,” continued Caderousse, “and capital offers, too; but you know, you will be captain, and who could refuse you then?”\n“Meaning to say,” replied Dantès, with a smile which but ill-concealed his trouble, “that if I were not a captain——”\n“Eh—eh!” said Caderousse, shaking his head.\n“Come, come,” said the sailor, “I have a better opinion than you of women in general, and of Mercédès in particular; and I am certain that, captain or not, she will remain ever faithful to me.”\n“So much the better—so much the better,” said Caderousse. “When one is going to be married, there is nothing like implicit confidence; but never mind that, my boy,—go and announce your arrival, and let her know all your hopes and prospects.”\n“I will go directly,” was Edmond’s reply; and, embracing his father, and nodding to Caderousse, he left the apartment.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "\"That's Caderousse,\" the old man said, \"He must have heard you're back and wants to congratulate you on your safe return.\" \"People say one thing but mean another,\" Edmond thought to himself. \"Still, he's a neighbor who helped us once, so let him in.\" Just as Edmond finished speaking, Caderousse, a dark-haired man of about twenty-five or twenty-six with a beard, appeared at the doorway. He was a tailor and carried a piece of cloth for a coat lining. \"Well, look who it is! Edmond, back again?\" he exclaimed in a strong Marseilles accent, grinning widely and showing his white teeth. \"Yes, neighbor Caderousse, I'm back,\" Dantès replied, struggling to hide his lack of warmth behind a polite facade. \"Happy to help in any way I can.\" \"Thanks, but lucky for me, I don't need anything right now,\" Caderousse said. \"In fact, sometimes others need *me*.\" He gestured dismissively. \"Not you, though, my friend. No, no! I lent you money, you paid it back; that's how good neighbors are, and we're even.\" Dantès countered, \"You can never fully repay someone who does you a favor. Even if you don't owe them money, you owe them thanks.\" \"Why bother with all that?\" Caderousse shrugged. \"What's done is done. Let's talk about you coming home. I was down on the quay looking for mulberry cloth when I bumped into Danglars. 'You in Marseilles?' he says. 'Yep,' I told him. 'Thought you were in Smyrna.' 'Was, but I'm back now.' 'And how's that fine young fellow, our Edmond?' 'Probably with his father,' Danglars answered. So,\" Caderousse finished, \"I came straight over to shake the hand of a friend.\" \"Kind Caderousse!\" Edmond's father said. \"He's so devoted to us.\" \"Indeed I am,\" Caderousse agreed. \"I value you because decent people are scarce. But it seems you've come back well-off, son,\" the tailor added, glancing sideways at the money pile on the table. Edmond noticed the greedy look in his neighbor's dark eyes. \"Oh,\" he said casually, \"This money isn't mine. I was worried Dad might have needed things while I was away, so he put his money out to show me he was fine. Go on, Father,\" Dantès added, \"put it away – unless neighbor Caderousse needs anything, then it's here for him.\" \"No, no, my friend,\" Caderousse said quickly. \"I don't need anything, thank goodness. My income matches my lifestyle. Keep your money; keep it, I say. You can never have too much. But know that I appreciate the offer just as much as if I accepted it.\" \"The offer was sincere,\" Dantès said. \"Of course, of course,\" Caderousse replied. \"Well, I hear you're on good terms with M. Morrel – quite the charmer, aren't you!\" \"M. Morrel has always treated me very well,\" Dantès said. \"Then you shouldn't have turned down his dinner invitation.\" \"What, you refused to dine with him?\" Old Dantès asked in surprise. \"He invited you?\" \"Yes, Father,\" Edmond replied, smiling at his father's shock at this great honor. \"And why would you refuse, son?\" his father asked. \"So I could see you sooner, Father,\" the young man answered. \"I was eager to get home.\" \"But that must have upset M. Morrel, he's a good man,\" Caderousse said. \"And when you're hoping to be captain, it wasn't smart to annoy the owner.\" \"But I told him why I refused,\" Dantès replied, \"and I believe he understood completely.\" \"Yes, but becoming captain sometimes requires a little buttering up of your superiors.\" \"I expect to become captain without needing to flatter anyone,\" Dantès stated. \"Even better! That's great!\" Caderousse exclaimed. \"Nothing would make your old friends happier. And I know someone down near the Saint Nicolas fort who will be especially pleased to hear that.\" \"Mercédès?\" the old man asked. \"Yes, Father,\" Edmond confirmed. \"Now that I've seen you and know you're well and have everything you need, may I have your permission to visit the Catalans?\" \"Go, son,\" Old Dantès said. \"And may God bless you in your wife, just as he has blessed me in my son!\" \"His wife!\" Caderousse interrupted. \"Hold on there, Father Dantès, she's not his wife yet, it seems to me.\" \"No, but she very likely will be soon,\" Edmond responded. \"Yes, yes,\" Caderousse agreed. \"But you were right to get back as fast as you could, my friend.\" \"Why is that?\" \"Because Mercédès is a beautiful young woman, and beautiful women always attract suitors; she has them by the dozen, in fact.\" \"Is that so?\" Edmond replied, smiling, though a hint of worry touched his expression. \"Oh yes,\" Caderousse went on, \"and excellent offers, too. But you know, you'll be captain, and then who could turn you down?\" \"So, you mean,\" Dantès said, his smile poorly hiding his unease, \"that if I *weren't* going to be captain...\" \"Well, well,\" Caderousse said, shaking his head vaguely. \"Now, now,\" the sailor said, \"I have a better opinion of women generally, and of Mercédès specifically. I'm certain that she'll remain faithful to me, whether I'm captain or not.\" \"Good, good!\" Caderousse replied. \"When you're about to get married, unquestioning trust is best. But never mind that; go on, tell her you're back, and share all your hopes and plans with her.\" \"I'll go right now,\" Edmond replied. He hugged his father, nodded to Caderousse, and left the room.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"That's Caderousse, who's heard you're back and is probably here to offer his congratulations,\" someone said. Edmond, a bit skeptical, thought to himself, \"Words can be deceiving, but he's a neighbor who's helped us before, so he's welcome.\" As Edmond spoke, Caderousse, a man in his mid-twenties with a dark beard, appeared at the door, carrying some cloth for his tailoring work. \n\n\"Edmond, is that really you? You're back?\" he greeted Edmond in a strong local accent, showing a big smile. \n\n\"Yes, neighbor Caderousse, as you see. I'm glad to help you however I can,\" Edmond replied, though his politeness hid some coolness. \n\n\"Thanks, but I don’t need anything right now—sometimes it’s the other way around,\" Caderousse said with a wave. \"But I wasn’t talking about you in particular; you repaid what you borrowed, and that’s what good neighbors do—we're even.\" Edmond responded, \"We’re never completely even with those who've helped us; if not money, then we owe gratitude.\" \n\n\"No need to mention that; that's in the past. Let's talk about your good fortune. I was down at the dock, getting some cloth, when I saw Danglars. 'You're in Marseilles?' he asked. 'Yes,' I said. 'I thought you were still in Smyrna.' 'I was, but I'm back now,' I told him. 'And where's Edmond?' 'Probably with his father,' Danglars guessed. So I hurried over to see you.\" \n\n\"Good man Caderousse! He's always been fond of us,\" Edmond’s father added. \"Of course,\" Caderousse replied. \"I respect honest people, which are rare these days. And I hear you’ve come back rich,\" he said, eyeing the coins Edmond had put on the table. Edmond noticed the greedy look and explained, \"This isn't my money. I was just showing my father, who emptied his purse to assure me he hadn’t lacked for anything while I was away. Put the money away, father—unless you need something, Caderousse. If so, it’s yours.\" \n\n\"No, no, I'm fine, thank you,\" Caderousse declined. \"I've got enough, but I appreciate your offer just the same.\" \"The offer was sincere,\" Edmond assured him. \"Of course. And I hear you’re on good terms with M. Morrel,\" Caderousse teased. \"Yes, he's always been very kind to me,\" Edmond answered. \"So why'd you turn down his dinner invitation?\" Caderousse asked. \"You refused?\" Edmond’s father said, astonished. \"Yes, father,\" Edmond smiled. \"Why did you?\" \"Because I wanted to see you sooner; I was eager to see you.\" \"Still, you might have upset M. Morrel, especially as you want to be captain,\" Caderousse pressed. \"I explained my reason; I’m sure he understood,\" Edmond replied. \"Still, you have to flatter your superiors a bit if you want to get promoted,\" Caderousse said. \"I hope to become captain without that,\" Edmond replied. \"That's good—your friends will be happy for you. I know someone in the Saint Nicolas district who'll be glad to hear it,\" Caderousse hinted. \n\n\"Mercédès?\" Edmond's father guessed. \"Yes, and now that I see you in good health and taken care of, may I visit the Catalans?\" Edmond asked. \"Go, my son, and may God bless you, as He’s done for me,\" his father replied. \n\n\"His wife!\" Caderousse exclaimed. \"You're rushing things; she isn't his wife yet.\" \"Not yet, but she will be soon,\" Edmond said. \"Yes, but you were right to hurry back,\" Caderousse said. \"Why?\" \"Because Mercédès is a lovely girl and has many admirers.\" \"Is that so?\" Edmond responded, a little uneasy. \"Oh yes, she gets many offers, but once you’re captain, who would refuse you?\" Caderousse teased. \"So you mean if I wasn't going to be captain…\" Edmond started. Caderousse just shook his head. Edmond replied, \"I have faith in women in general and Mercédès in particular. She's loyal to me, captain or not.\" \"Good for you,\" said Caderousse, \"trust is important when you're getting married. Now go and tell her your news.\" \"I’m going now,\" Edmond said, hugged his father, nodded to Caderousse, and left."

Dantès has no longer any occasion for assistance—he is about to become a captain.”\n“Pooh!” said Danglars, “he is not one yet.”\n“Ma foi! it will be as well if he is not,” answered Caderousse; “for if he should be, there will be really no speaking to him.”\n“If we choose,” replied Danglars, “he will remain what he is; and perhaps become even less than he is.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Nothing—I was speaking to myself.

One of its chiefs, who understood Provençal, begged the commune of Marseilles to give them this bare and barren promontory, where, like the sailors of old, they had run their boats ashore. The request was granted; and three months afterwards, around the twelve or fifteen small vessels which had brought these gypsies of the sea, a small village sprang up. This village, constructed in a singular and picturesque manner, half Moorish, half Spanish, still remains, and is inhabited by descendants of the first comers, who speak the language of their fathers. For three or four centuries they have remained upon this small promontory, on which they had settled like a flight of seabirds, without mixing with the Marseillaise population, intermarrying, and preserving their original customs and the costume of their mother-country as they have preserved its language.",

This enigmatic community had departed from Spain long ago and established themselves on the strip of land they still occupy today. Their exact origin was unknown, and they spoke a language no one else understood. One of their leaders, however, who could speak Provençal, petitioned the authorities of Marseilles to grant them this desolate, unyielding headland, where they had landed their boats, much like ancient sailors. The request was approved. Within three months, a small village rapidly developed around the twelve or fifteen vessels that had carried these 'sea gypsies'. This village, built in a distinctive and visually striking manner, blending Moorish and Spanish architectural styles, still stands and is populated by the descendants of the original settlers, who continue to speak their ancestral language. For three or four centuries, they have remained on this small promontory, having arrived like a flock of seabirds, preserving their unique customs, dress, and language without integrating with the general population of Marseilles, and strictly intermarrying among themselves.",

A young and beautiful girl, with hair as black as jet, her eyes as velvety as the gazelle’s, was leaning with her back against the wainscot, rubbing in her slender delicately moulded fingers a bunch of heath blossoms, the flowers of which she was picking off and strewing on the floor; her arms, bare to the elbow, brown, and modelled after those of the Arlesian Venus, moved with a kind of restless impatience, and she tapped the earth with her arched and supple foot, so as to display the pure and full shape of her well-turned leg, in its red cotton, gray and blue clocked, stocking. At three paces from her, seated in a chair which he balanced on two legs, leaning his elbow on an old worm-eaten table, was a tall young man of twenty, or two-and-twenty, who was looking at her with an air in which vexation and uneasiness were mingled. He questioned her with his eyes, but the firm and steady gaze of the young girl controlled his look.\n“You see, Mercédès,” said the young man, “here is Easter come round again; tell me, is this the moment for a wedding?”\n“I have answered you a hundred times, Fernand, and really you must be very stupid to ask me again.”\n“Well, repeat it,—repeat it, I beg of you, that I may at last believe it! Tell me for the hundredth time that you refuse my love, which had your mother’s sanction. Make me understand once for all that you are trifling with my happiness, that my life or death are nothing to you. Ah, to have dreamed for ten years of being your husband, Mercédès, and to lose that hope, which was the only stay of my existence!”\n“At least it was not I who ever encouraged you in that hope, Fernand,” replied Mercédès; “you cannot reproach me with the slightest coquetry. I have always said to you, ‘I love you as a brother; but do not ask from me more than sisterly affection, for my heart is another’s.’ Is not this true, Fernand?”\n“Yes, that is very true, Mercédès,” replied the young man, “Yes, you have been cruelly frank with me; but do you forget that it is among the Catalans a sacred law to intermarry?”\n“You mistake, Fernand; it is not a law, but merely a custom, and, I pray of you, do not cite this custom in your favor. You are included in the conscription, Fernand, and are only at liberty on sufferance, liable at any moment to be called upon to take up arms. Once a soldier, what would you do with me, a poor orphan, forlorn, without fortune, with nothing but a half-ruined hut and a few ragged nets, the miserable inheritance left by my father to my mother, and by my mother to me? She has been dead a year, and you know, Fernand, I have subsisted almost entirely on public charity. Sometimes you pretend I am useful to you, and that is an excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing, and I accept it, Fernand, because you are the son of my father’s brother, because we were brought up together, and still more because it would give you so much pain if I refuse. But I feel very deeply that this fish which I go and sell, and with the produce of which I buy the flax I spin,—I feel very keenly, Fernand, that this is charity.”\n“And if it were, Mercédès, poor and lone as you are, you suit me as well as the daughter of the first shipowner or the richest banker of Marseilles! What do such as we desire but a good wife and careful housekeeper, and where can I look for these better than in you?”\n“Fernand,” answered Mercédès, shaking her head, “a woman becomes a bad manager, and who shall say she will remain an honest woman, when she loves another man better than her husband?

The house's exterior is sun-baked to a lovely, faded-leaf hue characteristic of local architecture, while inside, it's coated with whitewash, reminiscent of a Spanish guesthouse. A young woman of remarkable beauty, with hair like blackest coal and eyes as soft as a gazelle's, stood leaning against the paneled wall. She was using her slender, gracefully formed fingers to gently rub a cluster of heath blossoms, plucking the flowers and scattering them onto the floor. Her arms, bare to the elbow, were tanned and sculpted, much like the figure of the Arlesian Venus. They moved with a kind of restless energy. She tapped the floor with her flexible, arched foot, drawing attention to the complete and elegant shape of her well-turned leg, encased in its red cotton stocking patterned with gray and blue clocks. Standing a few steps away was a tall young man, aged twenty or perhaps twenty-two. He was seated in a chair balanced precariously on its back legs, leaning his elbow on a worn, old table. He observed her with a look that combined both irritation and concern. He questioned her silently with his eyes, but the young woman's steady and resolute gaze held his look in check. \"Look, Mercédès,\" the young man began, \"Easter has arrived again. Tell me, is this the right time for a wedding?\" \"I've answered you countless times, Fernand,\" Mercédès replied. \"You must be incredibly stubborn to ask again.\" \"Well, please, repeat it,\" he begged, \"so I can finally believe it! Tell me for the hundredth time that you reject my love, which even had your mother's approval. Make me understand, definitively, that you're playing with my happiness, that my life or death means nothing to you. Ah, to have dreamed for ten years of marrying you, Mercédès, only to lose that hope—it was the only thing supporting my existence!\" \"At least I never gave you cause for that hope, Fernand,\" Mercédès responded. \"You can't accuse me of the slightest bit of flirting. I've consistently told you, 'I care for you like a brother; but don't expect anything more than a sister's affection, because my heart belongs to someone else.' Isn't that true, Fernand?\" \"Yes, that is absolutely true, Mercédès,\" the young man admitted. \"Yes, you've been cruelly honest with me. But do you forget that among the Catalans, it's a sacred rule to marry within the community?\" \"You're mistaken, Fernand; it's not a rule, but merely a custom. And please, don't use this custom to your advantage. You're liable for military service, Fernand, only here temporarily and could be called up at any moment. Once you're a soldier, what would you do with me? I'm a poor, solitary orphan, without any resources, possessing only a dilapidated cottage and a few tattered fishing nets – the meager inheritance left by my father to my mother, and then by my mother to me. She passed away a year ago, and you know I've subsisted almost entirely on charity. Sometimes you pretend I'm helping you, using it as an excuse to share your fishing catch with me, and I accept it, Fernand, because you are my father's brother's son, because we grew up together, and even more so because it would pain you deeply if I refused. But I feel it acutely, Fernand, this fish I sell, and the money I get to buy flax for spinning—I feel very strongly, Fernand, that this is charity.\" \"And even if it were, Mercédès,\" Fernand countered, \"poor and isolated as you are, you are just as suitable for me as the daughter of the leading shipowner or the wealthiest banker in Marseilles! What do men like us truly need but a good wife and a careful housekeeper, and where could I possibly find those qualities better than in you?\" \"Fernand,\" Mercédès replied, shaking her head, \"a woman doesn't manage a household well, and who can be sure she'll remain faithful, when she loves another man more than her husband?

If you cannot have me as your wife, accept being my friend and sister; besides,\" she continued, her eyes filling with teary concern, \"be patient, Fernand. You mentioned before how dangerous the sea can be—he has been gone for four months, and in that time, there have been terrible storms.\" Fernand didn’t answer or stop the tears streaming down Mercédès’s face—tears he would give anything to prevent, but which were wept for another man. He got up, paced back and forth in the hut, then stopped abruptly in front of Mercédès, eyes burning and fists clenched. \"Tell me, Mercédès,\" he demanded, \"is this your final decision?\" \"I love Edmond Dantès,\" she replied serenely, \"and no one else will ever be my husband.\" \"And you will always love him?\" \"For the rest of my life.\" Fernand bowed his head in defeat, let out a deep, painful sigh, then looked at her with clenched teeth and flared nostrils. \"But if he is dead—\" \"If he is dead, I will die as well.\" \"And if he has forgotten you—\""

Meanwhile, Edmond and Mercédès embraced each other tightly, bathed in warm sunlight pouring through the doorway.

Suddenly, Edmond noticed Fernand’s somber and threatening face, outlined in the shadow.

Are you really in such a hurry that you have no time to pass the time of day with your friends?”\n“Particularly when they have still a full bottle before them,” added Danglars. Fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air, but did not say a word.\n“He seems besotted,” said Danglars, pushing Caderousse with his knee. “Are we mistaken, and is Dantès triumphant in spite of all we have believed?”\n“Why, we must inquire into that,” was Caderousse’s reply; and turning towards the young man, said, “Well, Catalan, can’t you make up your mind?”\nFernand wiped away the perspiration steaming from his brow, and slowly entered the arbor, whose shade seemed to restore somewhat of calmness to his senses, and whose coolness somewhat of refreshment to his exhausted body.\n“Good-day,” said he. “You called me, didn’t you?” And he fell, rather than sat down, on one of the seats which surrounded the table.\n“I called you because you were running like a madman, and I was afraid you would throw yourself into the sea,” said Caderousse, laughing. “Why, when a man has friends, they are not only to offer him a glass of wine, but, moreover, to prevent his swallowing three or four pints of water unnecessarily!”\nFernand gave a groan, which resembled a sob, and dropped his head into his hands, his elbows leaning on the table.\n“Well, Fernand, I must say,” said Caderousse, beginning the conversation, with that brutality of the common people in which curiosity destroys all diplomacy, “you look uncommonly like a rejected lover;” and he burst into a hoarse laugh.\n“Bah!” said Danglars, “a lad of his make was not born to be unhappy in love. You are laughing at him, Caderousse.”\n“No,” he replied, “only hark how he sighs! Come, come, Fernand,” said Caderousse, “hold up your head, and answer us. It’s not polite not to reply to friends who ask news of your health.”\n“My health is well enough,” said Fernand, clenching his hands without raising his head.\n“Ah, you see, Danglars,” said Caderousse, winking at his friend, “this is how it is; Fernand, whom you see here, is a good and brave Catalan, one of the best fishermen in Marseilles, and he is in love with a very fine girl, named Mercédès; but it appears, unfortunately, that the fine girl is in love with the mate of the Pharaon; and as the Pharaon arrived today—why, you understand!”\n“No; I do not understand,” said Danglars.\n“Poor Fernand has been dismissed,” continued Caderousse.\n“Well, and what then?” said Fernand, lifting up his head, and looking at Caderousse like a man who looks for someone on whom to vent his anger; “Mercédès is not accountable to any person, is she? Is she not free to love whomsoever she will?”\n“Oh, if you take it in that sense,” said Caderousse, “it is another thing. But I thought you were a Catalan, and they told me the Catalans were not men to allow themselves to be supplanted by a rival. It was even told me that Fernand, especially, was terrible in his vengeance.”\nFernand smiled piteously. “A lover is never terrible,” he said.\n“Poor fellow!” remarked Danglars, affecting to pity the young man from the bottom of his heart. “Why, you see, he did not expect to see Dantès return so suddenly—he thought he was dead, perhaps; or perchance faithless! These things always come on us more severely when they come suddenly.”\n“Ah, ma foi, under any circumstances!” said Caderousse, who drank as he spoke, and on whom the fumes of the wine began to take effect,—“under any circumstances Fernand is not the only person put out by the fortunate arrival of Dantès; is he, Danglars?”\n“No, you are right—and I should say that would bring him ill-luck.”\n“Well, never mind,” answered Caderousse, pouring out a glass of wine for Fernand, and filling his own for the eighth or ninth time, while Danglars had merely sipped his. “Never mind—in the meantime he marries Mercédès—the lovely Mercédès—at least he returns to do that.”\nDuring this time Danglars fixed his piercing glance on the young man, on whose heart Caderousse’s words fell like molten lead.\n“And when is the wedding to be?” he asked.\n“Oh, it is not yet fixed!” murmured Fernand.\n“No, but it will be,” said Caderousse, “as surely as Dantès will be captain of the Pharaon—eh, Danglars?”\nDanglars shuddered at this unexpected attack, and turned to Caderousse, whose countenance he scrutinized, to try and detect whether the blow was premeditated; but he read nothing but envy in a countenance already rendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness.\n“Well,” said he, filling the glasses, “let us drink to Captain Edmond Dantès, husband of the beautiful Catalane!”\nCaderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand, and swallowed the contents at a gulp. Fernand dashed his on the ground.\n“Eh, eh, eh!” stammered Caderousse. “What do I see down there by the wall, in the direction of the Catalans? Look, Fernand, your eyes are better than mine. I believe I see double. You know wine is a deceiver; but I should say it was two lovers walking side by side, and hand in hand. Heaven forgive me, they do not know that we can see them, and they are actually embracing!”\nDanglars did not lose one pang that Fernand endured.\n“Do you know them, Fernand?” he said.\n“Yes,” was the reply, in a low voice. “It is Edmond and Mercédès!”\n“Ah, see there, now!” said Caderousse; “and I did not recognize them! Hallo, Dantès! hello, lovely damsel! Come this way, and let us know when the wedding is to be, for Fernand here is so obstinate he will not tell us.”\n“Hold your tongue, will you?” said Danglars, pretending to restrain Caderousse, who, with the tenacity of drunkards, leaned out of the arbor. “Try to stand upright, and let the lovers make love without interruption. See, look at Fernand, and follow his example; he is well-behaved!”\nFernand, probably excited beyond bearing, pricked by Danglars, as the bull is by the bandilleros, was about to rush out; for he had risen from his seat, and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong upon his rival, when Mercédès, smiling and graceful, lifted up her lovely head, and looked at them with her clear and bright eyes. At this Fernand recollected her threat of dying if Edmond died, and dropped again heavily on his seat. Danglars looked at the two men, one after the other, the one brutalized by liquor, the other overwhelmed with love.",

The young man abruptly stopped, glanced around, and spotted Caderousse and Danglars seated at a table under a shaded arbor. “Well,” said Caderousse, “why aren't you joining us? Are you in such a hurry you can't spare a moment for your friends?” “Especially when there's a full bottle still here,” added Danglars. Fernand stared at them, looking utterly bewildered, and remained silent. “He seems completely out of it,” Danglars commented, nudging Caderousse with his knee. “Could we be wrong? Did Dantès succeed despite everything we thought?” “We'll have to get to the bottom of that,” Caderousse replied, then turned back to the young man. “So, Catalan, aren't you going to decide?” Fernand wiped the sweat from his forehead and slowly stepped into the arbor's shade, which seemed to calm his agitated mind and offer some relief to his weary body. “Hello,” he said. “You called me, right?” He then practically fell, rather than sat, onto one of the seats around the table. “I called you because you were running like a madman, and I was afraid you'd throw yourself into the sea,” Caderousse said, laughing. “When a man has friends, they're not just there to offer wine, but also to stop him from unnecessarily drinking gallons of water!” Fernand let out a groan that sounded like a sob, dropping his head into his hands, leaning his elbows on the table. “Honestly, Fernand,” Caderousse began, with the bluntness of common folk whose curiosity overrides politeness, “you look exactly like someone whose love has been rejected.” He let out a rough laugh. “Nonsense!” said Danglars. “A fellow built like him wasn't meant to suffer in love. You're making fun of him, Caderousse.” “No,” he answered, “just listen to him sigh! Come on, Fernand,” Caderousse urged, “lift your head and tell us. It's rude not to answer friends asking about your well-being.” “My health is perfectly fine,” Fernand replied, clenching his fists without raising his head. “Ah, you see, Danglars,” Caderousse said, winking at his companion, “here's the situation: Fernand here is a good, brave Catalan, one of the best fishermen in Marseille, and he's in love with a beautiful young woman named Mercédès. But unfortunately, it seems the beautiful young woman is in love with the first mate of the *Pharaon*. And since the *Pharaon* arrived today—well, you get it!” “No, I don't get it,” said Danglars. “Poor Fernand has been turned down,” Caderousse explained further. “Alright, and what about it?” Fernand said, finally lifting his head and looking at Caderousse as if searching for someone to direct his anger towards. “Mercédès doesn't answer to anyone, does she? Isn't she free to love whoever she wants?” “Oh, if you look at it that way,” Caderousse said, “that changes things. But I thought you were a Catalan, and people told me Catalans aren't the type to let a rival take their place. They even told me Fernand, especially, was terrifying when he sought revenge.” Fernand smiled sadly. “A lover is never terrifying,” he stated. “Poor soul!” remarked Danglars, feigning deep sympathy for the young man. “You see, he didn't expect Dantès to return so suddenly—maybe he thought he was dead, or perhaps unfaithful! These things always hit harder when they happen unexpectedly.” “Ah, indeed, no matter the circumstances!” said Caderousse, who was drinking as he spoke and starting to feel the effects of the wine. “Regardless, Fernand isn't the only one bothered by Dantès's fortunate arrival, is he, Danglars?” “No, you're right—and I'd say it spells trouble for him.” “Well, never mind,” replied Caderousse, pouring a glass for Fernand and refilling his own for the eighth or ninth time, while Danglars had only taken small sips. “Never mind—in the meantime, he'll marry Mercédès—the lovely Mercédès—at least he's back to do that.” All the while, Danglars kept his sharp gaze fixed on the young man, whose heart felt like it was being pierced by Caderousse's words. “And when's the wedding?” he asked. “Oh, it's not decided yet!” Fernand mumbled. “No, but it will be,” said Caderousse, “as surely as Dantès will be captain of the *Pharaon*—right, Danglars?” Danglars flinched at this sudden remark and studied Caderousse's face to see if the jab was intentional, but he saw only the envy in a face already made coarse and foolish by drink. “Well,” he said, filling the glasses, “let's toast to Captain Edmond Dantès, husband of the beautiful Catalan woman!” Caderousse raised his glass unsteadily and gulped down the contents. Fernand smashed his glass on the ground. “Hey, hey, hey!” Caderousse stammered. “What do I see down by the wall, near where the Catalans live? Look, Fernand, your eyes are better than mine. I think I'm seeing double. You know wine plays tricks; but I'd say it's two lovers walking side by side, holding hands. Heaven help me, they don't know we can see them, and they're actually embracing!” Danglars didn't miss a single moment of Fernand's pain. “Do you know them, Fernand?” he asked. “Yes,” came the quiet reply. “It's Edmond and Mercédès!” “Ah, look there!” said Caderousse. “And I didn't even recognize them! Hello, Dantès! Hello, lovely lady! Come over here and tell us when the wedding is, because Fernand here is so stubborn he won't say.” “Be quiet, will you?” said Danglars, pretending to try and control Caderousse, who, with drunken persistence, leaned out of the arbor. “Try to stand up straight and let the lovers have their moment. Look at Fernand and follow his lead; he's being very well-behaved!” Fernand, likely pushed beyond endurance, stung by Danglars's taunts like a bull by a banderilla, was about to charge out; he had risen from his seat and seemed ready to hurl himself at his rival, when Mercédès, smiling and graceful, lifted her beautiful head and looked at them with her clear, bright eyes. At that moment, Fernand remembered her vow to die if Edmond died, and he sank back onto his seat with a heavy sigh. Danglars watched the two men, one after the other—one befuddled by alcohol, the other overwhelmed by heartache.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "A voice called out, “Hey, Catalan! Hey, Fernand! Where are you rushing off to?” Fernand stopped abruptly and looked around, spotting Caderousse sitting at a table with Danglars beneath a shaded arbor. \n\nCaderousse urged, “Why not join us? Are you so pressed for time that you can’t greet your friends?” Danglars added jokingly, “Especially with a full bottle still here!” Fernand gazed at them in confusion but stayed silent. \n\nDanglars nudged Caderousse and wondered aloud if they were wrong in thinking Dantès hadn’t triumphed. Caderousse said they should find out, then turned back to Fernand, pressing him to come over. Wiping sweat from his brow, Fernand slowly entered the arbor, the shade bringing him some relief, and slumped onto a seat. \n\n“You called me?” he asked. Caderousse laughed that he seemed to be running madly and jokingly said friends should not only offer wine but stop each other from jumping into the sea. Fernand groaned, dropping his head into his hands on the table.\n\nCaderousse blurted, with coarse bluntness, that Fernand looked like a jilted lover, and laughed. Danglars waved this aside, saying Fernand wasn’t the type to be unlucky in love, and accused Caderousse of teasing him. Caderousse insisted Fernand seemed to be sighing heavily and pressed him to lift his head and respond. Fernand muttered that his health was fine, hands clenched but head down.\n\nCaderousse winked at Danglars and explained that Fernand, a good Catalan fisherman, was in love with a beautiful girl named Mercédès, who instead loved Dantès, mate of the Pharaon—and since the Pharaon had just arrived, it was clear why Fernand was upset. Danglars claimed not to understand. Caderousse continued that Fernand had been rejected. Fernand, now looking up angrily, insisted Mercédès was free to love whom she chose. Caderousse shrugged, remarking that Catalans were known not to let rivals simply take over, especially someone like Fernand, renowned for vengeance. Fernand responded with a sad smile, that a spurned lover is never fierce.\n\nDanglars, feigning concern, observed that Fernand hadn’t expected Dantès to return; maybe he thought him dead or unfaithful, and such surprises hit hardest. Caderousse, now tipsy, added that Fernand wasn’t the only one unhappy at Dantès’s good fortune. Danglars agreed it might bring bad luck. Caderousse nevertheless poured more wine for Fernand and himself, noting at least that Dantès was back to marry Mercédès. Danglars watched Fernand intently as Caderousse made this remark, seeing how much it pained Fernand.\n\nDanglars asked when the wedding would be. Fernand muttered it wasn’t set. Caderousse confidently asserted it would surely happen, just as Dantès would become captain. The mention startled Danglars, who studied Caderousse’s drunken but envious face to see if it was deliberate. He then raised a toast: “Let’s drink to Captain Edmond Dantès, the beautiful Catalan’s husband!” Caderousse gulped his wine, while Fernand smashed his glass on the ground.\n\nSlurring, Caderousse pointed out two people near the wall, thinking he saw Edmond and Mercédès together. Danglars took pleasure in Fernand’s pain, asking if he recognized them. “Yes, it’s Edmond and Mercédès,” was Fernand’s quiet reply. Caderousse called out, inviting the pair over and teasing Fernand about being secretive. Danglars pretended to restrain Caderousse, telling him to watch Fernand’s good behavior and let the lovers be.\n\nFernand, agitated beyond endurance and prodded by Danglars like a bullfighter taunts a bull, began to rise as if to confront his rival, when Mercédès’ radiant gaze paused him—her presence reminding him of her vow that she’d die if Edmond perished. Fernand sagged back into his seat. Danglars looked back and forth between Caderousse (dulled by drink) and Fernand (crushed by love)."

Yet this Catalan has eyes that glisten like those of the vengeful Spaniards, Sicilians, and Calabrians, and the other has fists big enough to crush an ox at one blow. Unquestionably, Edmond’s star is in the ascendant, and he will marry the splendid girl—he will be captain, too, and laugh at us all, unless”—a sinister smile passed over Danglars’ lips—“unless I take a hand in the affair,” he added.\n“Hallo!” continued Caderousse, half-rising, and with his fist on the table, “hallo, Edmond! do you not see your friends, or are you too proud to speak to them?”\n“No, my dear fellow!” replied Dantès, “I am not proud, but I am happy, and happiness blinds, I think, more than pride.”\n“Ah, very well, that’s an explanation!” said Caderousse. “How do you do, Madame Dantès?”\nMercédès courtesied gravely, and said—“That is not my name, and in my country it bodes ill fortune, they say, to call a young girl by the name of her betrothed before he becomes her husband. So call me Mercédès, if you please.”\n“We must excuse our worthy neighbor, Caderousse,” said Dantès, “he is so easily mistaken.”\n“So, then, the wedding is to take place immediately, M. Dantès,” said Danglars, bowing to the young couple.\n“As soon as possible, M. Danglars; today all preliminaries will be arranged at my father’s, and tomorrow, or next day at latest, the wedding festival here at La Réserve. My friends will be there, I hope; that is to say, you are invited, M. Danglars, and you, Caderousse.”\n“And Fernand,” said Caderousse with a chuckle; “Fernand, too, is invited!”\n“My wife’s brother is my brother,” said Edmond; “and we, Mercédès and I, should be very sorry if he were absent at such a time.”\nFernand opened his mouth to reply, but his voice died on his lips, and he could not utter a word.\n“Today the preliminaries, tomorrow or next day the ceremony! You are in a hurry, captain!”\n“Danglars,” said Edmond, smiling, “I will say to you as Mercédès said just now to Caderousse, ‘Do not give me a title which does not belong to me’; that may bring me bad luck.”\n“Your pardon,” replied Danglars, “I merely said you seemed in a hurry, and we have lots of time; the Pharaon cannot be under weigh again in less than three months.”\n“We are always in a hurry to be happy, M. Danglars; for when we have suffered a long time, we have great difficulty in believing in good fortune. But it is not selfishness alone that makes me thus in haste; I must go to Paris.”\n“Ah, really?—to Paris! and will it be the first time you have ever been there, Dantès?”\n“Yes.”\n“Have you business there?”\n“Not of my own; the last commission of poor Captain Leclere; you know to what I allude, Danglars—it is sacred. Besides, I shall only take the time to go and return.”\n“Yes, yes, I understand,” said Danglars, and then in a low tone, he added, “To Paris, no doubt to deliver the letter which the grand marshal gave him. Ah, this letter gives me an idea—a capital idea! Ah; Dantès, my friend, you are not yet registered number one on board the good ship Pharaon;” then turning towards Edmond, who was walking away, “A pleasant journey,” he cried.\n“Thank you,” said Edmond with a friendly nod, and the two lovers continued on their way, as calm and joyous as if they were the very elect of heaven.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Muttering to himself, Danglars thought, “I'll get nothing useful from these imbeciles. I'm stuck between a drunkard and a coward here. One is an envious man getting drunk on wine when he should be fueling his anger, and the other is a fool watching the woman he loves being taken from him and acting like a crybaby. Yet, the Catalan has eyes that gleam like vengeful Southerners, and the other has fists capable of crushing an ox. Clearly, Edmond is blessed by fortune; he'll marry that beautiful girl, become captain, and mock us all, unless”—a sinister smile crossed Danglars’ face—“unless I interfere,” he added.\n\n“Hey!” Caderousse exclaimed, half-standing and slamming his fist on the table, “Hey, Edmond! Don't you see your friends, or are you too arrogant to speak?”\n\n“No, my dear fellow!” Dantès replied, “I’m not arrogant, just happy, and I believe happiness blinds more than pride.”\n\n“Ah, well, that explains it!” Caderousse said. “How do you do, Mrs. Dantès?”\n\nMercédès curtsied politely and responded, “That is not my name, and in my culture, they say it's bad luck to call a young woman by her fiancé's name before he is her husband. So please call me Mercédès.”\n\n“We must forgive our good friend, Caderousse,” Dantès said, “he’s easily confused.”\n\n“So, the wedding is set to happen soon, Mr. Dantès,” Danglars said, bowing to the couple.\n\n“As soon as possible, Mr. Danglars; today the preparations will be finished at my father's, and tomorrow, or the day after at the latest, the wedding celebration will be here at La Réserve. My friends will be there, I hope; that is, you are invited, Mr. Danglars, and you, Caderousse.”\n\n“And Fernand,” Caderousse added with a chuckle, “Fernand is invited too!”\n\n“My wife’s brother is like my own brother,” Edmond said, “and we, Mercédès and I, would be very disappointed if he wasn't present at such a time.”\n\nFernand opened his mouth to respond, but the words wouldn't come, and he remained silent.\n\n“Today the planning, tomorrow or the next day the ceremony! You’re certainly in a hurry, captain!”\n\n“Danglars,” Edmond said, smiling, “I’ll say to you what Mercédès just told Caderousse, ‘Don’t give me a title that isn’t mine yet’; that could bring bad luck.”\n\n“My apologies,” replied Danglars, “I merely observed you seemed rushed, and we have plenty of time; the *Pharaon* won't be sailing again for at least three months.”\n\n“We are always in a hurry to be happy, Mr. Danglars; after enduring suffering for a long time, it's hard to believe in good fortune. But it’s not just selfishness making me rush; I have to go to Paris.”\n\n“Ah, really? To Paris! Will this be your first visit there, Dantès?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Do you have business there?”\n\n“Not my own; it’s the final duty for poor Captain Leclere; you understand what I mean, Danglars—it’s a sacred task. Besides, I'll only be gone long enough to go and return.”\n\n“Yes, yes, I understand,” Danglars said, then added quietly, “To Paris, no doubt to deliver the letter the grand marshal entrusted to him. Ah, this letter sparks an idea—an excellent idea! Ah, Dantès, my friend, you are not yet officially the first mate aboard the good ship *Pharaon*;” then, turning towards Edmond who was leaving, he called out, “Have a pleasant journey.”\n\n“Thank you,” said Edmond with a friendly nod, and the two lovers continued on their way, appearing as tranquil and joyful as if they were chosen by destiny.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Danglars muttered to himself that he would get nothing worthwhile from these foolish people, and he felt uneasy being in the company of a drunk and a coward. He observed that one was drinking his anger away instead of holding onto it, while the other was acting childishly after losing the woman he loved. He noted, however, that the Catalan's eyes glinted with vengefulness, and the other man's fists were powerful. Still, he believed Edmond was destined for good fortune; Edmond would marry the beautiful Mercédès, become captain, and make a mockery of them all—unless, Danglars thought slyly, he chose to interfere. At that point, Caderousse called out to Edmond, accusing him of ignoring his friends out of pride. Edmond replied that he was just overwhelmed by happiness, making him oblivious, not proud. Caderousse accepted the explanation and greeted Mercédès as \"Madame Dantès.\" Mercédès politely corrected him, saying it was bad luck in her culture to call her by her fiancé's name before marriage. Edmond excused Caderousse for the slip, and Danglars asked if the wedding was imminent. Edmond confirmed that all arrangements would be made that day and the ceremony would follow soon after, inviting Danglars, Caderousse, and Fernand. Edmond added that Fernand, being Mercédès' brother, must be present. Fernand tried to respond but couldn't speak. Danglars commented on how quickly the wedding was happening, and Edmond replied, as Mercédès had done earlier, that it was bad luck to claim a title he didn’t yet have. Danglars apologized, mentioning that they had time because the ship Pharaon wouldn’t be leaving for months. Edmond explained that he was eager for happiness after much suffering and had to go to Paris for Captain Leclere's last commission. Danglars pretended to understand, but secretly suspected Edmond was delivering a letter for the grand marshal and began plotting against him. As Edmond walked away, Danglars wished him a good journey, which Edmond warmly acknowledged. Edmond and Mercédès continued on, happy and peaceful, as if nothing could disturb their joy."

I could drink four more bottles—they’re no bigger than perfume vials. Hey, Père Pamphile, bring more wine!\"\n\nHe banged his glass on the table.\n\n\"You were saying, sir—?\" Fernand said anxiously, waiting for Danglars to finish his interrupted thought.\n\n\"What was I saying? I can’t remember. This drunkard has made me lose my train of thought.\"\n\n\"Call me drunk if you want,\" said Caderousse, \"but it’s worse for those afraid to drink; it’s because they're scared that wine will draw out the bad things in their hearts.\" He then started singing the last two lines of a popular song:\n'Tous les méchants sont buveurs d’eau;\nC’est bien prouvé par le déluge.'"

Danglars asserted that the French possessed a superior ability to invent, unlike the Spanish who merely contemplated. Impatiently, Fernand urged him to invent something. Danglars then requested a pen, ink, and paper from the waiter. Fernand muttered the same request. Danglars explained that as a supercargo, these were essential tools, and he was useless without them. Fernand loudly reiterated the demand for writing materials. The waiter indicated they were on a nearby table. Fernand instructed the waiter to bring them over, which the waiter did.

Caderousse remarked, as he touched the paper, that a pen and ink could be more lethal than weapons, expressing more fear of writing than of blades or guns. Danglars, noticing Caderousse was still coherent, urged Fernand to pour him more wine, which Caderousse eagerly drank. As Caderousse grew more intoxicated, the plotters resumed their discussion.

Proof of this crime will be found on arresting him, for the letter will be found upon him, or at his father’s, or in his cabin on board the Pharaon.”\n“Very good,” resumed Danglars; “now your revenge looks like common sense, for in no way can it revert to yourself, and the matter will thus work its own way; there is nothing to do now but fold the letter as I am doing, and write upon it, ‘To the king’s attorney,’ and that’s all settled.” And Danglars wrote the address as he spoke.",

However, he warned that Dantès would not remain incarcerated permanently and would eventually be released, at which point the individual responsible for his imprisonment would face severe consequences. Fernand reacted by stating he would gladly confront Dantès. Danglars then reminded him of Mercédès, who would despise Fernand if he caused even minor harm to her beloved Edmond. Fernand conceded this point. Danglars continued by proposing a better course of action: drafting an anonymous denunciation. He proceeded to demonstrate, picking up a pen, dipping it in ink, and writing with his left hand in a deliberately altered script unlike his usual style. He then presented the written note to Fernand, who quietly read the contents: 'The king's prosecutor is hereby notified by a loyal supporter of the throne and religion that Edmond Dantès, first mate of the ship Pharaon, who arrived this morning from Smyrna after stops in Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, was entrusted by Murat with a message for the usurper and by the usurper with a message for the Bonapartist group in Paris. Evidence of this crime can be found upon his arrest, as the letter will be located on his person, at his father's residence, or in his cabin aboard the Pharaon.'

Still, Dantès can't stay locked up forever, and one day he'll get out, and when that happens, the person responsible for his imprisonment will be in trouble!\"\n\n\"I'd actually welcome it if he came to challenge me,\" said Fernand.\n\n\"Yes, and Mercédès! She'll hate you even if you so much as lay a finger on her beloved Edmond!\"\n\n\"That's true,\" Fernand replied.\n\n\"No, no,\" Danglars continued, \"if we're going to do this, it's better to take this pen, dip it in ink, and write the accusation with the left hand so it can't be traced back to us.\" As he said this, Danglars did exactly that: he wrote the message in an unfamiliar style with his left hand and handed it to Fernand, who quietly read:\n\n'Honorable King's Attorney, a supporter of the throne and the faith informs you that Edmond Dantès, first mate of the ship Pharaon, arrived today from Smyrna, having stopped at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, and has been trusted by Murat with a letter for the usurper, and by the usurper with another letter for the Bonapartist committee in Paris. Evidence for this crime will be found if you arrest him, as the letter will be with him, or at his father's home, or in his quarters aboard the Pharaon.'\n\n\"Excellent,\" Danglars said. \"Now your revenge is reasonable, and it can't be traced to you. The plan will play out on its own. All that's left is to fold the letter as I'm doing and address it to 'The King's Attorney.' Done.\" And as he spoke, Danglars wrote the address."

Certainly neither I nor Fernand,” said Danglars, rising and looking at the young man, who still remained seated, but whose eye was fixed on the denunciatory sheet of paper flung into the corner.\n“In this case,” replied Caderousse, “let’s have some more wine. I wish to drink to the health of Edmond and the lovely Mercédès.”\n“You have had too much already, drunkard,” said Danglars; “and if you continue, you will be compelled to sleep here, because unable to stand on your legs.”\n“I?” said Caderousse, rising with all the offended dignity of a drunken man, “I can’t keep on my legs? Why, I’ll wager I can go up into the belfry of the Accoules, and without staggering, too!”\n“Done!” said Danglars, “I’ll take your bet; but tomorrow—today it is time to return. Give me your arm, and let us go.”\n“Very well, let us go,” said Caderousse; “but I don’t want your arm at all. Come, Fernand, won’t you return to Marseilles with us?”\n“No,” said Fernand; “I shall return to the Catalans.”\n“You’re wrong. Come with us to Marseilles—come along.”\n“I will not.”\n“What do you mean? you will not? Well, just as you like, my prince; there’s liberty for all the world. Come along, Danglars, and let the young gentleman return to the Catalans if he chooses.”\nDanglars took advantage of Caderousse’s temper at the moment, to take him off towards Marseilles by the Porte Saint-Victor, staggering as he went.\nWhen they had advanced about twenty yards, Danglars looked back and saw Fernand stoop, pick up the crumpled paper, and putting it into his pocket then rush out of the arbor towards Pillon.\n“Well,” said Caderousse, “why, what a lie he told! He said he was going to the Catalans, and he is going to the city. Hallo, Fernand! You are coming, my boy!”\n“Oh, you don’t see straight,” said Danglars; “he’s gone right by the road to the Vieilles Infirmeries.”\n“Well,” said Caderousse, “I should have sworn that he turned to the right—how treacherous wine is!”\n“Come, come,” said Danglars to himself, “now the thing is at work and it will effect its purpose unassisted.”",

Certainly not I, nor Fernand,” replied Danglars, standing up and looking at the young man who remained seated, his eyes fixed on the discarded paper. “In that case,” said Caderousse, “let's have another drink. I want to toast Edmond and the beautiful Mercédès.” “You've had too much already, you drunkard,” Danglars retorted. “If you keep drinking, you'll have to sleep here, unable to stand.” “Me?” Caderousse said, rising with the indignant dignity of a drunken man. “I can't stand? I bet I could climb the Accoules belfry without stumbling!” “Accepted!” Danglars agreed. “I'll take that bet, but tomorrow. It's time to go back now. Lean on me, and let's head off.” “Alright, let's go,” said Caderousse, “but I don't need your help. Come on, Fernand, aren't you coming back to Marseilles with us?” “No,” said Fernand, “I'm going back to the Catalans.” “You're making a mistake. Come to Marseilles with us—come along.” “I won't.” “What do you mean, you won't? Well, suit yourself, my fine fellow; everyone's free to do as they please. Let's go, Danglars, and the young gentleman can go to the Catalans if that's what he wants.” Danglars seized the opportunity of Caderousse's state to guide him, stumbling, towards Marseilles via the Porte Saint-Victor.

He said he was going to the Catalans, but he's going into the city. Hey, Fernand! Are you coming, my friend?” “Oh, you're not seeing clearly,” said Danglars. “He went right along the road towards the Vieilles Infirmeries.” “Hmm,” Caderousse mused, “I could have sworn he turned right.

Certainly not me or Fernand,\" said Danglars, getting up and addressing Fernand, who was still seated and staring at the paper in the corner.\n\n\"If that's so,\" said Caderousse, \"let's have more wine. I want to toast Edmond and lovely Mercédès.\"\n\n\"You've had enough already, drunkard,\" Danglars said. \"If you keep it up, you'll have to sleep here, because you won't be able to stand.\"\n\n\"Me?\" said Caderousse, rising with the wounded pride of a drunk man, \"I can’t stand, you say?

After they'd gone about twenty yards, Danglars glanced back and saw Fernand pick up the crumpled paper, put it in his pocket, and hurry off out of the arbor toward Pillon.\n\n\"Hey,\" said Caderousse, \"he lied! He said he was going to the Catalans, but he's heading to the city. Hey, Fernand! Are you coming with us?\"\n\n\"You can't see straight,\" Danglars replied. \"He's gone down the road to the Vieilles Infirmeries.\"\n\n\"I would have sworn he turned right—the way wine tricks you!\" said Caderousse.\n\n\"Now it's set in motion and will succeed by itself,\" Danglars thought to himself."

And although the entertainment was fixed for twelve o’clock, an hour previous to that time the balcony was filled with impatient and expectant guests, consisting of the favored part of the crew of the Pharaon, and other personal friends of the bridegroom, the whole of whom had arrayed themselves in their choicest costumes, in order to do greater honor to the occasion.\nVarious rumors were afloat to the effect that the owners of the Pharaon had promised to attend the nuptial feast; but all seemed unanimous in doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding condescension could possibly be intended.\nDanglars, however, who now made his appearance, accompanied by Caderousse, effectually confirmed the report, stating that he had recently conversed with M. Morrel, who had himself assured him of his intention to dine at La Réserve.\nIn fact, a moment later M. Morrel appeared and was saluted with an enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the Pharaon, who hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man whose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first in command of the ship; and as Dantès was universally beloved on board his vessel, the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at finding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly coincided with their own.\nWith the entrance of M.

These guests included the preferred members of the Pharaon's crew and other close friends of the groom. Everyone had dressed in their best clothes to show extra respect for the occasion. Various rumors had been circulating that the owners of the Pharaon had promised to attend the wedding feast, but most people seemed to agree in doubting that such an unusually kind gesture would actually happen. However, Danglars, who arrived just then with Caderousse, effectively confirmed the report. He stated that he had recently spoken with M. Morrel, who had personally assured him of his intention to dine at La Réserve. Indeed, M. Morrel appeared moments later and was met with enthusiastic applause from the Pharaon's crew. They saw the shipowner's visit as a clear sign that the man whose wedding he was honoring would soon be given command of the ship. Since Dantès was liked by everyone on board, the sailors freely showed their loud happiness upon realizing that their superiors' opinion and choice matched their own perfectly. After M.

His thin but wiry legs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings, evidently of English manufacture, while from his three-cornered hat depended a long streaming knot of white and blue ribbons. Thus he came along, supporting himself on a curiously carved stick, his aged countenance lit up with happiness, looking for all the world like one of the aged dandies of 1796, parading the newly opened gardens of the Luxembourg and Tuileries.\nBeside him glided Caderousse, whose desire to partake of the good things provided for the wedding party had induced him to become reconciled to the Dantès, father and son, although there still lingered in his mind a faint and unperfect recollection of the events of the preceding night; just as the brain retains on waking in the morning the dim and misty outline of a dream.\nAs Danglars approached the disappointed lover, he cast on him a look of deep meaning, while Fernand, as he slowly paced behind the happy pair, who seemed, in their own unmixed content, to have entirely forgotten that such a being as himself existed, was pale and abstracted; occasionally, however, a deep flush would overspread his countenance, and a nervous contraction distort his features, while, with an agitated and restless gaze, he would glance in the direction of Marseilles, like one who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event.\nDantès himself was simply, but becomingly, clad in the dress peculiar to the merchant service—a costume somewhat between a military and a civil garb; and with his fine countenance, radiant with joy and happiness, a more perfect specimen of manly beauty could scarcely be imagined.\nLovely as the Greek girls of Cyprus or Chios, Mercédès boasted the same bright flashing eyes of jet, and ripe, round, coral lips. She moved with the light, free step of an Arlesienne or an Andalusian. One more practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath a veil, or, at least, have cast down her thickly fringed lashes, so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes; but, on the contrary, the delighted girl looked around her with a smile that seemed to say: “If you are my friends, rejoice with me, for I am very happy.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Danglars and Caderousse quickly went about their task. Before they had gone far, they saw a group coming towards them, consisting of the couple to be married, a group of young women with the bride, and Dantès' father walking beside her. Trailing behind them was Fernand, wearing his usual unpleasant grin. Neither Mercédès nor Edmond noticed the strange look on his face; they were so happy they were only aware of the sunshine and each other's presence. Having finished their errand and exchanged a warm handshake with Edmond, Danglars and Caderousse took their places next to Fernand and the elder Dantès. Old Dantès particularly drew everyone's attention. He was dressed in a shiny, patterned silk suit with polished steel buttons. His thin but muscular legs were covered in expensive, intricately embroidered stockings, clearly made in England, and a long stream of white and blue ribbons hung from his three-cornered hat. He walked supported by a curiously carved stick, his old face beaming with happiness, looking just like one of the old-fashioned gentlemen from 1796 parading in the new gardens of the Luxembourg and Tuileries. Beside him walked Caderousse, who was eager to enjoy the wedding festivities and had therefore reconciled with the Dantès, father and son. However, he still had a faint, unclear memory of the previous night's events, much like how the brain retains a dim and hazy outline of a dream upon waking. As Danglars approached the disappointed Fernand, he gave him a deeply significant look. Fernand, meanwhile, paced slowly behind the joyful couple, who seemed entirely oblivious to his existence in their complete happiness. He was pale and absorbed in thought. Occasionally, a deep blush would spread across his face, and his features would twitch nervously, while his restless eyes would dart towards Marseilles, like someone anticipating or expecting a major event. Dantès himself was dressed simply but appropriately in the uniform specific to the merchant navy, a style between military and civilian attire. With his handsome face radiating joy and happiness, it was hard to imagine a more perfect example of masculine beauty. As beautiful as the Greek girls of Cyprus or Chios, Mercédès had the same bright, sparkling black eyes and full, red lips. She moved with the light, graceful step of a woman from Arles or Andalusia. Someone more familiar with the ways of big cities would have hidden her blushes with a veil or at least lowered her thick eyelashes to hide the bright shine in her lively eyes. Instead, the delighted young woman looked around smiling, as if saying, \"If you are my friends, share my joy, because I am truly happy.\"",

You could see Edmond and Mercédès, lost in their joy, oblivious to Fernand’s expression, so caught up were they in the moment and each other’s company. After finishing their task, Danglars and Caderousse greeted Edmond warmly and then joined Fernand and the elder Dantès, who drew attention from everyone. The old man wore a flashy silk suit with shiny steel buttons and finely decorated stockings, clearly from England, topped with a tricorn hat and flowing white-and-blue ribbons. He walked with the help of an intricately carved cane, his face alight with happiness, resembling a stylish old gentleman from days gone by, strolling through famous Parisian gardens. Caderousse walked beside him, motivated by the prospect of feasting at the wedding, and had managed to patch things up with the Dantès family, though vague memories of last night still lingered in his mind, like the remnants of a dream after waking. As Danglars reached Fernand, he gave him a significant look, while Fernand himself trailed behind the joyful couple, pale and distracted, sometimes blushing deeply or grimacing with evident tension, frequently glancing toward Marseilles as if expecting something momentous to happen. Dantès looked handsome in his simple, yet proper, merchant’s uniform—a blend of military and civilian attire—and radiated happiness, embodying ideal male beauty. Mercédès was strikingly beautiful, with sparkling dark eyes and full red lips; she moved gracefully, like a woman from Arles or Andalusia. Unlike worldly city women, who might hide their emotions, she gazed around with a bright smile as if inviting everyone to join in her happiness."

Morrel descended and came forth to meet it, followed by the soldiers and sailors there assembled, to whom he had repeated the promise already given, that Dantès should be the successor to the late Captain Leclere. Edmond, at the approach of his patron, respectfully placed the arm of his affianced bride within that of M. Morrel, who, forthwith conducting her up the flight of wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the feast was prepared, was gayly followed by the guests, beneath whose heavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of several minutes.\n“Father,” said Mercédès, stopping when she had reached the centre of the table, “sit, I pray you, on my right hand; on my left I will place him who has ever been as a brother to me,” pointing with a soft and gentle smile to Fernand; but her words and look seemed to inflict the direst torture on him, for his lips became ghastly pale, and even beneath the dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen retreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the heart.\nDuring this time, Dantès, at the opposite side of the table, had been occupied in similarly placing his most honored guests. M. Morrel was seated at his right hand, Danglars at his left; while, at a sign from Edmond, the rest of the company ranged themselves as they found it most agreeable.\nThen they began to pass around the dusky, piquant, Arlesian sausages, and lobsters in their dazzling red cuirasses, prawns of large size and brilliant color, the echinus with its prickly outside and dainty morsel within, the clovis, esteemed by the epicures of the South as more than rivalling the exquisite flavor of the oyster, North. All the delicacies, in fact, that are cast up by the wash of waters on the sandy beach, and styled by the grateful fishermen “fruits of the sea.”\n“A pretty silence truly!” said the old father of the bridegroom, as he carried to his lips a glass of wine of the hue and brightness of the topaz, and which had just been placed before Mercédès herself. “Now, would anybody think that this room contained a happy, merry party, who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away?”\n“Ah,” sighed Caderousse, “a man cannot always feel happy because he is about to be married.”\n“The truth is,” replied Dantès, “that I am too happy for noisy mirth; if that is what you meant by your observation, my worthy friend, you are right; joy takes a strange effect at times, it seems to oppress us almost the same as sorrow.”\nDanglars looked towards Fernand, whose excitable nature received and betrayed each fresh impression.\n“Why, what ails you?” asked he of Edmond. “Do you fear any approaching evil? I should say that you were the happiest man alive at this instant.”\n“And that is the very thing that alarms me,” returned Dantès. “Man does not appear to me to be intended to enjoy felicity so unmixed; happiness is like the enchanted palaces we read of in our childhood, where fierce, fiery dragons defend the entrance and approach; and monsters of all shapes and kinds, requiring to be overcome ere victory is ours. I own that I am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which I feel myself unworthy—that of being the husband of Mercédès.”\n“Nay, nay!” cried Caderousse, smiling, “you have not attained that honor yet. Mercédès is not yet your wife. Just assume the tone and manner of a husband, and see how she will remind you that your hour is not yet come!”\nThe bride blushed, while Fernand, restless and uneasy, seemed to start at every fresh sound, and from time to time wiped away the large drops of perspiration that gathered on his brow.\n“Well, never mind that, neighbor Caderousse; it is not worthwhile to contradict me for such a trifle as that. ’Tis true that Mercédès is not actually my wife; but,” added he, drawing out his watch, “in an hour and a half she will be.”\nA general exclamation of surprise ran round the table, with the exception of the elder Dantès, whose laugh displayed the still perfect beauty of his large white teeth. Mercédès looked pleased and gratified, while Fernand grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch.\n“In an hour?” inquired Danglars, turning pale. “How is that, my friend?”\n“Why, thus it is,” replied Dantès. “Thanks to the influence of M. Morrel, to whom, next to my father, I owe every blessing I enjoy, every difficulty has been removed. We have purchased permission to waive the usual delay; and at half-past two o’clock the Mayor of Marseilles will be waiting for us at the city hall. Now, as a quarter-past one has already struck, I do not consider I have asserted too much in saying, that, in another hour and thirty minutes Mercédès will have become Madame Dantès.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Upon arriving at La Réserve, Mr. Morrel dismounted and went forward to welcome the wedding party. He was followed by the soldiers and sailors who had gathered, all of whom had heard his promise that Dantès would take over as captain after the late Captain Leclere. As his employer approached, Edmond politely offered his fiancée's arm to Mr. Morrel, who then led her up the flight of wooden stairs towards the room prepared for the celebratory meal. The guests followed cheerfully behind them, their combined weight causing the rather flimsy structure to groan and creak loudly for several minutes.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As soon as the wedding party arrived within sight of La Réserve, M. Morrel got out and came forward to greet them, accompanied by the assembled soldiers and sailors, all of whom he had told that Dantès would take over as captain after Leclere’s death. When Dantès saw his benefactor, he respectfully placed his fiancée’s arm in M. Morrel’s, who then led her up the wooden steps to the room where the banquet was ready. The guests followed with such enthusiasm that the stairs creaked under their weight for several minutes.\n\nOnce inside, Mercédès stopped at the center of the table. “Father,” she said, “please sit on my right, and I will put on my left the one who has always been like a brother to me,” indicating Fernand with a gentle smile. However, both her words and look deeply pained Fernand, who grew pale and looked as though all the blood had left his face.\n\nMeanwhile, Dantès was arranging seats for his honored guests on the opposite side. M. Morrel sat to his right, with Danglars to his left, and, at a nod from Dantès, the rest of the company settled in wherever they liked.\n\nNext, they began serving the richly flavored Arlesian sausages, bright red lobsters, large colorful prawns, sea urchins with their spiny shells and delicate interiors, and clovises, which the southern gourmets consider tastier than northern oysters. In short, all the seafood harvested from the shore, known to grateful fishermen as the “fruits of the sea.”\n\n“What a strange silence!” remarked Dantès’s father, taking a sip of golden wine just placed before Mercédès. “Would anyone guess this room was filled with happy people who just want to celebrate and dance?”\n\n“Ah,” sighed Caderousse, “a man doesn’t always feel happy, even before his wedding.”\n\nDantès replied, “It’s true I’m so happy that I can’t express it with laughter; joy can feel just as overwhelming as sorrow sometimes.”\n\nDanglars eyed Fernand, who couldn’t hide his feelings. “What’s wrong?” he asked Dantès. “Are you worried something bad might happen? You ought to be the happiest man alive right now.”\n\n“That’s what worries me,” Dantès responded. “It seems unnatural for a man to have such pure happiness; it’s like the magical castles from childhood tales, guarded by fierce dragons and monsters you must defeat to win. I can hardly believe my good fortune to become Mercédès’s husband.”\n\n“Not so fast!” said Caderousse with a laugh. “She isn’t your wife yet. Try acting like a husband and she’ll quickly remind you your time hasn’t come!”\n\nMercédès blushed at that, while Fernand fidgeted restlessly and periodically wiped sweat from his brow.\n\n“Anyway, Caderousse, there’s no need to correct me over something so small,” Dantès replied. “It’s true Mercédès isn’t yet my wife, but”—he checked his watch—“in an hour and a half, she will be.”\n\nEveryone cried out in surprise, except elder Dantès, who laughed heartily. Mercédès looked happy, while Fernand clutched his knife tightly.\n\n“In an hour?” Danglars asked, turning pale. “How’s that possible?”\n\nDantès explained, “Thanks to M. Morrel’s influence, who I thank for all my blessings after my father, we’ve been allowed to skip the usual waiting period; at half-past two, the Mayor will marry us at city hall. Since it’s already a quarter past one, it’s no exaggeration to say that in ninety minutes Mercédès will become Madame Dantès.”"

Arrived here only yesterday morning, and married today at three o’clock! Commend me to a sailor for going the quick way to work!”\n“But,” asked Danglars, in a timid tone, “how did you manage about the other formalities—the contract—the settlement?”\n“The contract,” answered Dantès, laughingly, “it didn’t take long to fix that. Mercédès has no fortune; I have none to settle on her. So, you see, our papers were quickly written out, and certainly do not come very expensive.” This joke elicited a fresh burst of applause.\n“So that what we presumed to be merely the betrothal feast turns out to be the actual wedding dinner!” said Danglars.\n“No, no,” answered Dantès; “don’t imagine I am going to put you off in that shabby manner. Tomorrow morning I start for Paris; four days to go, and the same to return, with one day to discharge the commission entrusted to me, is all the time I shall be absent. I shall be back here by the first of March, and on the second I give my real marriage feast.”\nThis prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests to such a degree, that the elder Dantès, who, at the commencement of the repast, had commented upon the silence that prevailed, now found it difficult, amid the general din of voices, to obtain a moment’s tranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the bride and bridegroom.\nDantès, perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father, responded by a look of grateful pleasure; while Mercédès glanced at the clock and made an expressive gesture to Edmond.\nAround the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at such a time among people sufficiently free from the demands of social position not to feel the trammels of etiquette. Such as at the commencement of the repast had not been able to seat themselves according to their inclination rose unceremoniously, and sought out more agreeable companions. Everybody talked at once, without waiting for a reply and each one seemed to be contented with expressing his or her own thoughts.\nFernand’s paleness appeared to have communicated itself to Danglars. As for Fernand himself, he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the damned; unable to rest, he was among the first to quit the table, and, as though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such deafening sounds, he continued, in utter silence, to pace the farther end of the salon.\nCaderousse approached him just as Danglars, whom Fernand seemed most anxious to avoid, had joined him in a corner of the room.\n“Upon my word,” said Caderousse, from whose mind the friendly treatment of Dantès, united with the effect of the excellent wine he had partaken of, had effaced every feeling of envy or jealousy at Dantès’ good fortune,—“upon my word, Dantès is a downright good fellow, and when I see him sitting there beside his pretty wife that is so soon to be. I cannot help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him that trick you were planning yesterday.”\n“Oh, there was no harm meant,” answered Danglars; “at first I certainly did feel somewhat uneasy as to what Fernand might be tempted to do; but when I saw how completely he had mastered his feelings, even so far as to become one of his rival’s attendants, I knew there was no further cause for apprehension.” Caderousse looked full at Fernand—he was ghastly pale.\n“Certainly,” continued Danglars, “the sacrifice was no trifling one, when the beauty of the bride is concerned. Upon my soul, that future captain of mine is a lucky dog! Gad! I only wish he would let me take his place.”\n“Shall we not set forth?” asked the sweet, silvery voice of Mercédès; “two o’clock has just struck, and you know we are expected in a quarter of an hour.”\n“To be sure!—to be sure!” cried Dantès, eagerly quitting the table; “let us go directly!”\nHis words were re-echoed by the whole party, with vociferous cheers.\nAt this moment Danglars, who had been incessantly observing every change in Fernand’s look and manner, saw him stagger and fall back, with an almost convulsive spasm, against a seat placed near one of the open windows. At the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct sound on the stairs, followed by the measured tread of soldiery, with the clanking of swords and military accoutrements; then came a hum and buzz as of many voices, so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the bridal party, among whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension quelled every disposition to talk, and almost instantaneously the most deathlike stillness prevailed.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Fernand's eyes closed, a searing heat spread across his forehead, and he had to grab the table for support to keep from falling out of his chair. Despite his best efforts, he couldn't stop a deep groan from escaping, though it was lost in the celebratory noise of the others.\n\"Well, now,\" the old man exclaimed, \"you certainly handle things quickly! You arrived just yesterday morning and you're getting married today at three o'clock! Leave it to a sailor to get straight to the point!\"\n\"But,\" Danglars asked cautiously, \"what about the other arrangements—the contract—the settlement?\"\n\"The contract,\" Dantès replied with a laugh, \"that was easy to sort out. Mercédès doesn't have a fortune, and I don't have one to give her. So, you see, our documents were drawn up quickly and certainly didn't cost much.\" This joke sparked another round of applause.\n\"So, what we thought was just the engagement party is actually the wedding reception!\" Danglars remarked.\n\"No, no,\" Dantès corrected; \"don't think I'd treat you so poorly. I'm heading to Paris tomorrow morning. It will take four days to get there and four to return, plus one day to handle the task I've been assigned. That's all the time I'll be away. I'll be back by March first, and on the second, I'll host the real wedding feast.\"\nThis promise of another celebration intensified the guests' merriment to such an extent that the elder Dantès, who had commented on the initial quietness of the meal, now struggled to find a moment of quiet amidst the general uproar to toast the health and prosperity of the bride and groom.\nDantès, seeing his father's loving eagerness, responded with a grateful look. Meanwhile, Mercédès glanced at the clock and made a meaningful gesture to Edmond.\nThe atmosphere around the table was filled with the boisterous cheerfulness typical of such gatherings among people relaxed enough not to be constrained by social formalities. Those who hadn't initially found their preferred seats got up freely and sought out more enjoyable company. Everyone spoke at once, without waiting for replies, seeming content just to express their own thoughts.\nFernand's pallor seemed to have spread to Danglars. As for Fernand himself, he appeared to be suffering immense agony. Restless, he was one of the first to leave the table, and as if trying to escape the deafening, joyful noise, he silently walked back and forth at the far end of the room.\nCaderousse approached him just as Danglars, whom Fernand seemed particularly keen to avoid, joined him in a corner.\n\"Honestly,\" Caderousse said, his earlier envy or jealousy towards Dantès' good fortune having been erased by Dantès' friendly treatment and the excellent wine he'd drunk, \"Honestly, Dantès is a truly good fellow, and seeing him sitting there beside his beautiful future wife, I can't help thinking it would have been a real shame to have pulled that trick on him you were planning yesterday.\"\n\"Oh, it wasn't malicious,\" Danglars replied; \"at first, I was certainly a bit worried about what Fernand might try to do. But when I saw how completely he had control over his feelings, even going so far as to act as one of his rival's groomsmen, I knew there was nothing more to worry about.\" Caderousse looked directly at Fernand—he was deathly pale.\n\"Certainly,\" Danglars continued, \"it was no small sacrifice, considering how beautiful the bride is. Upon my word, my future captain is a lucky man! I only wish I could take his place.\"\n\"Shall we go?\" asked Mercédès' sweet, clear voice; \"It's just struck two o'clock, and you know we're expected in fifteen minutes.\"\n\"Right!—Right!\" Dantès exclaimed, quickly getting up from the table; \"Let's go now!\"\nHis words were met with enthusiastic cheers from the entire group.\nAt this moment, Danglars, who had been constantly watching Fernand's every look and action, saw him stumble and fall back, with an almost convulsive movement, against a chair by an open window. At the same time, his ear caught a faint, unclear sound on the stairs, followed by the rhythmic steps of soldiers, the clatter of swords, and military gear. Then came a murmuring and buzzing of many voices, loud enough to drown out even the noisy celebration of the wedding party. A vague sense of curiosity and fear silenced any inclination to talk among the guests, and almost instantly, a profound stillness fell over the room.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Fernand, feeling overwhelmed, closed his eyes and clung to the table to steady himself, trying unsuccessfully to suppress a groan that was drowned out by the noisy celebrations around him. Meanwhile, an older man commented with amusement on the speed of the wedding arrangements, amazed that Dantès arrived only the day before and was marrying so soon. Danglars, questioning the legalities, asked how they managed the formalities such as the contract and settlements. Dantès, joking that neither he nor Mercédès had fortunes, said the paperwork was quick and inexpensive, making everyone laugh again. Danglars noted that what they thought was just an engagement party turned out to be an actual wedding feast. Dantès, however, clarified that the real celebration would occur after he returned from a brief trip to Paris, promising an even larger gathering. This news made the guests even more cheerful and jubilant, so much so that Dantès’ father, who had earlier commented on the quiet at the start of dinner, now struggled to make himself heard in the din while trying to toast the couple. Edmond Dantès gave his father a grateful look and Mercédès signaled to Edmond that it was nearly time to leave. The mood around the table was lively and casual, with guests freely changing seats and everyone talking animatedly. Fernand’s pale appearance seemed to affect Danglars, and Fernand, appearing tormented, was among the first to leave the table, pacing silently at the far end of the room to escape the clamor. Caderousse approached him, noting that Dantès’ kindness and the fine wine had dispelled his own jealousy, and remarking that it would have been a shame to play the trick they’d considered on Dantès. Danglars replied that there was no real harm intended and, seeing Fernand control his emotions and even help his rival, he felt there was nothing to worry about. Caderousse noticed Fernand looked extremely pale. Danglars continued that it must have been hard for Fernand to give up such a beautiful bride, and he joked that Dantès was lucky and he’d gladly trade places with him. Mercédès then reminded everyone it was time to go, as they were expected soon, and Dantès eagerly agreed, prompting enthusiastic cheers from the guests. Just then, Danglars, watching Fernand closely, saw him collapse against a seat by a window, clearly distressed. Simultaneously, Danglars heard a noise from the stairs, the clatter of soldiers’ equipment, and the growing sound of many voices, which quickly silenced the merriment and filled the room with uneasy silence."

          "text_segment": "The sounds drew nearer. Three blows were struck upon the panel of the door. The company looked at each other in consternation.\n“I demand admittance,” said a loud voice outside the room, “in the name of the law!” As no attempt was made to prevent it, the door was opened, and a magistrate, wearing his official scarf, presented himself, followed by four soldiers and a corporal. Uneasiness now yielded to the most extreme dread on the part of those present.\n“May I venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit?” said M. Morrel, addressing the magistrate, whom he evidently knew; “there is doubtless some mistake easily explained.”\n“If it be so,” replied the magistrate, “rely upon every reparation being made; meanwhile, I am the bearer of an order of arrest, and although I most reluctantly perform the task assigned me, it must, nevertheless, be fulfilled. Who among the persons here assembled answers to the name of Edmond Dantès?”\nEvery eye was turned towards the young man who, spite of the agitation he could not but feel, advanced with dignity, and said, in a firm voice:\n“I am he; what is your pleasure with me?”\n“Edmond Dantès,” replied the magistrate, “I arrest you in the name of the law!”\n“Me!” repeated Edmond, slightly changing color, “and wherefore, I pray?”\n“I cannot inform you, but you will be duly acquainted with the reasons that have rendered such a step necessary at the preliminary examination.”\nM. Morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless. He saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law, and perfectly well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate decked with his official scarf, as to address a petition to some cold marble effigy. Old Dantès, however, sprang forward. There are situations which the heart of a father or a mother cannot be made to understand. He prayed and supplicated in terms so moving, that even the officer was touched, and, although firm in his duty, he kindly said, “My worthy friend, let me beg of you to calm your apprehensions. Your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo, and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required, whether touching the health of his crew, or the value of his freight.”\n“What is the meaning of all this?” inquired Caderousse, frowningly, of Danglars, who had assumed an air of utter surprise.\n“How can I tell you?” replied he; “I am, like yourself, utterly bewildered at all that is going on, and cannot in the least make out what it is about.” Caderousse then looked around for Fernand, but he had disappeared.\nThe scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling clearness. The painful catastrophe he had just witnessed appeared effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication of the evening before had raised between himself and his memory.\n“So, so,” said he, in a hoarse and choking voice, to Danglars, “this, then, I suppose, is a part of the trick you were concerting yesterday? All I can say is, that if it be so, ’tis an ill turn, and well deserves to bring double evil on those who have projected it.”\n“Nonsense,” returned Danglars, “I tell you again I have nothing whatever to do with it; besides, you know very well that I tore the paper to pieces.”\n“No, you did not!” answered Caderousse, “you merely threw it by—I saw it lying in a corner.”\n“Hold your tongue, you fool!—what should you know about it?—why, you were drunk!”\n“Where is Fernand?” inquired Caderousse.\n“How do I know?” replied Danglars; “gone, as every prudent man ought to be, to look after his own affairs, most likely. Never mind where he is, let you and I go and see what is to be done for our poor friends.”\nDuring this conversation, Dantès, after having exchanged a cheerful shake of the hand with all his sympathizing friends, had surrendered himself to the officer sent to arrest him, merely saying, “Make yourselves quite easy, my good fellows, there is some little mistake to clear up, that’s all, depend upon it; and very likely I may not have to go so far as the prison to effect that.”\n“Oh, to be sure!” responded Danglars, who had now approached the group, “nothing more than a mistake, I feel quite certain.”\nDantès descended the staircase, preceded by the magistrate, and followed by the soldiers.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The sounds of approaching footsteps grew louder. Three distinct knocks resounded on the door panel, causing alarm among the assembled group. \"Open in the name of the law!\" a loud voice commanded from outside. Since no one resisted, the door was opened, revealing a magistrate in his official sash, accompanied by a corporal and four soldiers. The initial unease in the room turned into palpable fear. M. Morrel, recognizing the magistrate, cautiously asked, \"Might I ask the reason for this sudden visit? Surely there's a simple misunderstanding.\" The magistrate replied, \"If that's the case, rest assured full amends will be made. However, I carry an arrest warrant. Although I find this duty regrettable, it must be performed. Which of you is named Edmond Dantès?\" All eyes shifted to the young man, who, despite his evident inner turmoil, stepped forward with composure and stated firmly, \"That is I. What do you require of me?\" \"Edmond Dantès,\" the magistrate declared, \"I arrest you under the authority of the law!\" Edmond, his color paling slightly, repeated, \"Me? And why, I beg you?\" The magistrate responded, \"I cannot inform you now. You will be given the reasons necessitating this action during your preliminary examination.\" M. Morrel understood that further argument or protest was futile. He faced an official acting on behalf of the law and knew that appealing for pity from a magistrate in uniform would be as useless as petitioning a cold marble statue. Old Dantès, however, surged forward. A parent's heart sometimes cannot comprehend such events. He pleaded and begged so movingly that even the officer was touched, and though steadfast in his duty, he gently said, \"My good man, please calm your worries. Your son likely overlooked some procedure or detail when registering his cargo. It's quite probable he'll be released as soon as he provides the necessary information regarding his crew's health or the value of his goods.\" Meanwhile, Caderousse, with a furrowed brow, questioned Danglars, who appeared utterly bewildered. \"What's the meaning of all this?\" \"How should I know?\" Danglars replied, \"Like you, I'm completely confused by everything happening and haven't the slightest idea what it's about.\" Caderousse then looked around for Fernand, but he was gone. The events of the previous night flashed back into Caderousse's memory with sharp clarity. The distressing scene he had just witnessed seemed to have lifted the fog that the previous evening's drinking had placed between him and his recollection. \"Well, well,\" he muttered to Danglars in a hoarse, strained voice, \"I suppose this is part of the scheme you were plotting yesterday? If so, it's a cruel deed, and it will surely bring double misfortune upon those who planned it.\" \"Nonsense,\" Danglars retorted, \"I told you I have nothing to do with it. Besides, you know I tore the paper up.\" \"No, you didn't!\" Caderousse contradicted, \"You just threw it away—I saw it lying in a corner.\" \"Be quiet, you idiot! What could you possibly know about it? You were drunk!\" \"Where is Fernand?\" Caderousse asked again. \"How should I know?\" Danglars answered, \"Probably gone to look after his own interests, as any sensible person would. Forget about where he is, let's you and I go see what we can do for our poor friends.\" While this conversation took place, Dantès, after exchanging a cheerful farewell handshake with all his sympathetic friends, yielded to the arresting officer, simply saying, \"Don't worry, everyone, it's just a minor misunderstanding to clear up, that's all, believe me. I probably won't even need to go as far as the prison to resolve it.\" \"Oh, absolutely!\" agreed Danglars, who had now joined the group, \"Nothing more than a mistake, I'm completely sure.\" Dantès then went down the stairs, led by the magistrate and followed by the soldiers.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The noises came closer and then three knocks sounded on the door. The guests exchanged anxious glances. A commanding voice from outside demanded to be let in, speaking in the name of the law. Since nobody objected, the door opened, revealing a magistrate in his official sash, accompanied by four soldiers and a corporal. The group’s unease quickly turned to fear.\n\nM. Morrel, recognizing the official, addressed him politely, suggesting that there must be some explainable mistake for such an unannounced visit. The magistrate assured him that if there was a mistake, it would be corrected, but for the moment, he was there to serve an arrest warrant, a task he was reluctant to do but was required to carry out. He asked which of those present was Edmond Dantès.\n\nAll eyes turned to Dantès, who, despite his understandable distress, stepped forward gracefully and answered with composure, asking what was required of him. The magistrate announced Dantès’s arrest. Dantès, shocked and pale, asked why. The magistrate replied that he could not give the reason just yet, but that it would be explained during the preliminary hearing.\n\nM. Morrel realized that opposition was pointless; the law had to be respected. Old Dantès rushed in, pleading passionately for his son, so much so that the officer was moved. Still, he reassured the old man that Edmond was probably just being detained due to a minor paperwork error regarding cargo registration, and would likely be released soon after clarifying any issues.\n\nMeanwhile, Caderousse suspiciously asked Danglars what was going on. Danglars feigned ignorance, claiming to be just as confused, but Caderousse remembered the events of the previous night and confronted Danglars, suspecting this was part of a scheme. Danglars denied any involvement, asserting he had destroyed the incriminating paper, while Caderousse insisted he had only discarded it, not destroyed it, and accused Danglars of being drunk. Caderousse asked about Fernand’s whereabouts, but Danglars guessed he had left to attend his own business. Danglars suggested they see what could be done for their friend Dantès.\n\nDuring all this, Dantès, assuring his friends that it was surely just a misunderstanding, surrendered to the authorities, optimistic that things would be sorted out without even having to go to prison. Danglars, joining the group, echoed this hope. Dantès then went down the stairs, led by the magistrate and followed by the soldiers."

Morrel; “I will take the first conveyance I find, and hurry to Marseilles, whence I will bring you word how all is going on.”\n“That’s right!” exclaimed a multitude of voices, “go, and return as quickly as you can!”\nThis second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of terrified silence on the part of those who were left behind. The old father and Mercédès remained for some time apart, each absorbed in grief; but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their eyes, and with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each other’s arms.\nMeanwhile Fernand made his appearance, poured out for himself a glass of water with a trembling hand; then hastily swallowing it, went to sit down at the first vacant place, and this was, by mere chance, placed next to the seat on which poor Mercédès had fallen half fainting, when released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old Dantès. Instinctively Fernand drew back his chair.\n“He is the cause of all this misery—I am quite sure of it,” whispered Caderousse, who had never taken his eyes off Fernand, to Danglars.\n“I don’t think so,” answered the other; “he’s too stupid to imagine such a scheme. I only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of whoever wrought it.”\n“You don’t mention those who aided and abetted the deed,” said Caderousse.\n“Surely,” answered Danglars, “one cannot be held responsible for every chance arrow shot into the air.”\n“You can, indeed, when the arrow lights point downward on somebody’s head.”\nMeantime the subject of the arrest was being canvassed in every different form.\n“What think you, Danglars,” said one of the party, turning towards him, “of this event?”\n“Why,” replied he, “I think it just possible Dantès may have been detected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as contraband.”\n“But how could he have done so without your knowledge, Danglars, since you are the ship’s supercargo?”\n“Why, as for that, I could only know what I was told respecting the merchandise with which the vessel was laden. I know she was loaded with cotton, and that she took in her freight at Alexandria from Pastret’s warehouse, and at Smyrna from Pascal’s; that is all I was obliged to know, and I beg I may not be asked for any further particulars.”\n“Now I recollect,” said the afflicted old father; “my poor boy told me yesterday he had got a small case of coffee, and another of tobacco for me!”\n“There, you see,” exclaimed Danglars. “Now the mischief is out; depend upon it the custom-house people went rummaging about the ship in our absence, and discovered poor Dantès’ hidden treasures.”\nMercédès, however, paid no heed to this explanation of her lover’s arrest. Her grief, which she had hitherto tried to restrain, now burst out in a violent fit of hysterical sobbing.\n“Come, come,” said the old man, “be comforted, my poor child; there is still hope!”\n“Hope!” repeated Danglars.\n“Hope!” faintly murmured Fernand, but the word seemed to die away on his pale agitated lips, and a convulsive spasm passed over his countenance.\n“Good news! good news!” shouted forth one of the party stationed in the balcony on the lookout. “Here comes M. Morrel back. No doubt, now, we shall hear that our friend is released!”\nMercédès and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at the door. He was very pale.\n“What news?” exclaimed a general burst of voices.\n“Alas, my friends,” replied M. Morrel, with a mournful shake of his head, “the thing has assumed a more serious aspect than I expected.”\n“Oh, indeed—indeed, sir, he is innocent!” sobbed forth Mercédès.\n“That I believe!” answered M. Morrel; “but still he is charged——”\n“With what?” inquired the elder Dantès.\n“With being an agent of the Bonapartist faction!” Many of our readers may be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in the period at which our story is dated.",

The prisoner heard her cry, which sounded like a broken heart's sob, and leaning from the window of the coach, he called out, \"Goodbye, Mercédès—we will see each other again soon!\" The carriage then vanished around a turn near Fort Saint Nicholas. \"Wait for me here, all of you!\" exclaimed M. Morrel; \"I will take the first transport I find and hurry to Marseilles, from where I will bring you news of how everything is proceeding.\" \"That's right!\" a multitude of voices responded, \"go, and return as quickly as you can!\" This second departure was followed by a prolonged and terrible period of stunned silence among those left behind. The old father and Mercédès remained separate for a while, each consumed by grief; but eventually, the two unfortunate victims of the same shock raised their eyes and, with a simultaneous outpouring of emotion, rushed into each other's arms. Meanwhile, Fernand appeared, poured himself a glass of water with a trembling hand, swallowed it quickly, and sat down in the nearest vacant spot. This seat happened, by chance, to be next to the place where poor Mercédès had collapsed, half-fainting, after being released from old Dantès's warm and loving embrace. Instinctively, Fernand pulled his chair back. \"He is the reason for all this misfortune—I am absolutely sure of it,\" Caderousse whispered to Danglars, never taking his eyes off Fernand. \"I don't think so,\" the other replied; \"he's too simple-minded to devise such a plan. I only hope the trouble falls upon the person who caused it.\" \"You're not mentioning those who assisted and encouraged the act,\" said Caderousse. \"Surely,\" answered Danglars, \"one cannot be held accountable for every random arrow shot into the air.\" \"You certainly can,\" Caderousse retorted, \"when the arrow lands point-first on someone's head.\" In the meantime, the subject of the arrest was being discussed from every angle. \"What do you make of this event, Danglars?\" asked one of the group, turning to him. \"Why,\" he replied, \"I think it's quite possible Dantès was caught with some small item on board the ship considered contraband here.\" \"But how could he have done so without your knowledge, Danglars, since you are the ship's supercargo?\" \"Well, as for that, I could only know what I was informed about the merchandise the vessel carried. I know she was loaded with cotton and took on her freight in Alexandria from Pastret's warehouse, and in Smyrna from Pascal's; that is all I was required to know, and I ask that I not be questioned further.\" \"Now I recall,\" the grieving old father said; \"my poor boy told me yesterday he had a small crate of coffee and another of tobacco for me!\" \"There, you see,\" exclaimed Danglars. \"Now the mystery is solved; depend on it, the customs officials searched the ship in our absence and discovered poor Dantès's hidden treasures.\" Mercédès, however, paid no attention to this explanation for her lover's arrest. Her grief, which she had previously tried to suppress, now erupted in a violent fit of hysterical crying. \"Come, come,\" the old man said, \"find comfort, my poor child; there is still hope!\" \"Hope!\" Danglars repeated dismissively. \"Hope!\" faintly murmured Fernand, but the word seemed to die on his pale, troubled lips, and a convulsive tremor passed over his face. \"Good news! Good news!\" shouted one of the group positioned on the balcony lookout. \"Here comes M. Morrel returning. No doubt, now, we will hear that our friend has been released!\" Mercédès and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at the door. He looked very pale. \"What news?\" a general chorus of voices demanded. \"Alas, my friends,\" replied M. Morrel, shaking his head sorrowfully, \"the situation has taken a more serious turn than I expected.\" \"Oh, indeed—indeed, sir, he is innocent!\" Mercédès sobbed. \"I believe that!\" M. Morrel answered; \"but he is nevertheless charged——\" \"With what?\" inquired the elder Dantès. \"With being an agent of the Bonapartist faction!\" Many of our readers may remember how dangerous such an accusation was during the period in which our story is set.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "A carriage was waiting at the door for Dantès; he entered, accompanied by two soldiers and a magistrate, and the coach departed in the direction of Marseilles. From the balcony, Mercédès called after him, saying her heartfelt goodbyes. Dantès heard her sorrowful cry and, leaning from the carriage, reassured her that they would see each other again soon before the vehicle disappeared out of sight.\n\nM. Morrel instructed those around to wait for him, saying he would travel to Marseilles as quickly as possible to bring back news, which everyone encouraged him to do promptly. After Morrel left, silence and anxiety overcame those who remained. Both the elderly father and Mercédès grieved separately at first, but then, overcome by emotion, they embraced each other for comfort.\n\nFernand then appeared, visibly shaken, as he poured himself water before sitting down next to the seat where Mercédès had collapsed after being comforted by Dantès' father. Fernand instinctively moved his chair away. Caderousse, who had been watching Fernand, whispered his suspicions that Fernand was responsible for the trouble to Danglars, who dismissed the idea and insisted that blame should be reserved for the true perpetrator.\n\nTheir conversation was overheard, and others asked Danglars his opinion on the situation. He suggested that Dantès might have been caught with some minor contraband on the ship. When questioned about this—since Danglars was responsible for the cargo—he claimed he only knew what he had been told about the load, which consisted of cotton and goods taken from certain warehouses, and refused to elaborate further. The elder Dantès then recalled that his son had told him about small cases of coffee and tobacco meant for him, leading Danglars to suggest that customs officials must have found these and this caused the arrest.\n\nHowever, Mercédès was too distraught to consider these explanations, bursting into tears. The old man tried to comfort her by insisting there was still hope, a sentiment echoed weakly by Danglars and Fernand. At that moment, someone announced that M. Morrel was returning, possibly with good news. Mercédès and Dantès' father hurried to greet him, but he was pale and somber. When pressed, Morrel revealed the situation was more serious than he had thought. Mercédès insisted on Dantès' innocence, to which Morrel agreed but explained Dantès was officially charged with being an agent of the Bonapartist party—a dangerous accusation at that time."

Now, should any letters or other documents of a compromising character be found upon him, will it not be taken for granted that all who uphold him are his accomplices?”\nWith the rapid instinct of selfishness, Caderousse readily perceived the solidity of this mode of reasoning; he gazed, doubtfully, wistfully, on Danglars, and then caution supplanted generosity.\n“Suppose we wait a while, and see what comes of it,” said he, casting a bewildered look on his companion.\n“To be sure!” answered Danglars. “Let us wait, by all means. If he be innocent, of course he will be set at liberty; if guilty, why, it is no use involving ourselves in a conspiracy.”\n“Let us go, then. I cannot stay here any longer.”\n“With all my heart!” replied Danglars, pleased to find the other so tractable. “Let us take ourselves out of the way, and leave things for the present to take their course.”\nAfter their departure, Fernand, who had now again become the friend and protector of Mercédès, led the girl to her home, while some friends of Dantès conducted his father, nearly lifeless, to the Allées de Meilhan.",

I intend to tell them everything.\" \"Be quiet, you fool!\" cried Danglars, grabbing his arm, \"or I won't guarantee even your own safety. Who can be sure whether Dantès is innocent or guilty? The ship did stop at Elba, where he disembarked and spent an entire day. Now, if any compromising letters or documents are found on him, won't everyone who supports him be considered his accomplices?\" With the swift instinct of self-interest, Caderousse quickly recognized the strength of this reasoning; he looked uncertainly, longingly at Danglars, and then caution overtook generosity. \"Perhaps we should wait a while and see what happens,\" he said, casting a confused look at his companion. \"Certainly!\" replied Danglars. \"Let's wait by all means. If he's innocent, of course, he'll be released; if guilty, well, there's no need to involve ourselves in a conspiracy.\" \"Let's leave, then. I can't stay here any longer.\" \"Gladly!\" replied Danglars, pleased to find the other so agreeable. \"Let's remove ourselves and let things take their course for now.\" After they left, Fernand, who had resumed his position as Mercédès' friend and protector, led the girl home, while some of Dantès' friends took his nearly lifeless father to the Allées de Meilhan.",

I must confess everything to them.\" Danglars quickly grabbed Caderousse's arm and warned him, \"Keep quiet, you fool! I can't guarantee your own safety if you talk. Who knows if Dantès is truly innocent or guilty? The ship did stop at Elba, he left there, and spent an entire day on the island. If any incriminating letters or documents are found with him, won't people think that everyone supporting him is also involved?\" Driven by a sense of self-preservation, Caderousse recognized the logic of this argument. He looked uncertainly at Danglars, and his concern for his own safety outweighed his initial compassion. \"Maybe we should just wait and see what happens,\" he said, clearly confused. \"Exactly!\" Danglars replied. \"Let's wait and see. If Dantès is innocent, he'll be released. If not, there's no sense in dragging ourselves into trouble.\" \"Let's go. I can't stay here any longer,\" Caderousse insisted. \"With pleasure!\" Danglars agreed, happy that Caderousse was easy to persuade. \"Let's leave things alone for now and let events unfold on their own.\" Once the two of them had gone, Fernand, now acting as a supportive friend to Mercédès once more, escorted her home, while some of Dantès' friends helped his nearly unconscious father back to the Allées de Meilhan."

Morrel, as, on his return to the port for the purpose of gleaning fresh tidings of Dantès, from M. de Villefort, the assistant procureur, he overtook his supercargo and Caderousse. “Could you have believed such a thing possible?”\n“Why, you know I told you,” replied Danglars, “that I considered the circumstance of his having anchored at the Island of Elba as a very suspicious circumstance.”\n“And did you mention these suspicions to any person beside myself?”\n“Certainly not!” returned Danglars. Then added in a low whisper, “You understand that, on account of your uncle, M. Policar Morrel, who served under the other government, and who does not altogether conceal what he thinks on the subject, you are strongly suspected of regretting the abdication of Napoleon. I should have feared to injure both Edmond and yourself, had I divulged my own apprehensions to a soul. I am too well aware that though a subordinate, like myself, is bound to acquaint the shipowner with everything that occurs, there are many things he ought most carefully to conceal from all else.”\n“’Tis well, Danglars—’tis well!” replied M. Morrel. “You are a worthy fellow; and I had already thought of your interests in the event of poor Edmond having become captain of the Pharaon.”\n“Is it possible you were so kind?”\n“Yes, indeed; I had previously inquired of Dantès what was his opinion of you, and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post, for somehow I have perceived a sort of coolness between you.”\n“And what was his reply?”\n“That he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merely referred to without entering into particulars, but that whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ship’s owners would have his preference also.”\n“The hypocrite!” murmured Danglars.\n“Poor Dantès!” said Caderousse. “No one can deny his being a noble-hearted young fellow.”\n“But meanwhile,” continued M. Morrel, “here is the Pharaon without a captain.”\n“Oh,” replied Danglars, “since we cannot leave this port for the next three months, let us hope that ere the expiration of that period Dantès will be set at liberty.”\n“No doubt; but in the meantime?”\n“I am entirely at your service, M. Morrel,” answered Danglars. “You know that I am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced captain in the service; and it will be so far advantageous to you to accept my services, that upon Edmond’s release from prison no further change will be requisite on board the Pharaon than for Dantès and myself each to resume our respective posts.”\n“Thanks, Danglars—that will smooth over all difficulties. I fully authorize you at once to assume the command of the Pharaon, and look carefully to the unloading of her freight. Private misfortunes must never be allowed to interfere with business.”\n“Be easy on that score, M. Morrel; but do you think we shall be permitted to see our poor Edmond?”\n“I will let you know that directly I have seen M. de Villefort, whom I shall endeavor to interest in Edmond’s favor. I am aware he is a furious royalist; but, in spite of that, and of his being king’s attorney, he is a man like ourselves, and I fancy not a bad sort of one.”\n“Perhaps not,” replied Danglars; “but I hear that he is ambitious, and that’s rather against him.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The news of Edmond's detention for supposedly acting on behalf of Bonaparte quickly became known throughout Marseille. M. Morrel returned to the harbor, seeking the latest updates on Dantès from the deputy prosecutor, M. de Villefort. There, he encountered his supercargo, Danglars, and Caderousse. Morrel expressed his astonishment to Danglars, asking if he ever believed such a thing concerning Edmond was conceivable. Danglars responded by reminding Morrel that he had previously stated that Dantès's stop at the Island of Elba struck him as highly questionable. Morrel inquired if he had mentioned these suspicions to anyone other than him. \"Absolutely not!\" Danglars asserted. He then lowered his voice to explain, \"Given your uncle, M. Policar Morrel, who served the former regime and hasn't been shy about his opinions, you yourself are strongly suspected of wishing Napoleon hadn't abdicated. I was afraid of potentially hurting both Edmond and you if I had shared my concerns with anyone else. I am well aware that although someone in my position is obligated to inform the owner of all occurrences, there are many matters that must be strictly kept from others.\" \"Well done, Danglars—well done!\" M. Morrel responded. \"You are a trustworthy man; I had, in fact, already considered your position should poor Edmond take command of the Pharaon.\" \"You were truly so thoughtful?\" Danglars asked. \"Indeed,\" Morrel affirmed. \"I had previously asked Dantès for his assessment of you and if he would have any hesitation in retaining you in your current role, as I had noticed a certain reserve between you two.\" \"And what did he say?\" inquired Danglars. Morrel relayed that Dantès felt he had certainly caused offence to Danglars regarding an issue he mentioned without going into detail, but that anyone who held the shipowners' trust and favorable opinion would also be his preferred choice. \"The schemer!\" Danglars murmured under his breath. \"Poor Dantès!\" said Caderousse. \"One must admit he's a kind-hearted young man.\" \"But in the meantime,\" M. Morrel continued, \"the Pharaon is without a captain.\" \"Ah,\" Danglars replied, \"since we are unable to depart this port for the next three months, let us hope that Dantès will be released before that time is up.\" \"Without a doubt,\" Morrel said, \"but what about the interim?\" \"I am completely at your disposal, M. Morrel,\" Danglars stated. \"You are aware that I am as capable of managing a vessel as the most seasoned captain. Accepting my services will be advantageous because when Edmond is released, the only change needed aboard the Pharaon will be for Dantès and myself to resume our respective positions.\" \"Thank you, Danglars—that simplifies everything. I fully authorize you to take command of the Pharaon immediately and ensure her cargo is carefully unloaded. Personal difficulties must never be allowed to impede business.\" \"Rest assured on that matter, M. Morrel; but do you believe we will be allowed to visit poor Edmond?\" Danglars asked. \"I will inform you of that the moment I have seen M. de Villefort, whom I plan to try and persuade to favor Edmond's case. I know he is a staunch royalist, and despite that and his position as king's prosecutor, he is still a man like us, and I suspect he's not a terrible person.\" \"Perhaps not,\" Danglars conceded, \"but I've heard he is ambitious, and that tends to be a drawback.\"",

Policar Morrel, served under the previous regime and doesn't hide his opinions, people suspect you might wish Napoleon had not abdicated. I didn't want to harm either Edmond or you by voicing my doubts. Even though it’s my duty to inform you, the shipowner, of everything relevant, there are matters best kept quiet from others.\"\n\n\"That’s good, Danglars,\" Morrel said. \"You’re a good man. In fact, I had already considered your interests if Edmond ended up as captain of the Pharaon.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Danglars asked.\n\n\"Yes. I’d actually asked Dantès about you, and if he’d be willing to keep you in your current job, since I had sensed some tension between you two.\"\n\n\"And what did he say?\"\n\n\"He admitted he felt he might have upset you over something, though he didn’t give details. However, he said anyone trusted by the shipowners would have his support too.\"\n\n\"The hypocrite!\" Danglars muttered. \n\n\"Poor Dantès,\" said Caderousse. \"No one can deny he’s a decent, good-hearted young man.\"\n\n\"Meanwhile,\" Morrel continued, \"the Pharaon has no captain.\"\n\n\"Since we’re not due to sail for three months, let’s hope Edmond will be released by then,\" Danglars replied.\n\n\"I hope so, but what do we do in the meantime?\"\n\n\"I’m at your disposal, M.

For now, I command the Pharaon, and if Caderousse keeps silent, I'll likely keep the position. My only worry is that Dantès might be set free.

In this case, however, although the occasion of the entertainment was similar, the company was strikingly dissimilar. Instead of a rude mixture of sailors, soldiers, and those belonging to the humblest grade of life, the present assembly was composed of the very flower of Marseilles society,—magistrates who had resigned their office during the usurper’s reign; officers who had deserted from the imperial army and joined forces with Condé; and younger members of families, brought up to hate and execrate the man whom five years of exile would convert into a martyr, and fifteen of restoration elevate to the rank of a god.\nThe guests were still at table, and the heated and energetic conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then agitated each dweller of the South, where unhappily, for five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the violence of party feeling.\nThe emperor, now king of the petty Island of Elba, after having held sovereign sway over one-half of the world, counting as his subjects a small population of five or six thousand souls,—after having been accustomed to hear the “Vive Napoléons” of a hundred and twenty millions of human beings, uttered in ten different languages,—was looked upon here as a ruined man, separated forever from any fresh connection with France or claim to her throne.\nThe magistrates freely discussed their political views; the military part of the company talked unreservedly of Moscow and Leipsic, while the women commented on the divorce of Josephine. It was not over the downfall of the man, but over the defeat of the Napoleonic idea, that they rejoiced, and in this they foresaw for themselves the bright and cheering prospect of a revivified political existence.\nAn old man, decorated with the cross of Saint Louis, now rose and proposed the health of King Louis XVIII. It was the Marquis de Saint-Méran. This toast, recalling at once the patient exile of Hartwell and the peace-loving King of France, excited universal enthusiasm; glasses were elevated in the air à l’Anglaise, and the ladies, snatching their bouquets from their fair bosoms, strewed the table with their floral treasures. In a word, an almost poetical fervor prevailed.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "In a magnificent, aristocratic house designed by Puget, located on the Rue du Grand Cours across from the Medusa fountain, a second wedding celebration was taking place around the same time as Dantès's wedding feast. However, while the reason for the gathering was the same, the people present were remarkably different. Instead of a rough assembly of sailors, soldiers, and individuals from the lowest social classes, this group comprised the most distinguished members of Marseilles society. These included magistrates who had resigned during the usurper's reign, officers who had deserted the imperial army to join Condé, and younger generations of families raised to hate and condemn the man whom five years in exile would make a martyr and fifteen years of restoration would elevate to the status of a deity. The guests were still seated at the table, and the intense and lively conversation revealed the strong and bitter feelings that stirred every resident of the South at that time, where sadly, for five centuries, religious conflict had made political animosity even more intense. The emperor, now merely the king of the small island of Elba, after having governed half the world and commanded a population of 120 million people who cried 'Vive Napoléon' in ten different languages, was viewed here as a fallen man, permanently disconnected from France and any claim to its throne. On Elba, his subjects numbered only about five or six thousand souls. The magistrates openly discussed their political beliefs, the military guests spoke frankly of campaigns like Moscow and Leipsic, and the women commented on Josephine's divorce. Their rejoicing was not just over the man's downfall but over the defeat of the Napoleonic ideology, which they saw as a sign of a promising and positive future involving a renewed political life for themselves. An elderly man, bearing the cross of Saint Louis, stood up and proposed a toast to King Louis XVIII. This was the Marquis de Saint-Méran. This toast, recalling both the king's patient time in exile at Hartwell and his peaceful reign in France, was met with universal enthusiasm. Glasses were raised in the English style, and the ladies took the bouquets from their bosoms and scattered the flowers onto the table. In essence, an atmosphere of almost poetic fervor prevailed.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Across from the Medusa fountain, in one of Puget’s elegant mansions on the Rue du Grand Cours, a second wedding banquet was underway at nearly the same time as Dantès’s own celebration. While both events marked marriages, the gatherings were markedly different. Instead of the rough company of sailors, soldiers, and ordinary folk present at Dantès’s feast, this event hosted the elite of Marseilles: former magistrates who had left office during Napoleon’s reign, military officers who had defected to support Condé, and younger aristocrats raised to despise the man who exile would make a martyr and whose restoration would elevate him to near divinity. The guests were still eating, and their passionate, animated conversations reflected the deep and vengeful feelings then prevailing in the South, a region where centuries of religious conflict had aggravated party animosities. Here, the former emperor—now ruler of the tiny Isle of Elba after commanding half the world—was regarded as finished, with no hope of reclaiming France or her throne. The magistrates openly debated politics; the officers reminisced about Moscow and Leipzig; the women discussed Josephine’s divorce. They celebrated not Napoleon’s downfall as a person, but the defeat of his ideals, seeing in this a hopeful future for themselves politically. Then, an elderly man wearing the cross of Saint Louis, the Marquis de Saint-Méran, stood to toast King Louis XVIII—a gesture evoking memories of Louis’s exile and peaceful nature, which sparked unanimous excitement. Glasses were raised in English fashion; the women scattered flowers over the table, removing them from their own bouquets, creating a scene of nearly poetic enthusiasm."

I really must pray you to excuse me, but—in truth—I was not attending to the conversation.”\n“Marquise, marquise!” interposed the old nobleman who had proposed the toast, “let the young people alone; let me tell you, on one’s wedding day there are more agreeable subjects of conversation than dry politics.”\n“Never mind, dearest mother,” said a young and lovely girl, with a profusion of light brown hair, and eyes that seemed to float in liquid crystal, “’tis all my fault for seizing upon M. de Villefort, so as to prevent his listening to what you said. But there—now take him—he is your own for as long as you like. M. Villefort, I beg to remind you my mother speaks to you.”\n“If the marquise will deign to repeat the words I but imperfectly caught, I shall be delighted to answer,” said M. de Villefort.\n“Never mind, Renée,” replied the marquise, with a look of tenderness that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features; but, however all other feelings may be withered in a woman’s nature, there is always one bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart, and that is the shrine of maternal love. “I forgive you. What I was saying, Villefort, was, that the Bonapartists had not our sincerity, enthusiasm, or devotion.”\n“They had, however, what supplied the place of those fine qualities,” replied the young man, “and that was fanaticism. Napoleon is the Mahomet of the West, and is worshipped by his commonplace but ambitious followers, not only as a leader and lawgiver, but also as the personification of equality.”\n“He!” cried the marquise: “Napoleon the type of equality! For mercy’s sake, then, what would you call Robespierre? Come, come, do not strip the latter of his just rights to bestow them on the Corsican, who, to my mind, has usurped quite enough.”\n“Nay, madame; I would place each of these heroes on his right pedestal—that of Robespierre on his scaffold in the Place Louis Quinze; that of Napoleon on the column of the Place Vendôme. The only difference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated by these two men; one is the equality that elevates, the other is the equality that degrades; one brings a king within reach of the guillotine, the other elevates the people to a level with the throne. Observe,” said Villefort, smiling, “I do not mean to deny that both these men were revolutionary scoundrels, and that the 9th Thermidor and the 4th of April, in the year 1814, were lucky days for France, worthy of being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil order; and that explains how it comes to pass that, fallen, as I trust he is forever, Napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical satellites. Still, marquise, it has been so with other usurpers—Cromwell, for instance, who was not half so bad as Napoleon, had his partisans and advocates.”\n“Do you know, Villefort, that you are talking in a most dreadfully revolutionary strain? But I excuse it, it is impossible to expect the son of a Girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven.” A deep crimson suffused the countenance of Villefort.\n“’Tis true, madame,” answered he, “that my father was a Girondin, but he was not among the number of those who voted for the king’s death; he was an equal sufferer with yourself during the Reign of Terror, and had well-nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father perished.”\n“True,” replied the marquise, without wincing in the slightest degree at the tragic remembrance thus called up; “but bear in mind, if you please, that our respective parents underwent persecution and proscription from diametrically opposite principles; in proof of which I may remark, that while my family remained among the staunchest adherents of the exiled princes, your father lost no time in joining the new government; and that while the Citizen Noirtier was a Girondin, the Count Noirtier became a senator.”\n“Dear mother,” interposed Renée, “you know very well it was agreed that all these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside.”\n“Suffer me, also, madame,” replied Villefort, “to add my earnest request to Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran’s, that you will kindly allow the veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past. What avails recrimination over matters wholly past recall? For my own part, I have laid aside even the name of my father, and altogether disown his political principles.

          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The Marquise de Saint-Méran, a stern but still noble-looking woman of fifty, remarked bitterly that the revolutionaries who had ousted them from their property and bought it cheaply during the Reign of Terror would have to admit that true loyalty belonged to the Royalists, who followed their king even in misfortune, unlike the revolutionaries who profited from the 'rising sun' of the new regime. She asserted that the king they sacrificed for was their 'well-beloved Louis,' while their 'wretched usurper' Napoleon was their 'accursed Napoleon.' She asked Villefort if he agreed. Villefort apologized, admitting he hadn't been paying attention. An older nobleman interrupted, suggesting they spare the young people from dry politics on a wedding day. Renée, a beautiful young woman with light brown hair, took the blame for distracting Villefort and playfully offered him back to her mother, reminding him the Marquise was speaking to him. Villefort politely offered to answer if the Marquise would repeat her words. The Marquise, with a rare display of tenderness for Renée, forgave her and repeated her point: the Bonapartists lacked the sincerity, enthusiasm, or devotion of the Royalists. Villefort countered that Bonapartists possessed 'fanaticism,' viewing Napoleon as a Western 'Mahomet' idolized by his followers as a leader, lawgiver, and symbol of equality. The Marquise exclaimed in disbelief, asking how Napoleon could represent equality if Robespierre existed, accusing Napoleon of having already usurped enough credit. Villefort clarified that he'd place them both on their 'right pedestals' – Robespierre on his scaffold and Napoleon on his column – distinguishing their forms of equality: Robespierre's degraded by bringing a king to the guillotine, Napoleon's elevated by raising the people to the throne's level. He added, smiling, that both were 'revolutionary scoundrels' and their downfalls were beneficial for France and monarchy, explaining Napoleon's remaining followers, much like Cromwell had partisans. The Marquise accused Villefort of revolutionary talk, blaming it on his Girondin father. Villefort blushed deeply but affirmed his father was a Girondin who didn't vote for the king's death and suffered during the Terror like her family. He highlighted their differing principles: his family supported the new government while hers remained loyal to the exiles, noting his father went from 'Citizen Noirtier' to 'Count Noirtier' and senator. Renée intervened again, reminding them they agreed to avoid such unpleasant memories. Villefort strongly seconded Renée's plea, urging them to let the past be forgotten. He stated he had abandoned his father's name and political views; his father was likely still a Bonapartist 'Noirtier,' but he was a staunch Royalist 'de Villefort.' He asked them to see him as a new shoot grown away from the old revolutionary root, with no desire to reconnect.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"Oh,\" said the Marquise de Saint-Méran—a woman of imposing and stern presence, despite her age—\"these revolutionaries who forced us to abandon our properties, only to buy them at next to nothing during the Reign of Terror, would be forced to admit, if they were present, that true loyalty was ours. We chose to stand by a doomed king, while they sought to profit by aligning themselves with rising powers. Yes, they must acknowledge that for us the king, to whom we gave up our titles, wealth, and status, was our beloved Louis, while their leader has been, and always will be, their misfortune—their ‘Napoleon the accursed.’ Wouldn’t you agree, Villefort?\"\n\n\"I apologize, madame. I must beg your pardon—I wasn’t following the conversation,\" Villefort replied.\n\n\"Marquise, marquise!\" interrupted an elderly nobleman who had earlier proposed a toast. \"Let the young people enjoy themselves; there are sweeter subjects to discuss on a wedding day than dry politics.\"\n\nA beautiful young girl with abundant light brown hair and crystalline eyes added, \"Never mind, dear mother, it’s my fault for occupying M. de Villefort’s attention. Here, I return him to you as long as you please. M. Villefort, just a reminder—my mother is speaking to you.\"\n\n\"If the marquise would kindly repeat her words, which I only partly heard, I’d be happy to respond,\" Villefort said.\n\n\"Never mind, Renée,\" the marquise replied with an unusual gentleness, betraying her motherly affection despite her strict appearance. \"I forgive you. I was saying, Villefort, that the Bonapartists lacked the sincerity, passion, or loyalty we had.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, but what they had in place of those virtues was fanaticism,\" Villefort countered. \"Napoleon is the West’s Mahomet—his followers adore him as a leader and symbol of equality.\"\n\n\"He!\" exclaimed the marquise. \"Napoleon a symbol of equality? What then would you say of Robespierre? Don’t deprive Robespierre of his due to honor the Corsican, who has already seized enough titles.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, madame, I’d place each on their proper platform: Robespierre to his scaffold in the Place Louis Quinze; Napoleon to the column in Place Vendôme. The distinction lies in the type of equality each championed: one brings down the king to the guillotine, the other elevates the people to the throne’s level. But don’t mistake me—both were dangerous revolutionaries, and dates like the 9th Thermidor and 4th of April, 1814, should be celebrated by all who value monarchy and order. That’s why, even in exile, Napoleon maintains his band of loyal followers. Such is the fate of usurpers—look at Cromwell, who was not as bad as Napoleon, yet still had supporters.\"\n\n\"Villefort, you sound dreadfully revolutionary,\" said the marquise. \"But it’s understandable—how can the son of a Girondin not retain a touch of old politics?\" Villefort flushed deeply.\n\n\"It’s true, madame, my father was a Girondin, but he did not vote for the king’s execution. He suffered as you did during the Reign of Terror, almost losing his own life on the same scaffold where your father died.\"\n\n\"True,\" the marquise agreed, her composure unshaken. \"But keep in mind our families were persecuted for utterly different reasons. For example, while my family always supported the exiled princes, your father quickly joined the new government; Citizen Noirtier was Girondin, Count Noirtier became a senator.\"\n\n\"Mother,\" Renée interjected, \"we agreed to let go of these old resentments.\"\n\n\"Allow me to add my support to Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran’s request,\" Villefort said. \"Let’s let the past rest, since it cannot be changed. I have even abandoned my father’s name and principles. He was—and might be still—a Bonapartist known as Noirtier, while I am a loyal royalist who calls himself de Villefort. Let whatever remains of the revolution fade away with the old, and regard only the new branch that has grown, separate in its spirit from the familial root, but unable or unwilling to entirely break away from it.\""

Remember, also, Villefort, that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your fealty and strict loyalty, and that at our recommendation the king consented to forget the past, as I do” (and here she extended to him her hand)—“as I now do at your entreaty. But bear in mind, that should there fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the government, you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence with rigorous punishment, as it is known you belong to a suspected family.”\n“Alas, madame,” returned Villefort, “my profession, as well as the times in which we live, compels me to be severe. I have already successfully conducted several public prosecutions, and brought the offenders to merited punishment. But we have not done with the thing yet.”\n“Do you, indeed, think so?” inquired the marquise.\n“I am, at least, fearful of it. Napoleon, in the Island of Elba, is too near France, and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans. Marseilles is filled with half-pay officers, who are daily, under one frivolous pretext or other, getting up quarrels with the royalists; from hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of persons, and assassinations in the lower.”\n“You have heard, perhaps,” said the Comte de Salvieux, one of M. de Saint-Méran’s oldest friends, and chamberlain to the Comte d’Artois, “that the Holy Alliance purpose removing him from thence?”\n“Yes; they were talking about it when we left Paris,” said M. de Saint-Méran; “and where is it decided to transfer him?”\n“To Saint Helena.”\n“For heaven’s sake, where is that?” asked the marquise.\n“An island situated on the other side of the equator, at least two thousand leagues from here,” replied the count.\n“So much the better. As Villefort observes, it is a great act of folly to have left such a man between Corsica, where he was born, and Naples, of which his brother-in-law is king, and face to face with Italy, the sovereignty of which he coveted for his son.”\n“Unfortunately,” said Villefort, “there are the treaties of 1814, and we cannot molest Napoleon without breaking those compacts.”\n“Oh, well, we shall find some way out of it,” responded M. de Salvieux. “There wasn’t any trouble over treaties when it was a question of shooting the poor Duc d’Enghien.”\n“Well,” said the marquise, “it seems probable that, by the aid of the Holy Alliance, we shall be rid of Napoleon; and we must trust to the vigilance of M. de Villefort to purify Marseilles of his partisans.

Now I have hope of finally getting my wife to agree to something I’ve wanted for years: a complete pardon and forgetting of the past.” “With all my heart,” replied the marquise. “Let the past truly be forgotten forever. I assure you, I find it as unpleasant to revisit as you do. My only condition is that Villefort remains steadfast and unwavering in his political beliefs from now on. And remember, Villefort, we guaranteed your loyalty and strict faithfulness to His Majesty, and it was based on our recommendation that the king chose to forget the past, just as I am doing now” (offering him her hand). “I am doing so now at your request. But keep in mind that if anyone involved in a conspiracy against the government comes before you, you will be even more obligated to punish the offense severely, precisely because it is known that you come from a family that was viewed with suspicion.” “Alas, madame,” Villefort responded, “both my profession and the current times require me to be strict. I have already successfully handled several public cases and ensured the guilty received their just punishment. However, we are not out of danger yet.” “Do you truly believe that?” the marquise asked. “I am at least concerned about it. Napoleon, being on the Island of Elba, is too close to France, and his proximity sustains the hopes of his supporters. Marseilles is full of officers on half-pay who constantly pick fights with royalists under flimsy pretexts, leading to regular and deadly duels among the upper classes and murders among the lower.” “Perhaps you have heard,” said the Comte de Salvieux, one of M. de Saint-Méran’s oldest friends and chamberlain to the Comte d’Artois, “that the Holy Alliance intends to relocate him from there?” “Yes, they were discussing it when we left Paris,” said M. de Saint-Méran. “Where have they decided to send him?” “To Saint Helena.” “For heaven’s sake, where is that?” asked the marquise. “An island south of the equator, at least two thousand leagues from here,” replied the count. “Even better. As Villefort said, it was extremely foolish to leave such a man between Corsica, his birthplace, and Naples, ruled by his brother-in-law, and facing Italy, a territory he desired sovereignty over for his son.” “Unfortunately,” said Villefort, “the treaties of 1814 exist, and we cannot interfere with Napoleon without violating those agreements.” “Oh, well, we’ll figure something out,” M. de Salvieux countered. “Treaties weren’t an issue when it came to executing the poor Duc d’Enghien.” “Very well,” said the marquise, “it appears likely that, with the help of the Holy Alliance, we will be rid of Napoleon.

          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"Well done, Villefort!\" exclaimed the marquis. \"That was excellently put! Now, perhaps at last I can achieve what I have long tried to get your aunt to agree to—a complete forgiveness and forgetting of what has happened before.\"\n\n\"With pleasure,\" the marquise replied. \"Let us put the past behind us once and for all. Honestly, revisiting it doesn't bring me any more joy than it does you. All I ask is that Villefort always remain steadfast and unwavering in his political beliefs from now on. Don't forget, Villefort, that we've both vouched for your loyalty to His Majesty, and on our word, the king agreed to overlook the past, as I do now\"—she reached out her hand to him—\"I promise, at your request, to do so. But remember: if anyone conspiring against the government crosses your path, you'll be especially obliged to punish them sharply, since your background is already suspect.\"\n\n\"Alas, madam,\" Villefort answered, \"my career, and the times we live in, force me to be strict. I have already led several prosecutions against offenders and ensured they received their due punishment. But the issue is not yet resolved.\"\n\n\"You believe so?\" the marquise asked.\n\n\"I am afraid so. Napoleon is too close in Elba; his presence keeps his supporters in France hopeful. In Marseilles, ex-military officers on half-pay are constantly stirring up trouble with royalists for the smallest reasons. This leads to frequent and tragic duels among the gentry, and to murders among commoners.\"\n\n\"You may have heard,\" said the Comte de Salvieux, long-time friend of Saint-Méran and chamberlain to the Comte d’Artois, \"that the Holy Alliance intends to move Napoleon?\"\n\n\"Yes, we heard about it as we left Paris,\" replied Saint-Méran. \"But where will they send him?\"\n\n\"To Saint Helena.\"\n\n\"Where is that?\" asked the marquise.\n\n\"It's an island far beyond the equator, at least two thousand leagues away,\" the count explained.\n\n\"All the better! As Villefort pointed out, it's foolish to have left such a man between Corsica—his birthplace—and Naples, which his brother-in-law rules, as well as right next to Italy, the kingdom he wanted for his son.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" Villefort added, \"the 1814 treaties prevent us from acting against Napoleon without breaking our agreements.\"\n\n\"Oh, they'll find a way,\" said Salvieux. \"No treaties stopped anyone from executing the unfortunate Duc d’Enghien.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the marquise, \"it seems that, with the help of the Holy Alliance, we'll soon be free of Napoleon. Meanwhile, we must rely on Villefort's vigilance to rid Marseilles of his followers. The king is either the king or he isn't. If he’s to be accepted as France’s ruler, he should be supported in peace and order. The best way to do this is to empower the strictest officials to suppress any hint of conspiracy; that’s the surest way to keep the peace.\""

I never was in a law-court; I am told it is so very amusing!”\n“Amusing, certainly,” replied the young man, “inasmuch as, instead of shedding tears as at the fictitious tale of woe produced at a theatre, you behold in a law-court a case of real and genuine distress—a drama of life. The prisoner whom you there see pale, agitated, and alarmed, instead of—as is the case when a curtain falls on a tragedy—going home to sup peacefully with his family, and then retiring to rest, that he may recommence his mimic woes on the morrow,—is removed from your sight merely to be reconducted to his prison and delivered up to the executioner. I leave you to judge how far your nerves are calculated to bear you through such a scene. Of this, however, be assured, that should any favorable opportunity present itself, I will not fail to offer you the choice of being present.”\n“For shame, M. de Villefort!” said Renée, becoming quite pale; “don’t you see how you are frightening us?—and yet you laugh.”\n“What would you have? ’Tis like a duel. I have already recorded sentence of death, five or six times, against the movers of political conspiracies, and who can say how many daggers may be ready sharpened, and only waiting a favorable opportunity to be buried in my heart?”\n“Gracious heavens, M. de Villefort,” said Renée, becoming more and more terrified; “you surely are not in earnest.”\n“Indeed I am,” replied the young magistrate with a smile; “and in the interesting trial that young lady is anxious to witness, the case would only be still more aggravated. Suppose, for instance, the prisoner, as is more than probable, to have served under Napoleon—well, can you expect for an instant, that one accustomed, at the word of his commander, to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe, will scruple more to drive a stiletto into the heart of one he knows to be his personal enemy, than to slaughter his fellow-creatures, merely because bidden to do so by one he is bound to obey? Besides, one requires the excitement of being hateful in the eyes of the accused, in order to lash one’s self into a state of sufficient vehemence and power. I would not choose to see the man against whom I pleaded smile, as though in mockery of my words. No; my pride is to see the accused pale, agitated, and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire of my eloquence.” Renée uttered a smothered exclamation.\n“Bravo!” cried one of the guests; “that is what I call talking to some purpose.”\n“Just the person we require at a time like the present,” said a second.\n“What a splendid business that last case of yours was, my dear Villefort!” remarked a third; “I mean the trial of the man for murdering his father. Upon my word, you killed him ere the executioner had laid his hand upon him.”\n“Oh, as for parricides, and such dreadful people as that,” interposed Renée, “it matters very little what is done to them; but as regards poor unfortunate creatures whose only crime consists in having mixed themselves up in political intrigues——”\n“Why, that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit; for, don’t you see, Renée, the king is the father of his people, and he who shall plot or contrive aught against the life and safety of the parent of thirty-two millions of souls, is a parricide upon a fearfully great scale?”\n“I don’t know anything about that,” replied Renée; “but, M. de Villefort, you have promised me—have you not?—always to show mercy to those I plead for.”\n“Make yourself quite easy on that point,” answered Villefort, with one of his sweetest smiles; “you and I will always consult upon our verdicts.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“Regrettably, madame,” Villefort replied, “the strong hand of the law doesn't intervene until the wrong has already occurred.” “Then all it can do is try to mend it.” “Indeed, madame, the law is often incapable of doing so; its sole power lies in avenging the harm done.” “Oh, M. de Villefort,” exclaimed a lovely young lady, daughter of the Comte de Salvieux and a close friend of Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran, “do try to arrange a captivating trial while we're in Marseilles. I’ve never been to court; they say it’s utterly fascinating!” “Fascinating, certainly,” the young man conceded, “in that instead of shedding tears over the fictional suffering presented on a stage, in a courtroom, you witness a genuine, authentic case of misery—a real-life drama. The prisoner you see there, pale, anxious, and afraid, doesn't, like an actor after the curtain falls on a tragedy, simply go home for a peaceful supper with his family before resting to resume his pretense tomorrow. He is removed from your sight only to be led back to his prison and handed over to the executioner. I'll let you decide how well your nerves can withstand such a spectacle. However, rest assured, should a suitable chance arise, I will certainly give you the option to attend.” “For shame, M. de Villefort!” Renée cried, turning quite pale; “don’t you realize how you're alarming us?—and yet you find it amusing.” “What can I say? It's like a duel. I've already pronounced death sentences five or six times on instigators of political plots, and who knows how many daggers are sharpened, awaiting a favorable moment to be plunged into my heart?” “Heavens above, M. de Villefort,” said Renée, growing increasingly frightened; “you can't possibly be serious.” “But I am,” the young magistrate replied with a smile; “and in the intriguing trial that young lady is eager to see, the situation would be even more complex. Imagine, for instance, that the prisoner, as is quite likely, fought under Napoleon—well, can you for a second expect that someone used to charging fearlessly into enemy bayonets at his commander's command would hesitate more to drive a stiletto into the heart of a man he knows is his personal adversary than to slaughter his fellow men simply because he was ordered to do so by someone he's sworn to obey? Furthermore, one needs the exhilaration of being detested by the accused to whip oneself into a sufficient state of fervor and authority. I couldn't stand to see the man I was prosecuting smile, as if mocking my words. No; my pride is in seeing the accused pale, distraught, and appearing utterly broken by the intensity of my rhetoric.” Renée let out a muffled gasp. “Bravo!” one of the guests exclaimed; “now that’s truly speaking with purpose.” “Precisely the kind of person we need in times like these,” a second remarked. “What a brilliant success that last case of yours was, my dear Villefort!” a third commented; “I mean the trial of the parricide. Honestly, you finished him off before the executioner even touched him.” “Oh, as for parricides and such appalling individuals,” Renée interjected, “it hardly matters what is done to them; but concerning poor, unfortunate people whose only offense is getting involved in political schemes——” “Why, that is the absolute worst crime they could possibly commit; because, don’t you see, Renée, the king is the father of his nation, and anyone who conspires or plots anything against the life and safety of the parent of thirty-two million souls is a parricide on a terrifyingly vast scale?” “I don’t understand any of that,” Renée responded; “but, M. de Villefort, you promised me—didn't you?—always to show mercy to those on whose behalf I plead.” “Set your mind completely at ease on that matter,” Villefort answered, with one of his sweetest smiles; “you and I will always consult on our verdicts.”",

I've never been to court before; I hear it's so entertaining!\"\n\"Entertaining, yes,\" the young man replied, \"but only in the sense that, instead of weeping over fictional sadness at the theatre, in a courtroom you witness real people in real distress—a genuine drama. The accused you see, pale and nervous, doesn't go home to his family after the ordeal like an actor after a performance, but is instead led back to prison to await judgment or execution. You must consider carefully whether you can handle such a scene. Still, if the chance arises, I promise to invite you.\"\n\"You should be ashamed, M. de Villefort!\" said Renée, turning pale. \"Can't you see how frightened you’re making us? And yet you’re laughing.\"\n\"What can I say? It's similar to a duel. I have already given the death sentence five or six times to people guilty of political crimes, and who knows how many weapons might be waiting for a chance to strike at me?\"\n\"Good heavens, M. de Villefort,\" Renée said, even more shaken, \"you're not serious, are you?\"\n\"I assure you, I am,\" the young magistrate replied with a smile. \"And if the sort of dramatic trial the young lady wishes to see happened, the stakes would be even higher. Imagine the defendant is a former soldier of Napoleon – can you believe for a moment that someone accustomed to charging enemy bayonets on command will hesitate to stab an enemy in cold blood if he feels personally threatened? One must also become the villain in the eyes of the accused to argue passionately and forcefully. I wouldn't want to see the defendant grin at me as though ridiculing my efforts. No, my satisfaction is in seeing my adversary pale and shaken by the force of my words.\" Renée muffled a cry of alarm.\n\"Bravo!\" one guest shouted, \"that's what I call speaking candidly!\"\n\"Just the kind of prosecutor we need now,\" said another.\n\"Your last case was exceptional, Villefort,\" remarked a third, referring to a trial in which Villefort prosecuted a man for killing his own father. \"You destroyed him before the executioner even got to him.\"\n\"Well, with people who commit such horrible crimes as parricide,\" Renée interrupted, \"it hardly matters what happens to them; but for unfortunate people whose only offense is to have gotten involved in political affairs—\"\n\"But that is the most serious crime of all,\" responded Villefort. \"Don’t you see, Renée, that the king is like a father to his people? Anyone who plots against the king is committing parricide on an immense scale!\"\n\"I can’t speak for that,\" Renée replied, \"but you have promised me, M. de Villefort, always to show mercy to those I ask you to.\"\n\"Rest assured,\" Villefort replied kindly. \"We’ll always decide such matters together.\""

Renée regarded him with fond affection; and certainly his handsome features, lit up as they then were with more than usual fire and animation, seemed formed to excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful and intelligent lover.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The Comte de Salvieux remarked to Villefort, \"My dear Villefort, I said the very same thing just the other day at the Tuileries when the king's principal chamberlain asked me about the unusual match between a Girondin's son and the daughter of a Condé officer. I assured him that such a reconciliation of political differences was based on solid principles, and he seemed to understand completely. Then the king, who had been listening without our realizing it, interrupted us. He said, 'Villefort' – notice, he emphasized your name, Villefort, not Noirtier – 'Villefort is a young man of excellent judgment and discretion. He is sure to distinguish himself in his profession. I am very fond of him, and it gave me great pleasure to learn that he was about to become the son-in-law of the Marquis and Marquise de Saint-Méran. I would have suggested the union myself, had the noble marquis not anticipated my desires by asking for my approval.'\"\n\nVillefort, visibly moved, asked, \"Can it be true that the king spoke so kindly of me?\"\n\n\"Those were his exact words,\" replied Salvieux. \"And if the marquis is being honest, he'll confirm they align perfectly with what his majesty told him six months ago when he consulted the king about you marrying his daughter.\"\n\n\"That is correct,\" the marquis affirmed.\n\nVillefort exclaimed, \"How indebted I am to this gracious prince! There is nothing I wouldn't do to show my profound gratitude!\"\n\n\"That's the spirit!\" cried the marquise. \"I love to see you like this. Now, if a conspirator were to fall into your hands, he would be most welcome.\"\n\nRenée interjected gently, \"For my part, dear mother, I hope your wish doesn't come true. I pray that Providence only brings petty offenders, poor debtors, and minor swindlers into M. de Villefort's path. Then I would be content.\"\n\nVillefort countered, \"That's like wishing a doctor only had to treat headaches, measles, and wasp stings, or other minor skin issues. If you want me to become the king's attorney, you must hope for me to encounter some of those serious and dangerous cases where curing them brings a physician great honor.\"\n\nAt that very moment, as if Villefort's desire had immediately been granted, a servant entered and quietly spoke a few words to him. Villefort rose from the table immediately, citing urgent business. He returned shortly, his face glowing with happiness. Renée watched him with loving admiration. Indeed, his handsome features, now animated with unusual energy and brightness, seemed designed to inspire the innocent affection with which she gazed upon her elegant and intelligent fiancé.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"My dear Villefort,\" exclaimed the Comte de Salvieux, \"just recently at the Tuileries I made the exact same observation when the king's principal chamberlain asked me about the unusual match between the son of a Girondin and the daughter of a Duc de Condé's officer. I assured him that this way of bridging political divides was both logical and wise, and he understood it well. Then, unexpectedly, the king, who had overheard us, interrupted to say—note that he emphasized your name, Villefort, not Noirtier—'Villefort is a young man with keen judgment and discretion, destined to succeed in his career; I hold him in high regard, and was pleased to hear of his engagement to the Marquis and Marquise de Saint-Méran's daughter. I myself would have supported the match if the Marquis hadn't already come to seek my approval.'\"\n\nVillefort, delighted, asked if the king had truly spoken so kindly of him.\n\n\"Those are the king's actual words,\" responded Salvieux, \"and the Marquis can confirm that the King said the same to him when he came six months ago about your proposed marriage.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said the Marquis.\n\n\"I am so grateful to His Majesty!\" Villefort exclaimed. \"There is nothing I wouldn't do to show my appreciation.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said the Marquise. \"I like to see such gratitude. Now if only a conspirator would fall into your hands, you'd be delighted.\"\n\n\"For my part, Mother,\" interjected Renée, \"I hope you don't get your wish. May only minor offenders—poor debtors and petty cheats—come before Mr. de Villefort; that would make me happy.\"\n\n\"That's as if you wished a doctor only ever had to treat headaches or minor illnesses! If you want me to be the king's attorney, you should wish for serious cases—that's where the honor lies for a doctor.\"\n\nJust then, as if his wish had come true, a servant entered and whispered to Villefort, who rose from the table citing urgent business. He soon returned, his expression filled with happiness. Renée looked at him with loving admiration, his handsome features made even more striking by his excitement, inspiring even greater affection from her."

If Edmond Dantès is arrested, the truth of this can be confirmed, as he will either have the letter for Paris with him, or it can be found at his father's house.

Judging this one important, he sent for me, but as I wasn't there, he took it upon himself to issue the necessary orders for the suspect's arrest.\" \"So the guilty party is definitely imprisoned?\" the marquise asked. \"No, dear mother, please say the *accused* person,\" Villefort corrected. \"You understand we cannot yet declare him guilty.\" \"He is safely in custody,\" Villefort affirmed, \"and rest assured, if the letter proves authentic, he won't likely be allowed his freedom again, unless it's escorted by the executioner.\" \"And where is the poor individual?\" Renée inquired. \"He is at my house.\" \"Come, come, my friend,\" the marquise interrupted, \"don't neglect your duties to linger with us.

The marquise then asked if the person was now under arrest. Villefort clarified that the man should be referred to as the accused, not guilty, because no verdict had been reached yet. He confirmed that the accused was in secure custody and said that if the letter was incriminating, the accused would not be released unless he was taken to execution. Renée asked about the prisoner’s location, and Villefort replied that he was being held at Villefort’s own house. The marquise urged Villefort not to delay his official duties for their company. Renée pleaded with Villefort to show mercy, given that it was the day of their engagement. Villefort assured her that he would be as lenient as possible, but if the allegations against the Bonapartist were proven true, he would have no choice but to order his execution. The mention of execution distressed Renée. The marquise dismissed Renée’s reaction as childish and offered Villefort her hand, which he kissed respectfully, privately wishing it was Renée’s hand instead. Renée lamented that these were sad circumstances for a betrothal, upsetting her mother, who saw no connection between her daughter’s feelings and matters of the state. Renée protested softly. Villefort asked the marquise to forgive Renée, vowing to be all the more severe in his duty, but secretly promising Renée that he would treat the situation with as much compassion as possible.

          "text_segment": "No sooner had Villefort left the salon, than he assumed the grave air of a man who holds the balance of life and death in his hands. Now, in spite of the nobility of his countenance, the command of which, like a finished actor, he had carefully studied before the glass, it was by no means easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity. Except the recollection of the line of politics his father had adopted, and which might interfere, unless he acted with the greatest prudence, with his own career, Gérard de Villefort was as happy as a man could be. Already rich, he held a high official situation, though only twenty-seven. He was about to marry a young and charming woman, whom he loved, not passionately, but reasonably, as became a deputy attorney of the king; and besides her personal attractions, which were very great, Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran’s family possessed considerable political influence, which they would, of course, exert in his favor. The dowry of his wife amounted to fifty thousand crowns, and he had, besides, the prospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a million at her father’s death. These considerations naturally gave Villefort a feeling of such complete felicity that his mind was fairly dazzled in its contemplation.\nAt the door he met the commissary of police, who was waiting for him. The sight of this officer recalled Villefort from the third heaven to earth; he composed his face, as we have before described, and said, “I have read the letter, sir, and you have acted rightly in arresting this man; now inform me what you have discovered concerning him and the conspiracy.”\n“We know nothing as yet of the conspiracy, monsieur; all the papers found have been sealed up and placed on your desk. The prisoner himself is named Edmond Dantès, mate on board the three-master the Pharaon, trading in cotton with Alexandria and Smyrna, and belonging to Morrel & Son, of Marseilles.”\n“Before he entered the merchant service, had he ever served in the marines?”\n“Oh, no, monsieur, he is very young.”\n“How old?”\n“Nineteen or twenty at the most.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Immediately upon exiting the drawing-room, Villefort adopted the grave appearance of someone holding immense power over life and death. Despite his naturally noble features and the careful practice he, like a seasoned performer, had put into crafting a severe judicial expression in front of a mirror, it was actually quite difficult for him to achieve such a look. Apart from the potential impact of his father's past political affiliations on his own career, which required him to act with extreme caution, Gérard de Villefort enjoyed a remarkably fortunate life. He was already affluent and held a significant official role at just twenty-seven years old. He was on the verge of marrying a pleasant and attractive woman he cared for, not with intense passion, but with a sensible affection fitting for a deputy prosecutor for the king; and in addition to her considerable personal appeal, Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran's family possessed substantial political sway that they were certain to use to his advantage. His wife's dowry amounted to fifty thousand crowns, and he also anticipated her inheritance increasing her fortune to half a million upon her father's death. These combined factors instilled in Villefort such a profound sense of well-being that his mind was nearly overcome by the thought of it.\n\nAt the doorway, he encountered the police commissary who had been waiting for him. The sight of this officer jolted Villefort back from his state of perfect bliss to reality. He reassumed his stern expression, as noted earlier, and stated, 'Sir, I have reviewed the letter, and you were correct in apprehending this individual. Now, please inform me what you have discovered regarding him and the plot.'\n\nThe commissary replied, 'We have no information about the conspiracy just yet, monsieur. All retrieved documents have been sealed and placed on your desk. The prisoner himself is named Edmond Dantès, the first mate aboard the three-masted ship the Pharaon, which trades cotton with Alexandria and Smyrna and belongs to Morrel & Son of Marseilles.'\n\n'Had he ever served in the naval forces before joining the merchant service?' Villefort inquired.\n\n'Oh, no, monsieur, he is quite young,' the commissary said.\n\n'What is his age?'\n\n'Nineteen or twenty at the very most.'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As soon as Villefort left the drawing-room, he adopted the serious demeanor of someone who holds the power over others' lives. Although he possessed a noble appearance, and had practiced the severe expression he needed as though he were an actor, it was not genuinely natural for him to look stern and judicial. Apart from the potential complications from his father's political history, which might only affect his future if he was not extremely cautious, Gérard de Villefort was overwhelmingly happy. He was already wealthy, held a significant government position at just twenty-seven years old, and was soon to marry a beautiful and amiable woman. Though his feelings for her were measured and appropriate for a royal prosecutor, she was also attractive and her family's notable political connections would benefit him. She was bringing a fifty-thousand crown dowry, with the expectation of much more after her father's passing. These advantages filled Villefort with a sense of happiness so great it left him almost stunned. On his way out, he encountered the police commissioner waiting for him, which brought Villefort's focus back to the present. He rearranged his expression into the official sternness previously described and addressed the commissioner, saying he had read the letter, and approved the arrest, then asked for details about the accused and the conspiracy. The commissioner explained they didn't yet know much about the conspiracy, as all documents were sealed on Villefort's desk. The prisoner was Edmond Dantès, first mate on the Pharaon, a ship trading in cotton, owned by Morrel & Son of Marseilles. Asked if Dantès had ever served in the navy before entering merchant service, the commissioner replied no, he was very young, only nineteen or twenty."

Morrel.\n“Ah, M. de Villefort,” cried he, “I am delighted to see you. Some of your people have committed the strangest mistake—they have just arrested Edmond Dantès, mate of my vessel.”\n“I know it, monsieur,” replied Villefort, “and I am now going to examine him.”\n“Oh,” said Morrel, carried away by his friendship, “you do not know him, and I do. He is the most estimable, the most trustworthy creature in the world, and I will venture to say, there is not a better seaman in all the merchant service. Oh, M. de Villefort, I beseech your indulgence for him.”\nVillefort, as we have seen, belonged to the aristocratic party at Marseilles, Morrel to the plebeian; the first was a royalist, the other suspected of Bonapartism. Villefort looked disdainfully at Morrel, and replied coldly:\n“You are aware, monsieur, that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in private life, and the best seaman in the merchant service, and yet be, politically speaking, a great criminal. Is it not true?”\nThe magistrate laid emphasis on these words, as if he wished to apply them to the owner himself, while his eyes seemed to plunge into the heart of one who, interceding for another, had himself need of indulgence. Morrel reddened, for his own conscience was not quite clear on politics; besides, what Dantès had told him of his interview with the grand-marshal, and what the emperor had said to him, embarrassed him. He replied, however, in a tone of deep interest:\n“I entreat you, M. de Villefort, be, as you always are, kind and equitable, and give him back to us soon.” This give us sounded revolutionary in the deputy’s ears.\n“Ah, ah,” murmured he, “is Dantès then a member of some Carbonari society, that his protector thus employs the collective form? He was, if I recollect, arrested in a tavern, in company with a great many others.” Then he added, “Monsieur, you may rest assured I shall perform my duty impartially, and that if he be innocent you shall not have appealed to me in vain; should he, however, be guilty, in this present epoch, impunity would furnish a dangerous example, and I must do my duty.”\nAs he had now arrived at the door of his own house, which adjoined the Palais de Justice, he entered, after having, coldly saluted the shipowner, who stood, as if petrified, on the spot where Villefort had left him.",

Your staff has made a truly bizarre error—they've just arrested Edmond Dantès, my ship's first mate.\" Villefort responded, \"I'm aware of that, monsieur, and I'm on my way now to question him.\" \"Oh,\" said Morrel, swept up by his affection, \"you don't know him, but I do. He is the most admirable, most dependable person in the world, and I dare say, there isn't a better sailor in the entire merchant fleet. Oh, M. de Villefort, I beg you to show him leniency.\" As we've seen, Villefort belonged to Marseilles' aristocratic faction, while Morrel was part of the common people; the former was a supporter of the king, the latter suspected of favoring Bonaparte. Villefort looked down on Morrel with disdain and answered coolly, \"You understand, monsieur, that someone can be admirable and dependable in their personal life, and the best sailor in the merchant service, yet still be, from a political standpoint, a significant criminal. Isn't that so?\" The magistrate emphasized these words, seemingly wanting to apply them to the ship owner himself, while his gaze appeared to penetrate the thoughts of a man who, while pleading for another, himself needed forbearance. Morrel blushed, as his own political views weren't entirely free from suspicion; furthermore, what Dantès had told him about his meeting with the grand-marshal and the emperor's words had left him unsettled. Nevertheless, he replied with deep earnestness, \"I implore you, M. de Villefort, please be, as you always are, kind and just, and return him to us quickly.\" The phrase \"return him to us\" sounded revolutionary to the deputy. \"Ah, ah,\" he muttered, \"is Dantès perhaps a member of some Carbonari group, that his advocate uses the collective term? If I recall correctly, he was apprehended in a tavern among many others.\" He then added, \"Monsieur, rest assured I will carry out my duty fairly, and if he is innocent, your appeal will not have been in vain; however, should he be guilty, in this current era, granting him impunity would set a dangerous precedent, and I must fulfill my obligation.\" Having now reached the entrance to his own house, which was adjacent to the Palais de Justice, he went inside after giving a cold nod to the ship owner, who remained frozen in place where Villefort had left him.",

There has been a serious mistake by your staff—they have just arrested Edmond Dantès, the first mate of my ship.\" Villefort replied, \"I am aware of this, monsieur; I am on my way to interrogate him.\" Driven by his loyalty, Morrel continued, \"You don’t know him as I do. He’s the most honorable and trustworthy man, and I dare say you won’t find a better sailor in the merchant fleet. Please, M. de Villefort, show him some leniency.\" Villefort, who was from the aristocratic, royalist faction in Marseilles, looked at Morrel, who was from the commoners and suspected to be a Bonapartist, with a cold arrogance. He said, \"You understand that a man may be exemplary and reliable in his private affairs and a superb sailor, but still, in political matters, could be seen as a serious criminal. Isn’t that so?\" Villefort emphasized these words, almost as if suggesting Morrel was speaking for himself, and his gaze seemed to see into Morrel’s heart, as if suspecting him of needing leniency. Morrel blushed, feeling his own uneasy political conscience exposed, especially thinking about what Dantès had told him about his meeting with the grand-marshal and the emperor. Yet, sincerely, he added, \"I urge you, M. de Villefort, please act as fairly and kindly as you always do, and return him to us quickly.\" The word \"us\" struck Villefort as subversive. \"Ah,\" he thought, \"is Dantès part of a secret society that his supporter speaks like this? He was, after all, arrested in a tavern among a crowd.\" He then continued aloud, \"You can be sure, monsieur, I will fulfill my duty with impartiality. If he is innocent, you’ll not regret appealing to me; but if he is guilty, I must act, for in these times to show leniency would be dangerous.\" Reaching the door of his home next to the Palais de Justice, Villefort entered, having formally nodded to Morrel, who remained frozen in place after Villefort left."

Morrel & Son.”\n“Your age?” continued Villefort.\n“Nineteen,” returned Dantès.\n“What were you doing at the moment you were arrested?”\n“I was at the festival of my marriage, monsieur,” said the young man, his voice slightly tremulous, so great was the contrast between that happy moment and the painful ceremony he was now undergoing; so great was the contrast between the sombre aspect of M. de Villefort and the radiant face of Mercédès.\n“You were at the festival of your marriage?” said the deputy, shuddering in spite of himself.\n“Yes, monsieur; I am on the point of marrying a young girl I have been attached to for three years.” Villefort, impassive as he was, was struck with this coincidence; and the tremulous voice of Dantès, surprised in the midst of his happiness, struck a sympathetic chord in his own bosom—he also was on the point of being married, and he was summoned from his own happiness to destroy that of another. “This philosophic reflection,” thought he, “will make a great sensation at M. de Saint-Méran’s;” and he arranged mentally, while Dantès awaited further questions, the antithesis by which orators often create a reputation for eloquence. When this speech was arranged, Villefort turned to Dantès.\n“Go on, sir,” said he.\n“What would you have me say?”\n“Give all the information in your power.”\n“Tell me on which point you desire information, and I will tell all I know; only,” added he, with a smile, “I warn you I know very little.”\n“Have you served under the usurper?”\n“I was about to be mustered into the Royal Marines when he fell.”\n“It is reported your political opinions are extreme,” said Villefort, who had never heard anything of the kind, but was not sorry to make this inquiry, as if it were an accusation.\n“My political opinions!” replied Dantès. “Alas, sir, I never had any opinions. I am hardly nineteen; I know nothing; I have no part to play. If I obtain the situation I desire, I shall owe it to M. Morrel. Thus all my opinions—I will not say public, but private—are confined to these three sentiments,—I love my father, I respect M. Morrel, and I adore Mercédès. This, sir, is all I can tell you, and you see how uninteresting it is.” As Dantès spoke, Villefort gazed at his ingenuous and open countenance, and recollected the words of Renée, who, without knowing who the culprit was, had besought his indulgence for him. With the deputy’s knowledge of crime and criminals, every word the young man uttered convinced him more and more of his innocence. This lad, for he was scarcely a man,—simple, natural, eloquent with that eloquence of the heart never found when sought for; full of affection for everybody, because he was happy, and because happiness renders even the wicked good—extended his affection even to his judge, spite of Villefort’s severe look and stern accent. Dantès seemed full of kindness.\n“Pardieu!” said Villefort, “he is a noble fellow. I hope I shall gain Renée’s favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on me. I shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public, and a sweet kiss in private.” Full of this idea, Villefort’s face became so joyous, that when he turned to Dantès, the latter, who had watched the change on his physiognomy, was smiling also.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“Who exactly are you?” Villefort demanded, sifting through a growing pile of papers about the prisoner that a police officer had handed him upon arrival. In just an hour, this collection had swollen significantly, a testament to the flawed surveillance system that always targets the accused. “I am Edmond Dantès,” the young man replied calmly. “I am the first mate aboard the Pharaon, which is owned by Messrs. Morrel & Son.” Villefort continued, “Your age?” “Nineteen,” Dantès answered. “What were you doing when you were arrested?” “I was at my wedding celebration, sir,” the young man said, his voice slightly shaky due to the stark contrast between that joyful occasion and this painful interrogation, and the difference between Monsieur de Villefort’s severe expression and Mercédès’ radiant face. “You were at your wedding celebration?” the deputy repeated, involuntarily flinching. “Yes, sir; I am on the verge of marrying a young woman I have loved for three years.” Villefort, usually composed, was struck by this parallel. Dantès’ trembling voice, caught in the midst of his happiness, resonated with a chord of sympathy within him – he too was about to marry and had been called away from his own happiness to potentially ruin another’s. ‘This philosophical reflection,’ he mused, ‘will make quite an impression at Monsieur de Saint-Méran’s.’ While Dantès waited for the next question, Villefort mentally crafted the rhetorical contrast that orators often use to build a reputation for eloquence. Once his speech was composed, Villefort looked back at Dantès. “Proceed, sir,” he instructed. “What do you wish me to say?” “Provide all the information you can.” “Tell me specifically what you need to know, and I will share everything I know; however,” he added with a smile, “I must warn you I know very little.” “Did you serve under the usurper?” “I was just about to join the Royal Marines when he fell.” “It is claimed that your political views are extreme,” said Villefort, who had actually heard no such thing but felt no harm in posing the question as if it were an accusation. “My political views!” Dantès exclaimed. “Alas, sir, I have never had any. I am barely nineteen; I know nothing; I play no part. Any position I hope to gain, I will owe to Monsieur Morrel. Therefore, my only ‘opinions’—not public, but personal—are limited to these three feelings: I love my father, I respect Monsieur Morrel, and I adore Mercédès. That, sir, is all I can tell you, and you see how unremarkable it is.” As Dantès spoke, Villefort observed his simple and honest countenance and recalled Renée’s words, who, without knowing the accused, had pleaded for clemency. With the deputy’s experience dealing with crime and criminals, every word the young man uttered convinced him more and more of his innocence. This youth—for he was hardly an adult—was straightforward, genuine, and eloquent with that heartfelt sincerity not found when sought; full of affection for everyone because he was happy, and happiness makes even the wicked good—he extended his goodwill even to his judge, despite Villefort’s stern gaze and sharp tone. Dantès appeared genuinely kind. “Indeed!” Villefort thought, “He is a fine young man. I hope I can easily win Renée’s approval by fulfilling the very first request she made of me. I will at least receive a handshake in public and a sweet kiss in private.” Filled with this thought, Villefort’s face became so cheerful that when he looked at Dantès, the latter, who had noticed the change in his expression, began smiling as well.",

Dantès replied with a slight unease, recalling, “I was celebrating my wedding, monsieur,” the stark difference between his joyful celebration and his somber questioning making his voice waver. Villefort, despite himself, was affected to hear Dantès was about to be married—he was also soon to wed and realized he was being pulled from his own joy to deal with another’s. He even briefly imagined how he would recount this irony at M. de Saint-Méran's and mentally composed the speech he might deliver. Returning his focus to Dantès, Villefort asked him to continue, prompting Dantès for information. Dantès offered to answer any specific questions honestly, though confessed he knew little. Villefort inquired if Dantès had served under Napoleon, and Dantès explained he was about to join the Royal Marines when Napoleon fell from power. Villefort suggested Dantès held strong political views, though he had no evidence; Dantès protested that, being young and uninvolved, he held no opinions beyond personal loyalties—to his father, his employer Morrel, and his fiancée Mercédès. As Dantès spoke, Villefort, remembering his fiancée Renée's plea for leniency toward the unknown prisoner, became more and more convinced of Dantès’s innocence, seeing only the sincerity and warmth of a happy young man, harmless and honest. Villefort thought to himself that following Renée’s wishes in this matter would surely win her affection. This pleasant thought lit up his face, which Dantès noticed, and both men ended the exchange with smiles."

          "text_segment": "“Sir,” said Villefort, “have you any enemies, at least, that you know.”\n“I have enemies?” replied Dantès; “my position is not sufficiently elevated for that. As for my disposition, that is, perhaps, somewhat too hasty; but I have striven to repress it. I have had ten or twelve sailors under me, and if you question them, they will tell you that they love and respect me, not as a father, for I am too young, but as an elder brother.”\n“But you may have excited jealousy. You are about to become captain at nineteen—an elevated post; you are about to marry a pretty girl, who loves you; and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the envy of someone.”\n“You are right; you know men better than I do, and what you say may possibly be the case, I confess; but if such persons are among my acquaintances I prefer not to know it, because then I should be forced to hate them.”\n“You are wrong; you should always strive to see clearly around you. You seem a worthy young man; I will depart from the strict line of my duty to aid you in discovering the author of this accusation. Here is the paper; do you know the writing?” As he spoke, Villefort drew the letter from his pocket, and presented it to Dantès. Dantès read it. A cloud passed over his brow as he said:\n“No, monsieur, I do not know the writing, and yet it is tolerably plain. Whoever did it writes well. I am very fortunate,” added he, looking gratefully at Villefort, “to be examined by such a man as you; for this envious person is a real enemy.” And by the rapid glance that the young man’s eyes shot forth, Villefort saw how much energy lay hid beneath this mildness.\n“Now,” said the deputy, “answer me frankly, not as a prisoner to a judge, but as one man to another who takes an interest in him, what truth is there in the accusation contained in this anonymous letter?” And Villefort threw disdainfully on his desk the letter Dantès had just given back to him.\n“None at all. I will tell you the real facts. I swear by my honor as a sailor, by my love for Mercédès, by the life of my father——”\n“Speak, monsieur,” said Villefort. Then, internally, “If Renée could see me, I hope she would be satisfied, and would no longer call me a decapitator.”\n“Well, when we quitted Naples, Captain Leclere was attacked with a brain fever. As we had no doctor on board, and he was so anxious to arrive at Elba, that he would not touch at any other port, his disorder rose to such a height, that at the end of the third day, feeling he was dying, he called me to him. ‘My dear Dantès,’ said he, ‘swear to perform what I am going to tell you, for it is a matter of the deepest importance.’\n“‘I swear, captain,’ replied I.\n“‘Well, as after my death the command devolves on you as mate, assume the command, and bear up for the Island of Elba, disembark at Porto-Ferrajo, ask for the grand-marshal, give him this letter—perhaps they will give you another letter, and charge you with a commission. You will accomplish what I was to have done, and derive all the honor and profit from it.’\n“‘I will do it, captain; but perhaps I shall not be admitted to the grand-marshal’s presence as easily as you expect?’\n“‘Here is a ring that will obtain audience of him, and remove every difficulty,’ said the captain. At these words he gave me a ring. It was time—two hours after he was delirious; the next day he died.”\n“And what did you do then?”\n“What I ought to have done, and what everyone would have done in my place. Everywhere the last requests of a dying man are sacred; but with a sailor the last requests of his superior are commands. I sailed for the Island of Elba, where I arrived the next day; I ordered everybody to remain on board, and went on shore alone. As I had expected, I found some difficulty in obtaining access to the grand-marshal; but I sent the ring I had received from the captain to him, and was instantly admitted. He questioned me concerning Captain Leclere’s death; and, as the latter had told me, gave me a letter to carry on to a person in Paris. I undertook it because it was what my captain had bade me do. I landed here, regulated the affairs of the vessel, and hastened to visit my affianced bride, whom I found more lovely than ever. Thanks to M. Morrel, all the forms were got over; in a word I was, as I told you, at my marriage feast; and I should have been married in an hour, and tomorrow I intended to start for Paris, had I not been arrested on this charge which you as well as I now see to be unjust.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“Sir,” asked Villefort, “do you have any enemies that you are aware of?” Dantès responded, “Enemies? My position isn't high enough for that. Regarding my temperament, perhaps I can be a bit quick-tempered, but I’ve worked to control it. I've supervised ten or twelve sailors, and if you ask them, they’ll tell you they love and respect me, not as a father, since I’m too young, but as an older brother.” “But you might have provoked envy,” Villefort suggested. “You’re becoming a captain at nineteen – a significant promotion; you’re about to marry a beautiful girl who loves you. These two pieces of good fortune could easily have stirred up someone’s jealousy.” “You are right,” Dantès admitted, “you understand people better than I do, and what you say might well be true, I confess. But if such individuals are among my acquaintances, I’d rather not know it, because then I’d feel compelled to hate them.” “You are mistaken,” Villefort corrected. “You should always strive to see clearly around you. You seem like a decent young man; I’ll step outside the strict bounds of my duty to help you find the person behind this accusation. Here is the document; do you recognize the handwriting?” As he spoke, Villefort took the letter from his pocket and handed it to Dantès. Dantès read it. A shadow crossed his face before he replied, “No, monsieur, I don’t recognize the writing, yet it’s quite clear. Whoever wrote it has good penmanship. I consider myself very fortunate,” he added, looking thankfully at Villefort, “to be questioned by someone like you, because this envious person is a genuine enemy.” The rapid glance from the young man's eyes showed Villefort the considerable strength hidden beneath his gentle demeanor. “Now,” said the deputy prosecutor, “answer me truthfully, not as a prisoner speaking to a judge, but as one man to another who cares about your situation. How much truth is there in the accusation in this anonymous letter?” Villefort then tossed the letter Dantès had returned to him disdainfully onto his desk. “None whatsoever,” Dantès declared. “I will tell you the absolute truth. I swear on my honor as a sailor, on my love for Mercédès, on my father’s life—” “Speak, monsieur,” Villefort prompted. He thought to himself, “If Renée could see me now, I hope she’d be pleased and stop calling me a butcher.” “Very well,” Dantès continued. “When we left Naples, Captain Leclere fell ill with a high fever. As we had no doctor aboard and he was so eager to reach Elba that he refused to stop anywhere else, his condition worsened severely. By the third day, feeling he was dying, he called me to him. ‘My dear Dantès,’ he said, ‘swear you will do exactly as I tell you, because it is of the utmost importance.’ ‘I swear, Captain,’ I replied. ‘Good. After my death, command falls to you as mate, so take charge and sail for the Island of Elba. Land at Porto-Ferrajo, ask for the grand-marshal, give him this letter – perhaps they will give you another letter and assign you a task. You will complete what I was meant to do and receive all the credit and benefit from it.’ ‘I will do it, Captain, but perhaps I won't be granted access to the grand-marshal as easily as you expect?’ ‘Here is a ring that will ensure you are granted an audience with him and remove any difficulty,’ said the captain. With these words, he gave me a ring. It was just in time – two hours later he was delirious; the next day he died.” “And what did you do next?” Villefort inquired. “I did what I was obligated to do, what anyone in my position would have done. The final wishes of a dying man are sacred everywhere, but for a sailor, his superior's last requests are commands. I sailed for the Island of Elba and arrived the next day. I ordered everyone to stay aboard and went ashore alone. As I had anticipated, I found it difficult to gain access to the grand-marshal, but I sent him the ring I had received from the captain, and I was immediately admitted. He questioned me about Captain Leclere’s death and, just as the captain had told me, gave me a letter to deliver to someone in Paris. I accepted the task because it was what my captain had instructed me to do. I landed here, took care of the ship's business, and hurried to visit my fiancée, whom I found even more beautiful than before. Thanks to M. Morrel, all the arrangements were completed; in short, I was, as I mentioned, at my wedding celebration. I would have been married within an hour and intended to leave for Paris tomorrow, had I not been arrested on this charge, which both you and I now see is unjust.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"Sir,\" Villefort asked, \"do you have any enemies that you know of?\" \n\nDantès replied, \"Enemies? My situation in life isn’t grand enough to attract any. My temperament might be a bit impulsive, I admit, but I’ve tried to keep it in check. I’ve been in command of ten or twelve sailors, who, if asked, would say they like and respect me—more like an older brother than a father, since I’m still young.\"\n\nVillefort continued, \"But you might have made someone jealous. You’re about to become a captain at just nineteen, which is a distinguished rank, and you’ll soon marry a beautiful woman who’s deeply in love with you. Such good fortune could easily provoke envy.\"\n\n\"You’re probably right,\" Dantès conceded. \"You know people better than I do, and perhaps that’s the case. But if there are such people among those I know, I’d rather not be aware of it—I wouldn’t want to hate them.\"\n\n\"That’s a mistake; you should always strive to know the people around you,\" Villefort advised. \"You seem to be a decent young man, so I’ll step beyond my official duties to help you identify who’s making these accusations. Here’s the document—do you recognize this handwriting?\" Villefort produced the letter for Dantès to examine.\n\nDantès read it, and a shadow crossed his face. \"No, sir, I don’t know the handwriting, though it’s quite clear. Whoever wrote it has good penmanship. I consider myself lucky to be questioned by someone as fair-minded as you; whoever wrote this letter truly is an enemy.\" Villefort noted, through Dantès’ intense expression, the passion beneath his calm exterior.\n\n\"Now,\" Villefort said, \"tell me honestly, man to man, what truth is there in these accusations?\" He tossed the letter on his desk, clearly dismissing its importance.\n\n\"None whatsoever,\" Dantès answered. \"Let me explain what actually happened. I give you my word as a sailor, as a man in love with Mercédès, and as my father’s son.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" Villefort prompted, thinking to himself that his fiancée Renée would approve of his fairness.\n\nDantès continued, \"After we left Naples, Captain Leclere fell seriously ill. With no doctor on board and desperate to get to Elba, he refused to stop at any other port. His illness grew worse, and after three days, convinced he was dying, he called me over. ‘Dantès, promise you’ll do as I ask; it’s very important,’ he said. I promised I would. Then he said, ‘After my death, you’ll take command as mate. Go to the Island of Elba, land at Porto-Ferrajo, ask for the grand-marshal, and give him this letter—he may give you another one and an errand to complete. Do this, and you’ll receive the credit I would have.’\n\nI agreed, saying I might not get a meeting with the grand-marshal easily. He gave me a ring that would ensure I’d be let in. He was right; shortly after, he lost consciousness, and the next day he died.\"\n\nVillefort asked, \"What did you do then?\"\n\n\"What anyone in my position would have done,\" Dantès replied. \"A dying man’s last request is sacred, especially for a sailor when it comes as a command from a superior. I sailed for Elba, arrived the next day, told my crew to stay on board, and went ashore by myself. As expected, getting to see the grand-marshal was difficult, but with the captain’s ring, I was admitted straight away. The grand-marshal asked about Captain Leclere’s death and, just like my captain said, gave me a letter to deliver to someone in Paris. I took on the task because it was my captain’s wish. I then returned, handled the ship’s business, and hurried to see my fiancée, who was even more beautiful than before. Thanks to M. Morrel, all the paperwork for my marriage was in order. I was, as I mentioned, at my wedding celebration; I would have been married within the hour and planned to leave for Paris the next day—if I hadn’t been arrested for these accusations, which we both now see are baseless.\""

The Palais de Justice communicated with the prison,—a sombre edifice, that from its grated windows looks on the clock-tower of the Accoules. After numberless windings, Dantès saw a door with an iron wicket. The commissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice, every blow seeming to Dantès as if struck on his heart. The door opened, the two gendarmes gently pushed him forward, and the door closed with a loud sound behind him. The air he inhaled was no longer pure, but thick and mephitic,—he was in prison.\nHe was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber, but grated and barred, and its appearance, therefore, did not greatly alarm him; besides, the words of Villefort, who seemed to interest himself so much, resounded still in his ears like a promise of freedom. It was four o’clock when Dantès was placed in this chamber. It was, as we have said, the 1st of March, and the prisoner was soon buried in darkness. The obscurity augmented the acuteness of his hearing; at the slightest sound he rose and hastened to the door, convinced they were about to liberate him, but the sound died away, and Dantès sank again into his seat.

The commissioner picked up an iron hammer and struck the door three times, each strike feeling like a blow to Dantès's heart. The door opened, the two officers gently urged him forward, and it shut loudly behind him. The air he breathed was no longer fresh but heavy and foul, confirming he was now in prison. He was led to a cell that was reasonably clean but reinforced with bars, so its appearance wasn't immediately terrifying. Moreover, Villefort's seemingly supportive words still echoed in his mind, suggesting he might be released. It was four o'clock when Dantès was placed in the cell. Being the 1st of March, as mentioned, darkness soon enveloped the prisoner. The darkness sharpened his hearing; any slight noise made him stand up and rush to the door, certain they were there to set him free, but the sound would fade, and Dantès would sink back onto his seat. Finally, around ten o'clock, just as Dantès was starting to lose hope, footsteps were heard in the corridor.

The two gendarmes who were opposite to him descended first, then he was ordered to alight and the gendarmes on each side of him followed his example. They advanced towards a boat, which a custom-house officer held by a chain, near the quay.\nThe soldiers looked at Dantès with an air of stupid curiosity. In an instant he was placed in the stern-sheets of the boat, between the gendarmes, while the officer stationed himself at the bow; a shove sent the boat adrift, and four sturdy oarsmen impelled it rapidly towards the Pilon. At a shout from the boat, the chain that closes the mouth of the port was lowered and in a second they were, as Dantès knew, in the Frioul and outside the inner harbor.\nThe prisoner’s first feeling was of joy at again breathing the pure air—for air is freedom; but he soon sighed, for he passed before La Réserve, where he had that morning been so happy, and now through the open windows came the laughter and revelry of a ball. Dantès folded his hands, raised his eyes to heaven, and prayed fervently.\nThe boat continued her voyage. They had passed the Tête de Mort, were now off the Anse du Pharo, and about to double the battery. This manœuvre was incomprehensible to Dantès.\n“Whither are you taking me?” asked he.\n“You will soon know.”\n“But still——”\n“We are forbidden to give you any explanation.” Dantès, trained in discipline, knew that nothing would be more absurd than to question subordinates, who were forbidden to reply; and so he remained silent.\nThe most vague and wild thoughts passed through his mind. The boat they were in could not make a long voyage; there was no vessel at anchor outside the harbor; he thought, perhaps, they were going to leave him on some distant point. He was not bound, nor had they made any attempt to handcuff him; this seemed a good augury. Besides, had not the deputy, who had been so kind to him, told him that provided he did not pronounce the dreaded name of Noirtier, he had nothing to apprehend? Had not Villefort in his presence destroyed the fatal letter, the only proof against him?\nHe waited silently, striving to pierce through the darkness.\nThey had left the Ile Ratonneau, where the lighthouse stood, on the right, and were now opposite the Point des Catalans. It seemed to the prisoner that he could distinguish a feminine form on the beach, for it was there Mercédès dwelt. How was it that a presentiment did not warn Mercédès that her lover was within three hundred yards of her?\nOne light alone was visible; and Dantès saw that it came from Mercédès’ chamber. Mercédès was the only one awake in the whole settlement. A loud cry could be heard by her. But pride restrained him and he did not utter it. What would his guards think if they heard him shout like a madman?\nHe remained silent, his eyes fixed upon the light; the boat went on, but the prisoner thought only of Mercédès. An intervening elevation of land hid the light. Dantès turned and perceived that they had got out to sea. While he had been absorbed in thought, they had shipped their oars and hoisted sail; the boat was now moving with the wind.",

A dozen soldiers emerged and arranged themselves in formation, their bayonets gleaming under the quay lamps, a sight Dantès observed. He inwardly questioned if this considerable force was necessary because of him. The officer, by unlocking and opening the carriage door without a word, confirmed Dantès's suspicion, revealing a path through the ranks of soldiers leading directly to the port. The two gendarmes opposite him got out first, followed by Dantès when ordered, and then the gendarmes who had been beside him. They walked towards a boat, held by a customs officer near the quay with a chain. The soldiers watched Dantès with simple curiosity. Swiftly, he was placed in the boat's stern between the gendarmes, while the officer positioned himself at the bow. A push sent the boat moving, and four strong rowers propelled it quickly towards the Pilon. At a call from the boat, the harbor-mouth chain was lowered, and within moments, as Dantès realized, they were in the Frioul area, outside the inner harbor. Initially, the prisoner felt relief at breathing the fresh air again, associating air with freedom. However, this was soon followed by a sigh as they passed La Réserve, the location of his earlier happiness that day, now emanating sounds of laughter and celebration from a ball through its open windows. Dantès clasped his hands, looked skyward, and offered a heartfelt prayer. The boat continued its journey, passing the Tête de Mort and nearing the Anse du Pharo, preparing to round the battery. This maneuver puzzled Dantès. He asked where they were taking him, to which he received the curt reply, 'You will soon know.' When he pressed further, he was told, 'We are forbidden to give you any explanation.' Dantès, understanding military discipline, knew questioning subordinates who were not allowed to answer was futile, so he fell silent. Wild and uncertain ideas flooded his mind. He reasoned the boat wasn't suitable for a long voyage and saw no ships anchored outside the harbor, leading him to think they might be dropping him at a nearby location. He wasn't bound or handcuffed, which seemed a hopeful sign. Furthermore, the kind deputy had assured him he had nothing to fear if he avoided mentioning the name Noirtier, and Villefort himself had destroyed the crucial letter, the sole evidence against him, right in front of him. He waited quietly, trying to see through the darkness. They passed the lighthouse on Ile Ratonneau to their right and were now opposite the Point des Catalans. It seemed to the prisoner he could make out a woman's shape on the shore, as this was where Mercédès lived. He wondered why she hadn't felt a premonition that her beloved was just three hundred yards away. Only one light was visible, which Dantès recognized as coming from Mercédès's room. Mercédès was the only person awake in the entire settlement. A loud shout from him could reach her. But pride held him back, preventing him from crying out. What would his guards think if he yelled like a madman? He remained silent, his gaze fixed on the light. The boat moved on, but the prisoner's thoughts were solely on Mercédès. When a rise in the land hid the light, Dantès turned and realized they were now heading out to sea. While he had been lost in thought, they had pulled in the oars and hoisted a sail; the boat was now being driven by the wind.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The carriage came to a halt and the officer got out, making his way to the guardhouse. About a dozen soldiers emerged and lined up in formation; Dantès noticed the glint of their guns illuminated by the quay's lamps. He wondered to himself, “Is all this force really here for me?” The officer unlocked and opened the carriage door, and his silent actions answered Dantès’ question. The soldiers made a corridor leading from the carriage to the port. The two gendarmes sitting across from Dantès exited first; then Dantès was instructed to follow, and the other gendarmes at his side stepped out as well. They all walked toward a boat held by a customs officer with a chain near the dock. The soldiers stared at Dantès with dumb curiosity. In no time, Dantès was seated in the stern of the boat between the gendarmes, while the officer took a position at the front. A push sent the boat away from the dock, and four strong rowers quickly directed it toward the Pilon. When someone from the boat shouted, the chain blocking the port entrance was lowered, and in moments, as Dantès realized, they had entered Frioul and left the inner harbor behind. \nAt first, Dantès felt a surge of happiness at breathing fresh air, equating it to freedom; but the feeling soon changed to sorrow as they passed La Réserve, where he had been so content that morning, and now he could hear laughter and festivities through the open windows. Dantès clasped his hands, lifted his gaze skyward, and prayed earnestly.\nThe journey continued. They went beyond Tête de Mort, passed Anse du Pharo, and were about to go around the battery. Dantès couldn’t comprehend this maneuver. He asked, “Where are you taking me?” The reply was, “You will know soon enough.” When he pressed further, he was told, “We cannot explain.” Understanding the futility of questioning subordinates ordered to keep silent, Dantès said no more. Wild thoughts raced through his head. The boat was too small for lengthy travel; there were no ships anchored outside the harbor. He speculated that perhaps they intended to leave him at a remote spot. They hadn’t tied him up or attempted to restrain him, which he took as a good sign. Hadn’t the deputy been so considerate, advising him that as long as he didn’t mention Noirtier’s name, he had nothing to fear? Hadn’t Villefort, in his presence, destroyed the letter that was the only evidence against him?\nDantès waited in silence, trying to make sense of the darkness. They had left Ile Ratonneau, with its lighthouse, to the right, and were now across from Point des Catalans. Dantès thought he could spot a female figure on the beach—likely Mercédès, who lived there. He wondered why Mercédès didn’t somehow sense that he was so near, only about three hundred yards away.\nJust one light could be seen, coming from Mercédès’ room; she was the only person awake in the whole village. If he cried out, she would hear him. But pride held him back, and he refrained. What would his guards think if he suddenly shouted out like someone deranged?\nHe stayed quiet, eyes fixed on the light. The boat kept moving, but Dantès thought of nothing but Mercédès. Then a rise in the land blocked the light from view. Dantès looked back and noticed they had gone out to sea. Lost in thought, he hadn’t realized they put aside the oars and raised the sail; now the wind was carrying the boat forward."

Dantès walked behind his escort, who brought him to a room nearly underground. The room had bare, damp walls stained by years of sorrow; a lamp on a stool cast a weak light, allowing Dantès to see his escort—a poorly dressed, grim-looking assistant jailer. \"This is your room for the night,\" he said. \"It’s late, and the governor is asleep. He may move you tomorrow. For now, here’s bread, water, and clean straw, all a prisoner needs. Goodnight.\" Before Dantès could say a word, look at where the bread or water was placed, or see where the straw lay, the jailer hurried out, took the lamp, and locked the door, leaving Dantès with only the fading image of the damp, gloomy cell walls. Dantès was left alone in total darkness and silence, chilled by the cold air on his fevered brow."

He could have hidden until a Genoese or Spanish ship arrived, fleeing to Spain or Italy where Mercédès and his father could have joined him. He wasn't worried about finding work; good sailors were welcome anywhere. He spoke Italian and Spanish fluently, like a native.

He had no doubt he could make a living as a skilled sailor, as he was fluent in both Italian and Spanish.

The jailer tried to encourage him, asking if there was anything he could do. Dantès expressed a desire to see the governor, but the jailer refused, citing prison rules against it. He explained that prisoners could get better food for a price, access books, and take walks, but not speak with the governor by request. Dantès insisted, threatening to starve himself if denied, which made the jailer nervous since his pay depended on the prisoners. The jailer softened, saying that if Dantès behaved, he might eventually see the governor by chance, but that it could take months. Frustrated, Dantès said that waiting so long was unbearable, to which the jailer warned that constant brooding over the impossible would drive him mad within weeks."

Now, excuse the indiscretion, marquis, but have you any landed property?”\n“All my fortune is in the funds; seven or eight hundred thousand francs.”\n“Then sell out—sell out, marquis, or you will lose it all.”\n“But how can I sell out here?”\n“You have a broker, have you not?”\n“Yes.”\n“Then give me a letter to him, and tell him to sell out without an instant’s delay, perhaps even now I shall arrive too late.”\n“The deuce you say!” replied the marquis, “let us lose no time, then!”\nAnd, sitting down, he wrote a letter to his broker, ordering him to sell out at the market price.\n“Now, then,” said Villefort, placing the letter in his pocketbook, “I must have another!”\n“To whom?”\n“To the king.”\n“To the king?”\n“Yes.”\n“I dare not write to his majesty.”\n“I do not ask you to write to his majesty, but ask M. de Salvieux to do so.

Along with everyone else present, Renée was anxiously awaiting his return, and his appearance prompted a general outcry. One person asked, \"Well, Executioner, Protector of the Realm, Loyalist, Brutus, what's going on? Tell us!\" Another inquired, \"Are we facing a new Reign of Terror?\" A third exclaimed, \"Has the Corsican monster escaped?\" Villefort approached his future mother-in-law, the Marquise, and said, \"Marquise, I beg your forgiveness for leaving you so abruptly. Would the Marquis do me the honor of a brief private conversation?\" Noticing the seriousness on Villefort’s face, the Marquis asked, \"Ah, so it's truly a serious matter then?\" Villefort replied, \"So serious that I must leave you all for a few days; therefore,\" he added, turning to Renée, \"judge for yourself if it isn't important.\" \"You are leaving us?\" cried Renée, unable to hide her distress at this sudden news. \"Alas,\" Villefort responded, \"I must!\" The Marquise then asked, \"Where are you going?\" Villefort answered, \"That, Madame, is an official secret; but if you have any errands for Paris, a friend of mine is traveling there tonight and will gladly undertake them.\" The guests exchanged glances. \"You wish to speak with me alone?\" the Marquis repeated. \"Yes, please, let us go to the library.\" The Marquis took his arm, and they left the drawing-room. As soon as they were alone, the Marquis questioned, \"Well, tell me what this is about?\" \"An affair of the utmost importance that requires my immediate presence in Paris,\" said Villefort. \"Now, please excuse the intrusion, Marquis, but do you possess any landed property?\" \"My entire fortune is invested in the funds; seven or eight hundred thousand francs,\" replied the Marquis. \"Then sell out—sell out immediately, Marquis, or you will lose everything,\" Villefort urged. \"But how can I sell from here?\" asked the Marquis. \"You have a stockbroker, don't you?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then give me a letter for him, and tell him to sell without delay. It's possible I might even arrive too late as it is.\" \"Good heavens!\" exclaimed the Marquis. \"In that case, let's not waste any time!\" Sitting down, he wrote a letter to his broker, instructing him to sell at the current market price. \"Excellent,\" said Villefort, placing the letter in his pocketbook, \"now I need another one!\" \"To whom?\" \"To the King.\" \"To the King?\" \"Yes.\" \"I wouldn't presume to write to His Majesty.\" \"I'm not asking you to write to His Majesty yourself, but ask M. de Salvieux to do so. I need a letter that will allow me to be brought into the King's presence without the usual formalities of requesting an audience; that would cause a loss of precious time.\" \"But address yourself to the Keeper of the Seals,\" suggested the Marquis. \"He has the right to enter the Tuileries and can secure you an audience at any time, day or night.\" \"Undoubtedly; but there's no reason to share the credit for my discovery with him. The Keeper would push me aside and claim all the glory. I assure you, Marquis, my fortune is secured if I am the first to reach the Tuileries, because the King will not forget this service I render him.\" \"In that case, go and prepare for your departure.

Some jokingly called him by various nicknames and asked if there was imminent danger or a political upheaval. Villefort apologized to Madame de Saint-Méran for his abrupt departure and asked the marquis if he could speak with him privately. The marquis, noticing Villefort’s serious demeanor, realized the importance of the matter. Villefort announced he would have to leave for a few days, which upset Renée. When pressed for his destination, Villefort said it was an official secret, but offered to take any errands to Paris through a friend. After asking to speak privately, Villefort told the marquis he needed to go to Paris urgently for a critical affair. Villefort then inquired if the marquis had any property, recommending he sell all his investments at once to avoid losses. The marquis agreed, wrote a letter to his broker to sell immediately, and handed it to Villefort. Villefort also asked the marquis to arrange for a letter to the king via M. de Salvieux, to allow him quicker access to the king without formalities. The marquis suggested going through the Keeper of the Seals, but Villefort argued that he wanted credit for his discovery and to reach the king first. The marquis agreed to act quickly and arrange the necessary letters, while Villefort prepared to depart and made arrangements to say goodbye to the family before leaving."

          "text_segment": "Villefort hastily quitted the apartment, but reflecting that the sight of the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to throw the whole city into confusion, he resumed his ordinary pace. At his door he perceived a figure in the shadow that seemed to wait for him. It was Mercédès, who, hearing no news of her lover, had come unobserved to inquire after him.\nAs Villefort drew near, she advanced and stood before him. Dantès had spoken of Mercédès, and Villefort instantly recognized her. Her beauty and high bearing surprised him, and when she inquired what had become of her lover, it seemed to him that she was the judge, and he the accused.\n“The young man you speak of,” said Villefort abruptly, “is a great criminal, and I can do nothing for him, mademoiselle.” Mercédès burst into tears, and, as Villefort strove to pass her, again addressed him.\n“But, at least, tell me where he is, that I may know whether he is alive or dead,” said she.\n“I do not know; he is no longer in my hands,” replied Villefort.\nAnd desirous of putting an end to the interview, he pushed by her, and closed the door, as if to exclude the pain he felt. But remorse is not thus banished; like Virgil’s wounded hero, he carried the arrow in his wound, and, arrived at the salon, Villefort uttered a sigh that was almost a sob, and sank into a chair.\nThen the first pangs of an unending torture seized upon his heart. The man he sacrificed to his ambition, that innocent victim immolated on the altar of his father’s faults, appeared to him pale and threatening, leading his affianced bride by the hand, and bringing with him remorse, not such as the ancients figured, furious and terrible, but that slow and consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up to the very moment of death. Then he had a moment’s hesitation. He had frequently called for capital punishment on criminals, and owing to his irresistible eloquence they had been condemned, and yet the slightest shadow of remorse had never clouded Villefort’s brow, because they were guilty; at least, he believed so; but here was an innocent man whose happiness he had destroyed. In this case he was not the judge, but the executioner.\nAs he thus reflected, he felt the sensation we have described, and which had hitherto been unknown to him, arise in his bosom, and fill him with vague apprehensions. It is thus that a wounded man trembles instinctively at the approach of the finger to his wound until it be healed, but Villefort’s was one of those that never close, or if they do, only close to reopen more agonizing than ever. If at this moment the sweet voice of Renée had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy, or the fair Mercédès had entered and said, “In the name of God, I conjure you to restore me my affianced husband,” his cold and trembling hands would have signed his release; but no voice broke the stillness of the chamber, and the door was opened only by Villefort’s valet, who came to tell him that the travelling carriage was in readiness.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Villefort quickly left the room, but realizing that the sight of the deputy prosecutor rushing through the streets would cause widespread alarm, he resumed his normal walking pace. As he reached his door, he noticed a figure lurking in the shadows, seemingly waiting for him. It was Mercédès, who, having received no news of her beloved, had come discreetly to inquire about him.\n\nApproaching Villefort, she stepped forward and stood before him. Dantès had mentioned Mercédès, and Villefort immediately recognized her. Her beauty and dignified demeanor surprised him, and when she asked about her lover's fate, he felt as if she were the judge and he the one on trial.\n\n“The young man you are referring to,” Villefort stated abruptly, “is a serious offender, and I am unable to do anything for him, mademoiselle.” Mercédès began to weep, and as Villefort tried to pass, she spoke to him again.\n\n“But, at least, tell me where he is, so I might know if he is alive or dead,” she pleaded.\n\n“I do not know; he is no longer under my jurisdiction,” Villefort replied.\n\nWishing to end the encounter, he pushed past her and closed the door, as if to shut out the distress he felt. However, remorse cannot be so easily dismissed; like the hero in Virgil's tale, he carried the wound with the arrow still within. Upon reaching his drawing-room, Villefort let out a sigh that was almost a sob and sank into a chair.\n\nThen, the first agonizing pangs of an unending torment gripped his heart. The man he had sacrificed for his ambition, that innocent victim offered up because of his father's misdeeds, appeared before him, pale and menacing, holding the hand of his betrothed, and bringing with him a form of remorse not depicted by the ancients as fierce and terrifying, but as a slow, consuming anguish whose suffering intensified with every passing hour until death.\n\nHe had a moment of hesitation. He had often argued forcefully for the death penalty for criminals, and his compelling arguments had led to their condemnation, yet not the slightest hint of remorse had ever troubled Villefort, because they were guilty—or so he believed. But here was an innocent man whose happiness he had destroyed. In this instance, he was not the judge, but the executioner.\n\nAs he reflected on this, he experienced the feeling previously described, one entirely new to him, rising within his chest and filling him with vague anxieties. It is like a wounded person instinctively flinching when someone approaches their injury until it heals. But Villefort's was a wound that would never close, or if it did, would only reopen more painfully than before.\n\nIf at that moment the gentle voice of Renée had reached his ears, pleading for mercy, or if the lovely Mercédès had entered and implored, “In the name of God, I beg you to restore my betrothed husband,” his cold, trembling hands would have signed his release. But no voice broke the silence of the room, and the only person who opened the door was Villefort's valet, announcing that the carriage for his journey was ready.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Villefort hurriedly left the room, but realizing that seeing the deputy procureur rush through the streets might alarm the city, he slowed down to his normal pace. As he neared his house, he noticed someone waiting in the shadows by his door—it was Mercédès. She had come quietly, anxious for any news about her fiancé Dantès. When Villefort approached, Mercédès stepped forward. Since Dantès had mentioned her, Villefort immediately knew who she was and was impressed by her beauty and dignity. When she asked about her lover, Villefort felt as if he were being judged rather than being the judge himself. He replied abruptly that Dantès was a serious criminal and there was nothing he could do. Mercédès began to cry and pleaded to at least be told where Dantès was or if he was alive. Villefort answered that he did not know, as Dantès was no longer under his authority. Wanting to end the encounter, he brushed past her and shut the door, as if trying to shut out his guilt. However, remorse could not be so easily shut away; like the wounded hero in Virgil, he carried the pain within him. In his living room, Villefort collapsed into a chair with a deep, almost sobbing sigh, as the first intense pain of guilt took over his heart. The innocent man he had sacrificed out of ambition now haunted him in his thoughts, appearing with Mercédès and embodying a slow, relentless remorse, worse than any threat—a pain that grew over time. Villefort hesitated, recalling how he had previously argued passionately for the death penalty for guilty men without regret—but now, knowing he had condemned an innocent man, he felt he had become an executioner rather than a judge. This new, unsettling feeling filled him with fear and anxiety, like a man frightened of pain if anyone touches his wound—a wound that never heals for Villefort, or if it does, it soon reopens. At that moment, had Renée or Mercédès pleaded with him again for mercy, he would have let Dantès go free; but no one spoke and only his servant entered to announce that his carriage was ready for departure."

The lamp went out for want of oil, but she paid no heed to the darkness, and dawn came, but she knew not that it was day. Grief had made her blind to all but one object—that was Edmond.\n“Ah, you are there,” said she, at length, turning towards Fernand.\n“I have not quitted you since yesterday,” returned Fernand sorrowfully.\nM. Morrel had not readily given up the fight. He had learned that Dantès had been taken to prison, and he had gone to all his friends, and the influential persons of the city; but the report was already in circulation that Dantès was arrested as a Bonapartist agent; and as the most sanguine looked upon any attempt of Napoleon to remount the throne as impossible, he met with nothing but refusal, and had returned home in despair, declaring that the matter was serious and that nothing more could be done.\nCaderousse was equally restless and uneasy, but instead of seeking, like M. Morrel, to aid Dantès, he had shut himself up with two bottles of black currant brandy, in the hope of drowning reflection. But he did not succeed, and became too intoxicated to fetch any more drink, and yet not so intoxicated as to forget what had happened. With his elbows on the table he sat between the two empty bottles, while spectres danced in the light of the unsnuffed candle—spectres such as Hoffmann strews over his punch-drenched pages, like black, fantastic dust.\nDanglars alone was content and joyous—he had got rid of an enemy and made his own situation on the Pharaon secure. Danglars was one of those men born with a pen behind the ear, and an inkstand in place of a heart. Everything with him was multiplication or subtraction. The life of a man was to him of far less value than a numeral, especially when, by taking it away, he could increase the sum total of his own desires.

After encountering Fernand at the corner of Rue de la Loge, she had gone back to the Catalan village and collapsed onto her bed in utter despair. Fernand, kneeling beside her, grasped her hand and covered it with kisses she seemed not to register. She spent the entire night in this state. The lamp eventually ran out of oil, plunging the room into darkness, but she paid no attention to it, and the arrival of dawn also went unnoticed. Her overwhelming sorrow had fixated her sight on only one person: Edmond. 'Ah, you are still here,' she finally said, turning towards Fernand. 'I haven't left your side since yesterday,' Fernand replied sadly. M. Morrel had not easily given up his efforts. Upon learning that Dantès had been imprisoned, he contacted all his acquaintances and influential figures in the city; however, the news was already circulating that Dantès was apprehended as an agent for the Bonapartists, and as most people considered Napoleon's potential return to power out of the question, he met only with rejections. He returned home despondent, stating that the situation was serious and irreversible. Caderousse also felt restless and anxious, but unlike M. Morrel who sought to help Dantès, he secluded himself with two bottles of black currant brandy, hoping to suppress his thoughts. Yet he failed; he became too drunk to fetch more liquor but not so drunk as to forget what had occurred. He sat with his elbows on the table, positioned between the two empty bottles, while unsettling images, akin to the dark, bizarre phantoms Hoffmann scattered across his stories steeped in punch, danced in the unsteady light of the untrimmed candle. Only Danglars felt pleased and cheerful – he had eliminated an obstacle and secured his position aboard the Pharaon. Danglars was one of those individuals seemingly born with a pen lodged behind his ear and an inkwell where his heart should be. To him, everything was a calculation of increase or decrease. A human life held significantly less value than a number, especially if its removal could augment the total sum of his own ambitions. He retired to bed at his usual time and slept soundly.",

Fernand knelt beside her, showering her hand with kisses, but she was numb to his touch. She remained in this state all night long, indifferent to both the lamp burning out and the arrival of dawn, completely consumed by thoughts of Edmond. Eventually, she noticed Fernand and acknowledged his presence, to which he responded that he had not left her side since the previous day. Meanwhile, M. Morrel had been doing his best to help Dantès after hearing of his imprisonment; he appealed to his friends and influential people, but rumors that Dantès was a Bonapartist prevented any assistance, leaving Morrel hopeless and certain the situation was dire. Caderousse, on the other hand, isolated himself with two bottles of black currant brandy, hoping to forget, but only ended up drunk and haunted by memories and disturbing visions. Only Danglars was happy; he was relieved to have eliminated Dantès as a rival and secured his own position on the ship Pharaon. Danglars was calculating and coldhearted, valuing numbers over lives, and he enjoyed a peaceful night's sleep after achieving his goal."

There, we enter the small room with the arched window, famous as the preferred private space of Napoleon, Louis XVIII, and now Louis Philippe. In this room, King Louis XVIII was seated at a walnut table he had a particular fondness for, brought from Hartwell. He was casually listening to a gentlemanly, aristocratic man of fifty or fifty-two with gray hair, M. de Blacas, while making a note in his copy of Horace. The king, known for his sharp observations, was improving this edition.\n\n“You mentioned, sir—” the King began.\n\n“That I am extremely troubled, sire,” M. de Blacas responded.\n\n“Indeed? Have you perhaps seen a vision like that of the seven fat and seven lean cows?” the King jested.\n\n“No, sire, as that would only predict seven years of abundance followed by seven of scarcity. With a king as provident as Your Majesty, scarcity is not something to fear,” Blacas replied.\n\n“Then what other calamity worries you, my dear Blacas?” Louis XVIII inquired.\n\n“Sire, I have strong reasons to believe that trouble is brewing in the southern regions,” Blacas stated.\n\n“Well, my dear Duke,” Louis XVIII answered, “I think you are misinformed. I am quite certain, in fact, that the situation there is very peaceful.” Louis XVIII, being a man of intellect, enjoyed a bit of playful teasing.\n\n“Sire,” M. de Blacas persisted, “simply to ease the mind of a loyal servant, would Your Majesty consider sending trustworthy individuals into Languedoc, Provence, and Dauphiné? They could bring back an accurate report on the sentiment in those three provinces.”\n\n“Canimus surdis,” the King replied, continuing his annotations in Horace.\n\n“Sire,” the courtier responded with a laugh, pretending to understand the Latin quote, “Your Majesty may be perfectly right to trust in the positive attitude of France, but I fear I may not be entirely wrong in being concerned about a desperate action.”\n\n“By whom?” asked the King.\n\n“By Bonaparte, or at least by those loyal to him,” Blacas specified.\n\n“My dear Blacas,” the King said, “your worries are preventing me from my work.”\n\n“And Your Majesty’s complacency prevents me from sleeping,” Blacas countered.\n\n“Hold on, my dear sir, just a moment,” the King said. “I have a wonderful note to make on ‘Pastor quum traheret’—wait, and I will hear you afterward.”\n\nThere was a brief silence while Louis XVIII made another note in his Horace in a very small hand.

The king sits before a walnut table he had brought from Hartwell, to which he is sentimentally attached, engaging in a leisurely conversation with an elegantly dressed gentleman in his early fifties, whose distinguished appearance matches his gentlemanly demeanor. While the king listens, he makes notes in the margins of a sought-after but flawed edition of Horace, enriched by his philosophical insights. \n\nThe king prompts the gentleman—Blacas—who confesses he is very uneasy. The king makes a lighthearted reference to the biblical vision of seven fat and seven lean cows, implying a prophecy of alternating years of plenty and famine. Blacas, however, assures him that with the king's prudence, famine is unlikely. His worries, he clarifies, stem from suspicions of unrest brewing in the southern provinces. Louis XVIII, ever fond of a witty remark, replies that he has heard the weather there is actually fine. Blacas perseveres, requesting that loyal agents be sent to Languedoc, Provence, and Dauphiné to learn the true mood of the people. The king, busy annotating his Horace, responds with a Latin phrase, seemingly dismissing the concern, while Blacas, trying to appear in on the jest, feigns amusement but presses his concern about possible threats from Bonaparte or his supporters. Louis XVIII claims such worries interrupt his scholarly work, just as his calm disturbs Blacas’s sleep. The king asks for patience so he can finish his delightful note, then, after a pause and another margin note, invites Blacas to continue, pretending to have arrived at an original idea while in truth only expanding on another's thought, and assures him of his attention."

Dandré, is present to give the most current updates about Napoleon Bonaparte. Louis XVIII urges Dandré not to hide anything, joking that Elba is like a volcano about to erupt with war. Dandré respectfully reports that, according to their latest intelligence, Bonaparte is terribly bored and spends his time supervising miners at Porto-Longone while suffering from a severe skin condition. The king humorously adds that Bonaparte scratches himself out of irritation. The Duke, confused, asks for clarification, and the king confirms, calling it prurigo. Dandré and the king then suggest that Bonaparte may soon lose his mind, describing his erratic behavior, like laughing and crying for no reason or throwing stones into the sea with childlike delight. The king teases that perhaps these are signs of genius rather than madness, referencing ancient generals for comparison. Between the confident king and the honest minister, Blacas is left thoughtful and worried, as Villefort hasn’t told them everything. Louis XVIII tells Dandré to continue and explain “the usurper’s conversion.” Dandré gravely explains that during a recent review, Napoleon dismissed a few veterans who wanted to return to France, encouraging them to serve the legitimate king.

The duke, however, overcame all difficulties with a word—his majesty’s order; and, in spite of the protestations which the master of ceremonies made for the honor of his office and principles, Villefort was introduced.\nThe king was seated in the same place where the duke had left him. On opening the door, Villefort found himself facing him, and the young magistrate’s first impulse was to pause.\n“Come in, M. de Villefort,” said the king, “come in.”\nVillefort bowed, and advancing a few steps, waited until the king should interrogate him.\n“M. de Villefort,” said Louis XVIII., “the Duc de Blacas assures me you have some interesting information to communicate.”\n“Sire, the duke is right, and I believe your majesty will think it equally important.”\n“In the first place, and before everything else, sir, is the news as bad in your opinion as I am asked to believe?”\n“Sire, I believe it to be most urgent, but I hope, by the speed I have used, that it is not irreparable.”\n“Speak as fully as you please, sir,” said the king, who began to give way to the emotion which had showed itself in Blacas’s face and affected Villefort’s voice. “Speak, sir, and pray begin at the beginning; I like order in everything.”\n“Sire,” said Villefort, “I will render a faithful report to your majesty, but I must entreat your forgiveness if my anxiety leads to some obscurity in my language.” A glance at the king after this discreet and subtle exordium, assured Villefort of the benignity of his august auditor, and he went on:\n“Sire, I have come as rapidly to Paris as possible, to inform your majesty that I have discovered, in the exercise of my duties, not a commonplace and insignificant plot, such as is every day got up in the lower ranks of the people and in the army, but an actual conspiracy—a storm which menaces no less than your majesty’s throne. Sire, the usurper is arming three ships, he meditates some project, which, however mad, is yet, perhaps, terrible. At this moment he will have left Elba, to go whither I know not, but assuredly to attempt a landing either at Naples, or on the coast of Tuscany, or perhaps on the shores of France.

Consequently, despite the master of ceremonies' protests regarding the dignity of his office and its rules, Villefort was admitted. The king remained seated in the same spot where the duke had left him. Entering the room, Villefort found himself directly facing the monarch, and the young magistrate's immediate reaction was to pause. \"Come in, M. de Villefort,\" the king said, \"come in.\" Villefort bowed and took a few steps forward, waiting for the king to question him. \"M. de Villefort,\" Louis XVIII stated, \"the Duc de Blacas assures me you have some important information to share.\" \"Sire, the duke is correct, and I believe your majesty will find it equally significant.\" \"First and foremost, sir,\" the king inquired, \"is this news, in your estimation, as serious as I am being led to believe?\" \"Sire, I believe it is extremely urgent, but I hope that the speed with which I have traveled means it is not yet irreversible.\" \"Speak as fully as you wish, sir,\" said the king, beginning to show the emotion that had been visible in Blacas's face and which affected Villefort's voice. \"Speak, sir, and please start from the beginning; I prefer order in all things.\" \"Sire,\" Villefort began, \"I will provide your majesty with a faithful report, but I must ask for your forgiveness if my anxiety causes my words to be somewhat unclear.\" After observing the king's favorable reaction to this careful and subtle introduction, Villefort continued: \"Sire, I have traveled to Paris as quickly as possible to inform your majesty that, through the course of my duties, I have uncovered not a common, minor plot of the sort that frequently arises among ordinary people or in the army, but a true conspiracy – a dangerous threat aimed directly at your majesty's throne.

Louis XVIII downplayed the likelihood of a successful conspiracy, reasoning that while such plans were easy to conceive, they were difficult to execute thanks to the monarchy’s vigilance, particularly in watching the Mediterranean coast. He expressed confidence that should Bonaparte attempt to land—whether in Naples, Tuscany, or France itself—he would face overwhelming opposition or be met with public hostility. The king encouraged Villefort to be optimistic and reassured him of royal gratitude. At that moment, de Blacas announced the arrival of M. Dandré, who entered looking pale and shaken, and as Villefort moved to leave, de Blacas stopped him by taking his hand."

          "text_segment": "At the sight of this agitation Louis XVIII. pushed from him violently the table at which he was sitting.\n“What ails you, baron?” he exclaimed. “You appear quite aghast. Has your uneasiness anything to do with what M. de Blacas has told me, and M. de Villefort has just confirmed?” M. de Blacas moved suddenly towards the baron, but the fright of the courtier pleaded for the forbearance of the statesman; and besides, as matters were, it was much more to his advantage that the prefect of police should triumph over him than that he should humiliate the prefect.\n“Sire,——” stammered the baron.\n“Well, what is it?” asked Louis XVIII. The minister of police, giving way to an impulse of despair, was about to throw himself at the feet of Louis XVIII., who retreated a step and frowned.\n“Will you speak?” he said.\n“Oh, sire, what a dreadful misfortune! I am, indeed, to be pitied. I can never forgive myself!”\n“Monsieur,” said Louis XVIII., “I command you to speak.”\n“Well, sire, the usurper left Elba on the 26th February, and landed on the 1st of March.”\n“And where? In Italy?” asked the king eagerly.\n“In France, sire,—at a small port, near Antibes, in the Gulf of Juan.”\n“The usurper landed in France, near Antibes, in the Gulf of Juan, two hundred and fifty leagues from Paris, on the 1st of March, and you only acquired this information today, the 3rd of March! Well, sir, what you tell me is impossible. You must have received a false report, or you have gone mad.”\n“Alas, sire, it is but too true!” Louis made a gesture of indescribable anger and alarm, and then drew himself up as if this sudden blow had struck him at the same moment in heart and countenance.\n“In France!” he cried, “the usurper in France! Then they did not watch over this man. Who knows? they were, perhaps, in league with him.”\n“Oh, sire,” exclaimed the Duc de Blacas, “M. Dandré is not a man to be accused of treason! Sire, we have all been blind, and the minister of police has shared the general blindness, that is all.”\n“But——” said Villefort, and then suddenly checking himself, he was silent; then he continued, “Your pardon, sire,” he said, bowing, “my zeal carried me away. Will your majesty deign to excuse me?”\n“Speak, sir, speak boldly,” replied Louis. “You alone forewarned us of the evil; now try and aid us with the remedy.”\n“Sire,” said Villefort, “the usurper is detested in the south; and it seems to me that if he ventured into the south, it would be easy to raise Languedoc and Provence against him.”\n“Yes, assuredly,” replied the minister; “but he is advancing by Gap and Sisteron.”\n“Advancing—he is advancing!” said Louis XVIII. “Is he then advancing on Paris?” The minister of police maintained a silence which was equivalent to a complete avowal.\n“And Dauphiné, sir?” inquired the king, of Villefort. “Do you think it possible to rouse that as well as Provence?”\n“Sire, I am sorry to tell your majesty a cruel fact; but the feeling in Dauphiné is quite the reverse of that in Provence or Languedoc. The mountaineers are Bonapartists, sire.”\n“Then,” murmured Louis, “he was well informed. And how many men had he with him?”\n“I do not know, sire,” answered the minister of police.\n“What, you do not know! Have you neglected to obtain information on that point? Of course it is of no consequence,” he added, with a withering smile.\n“Sire, it was impossible to learn; the despatch simply stated the fact of the landing and the route taken by the usurper.”\n“And how did this despatch reach you?” inquired the king. The minister bowed his head, and while a deep color overspread his cheeks, he stammered out:\n“By the telegraph, sire.” Louis XVIII. advanced a step, and folded his arms over his chest as Napoleon would have done.\n“So then,” he exclaimed, turning pale with anger, “seven conjoined and allied armies overthrew that man. A miracle of heaven replaced me on the throne of my fathers after five-and-twenty years of exile. I have, during those five-and-twenty years, spared no pains to understand the people of France and the interests which were confided to me; and now, when I see the fruition of my wishes almost within reach, the power I hold in my hands bursts and shatters me to atoms!”\n“Sire, it is fatality!” murmured the minister, feeling that the pressure of circumstances, however light a thing to destiny, was too much for any human strength to endure.\n“What our enemies say of us is then true. We have learnt nothing, forgotten nothing! If I were betrayed as he was, I would console myself; but to be in the midst of persons elevated by myself to places of honor, who ought to watch over me more carefully than over themselves,—for my fortune is theirs—before me they were nothing—after me they will be nothing, and perish miserably from incapacity—ineptitude! Oh, yes, sir, you are right—it is fatality!”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Witnessing the baron's distress, Louis XVIII impatiently shoved the table he was seated at. “What is wrong, Baron?” he demanded. “You look completely stunned. Is your anxiety related to what M. de Blacas informed me of, which M. de Villefort has just substantiated?” M. de Blacas abruptly approached the baron, but the courtier's visible fear convinced the statesman to hold back; moreover, given the circumstances, it was more advantageous for the prefect of police to succeed where he failed than for him to disgrace the prefect. “Sire,” the baron faltered. “Well, what is it?” Louis XVIII pressed. Overcome by despair, the minister of police was on the verge of prostrating himself before Louis XVIII, who recoiled a step and frowned. “Will you speak?” he ordered. “Oh, sire, it’s a terrible catastrophe! I am truly deserving of pity. I shall never forgive myself!” “Monsieur,” said Louis XVIII, “I order you to speak.” “Very well, sire, the usurper departed Elba on February 26th and landed on March 1st.” “And where? In Italy?” the king asked keenly. “In France, sire—at a small harbor near Antibes, in the Gulf of Juan.” “The usurper landed in France, near Antibes, in the Gulf of Juan, two hundred and fifty leagues from Paris, on March 1st, and you only learned this today, March 3rd! Sir, what you are telling me is impossible. You must have received incorrect intelligence, or you’ve lost your mind.” “Alas, sire, it is unfortunately true!” Louis reacted with a gesture of profound anger and alarm, then composed himself as if this sudden shock had wounded him simultaneously in spirit and appearance. “In France!” he exclaimed, “the usurper in France! Then they failed to monitor this man. Who knows? Perhaps they were in collusion with him.” “Oh, sire,” cried the Duc de Blacas, “M. Dandré cannot be accused of treason! Sire, we have all been oblivious, and the minister of police simply shared in the universal lack of awareness, that is all.” “But—” Villefort began, then abruptly stopped, falling silent; he then continued, “Forgive me, sire,” he said, bowing, “my fervor got the better of me. Would your majesty condescend to excuse me?” “Speak, sir, speak freely,” Louis replied. “You were the only one who alerted us to the danger; now attempt to assist us with a solution.” “Sire,” said Villefort, “the usurper is detested in the south; and it strikes me that if he ventured there, it would be simple to rally Languedoc and Provence against him.” “Yes, indeed,” the minister agreed; “but he is advancing through Gap and Sisteron.” “Advancing—he is advancing!” said Louis XVIII. “Is he then advancing on Paris?” The minister of police remained silent, a silence that amounted to a full confession. “And Dauphiné, sir?” the king inquired of Villefort. “Do you believe it possible to stir up that region as well as Provence?” “Sire, it pains me to convey a harsh reality to your majesty; but the sentiment in Dauphiné is quite the opposite of that in Provence or Languedoc. The mountain inhabitants are Bonapartists, sire.” “Then,” Louis murmured, “he was well-informed. And how many men did he have with him?” “I do not know, sire,” replied the minister of police. “What, you do not know! Did you neglect to gather information on that matter? Of course, it is of no significance,” he added, with a scathing smile. “Sire, it was impossible to ascertain; the despatch merely stated the fact of the landing and the route the usurper took.” “And how did this despatch arrive?” the king asked. The minister lowered his head, and as a deep flush spread across his cheeks, he mumbled: “By the telegraph, sire.” Louis XVIII took a step forward, crossing his arms over his chest as Napoleon might have done. “So then,” he declared, turning pale with rage, “seven combined and allied armies overthrew that man. A divine miracle restored me to the throne of my ancestors after twenty-five years of exile. During those twenty-five years, I spared no effort to comprehend the French people and the interests entrusted to me; and now, as the realization of my desires is nearly within reach, the power I wield shatters in my hands and fragments me!” “Sire, it is fate!” the minister whispered, sensing that the pressure of circumstances, however minor to destiny, was too great for any human strength to withstand. “What our adversaries say about us is thus true. We have learned nothing, forgotten nothing! If I were betrayed as he was, I would find solace; but to be surrounded by individuals I elevated to positions of honor, who ought to guard me more diligently than themselves—for my prosperity is theirs—before me they were nothing—after me they will be nothing, and perish miserably from their incompetence—incapacity! Oh, yes, sir, you are correct—it is fate!”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Upon seeing the baron's distress, Louis XVIII. abruptly shoved his table aside. \"What's wrong, baron?\" he demanded. \"You look terrified. Is your worry related to what M. de Blacas told me, and what M. de Villefort has just confirmed?\" M. de Blacas approached the baron, but the baron's obvious fear made the statesman merciful; besides, it suited Blacas for the prefect of police to prevail rather than for him to humiliate the prefect. \n\n\"Sire...\" the baron stammered. \n\n\"Well, what is it?\" Louis XVIII. pressed. The minister of police, desperate, nearly fell to his knees, but Louis XVIII. stepped back and frowned. \"Will you speak?\" he insisted. \n\n\"Oh, sire, what a catastrophe! I am to be pitied greatly; I'll never forgive myself!\" \n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the king, \"I order you to speak.\" \n\n\"Sire, the usurper left Elba on February 26th, and landed on March 1st.\" \n\n\"Where?

What you say seems impossible. You must have received a false report, or else you've lost your senses.\" \n\n\"Unfortunately, sire, it's the truth!\" Louis made a furious, alarmed gesture, then straightened up, deeply affected. \n\n\"In France!\" he cried. \"The usurper in France! Clearly, he was not being watched. Perhaps some were even in league with him.\" \n\n\"Oh sire,\" said the Duc de Blacas, \"M. Dandré is no traitor! We have all been blinded, and the minister of police has just shared in this general blindness.\" \n\n\"But—\" began Villefort, then stopped himself and bowed, apologizing for his rashness. \n\n\"Speak boldly,\" replied Louis. \"You warned us of the danger; now help us find a solution.\" \n\n\"Sire, the usurper is hated in the south. If he went there, we could likely rouse Languedoc and Provence against him.\" \n\n\"Yes, certainly,\" added the minister, \"but he is advancing by Gap and Sisteron.\" \n\n\"Advancing—he is advancing!\" cried the king. \"Toward Paris?\" The minister of police’s silence confirmed the worst. \n\n\"What about Dauphiné?\" the king asked Villefort. \"Can it be roused as well?\" \n\n\"Sire, sadly, Dauphiné feels differently than Provence or Languedoc. The mountaineers are Bonapartists.\" \n\nLouis murmured, \"Then he was well informed. How many men does he have?\" \n\n\"I do not know, sire,\" replied the police minister. \n\n\"You don’t know? You haven’t found out? Very well,\" the king replied sarcastically. \n\n\"Sire, it was impossible; the message simply stated the usurper landed and his route.\" \n\n\"And how did you get this message?\" the king asked. The minister, reddening, replied, \"By telegraph, sire.\" Louis XVIII. stepped forward, crossing his arms like Napoleon. \n\n\"So,\" he burst out, pale with anger, \"seven allied armies defeated that man. A miracle restored me to my throne after 25 years of exile during which I worked hard to understand my people and my duties. And now, when my hopes seem near fulfillment, the power granted to me falls apart!\" \n\n\"Sire, it is fate,\" murmured the minister, feeling overwhelmed by the circumstances. \n\n\"Our enemies are right—we have learned nothing, forgotten nothing! If I were betrayed like him I could accept it, but to be surrounded by people raised to honor by me, whose fortunes depend on mine, and who will be nothing without me—and to be let down by their incompetence! Yes, you are right, it is fate.\""

          "text_segment": "The minister quailed before this outburst of sarcasm. M. de Blacas wiped the moisture from his brow. Villefort smiled within himself, for he felt his increased importance.\n“To fall,” continued King Louis, who at the first glance had sounded the abyss on which the monarchy hung suspended,—“to fall, and learn of that fall by telegraph! Oh, I would rather mount the scaffold of my brother, Louis XVI., than thus descend the staircase at the Tuileries driven away by ridicule. Ridicule, sir—why, you know not its power in France, and yet you ought to know it!”\n“Sire, sire,” murmured the minister, “for pity’s——”\n“Approach, M. de Villefort,” resumed the king, addressing the young man, who, motionless and breathless, was listening to a conversation on which depended the destiny of a kingdom. “Approach, and tell monsieur that it is possible to know beforehand all that he has not known.”\n“Sire, it was really impossible to learn secrets which that man concealed from all the world.”\n“Really impossible! Yes—that is a great word, sir. Unfortunately, there are great words, as there are great men; I have measured them. Really impossible for a minister who has an office, agents, spies, and fifteen hundred thousand francs for secret service money, to know what is going on at sixty leagues from the coast of France! Well, then, see, here is a gentleman who had none of these resources at his disposal—a gentleman, only a simple magistrate, who learned more than you with all your police, and who would have saved my crown, if, like you, he had the power of directing a telegraph.” The look of the minister of police was turned with concentrated spite on Villefort, who bent his head in modest triumph.\n“I do not mean that for you, Blacas,” continued Louis XVIII.; “for if you have discovered nothing, at least you have had the good sense to persevere in your suspicions. Any other than yourself would have considered the disclosure of M. de Villefort insignificant, or else dictated by venal ambition.” These words were an allusion to the sentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much confidence an hour before.\nVillefort understood the king’s intent. Any other person would, perhaps, have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise; but he feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police minister, although he saw that Dandré was irrevocably lost. In fact, the minister, who, in the plenitude of his power, had been unable to unearth Napoleon’s secret, might in despair at his own downfall interrogate Dantès and so lay bare the motives of Villefort’s plot. Realizing this, Villefort came to the rescue of the crest-fallen minister, instead of aiding to crush him.\n“Sire,” said Villefort, “the suddenness of this event must prove to your majesty that the issue is in the hands of Providence; what your majesty is pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity is simply owing to chance, and I have profited by that chance, like a good and devoted servant—that’s all. Do not attribute to me more than I deserve, sire, that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first opinion you have been pleased to form of me.” The minister of police thanked the young man by an eloquent look, and Villefort understood that he had succeeded in his design; that is to say, that without forfeiting the gratitude of the king, he had made a friend of one on whom, in case of necessity, he might rely.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The minister visibly faltered under this biting sarcasm. Monsieur de Blacas wiped sweat from his forehead. Meanwhile, Villefort smiled inwardly, recognizing his newfound importance. King Louis continued, having immediately grasped the serious danger the monarchy faced: “To fall, and discover this fall via telegraph! Oh, I would sooner ascend the guillotine like my brother, Louis XVI, than be driven from the Tuileries stairs by mockery. Ridicule, sir—you underestimate its power in France, though you should know it!” “Sire, sire,” the minister weakly pleaded, “have pity…” “Approach, Monsieur de Villefort,” the king commanded, turning to the young man who stood frozen, listening intently to a conversation holding a kingdom's fate. “Approach, and inform this gentleman that it was indeed possible to foresee everything he failed to know.” “Sire, it was genuinely impossible to uncover secrets this man kept from everyone,” the minister defended. “Genuinely impossible! Yes, that’s a grand phrase, sir. Regrettably, there are grand phrases, just as there are great men; I’ve assessed both. Genuinely impossible for a minister with an office, agents, spies, and a million and a half francs for confidential operations, to know what’s happening only sixty leagues from the French coast! Well, observe, here is a gentleman lacking any of these resources—a simple magistrate, no less—who knew more than you, with all your police, and could have preserved my throne had he possessed the authority to use a telegraph like you.” The police minister’s gaze fixed on Villefort with intense resentment, while Villefort modestly lowered his head, enjoying a quiet victory. “I’m not referring to you, Blacas,” Louis XVIII added, “because while you uncovered nothing, you at least had the good sense to persist in your suspicions. Anyone else would have deemed Monsieur de Villefort’s revelation trivial or motivated by ambition.” These words alluded to the police minister's confident dismissal of Villefort's information just an hour prior. Villefort understood the king’s meaning. Such intoxicating praise might have overwhelmed another person, but he feared making a bitter enemy of the police minister, even though he saw Dandré's career was over. The minister, who in his authority couldn't uncover Napoleon's secret, might, in despair over his own ruin, question Dantès and thus reveal the basis of Villefort’s plot. Recognizing this, Villefort chose to support the disgraced minister rather than contribute to his downfall. “Sire,” said Villefort, “the suddenness of this event proves to your majesty that the outcome rests with Providence; what your majesty kindly attributes to my profound insight is merely the result of chance, and I simply seized that opportunity as a loyal and dedicated servant—nothing more. Please do not credit me with more than I deserve, sire, so that your majesty will never have cause to regret the initial high opinion you have formed of me.” The police minister expressed his gratitude to the young man with a meaningful look, and Villefort understood he had succeeded: he had secured the king's favor without alienating someone he might need to rely on in the future.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The minister was intimidated by the king’s biting sarcasm, while M. de Blacas nervously wiped his forehead. Villefort secretly enjoyed the situation, recognizing that his own influence was growing. The king, having immediately understood the precarious situation of the monarchy, continued, \"To be overthrown and to learn about it through a telegraph message! I’d rather face the execution platform as my brother Louis XVI did than be mocked as I leave the Tuileries. Ridicule—its power is immense in France, something you should truly appreciate!\" The minister tried to plead for mercy, but the king interrupted, inviting Villefort, who had been silently listening, to step forward and demonstrate that knowledge can be obtained where others have failed. Villefort explained it was impossible to learn secrets hidden so carefully. The king rebuked him for saying 'impossible,' pointing out that with all the resources of his office, the minister had failed to gather intelligence from not far away, while Villefort, with none of those advantages, had succeeded. The minister glared at Villefort in resentment, and Villefort, though proud, showed humility. The king reassured M. de Blacas that his suspicions at least had merit, unlike the minister of police, who had earlier dismissed Villefort’s information. Villefort grasped the king’s meaning and, careful not to make an enemy of the police minister, modestly attributed his success to luck and devotion, asking the king not to overestimate him. The minister of police, grateful for the gesture, gave Villefort a thankful look, and Villefort realized he had secured both the king’s favor and a potential ally in the police minister."

Yet, speaking of reports, baron, what have you learned with regard to the affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques?”\n“The affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques!” exclaimed Villefort, unable to repress an exclamation. Then, suddenly pausing, he added, “Your pardon, sire, but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget, not the respect I have, for that is too deeply engraved in my heart, but the rules of etiquette.”\n“Go on, go on, sir,” replied the king; “you have today earned the right to make inquiries here.”\n“Sire,” interposed the minister of police, “I came a moment ago to give your majesty fresh information which I had obtained on this head, when your majesty’s attention was attracted by the terrible event that has occurred in the gulf, and now these facts will cease to interest your majesty.”\n“On the contrary, sir,—on the contrary,” said Louis XVIII., “this affair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which occupies our attention, and the death of General Quesnel will, perhaps, put us on the direct track of a great internal conspiracy.” At the name of General Quesnel, Villefort trembled.\n“Everything points to the conclusion, sire,” said the minister of police, “that death was not the result of suicide, as we first believed, but of assassination. General Quesnel, it appears, had just left a Bonapartist club when he disappeared. An unknown person had been with him that morning, and made an appointment with him in the Rue Saint-Jacques; unfortunately, the general’s valet, who was dressing his hair at the moment when the stranger entered, heard the street mentioned, but did not catch the number.” As the police minister related this to the king, Villefort, who looked as if his very life hung on the speaker’s lips, turned alternately red and pale. The king looked towards him.\n“Do you not think with me, M. de Villefort, that General Quesnel, whom they believed attached to the usurper, but who was really entirely devoted to me, has perished the victim of a Bonapartist ambush?”\n“It is probable, sire,” replied Villefort. “But is this all that is known?”\n“They are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with him.”\n“On his track?” said Villefort.\n“Yes, the servant has given his description. He is a man of from fifty to fifty-two years of age, dark, with black eyes covered with shaggy eyebrows, and a thick moustache. He was dressed in a blue frock-coat, buttoned up to the chin, and wore at his button-hole the rosette of an officer of the Legion of Honor. Yesterday a person exactly corresponding with this description was followed, but he was lost sight of at the corner of the Rue de la Jussienne and the Rue Coq-Héron.” Villefort leaned on the back of an armchair, for as the minister of police went on speaking he felt his legs bend under him; but when he learned that the unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who followed him, he breathed again.\n“Continue to seek for this man, sir,” said the king to the minister of police; “for if, as I am all but convinced, General Quesnel, who would have been so useful to us at this moment, has been murdered, his assassins, Bonapartists or not, shall be cruelly punished.” It required all Villefort’s coolness not to betray the terror with which this declaration of the king inspired him.",

What remains falls under the purview of the minister of war.” “Fortunately, sire,” M. de Blacas remarked, “we can rely on the army; your majesty knows how consistently reports confirm their loyalty and devotion.” “Do not speak of reports to me, duke,” the King said, “for I no longer know what trust to place in them. However, speaking of reports, baron, what intelligence have you gathered concerning the matter in the Rue Saint-Jacques?” “The affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques!” Villefort exclaimed, unable to restrain himself. He then quickly paused, adding, “My apologies, sire, but my dedication to your majesty caused me to forget—not the deep respect etched in my heart—but the rules of courtly behavior.” “Proceed, proceed, sir,” the King replied. “You have earned the right to inquire here today.” “Sire,” the minister of police interjected, “I arrived moments ago to provide your majesty with new information I had acquired on this subject, when your majesty’s attention was drawn by the terrible event in the gulf, and I assumed these facts would no longer interest your majesty.” “On the contrary, sir—on the contrary,” Louis XVIII countered, “this matter appears to me to have a clear connection with what currently occupies us, and the death of General Quesnel may perhaps set us on the direct path of a significant internal conspiracy.” At the mention of General Quesnel, Villefort trembled. “Everything indicates, sire,” the minister of police stated, “that his death was not a suicide, as we initially believed, but an assassination.

He is a man aged fifty to fifty-two, dark, with black eyes under bushy eyebrows, and a thick mustache. He wore a blue frock-coat buttoned to the chin and had an officer’s Legion of Honor rosette at his button-hole. Yesterday, a person precisely matching this description was followed, but the agent lost sight of him at the intersection of the Rue de la Jussienne and the Rue Coq-Héron.” Villefort leaned on the back of an armchair, feeling his legs weaken as the minister of police spoke. However, upon learning that the unknown individual had evaded the agent’s surveillance, he breathed a sigh of relief. “Continue the search for this man, sir,” the King instructed the minister of police, “for if, as I am almost convinced, General Quesnel, who would have been so useful to us at this moment, has been murdered, his assassins, Bonapartists or otherwise, shall be severely punished.” It required all of Villefort’s self-control not to reveal the terror the King’s declaration inspired in him.",

Would you like to know how matters have progressed? Well, I will tell you. It was thought reliance might be placed in General Quesnel; he was recommended to us from the Island of Elba; one of us went to him, and invited him to the Rue Saint-Jacques, where he would find some friends. He came there, and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving Elba, the projected landing, etc. When he had heard and comprehended all to the fullest extent, he replied that he was a royalist.

I thought he was philosophical enough to accept that politics knows no murder. In politics, my dear boy, as you well know, there are no individuals, only ideologies – no emotions, only advantages; in politics, we don't kill a man, we merely eliminate an obstacle, that's all. Would you like an update on the situation? Very well, I'll tell you. It was believed that General Quesnel could be trusted; he was recommended to us from the Island of Elba; one of our group went to him and invited him to Rue Saint-Jacques, where he would meet some associates. He came there, and the plan for leaving Elba, the proposed landing, and so on, was revealed to him. After he had heard and fully understood everything, he declared that he was a royalist. Everyone then exchanged glances – he was made to take an oath, and he did so, but with such reluctance that swearing like that truly seemed to provoke fate, and yet, despite that, the general was allowed to leave freely – absolutely unrestrained. Yet, he never returned home. What could that imply? Why, my dear fellow, it means that upon leaving us, he simply lost his way, that's all. Murder? Really, Villefort, you astonish me. You, a deputy prosecutor, basing an accusation on such flimsy premises! Did I ever say to you, when you were acting as a royalist and had one of my people executed, 'My son, you've committed a murder'? No, I said, 'Alright, sir, you've won the round; perhaps tomorrow, it will be our turn.'\"",

Why didn’t they conduct a more thorough search? They might have discovered—\"\n\"But they haven’t yet; though they’re closing in.\"\n\"That’s what they always say; I know the routine. When the police fail, they claim to be ‘on the track,’ and the government waits patiently for them eventually to admit they’ve lost the trail entirely.\"\n\"Maybe so, but this time they’ve found a body; the general has been killed, and in every country, that would be considered murder.\"\n\"You think it’s a murder? There’s no evidence of that.

Don’t fool yourself—this was murder, obvious to anyone.\"\n\"And who called it that?\"\n\"The king himself.\"\n\"The king! I would have thought he was shrewd enough to realize there’s no such thing as murder in politics. In politics, my friend, there are no individuals, just ideas and interests; you don’t kill a man, you simply remove an obstacle. Do you want to know how things unfolded? I’ll tell you. General Quesnel seemed a reliable ally, recommended from Elba. One of us met with him and invited him to the club on Rue Saint-Jacques to discuss plans to leave Elba, the landing and so on. After hearing all the details, he declared he was a royalist. Everyone looked at each other, but we swore him to secrecy anyway, though he clearly was reluctant, and we still let him go—completely free. Yet, he didn’t make it back home. What does that suggest? Simply that he lost his way leaving us, that’s all. Murder? Really, Villefort, you surprise me. For a deputy prosecutor, that’s a weak accusation. Did I ever claim, when you, as a royalist, executed one of my associates, ‘You’ve committed murder’? No, I simply said, ‘All right, you’ve won this time; perhaps our side will win tomorrow.’\""

Keep your journey a secret; do not boast of what you have come to Paris to do, or have done; return with all speed; enter Marseilles at night, and your house by the back-door, and there remain, quiet, submissive, secret, and, above all, inoffensive; for this time, I swear to you, we shall act like powerful men who know their enemies.

Go, Your Majesty, not because you are in danger – your enemy is strong enough to grant you clemency – but because it would be beneath a descendant of Saint Louis to owe his life to the man of Arcola, Marengo, and Austerlitz.’ Tell him this, Gérard.

The man you in Paris call the ‘Corsican ogre,’ who at Nevers is ‘the usurper,’ is already known as Bonaparte in Lyons and called Emperor in Grenoble. You think he is on the run, being hunted and caught, but he is moving forward as swiftly as his eagles.

Sire, you should leave France to its true master, the man who conquered it, not bought it; leave, not because you're in danger—your opponent is strong enough to spare you—but because it would be degrading for a descendant of Saint Louis to owe his life to Napoleon.’ Tell him that, Gérard—or, better yet, don't tell him anything. Keep your mission secret, don't brag about why you came to Paris or what you have done. Return home quickly, enter Marseilles discreetly at night, and slip into your house quietly. Stay there, be discreet, humble, and, most importantly, do nothing to draw attention. I assure you, this time, we will act with the power of those who know their enemies. Go now, my son—my dear Gérard; follow my advice, or if you wish, my fatherly instructions, and we will protect your position. This will be,\" Noirtier added with a smile, \"one way in which you might again save me, should the political winds shift and lift you up as I fall.

Then he turned to the various articles he had left behind him, put the black cravat and blue frock-coat at the bottom of the portmanteau, threw the hat into a dark closet, broke the cane into small bits and flung it in the fire, put on his travelling-cap, and calling his valet, checked with a look the thousand questions he was ready to ask, paid his bill, sprang into his carriage, which was ready, learned at Lyons that Bonaparte had entered Grenoble, and in the midst of the tumult which prevailed along the road, at length reached Marseilles, a prey to all the hopes and fears which enter into the heart of man with ambition and its first successes.",

Villefort, visibly upset and pale, hurried to the window, drew back the curtain, and watched as Noirtier walked past, cool and collected. Near the street corner stood a few unsavoury-looking men, potentially waiting to apprehend someone fitting Noirtier's description – a man with black whiskers, wearing a blue coat and a hat with a wide brim. Villefort remained at the window, breathless, until his father was out of sight on Rue Bussy. He then attended to the items Noirtier had left behind. He hid the black cravat and blue frock-coat at the bottom of his portmanteau, threw the hat into a dim closet, broke the cane into small pieces before tossing them into the fire, and put on his own traveling cap. Upon calling for his valet, he used a look to stifle the many questions the servant was clearly ready to ask. He paid his bill, quickly entered his waiting carriage, and learned in Lyons that Bonaparte had entered Grenoble. Traveling through the widespread commotion along the route, he finally arrived in Marseilles, consumed by the mix of hope and apprehension that ambition and its initial achievements instill in a man.",

Villefort, visibly shaken and pale, hurried to the window, moved the curtain, and watched his father, who walked calmly past a group of suspicious-looking men standing at the street corner—men who seemed possibly poised to apprehend someone matching Noirtier's appearance. Villefort watched anxiously until his father vanished down Rue Bussy. Then, Villefort methodically gathered the items he had set aside: he hid the black cravat and blue frock-coat at the bottom of his suitcase, tossed the hat into a dark closet, broke the cane into small pieces and threw it into the fire, put on his traveling cap, and, silencing his valet with a look, settled his account, leapt into his waiting carriage, and learned in Lyons that Bonaparte had arrived at Grenoble. Amid the confusion along the route, he eventually reached Marseilles, overcome by the many hopes and fears that follow ambition and the taste of initial achievement."

Everyone knows the history of the famous return from Elba, a return which was unprecedented in the past, and will probably remain without a counterpart in the future.\nLouis XVIII. made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow; the monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious foundation, and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground. Villefort, therefore, gained nothing save the king’s gratitude (which was rather likely to injure him at the present time) and the cross of the Legion of Honor, which he had the prudence not to wear, although M. de Blacas had duly forwarded the brevet.\nNapoleon would, doubtless, have deprived Villefort of his office had it not been for Noirtier, who was all powerful at court, and thus the Girondin of ’93 and the Senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had been his protector. All Villefort’s influence barely enabled him to stifle the secret Dantès had so nearly divulged. The king’s procureur alone was deprived of his office, being suspected of royalism.",

The well-known account of Napoleon's return from Elba, an event without historical parallel before or likely after, is universally recognized. Louis XVIII offered only minimal resistance to this sudden turn of events; his monarchy, which had barely been re-established, faltered on its shaky base, and with Napoleon's return, the unstable combination of old customs and modern concepts crumbled. Consequently, Villefort's only gains were the king's appreciation (which was now more likely to be a liability) and the cross of the Legion of Honor, which he wisely decided not to wear, despite receiving official notification from Mr. de Blacas. Napoleon probably would have removed Villefort from his post had it not been for Noirtier, who held considerable sway at court. Thus, the figure from the Girondin period of '93 and the Senator of 1806 ended up safeguarding the man who had recently been in a position to protect him. All of Villefort's power was just enough to keep hidden the secret that Dantès had almost disclosed. The only person dismissed from office was the king's prosecutor, due to suspicions of being loyal to the monarchy.",

The well-known history of the dramatic return from Elba occurred—a unique event without precedent and unlikely to be repeated. Louis XVIII made only a weak effort to resist this unforeseen event; the monarchy he had just rebuilt wavered on unstable ground, and at Napoleon's command, the fragile combination of old prejudices and new ideas collapsed. As a result, Villefort received nothing but the king’s thanks—which actually put him in a difficult position—and the Legion of Honor, though he wisely chose not to display it, although M. de Blacas had officially sent the certificate. Napoleon likely would have removed Villefort from his post if not for Noirtier, who held great power at court; in this way, the Girondin of 1793 and the Senator of 1806 protected the very man who had recently protected him. Thanks to his influence, Villefort just managed to suppress the secret that Dantès had nearly revealed. Only the king's procureur lost his job, being considered too sympathetic to royalists."

If the emperor remained on the throne, Gérard required a different alliance to aid his career; if Louis XVIII. returned, the influence of M. de Saint-Méran, like his own, could be vastly increased, and the marriage be still more suitable. The deputy procureur was, therefore, the first magistrate of Marseilles, when one morning his door opened, and M. Morrel was announced.",

This unrest rapidly escalated beyond mere shouting and insults to more violent attacks on royalists seen in public. As a result of this political shift, the reputable shipowner, M. Morrel, who was considered cautious or even \"moderate\" by fervent Bonaparte supporters, gained sufficient influence to advocate for Dantès. Villefort managed to retain his position, but his planned marriage was deferred, awaiting a more opportune moment. The strategic benefit of the alliance for Villefort's career depended heavily on the political outcome: a different marriage would be advantageous if the Emperor remained, whereas Louis XVIII's return would significantly boost both M. de Saint-Méran's and Villefort's influence, making the marriage even more desirable. Thus, Villefort was serving as the principal magistrate in Marseilles when M. Morrel arrived at his office one morning.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Once Napoleon had reestablished his rule and resumed issuing commands from the Tuileries—the very chamber readers are familiar with, where he found Louis XVIII’s partly used snuff-box—Marseilles immediately stirred with renewed unrest, defying the authorities. The southern city was already a hotbed of simmering discontent, and it took little provocation to turn the crowds toward more than just verbal attacks and insults against the royalists seen in the streets. Amidst this upheaval, the honorable shipowner, although not an extremely powerful man due to his cautious and somewhat timid nature—many strong Bonaparte supporters criticized Morrel for being too moderate—nevertheless gained enough influence to advocate for Dantès. Meanwhile, Villefort kept his public office, but postponed his marriage, waiting for a better moment. If Napoleon kept the throne, Gérard would need to marry differently to support his ambitions; should Louis XVIII regain power, both his and M. de Saint-Méran's status would rise, making the marriage even more advantageous. So, Villefort remained the chief magistrate in Marseilles when, one morning, M. Morrel was announced at his door."

Morrel to be admitted.\nMorrel expected Villefort would be dejected; he found him as he had found him six weeks before, calm, firm, and full of that glacial politeness, that most insurmountable barrier which separates the well-bred from the vulgar man.\nHe had entered Villefort’s office expecting that the magistrate would tremble at the sight of him; on the contrary, he felt a cold shudder all over him when he saw Villefort sitting there with his elbow on his desk, and his head leaning on his hand.

What was the other day a crime is today a title to favor.

After spending fifteen minutes reviewing papers, he ordered M. Morrel to be shown in. Morrel had anticipated finding Villefort despondent, but instead, he found him just as he had been six weeks prior: composed, resolute, and displaying that icy politeness, the most difficult barrier to overcome, which distinguishes the refined from the common person. He had entered Villefort’s office fully expecting the magistrate to show fear at his presence. Conversely, he felt a cold shiver run through him upon seeing Villefort seated with his elbow resting on the desk and his head leaning on his hand. He paused at the entrance. Villefort looked at him as if struggling to remember who he was, then after a brief pause, during which the honest shipowner nervously fiddled with his hat, Villefort inquired, 'M. Morrel, I presume?' 'Yes, sir,' Morrel replied. 'Please approach,' the magistrate instructed, with a condescending wave of his hand, 'and inform me of the reason for this visit.' 'Do you not have an idea, sir?' Morrel asked. 'Not at all; but I would be pleased to assist you if possible.' 'Everything depends on you,' said Morrel. 'Pray, explain yourself,' Villefort urged.

Morrel had expected to find Villefort in low spirits, but instead found him just as he had been six weeks earlier: calm, composed, and displaying a coldly formal politeness that clearly marked the difference between those of high breeding and those without. Morrel entered, thinking Villefort would be unsettled by his presence; instead, it was Morrel who felt uneasy, finding Villefort seated at his desk with his head resting on his hand. Morrel paused at the doorway, and Villefort looked at him as if he was struggling to remember who he was. After a short moment, while Morrel nervously turned his hat in his hands, Villefort spoke. \"M. Morrel, I presume?\" he said. \"Yes, sir,\" Morrel replied. \"Come in,\" Villefort said, gesturing for him to approach, \"and tell me what brings you here today.\" Morrel asked in return, \"You don't know, monsieur?\" Villefort answered, \"I have no idea; but if I can help you, I’d be glad to.\" \"Everything depends on you,\" said Morrel. \"Please explain,\" Villefort prompted. Gaining confidence as he spoke, Morrel reminded Villefort that, just before the emperor returned to France, he had come to plead for a young first mate from his ship who had been accused of communicating with the Island of Elba. Morrel pointed out that what had recently been considered a crime was now seen as worthy of favor. Villefort had been serving King Louis XVIII at the time and had justly refused help; now, with Napoleon in power, Villefort should offer protection.

But Morrel, disappointed in his expectations of exciting fear, was conscious only of the other’s condescension. Villefort had calculated rightly.\n“No,” said Morrel; “I am not mistaken. I have known him for ten years, the last four of which he was in my service. Do not you recollect, I came about six weeks ago to plead for clemency, as I come today to plead for justice. You received me very coldly. Oh, the royalists were very severe with the Bonapartists in those days.”\n“Monsieur,” returned Villefort, “I was then a royalist, because I believed the Bourbons not only the heirs to the throne, but the chosen of the nation. The miraculous return of Napoleon has conquered me, the legitimate monarch is he who is loved by his people.”\n“That’s right!” cried Morrel. “I like to hear you speak thus, and I augur well for Edmond from it.”\n“Wait a moment,” said Villefort, turning over the leaves of a register; “I have it—a sailor, who was about to marry a young Catalan girl. I recollect now; it was a very serious charge.”\n“How so?”\n“You know that when he left here he was taken to the Palais de Justice.”\n“Well?”\n“I made my report to the authorities at Paris, and a week after he was carried off.”\n“Carried off!” said Morrel. “What can they have done with him?”\n“Oh, he has been taken to Fenestrelles, to Pignerol, or to the Sainte-Marguérite islands. Some fine morning he will return to take command of your vessel.”\n“Come when he will, it shall be kept for him. But how is it he is not already returned? It seems to me the first care of government should be to set at liberty those who have suffered for their adherence to it.”\n“Do not be too hasty, M. Morrel,” replied Villefort. “The order of imprisonment came from high authority, and the order for his liberation must proceed from the same source; and, as Napoleon has scarcely been reinstated a fortnight, the letters have not yet been forwarded.”\n“But,” said Morrel, “is there no way of expediting all these formalities—of releasing him from arrest?”\n“There has been no arrest.”\n“How?”\n“It is sometimes essential to government to cause a man’s disappearance without leaving any traces, so that no written forms or documents may defeat their wishes.”\n“It might be so under the Bourbons, but at present——”\n“It has always been so, my dear Morrel, since the reign of Louis XIV. The emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even Louis himself, and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the register is incalculable.” Had Morrel even any suspicions, so much kindness would have dispelled them.",

I remember now; the accusation was very serious.\" \"How so?\" \"You know he was taken to the Palais de Justice after leaving here.\" \"Yes?\" \"I sent my report to the Paris authorities, and a week later he was removed.\" \"Removed!\" Morrel cried. \"What could they have done with him?\" \"Oh, he's been sent to Fenestrelles, Pignerol, or perhaps the Sainte-Marguérite islands. He'll return one fine morning to take command of your ship.\" \"Whenever he returns, the ship will be waiting. But why hasn't he come back already? It seems to me the government's first priority should be releasing those who suffered for supporting it.\" \"Don't be too hasty, Mr. Morrel,\" Villefort replied. \"The order for his imprisonment came from a high source, and the order for his release must come from the same place. Since Napoleon has only been back about two weeks, the liberation orders haven't been dispatched yet.\" \"But,\" Morrel pressed, \"isn't there a way to speed up these procedures—to get him released from arrest?\" \"There was no arrest.\" \"What?\" \"Sometimes the government finds it necessary to make someone disappear without leaving any record, so that no official forms or documents can obstruct their will.\" \"That might have happened under the Bourbons, but now—\" \"It has always been this way, my dear Morrel, since the time of Louis XIV. The emperor is even stricter with prison rules than Louis was, and the number of prisoners not on any register is immense.\" Even if Morrel had any suspicions, Villefort's apparent helpfulness would have completely removed them.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "With significant effort, Villefort tried to keep his composure. “What is his name?” he asked. “Tell me.”\n\n“Edmond Dantès.”\n\nHearing this name was harder for Villefort than facing a pistol, but he showed no reaction. \n\n“Dantès—Edmond Dantès,” he echoed.\n\n“Yes, monsieur.” Villefort opened a large register, then moved between the table and the registers, before facing Morrel.\n\n“Are you sure you’re not mistaken, monsieur?” Villefort asked, sounding perfectly at ease.\n\nIf Morrel had been more perceptive or familiar with such matters, he might have found it odd that Villefort, the king’s prosecutor, was answering directly instead of referring him to the prison officials or local authorities. However, disappointed that Villefort didn’t show any fear, Morrel only noticed the man’s courtesy, as Villefort had anticipated.\n\n“No,” said Morrel. “I’m not mistaken. I’ve known him for ten years, and he worked for me for the last four. Remember, I came about six weeks ago to ask for clemency, and now I’m back asking for justice. You were rather cold then. The royalists were quite harsh on Bonapartists at that time.”\n\n“Monsieur,” Villefort replied, “I was a royalist then because I thought the Bourbons were the rightful rulers and favored by the nation. But Napoleon’s extraordinary return has convinced me otherwise; the true ruler is the one loved by the people.”\n\n“I’m glad to hear you say that,” Morrel exclaimed. “It gives me hope for Edmond.”\n\n“Wait,” Villefort said while flipping through the register. “Here it is—a sailor, about to marry a young Catalan woman. I remember now; it was a very serious matter.”\n\n“How so?”\n\n“When he left here, he was taken to the Palais de Justice.”\n\n“Well?”\n\n“I reported the case to the authorities in Paris, and a week later he was taken away.”\n\n“Taken away!” Morrel exclaimed. “What could have happened to him?”\n\n“He might be at Fenestrelles, Pignerol, or the Sainte-Marguérite islands. One day he'll be back to captain your ship.”\n\n“Whenever he comes back, his post will be waiting. But why hasn’t he already returned? Shouldn’t the government release those who supported it as soon as possible?”\n\n“Do not be impatient, M. Morrel,” Villefort replied. “The order to imprison him came from the highest level, and only the same authority can release him. Napoleon has only just returned, so the necessary papers haven’t been sent yet.”\n\n“But,” Morrel asked, “is there no way to speed up the process and free him?”\n\n“There’s been no official arrest.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Sometimes the government needs someone to disappear without any record, so that paperwork can't undermine its aims.”\n\n“That may have happened under the Bourbons, but now—”\n\n“It has always been that way, my dear Morrel, since Louis XIV. The emperor is even stricter about prison discipline, and many prisoners' names never appear in any register.” If Morrel had any suspicions, Villefort’s reassuring manner would have put them to rest."

Morrel inquired if Villefort would handle the delivery, to which Villefort readily agreed. He claimed it was now his duty to secure Dantès' release, as it had been his duty to condemn him when he appeared guilty. By offering this help, Villefort strategically aimed to avert any potential investigation that could expose him, however unlikely such an inquiry might be. Morrel then asked how he should draft the petition. Villefort offered his seat to Morrel and instructed him to write as he dictated. Morrel expressed his thanks, and Villefort urged him to hurry, stating they had already wasted too much time. Morrel agreed, reflecting on the potential suffering Dantès was currently enduring. This thought made Villefort inwardly recoil, but he knew he was too committed to turn back; his own aspirations demanded Dantès' ruin. Villefort dictated a petition that, despite his apparent good intentions, deliberately overstated Dantès' loyalty to France, presenting him as a highly influential supporter of Napoleon's return. The document was clearly crafted to ensure the minister would order Dantès' immediate liberation upon reading it. Once the petition was finished, Villefort read it aloud.",

It is as much my responsibility to get him released now as it was to have condemned him before.\" In taking on this task, Villefort protected himself from any potential investigation that, though unlikely, would leave him vulnerable. \"How should I word my appeal to the minister?\" \"Take my seat,\" said Villefort, making space for Morrel. \"I will dictate the letter.\" \"Thank you. We must hurry—too much time has already passed.\" \"That's true,\" Morrel agreed, thinking anxiously about the suffering Dantès might currently endure. Villefort trembled at the thought but felt he had committed too far to turn back. Crushing Dantès was necessary for Villefort's own ambition. Villefort then dictated a petition in which Dantès' loyalty and actions for Napoleon were overstated, making him appear as one of Napoleon's most zealous supporters. Such a petition, Villefort believed, would guarantee Dantès' immediate release. Once finished, Villefort read the appeal aloud."

Dantès in his cell heard the noise of preparation,—sounds that at the depth where he lay would have been inaudible to any but the ear of a prisoner, who could hear the splash of the drop of water that every hour fell from the roof of his dungeon. He guessed something uncommon was passing among the living; but he had so long ceased to have any intercourse with the world, that he looked upon himself as dead.\nThe inspector visited, one after another, the cells and dungeons of several of the prisoners, whose good behavior or stupidity recommended them to the clemency of the government. He inquired how they were fed, and if they had any request to make. The universal response was, that the fare was detestable, and that they wanted to be set free.\nThe inspector asked if they had anything else to ask for. They shook their heads. What could they desire beyond their liberty? The inspector turned smilingly to the governor.\n“I do not know what reason government can assign for these useless visits; when you see one prisoner, you see all,—always the same thing,—ill fed and innocent. Are there any others?”\n“Yes; the dangerous and mad prisoners are in the dungeons.”\n“Let us visit them,” said the inspector with an air of fatigue. “We must play the farce to the end. Let us see the dungeons.”\n“Let us first send for two soldiers,” said the governor. “The prisoners sometimes, through mere uneasiness of life, and in order to be sentenced to death, commit acts of useless violence, and you might fall a victim.”\n“Take all needful precautions,” replied the inspector.",

From the depths of his cell, Dantès heard the commotion of preparations – sounds so distant that only a prisoner, whose hearing was honed to detect even the hourly drip of water from his dungeon ceiling, could have perceived them. He suspected something unusual was taking place among the world of the living. Yet, having been isolated from society for such a long time, he considered himself effectively deceased. The inspector visited the cells and dungeons of various other inmates sequentially, focusing on those whose compliance or low intelligence might have made them candidates for government mercy. He inquired about the quality of their food and whether they had any requests. The consistent reply was that the provisions were awful and they desired their freedom. When asked if they had any other wishes, they simply shook their heads, indicating they could want nothing more than to be released. The inspector then turned to the governor with a smile. 'I'm not sure why the government mandates these pointless inspections,' he remarked. 'When you've seen one prisoner, you've seen them all – always the same complaints about poor food and claims of innocence. Are there any others?' 'Yes,' the governor answered. 'The dangerous and mad prisoners are confined to the lowest dungeons.' 'Let's go see them,' the inspector said, sighing with weariness. 'We might as well see this charade through. Take me to the dungeons.' 'Let's first request two soldiers,' the governor advised. 'Occasionally, prisoners, driven by sheer desperation or seeking a death sentence, commit acts of needless violence, and you could be harmed.' 'Ensure all necessary safety measures are taken,' the inspector replied.",

In his cell, Dantès could hear the sounds of preparations—noise that, deep as he was below ground, only a prisoner could detect, much like he’d always heard the faint drip of water from his ceiling each hour. He sensed that something unusual was happening among the free, but having been out of touch with the world for so long, he regarded himself as already dead. The inspector went from cell to cell, visiting prisoners whose good conduct or lack of intelligence made them candidates for mercy from the government. He asked about their food and whether they had any requests. Nearly all complained about the terrible meals and said they wanted to be released. When the inspector asked if there was anything else they wanted, the prisoners just shook their heads—what more could they wish for but freedom? The inspector smiled at the governor and remarked, “I don’t see the point in these visits; once you’ve seen one prisoner, you’ve seen them all: always badly fed and always declaring innocence. Are there any others?” The governor replied that the most dangerous and insane prisoners were in the dungeons. “Let’s see them,” said the inspector tiredly. “We’ve got to finish this charade. Let’s visit the dungeons.” “Let’s call for two soldiers first,” the governor suggested, “Sometimes, out of desperation and a wish to be condemned to death, the prisoners commit acts of violence, and you might be harmed.” “Take whatever precautions are necessary,” agreed the inspector."

Seventeen months’ captivity to a sailor accustomed to the boundless ocean, is a worse punishment than human crime ever merited. Have pity on me, then, and ask for me, not intelligence, but a trial; not pardon, but a verdict—a trial, sir, I ask only for a trial; that, surely, cannot be denied to one who is accused!”\n“We shall see,” said the inspector; then, turning to the governor, “On my word, the poor devil touches me. You must show me the proofs against him.”\n“Certainly; but you will find terrible charges.”\n“Monsieur,” continued Dantès, “I know it is not in your power to release me; but you can plead for me—you can have me tried—and that is all I ask. Let me know my crime, and the reason why I was condemned. Uncertainty is worse than all.”\n“Go on with the lights,” said the inspector.\n“Monsieur,” cried Dantès, “I can tell by your voice you are touched with pity; tell me at least to hope.”\n“I cannot tell you that,” replied the inspector; “I can only promise to examine into your case.”\n“Oh, I am free—then I am saved!”\n“Who arrested you?”\n“M. Villefort. See him, and hear what he says.”\n“M. Villefort is no longer at Marseilles; he is now at Toulouse.”\n“I am no longer surprised at my detention,” murmured Dantès, “since my only protector is removed.”\n“Had M. de Villefort any cause of personal dislike to you?”\n“None; on the contrary, he was very kind to me.”\n“I can, then, rely on the notes he has left concerning you?”\n“Entirely.”\n“That is well; wait patiently, then.”\nDantès fell on his knees, and prayed earnestly.

Realizing he was perceived as dangerous, Dantès infused his eyes and voice with profound humility, addressing the inspector and trying to evoke sympathy. The inspector listened intently before commenting to the governor, “He’ll become religious; he’s already milder now. He’s scared and recoiled from the bayonets—madmen aren’t afraid of anything; I noted this specifically at Charenton.” Then, addressing the prisoner, he asked, “What do you want?” “I want to know my crime,” Dantès replied, “to have a trial. If I’m guilty, execute me; if innocent, free me.” “Are you getting enough food?” the inspector inquired. “I think so; I’m not sure; it’s irrelevant,” said Dantès. “What truly matters, not just to me but to the law and the king, is that an innocent man is wasting away in prison, a victim of a vile accusation, condemned to die here cursing those responsible.” The governor remarked, “You’re very meek today. You weren’t always; just recently, for instance, when you tried to kill the turnkey.” Dantès admitted, “It’s true, sir, and I apologize to him, for he’s always treated me well, but I was out of my mind.” “And you’re not anymore?” The inspector asked. “No; imprisonment has broken me—I’ve been here such a long time.” “So long? When were you arrested?” asked the inspector. “On February 28, 1815, at half-past two in the afternoon,” Dantès specified. “Today is July 30, 1816,” the inspector calculated, “—that’s only seventeen months.” “Only seventeen months,” Dantès echoed emotionally. “Oh, you cannot grasp what seventeen months in prison feels like! It’s more like seventeen ages, especially for a man who, like me, had reached the peak of his aspirations—who was on the verge of marrying the woman he adored, with a promising career ahead, only to lose everything instantly—to see his future destroyed, and remain ignorant of his fiancée’s fate and whether his elderly father is still alive! Seventeen months of confinement for a sailor used to the vast ocean is a harsher punishment than any human crime could deserve. Please, pity me, and request for me not information, but a trial; not clemency, but a verdict—a trial, sir, that is all I ask. Surely, one who is accused cannot be denied that!” “We shall see,” the inspector responded, then turned to the governor, commenting, “Honestly, the poor soul moves me. You must show me the evidence against him.” “Certainly,” the governor agreed, “but the charges are formidable.” Dantès continued, “Sir, I know you can’t release me, but you can intercede for me—you can get me a trial—and that is all I request. Let me know my crime and why I was condemned. Uncertainty is the cruelest thing.” “Bring the lights on,” the inspector directed, indicating they should move. “Sir,” Dantès cried out, “I can hear the pity in your voice; at least tell me to hope.” “I cannot promise that,” the inspector replied, “I can only pledge to look into your case.” “Oh, then I’m free—I’m saved!” Dantès exclaimed, misunderstanding. “Who arrested you?” the inspector asked. “Monsieur Villefort. See him, and hear his account.” “Monsieur Villefort is no longer in Marseilles; he is now in Toulouse.” “It makes sense why I’m still held,” Dantès murmured, “since my only advocate is gone.” “Did Monsieur de Villefort have any personal animosity towards you?” “None; quite the opposite, he treated me very kindly.” “Then I can trust the notes he left about you?” “Absolutely.” “Very well; then wait patiently.” Dantès dropped to his knees and prayed devoutly. The door closed, but this time, Dantès was left with a new companion—Hope.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "It was the inspector's first time visiting, and he wanted to assert his position. \"Let's start with this cell,\" he said. \"Certainly,\" answered the governor, signaling for the turnkey to unlock the door. At the sound of the lock and creaking hinges, Dantès, who was crouched in a corner where he could see a faint beam of light coming from a small barred window above, lifted his head. Seeing a stranger with two torch-bearing turnkeys and two soldiers—whom the governor treated with respect—Dantès realized this was his opportunity to speak to someone with authority. He immediately approached with hands clasped, prompting the soldiers to block him with their bayonets, thinking he meant harm. The inspector drew back, and Dantès sensed they viewed him as dangerous. So, making himself as humble as possible, he addressed the inspector, hoping to appeal to his sympathy.\n\nThe inspector listened, then remarked to the governor, \"He seems more docile now—he was frightened by the bayonets, unlike true madmen. I remember studying such cases at Charenton.\" Turning to Dantès, he asked, \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"I want to know my supposed crime, to be given a trial. If guilty, I should be executed; if innocent, set free.\"\n\n\"Are you fed adequately?\" the inspector asked.\n\n\"I suppose so; it doesn't matter. What matters is that an innocent person is imprisoned, possibly to die here cursing those responsible. This should concern all officers of justice.\"\n\n\"You're very humble now,\" said the governor, \"not like when you tried to attack the turnkey recently.\"\n\n\"It's true, sir. I apologize—he's been kind, but I lost my mind then.\"\n\n\"And now you are sane?\"\n\n\"Yes. This long imprisonment has subdued me.\"\n\n\"How long have you been here?\" asked the inspector.\n\n\"Since February 28th, 1815, at half-past two in the afternoon.\"\n\n\"Today is July 30th, 1816—that's just seventeen months.\"\n\n\"Seventeen months,\" Dantès replied, \"feels like centuries for a man at the height of happiness, about to be married, with a promising future—all lost in a moment, not knowing what happened to his loved ones. For a sailor used to freedom, this is the cruelest punishment. Please, I don't ask for mercy, just a fair trial. Surely, that can't be refused to one accused!\"\n\n\"We'll see,\" said the inspector. Then, to the governor, \"He moves me. Show me the evidence against him.\"\n\n\"Of course, but the charges are serious.\"\n\nDantès added, \"I know you can't free me yourself, but you can speak for me and ensure I have a trial. Just let me know what I'm accused of. Not knowing is the worst.\"\n\n\"Bring the lights,\" the inspector ordered.\n\n\"Sir,\" Dantès pleaded, \"your voice suggests you pity me. Please, let me hope.\"\n\n\"I can't promise that,\" answered the inspector, \"but I will look into your case.\"\n\n\"Then I have hope—I'm saved!\"\n\n\"Who arrested you?\"\n\n\"M. Villefort. He can tell you everything.\"\n\n\"Villefort isn't in Marseilles anymore; he's in Toulouse.\"\n\n\"No wonder I've been forgotten,\" Dantès murmured. \"My only advocate is gone.\"\n\n\"Did Villefort bear any grudge against you?\"\n\n\"None. He treated me well.\"\n\n\"So I can trust his report?\"\n\n\"Completely.\"\n\n\"Good. Wait patiently, then.\"\n\nDantès knelt and prayed with all his heart. As the door closed, he was left with a new companion—Hope."

He was drawing in this circle geometrical lines, and seemed as much absorbed in his problem as Archimedes was when the soldier of Marcellus slew him. He did not move at the sound of the door, and continued his calculations until the flash of the torches lighted up with an unwonted glare the sombre walls of his cell; then, raising his head, he perceived with astonishment the number of persons present. He hastily seized the coverlet of his bed, and wrapped it round him.\n“What is it you want?” said the inspector.\n“I, monsieur,” replied the abbé with an air of surprise,—“I want nothing.”\n“You do not understand,” continued the inspector; “I am sent here by government to visit the prison, and hear the requests of the prisoners.”\n“Oh, that is different,” cried the abbé; “and we shall understand each other, I hope.”\n“There, now,” whispered the governor, “it is just as I told you.”\n“Monsieur,” continued the prisoner, “I am the Abbé Faria, born at Rome. I was for twenty years Cardinal Spada’s secretary; I was arrested, why, I know not, toward the beginning of the year 1811; since then I have demanded my liberty from the Italian and French government.”\n“Why from the French government?”\n“Because I was arrested at Piombino, and I presume that, like Milan and Florence, Piombino has become the capital of some French department.”\n“Ah,” said the inspector, “you have not the latest news from Italy?”\n“My information dates from the day on which I was arrested,” returned the Abbé Faria; “and as the emperor had created the kingdom of Rome for his infant son, I presume that he has realized the dream of Machiavelli and Cæsar Borgia, which was to make Italy a united kingdom.”\n“Monsieur,” returned the inspector, “Providence has changed this gigantic plan you advocate so warmly.”\n“It is the only means of rendering Italy strong, happy, and independent.”\n“Very possibly; only I am not come to discuss politics, but to inquire if you have anything to ask or to complain of.”\n“The food is the same as in other prisons,—that is, very bad; the lodging is very unhealthful, but, on the whole, passable for a dungeon; but it is not that which I wish to speak of, but a secret I have to reveal of the greatest importance.”\n“We are coming to the point,” whispered the governor.\n“It is for that reason I am delighted to see you,” continued the abbé, “although you have disturbed me in a most important calculation, which, if it succeeded, would possibly change Newton’s system. Could you allow me a few words in private.”\n“What did I tell you?” said the governor.\n“You knew him,” returned the inspector with a smile.\n“What you ask is impossible, monsieur,” continued he, addressing Faria.\n“But,” said the abbé, “I would speak to you of a large sum, amounting to five millions.”\n“The very sum you named,” whispered the inspector in his turn.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The governor asked if the inspector wished to immediately consult the register or proceed to the next cell. The inspector replied that they should visit all of them, confessing that if he went up the stairs now, he wouldn't have the courage to come down later. The governor remarked that the upcoming prisoner was different from the previous one, whose apparent sanity was more distressing than this man's supposed madness. When asked about his delusion, the governor explained that the man believed he possessed immense wealth. Each year of his imprisonment, he had offered the government an increasing sum for his freedom: one million the first year, two the second, three the third, and so on. Now in his fifth year, he would likely request a private meeting to offer five million. The inspector found this fascinating and inquired about his name. The governor replied, 'The Abbé Faria.' The inspector noted, 'No. 27,' and the governor instructed the turnkey, Antoine, to unlock the door. Antoine complied, and the inspector peered with interest into the room of the 'mad abbé,' as the prisoner was commonly known. In the center of the cell, a man sat within a circle drawn with a piece of plaster from the wall. His clothes were ragged, barely covering him. He was engrossed in drawing geometrical figures inside the circle, appearing as deeply absorbed in his problem as Archimedes was when killed by a soldier. He remained still despite the door opening, continuing his calculations until the bright light of the torches unusually illuminated the dark walls of his cell. Raising his head, he seemed surprised by the number of people present. He quickly grabbed his bedcover and wrapped it around himself. The inspector asked what he wanted. The abbé, appearing surprised, replied that he wanted nothing. The inspector clarified that he had been sent by the government to inspect the prison and hear the prisoners' requests. 'Oh, that changes things,' cried the abbé, 'and I hope we will understand each other.' The governor quietly commented, 'Just as I predicted.' The prisoner continued, 'Monsieur, I am the Abbé Faria, born in Rome. I served as Cardinal Spada's secretary for twenty years. I was arrested for reasons unknown to me around the beginning of 1811. Since then, I have sought my release from both the Italian and French governments.' The inspector asked why he approached the French government. 'Because I was arrested at Piombino,' the abbé explained, 'and I assume that, like Milan and Florence, Piombino has become the capital of a French department.' 'Ah,' said the inspector, 'you are not up-to-date on the latest news from Italy?' The Abbé Faria replied, 'My information is current as of the day I was arrested. Since the emperor had created the kingdom of Rome for his infant son, I presumed he had achieved Machiavelli and Cesare Borgia's goal of unifying Italy into a single kingdom.' 'Monsieur,' the inspector responded, 'Providence has altered this immense plan you so strongly advocate.' 'It is the only way to make Italy strong, happy, and independent,' the abbé asserted. 'Perhaps,' said the inspector, 'but I am here to discuss if you have requests or complaints, not politics.' The abbé stated, 'The food is the usual prison fare, which is poor. The living conditions are unhealthy but acceptable for a dungeon. However, that is not what I wish to discuss. I have a secret of the utmost importance to reveal.' The governor whispered, 'We are getting to the point.' The abbé continued, 'That is why I am delighted to see you, even though you interrupted a crucial calculation which, if successful, might alter Newton's system. Could you grant me a moment in private?' 'What did I tell you?' the governor said to the inspector. The inspector, smiling, replied, 'You certainly knew him.' Turning back to Faria, he stated, 'What you ask is impossible, monsieur.' The abbé persisted, 'But I wish to speak to you about a large sum, amounting to five million.' 'Exactly the sum you mentioned,' the inspector murmured back to the governor.",

His insanity is less disturbing than the previous one's apparently rational behavior.\" \n\"What is his delusion?\" \n\"He believes he owns a huge fortune. In his first year here, he offered the government a million francs for his freedom, then two million the next year, three the following, and so on. He's been imprisoned five years now, so he'll probably ask to speak to you privately and promise you five million.\" \n\"How interesting! What is his name?\" \n\"The Abbé Faria.\" \n\"Number 27,\" noted the inspector. \n\"This is the cell; open it, Antoine.\" \nThe turnkey did as instructed, and the inspector peered curiously into the room of the \"mad abbé,\" as he was often called. \nIn the middle of the room, sitting within a circle he'd drawn using a piece of plaster from the wall, was a man whose clothes were in tatters, barely covering him. He was drawing geometric shapes in the circle, completely focused on his work like Archimedes when he was killed by a Roman soldier. He didn't react to the door opening, continuing his calculations until the torchlight briefly illuminated his gloomy cell. Then, on noticing the crowd, he quickly wrapped his bedcover around himself. \n\"What do you want?\" the inspector asked. \n\"Me, monsieur?\" the abbé replied, surprised. \"I want nothing.\" \n\"Let me explain,\" said the inspector. \"The government sent me to inspect the prison and hear the prisoners' requests.\" \n\"Ah, that's different,\" the abbé exclaimed. \"Perhaps we can understand each other then.\" \n\"See,\" whispered the governor, \"just as I told you.\" \n\"Monsieur,\" the prisoner said, \"I am the Abbé Faria, born in Rome. I served as Cardinal Spada's secretary for twenty years. I was arrested, though I don't know why, early in 1811. Since then I have appealed to both the Italian and French governments for my release.\" \n\"Why the French government?\" \n\"Because I was detained at Piombino, which I assume, like Milan and Florence, is now the capital of a French department.\" \n\"You haven't heard Italy's latest news?\" the inspector observed. \n\"My knowledge ends the day I was arrested,\" Abbé Faria answered. \"At that time, the emperor had established the Kingdom of Rome for his young son, so I assumed he had accomplished Machiavelli and Cæsar Borgia's ambition to unify Italy.\" \n\"Monsieur,\" the inspector replied, \"Providence has thwarted that grand plan you support.\" \n\"It's the only way to make Italy strong, happy, and independent,\" the abbé insisted. \n\"Maybe so, but I'm not here to talk politics. I'm just asking if you have any requests or complaints.\" \n\"The food is as bad here as in other prisons, the cell is unhealthy though tolerable for a dungeon—but that's not what I wish to discuss. I have a secret to reveal of utmost importance.\" \n\"Now we're getting somewhere,\" the governor whispered. \n\"That's why I'm pleased to see you,\" continued the abbé, \"though you've interrupted a calculation that, if successful, could have challenged Newton's system. May I speak with you in private?\" \n\"I told you so,\" murmured the governor. \n\"You know him well,\" the inspector replied, smiling. \n\"That isn't possible,\" he said to Faria. \n\"But I want to discuss a very large sum—five million,\" the abbé insisted. \n\"Exactly as you predicted,\" the inspector whispered back."

Had not government better profit by it? I will offer six millions, and I will content myself with the rest, if they will only give me my liberty.”\n“On my word,” said the inspector in a low tone, “had I not been told beforehand that this man was mad, I should believe what he says.”\n“I am not mad,” replied Faria, with that acuteness of hearing peculiar to prisoners. “The treasure I speak of really exists, and I offer to sign an agreement with you, in which I promise to lead you to the spot where you shall dig; and if I deceive you, bring me here again,—I ask no more.”\nThe governor laughed. “Is the spot far from here?”\n“A hundred leagues.”\n“It is not ill-planned,” said the governor. “If all the prisoners took it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues, and their guardians consented to accompany them, they would have a capital chance of escaping.”\n“The scheme is well known,” said the inspector; “and the abbé’s plan has not even the merit of originality.”\nThen turning to Faria, “I inquired if you are well fed?” said he.\n“Swear to me,” replied Faria, “to free me if what I tell you prove true, and I will stay here while you go to the spot.”\n“Are you well fed?” repeated the inspector.\n“Monsieur, you run no risk, for, as I told you, I will stay here; so there is no chance of my escaping.”\n“You do not reply to my question,” replied the inspector impatiently.\n“Nor you to mine,” cried the abbé. “You will not accept my gold; I will keep it for myself. You refuse me my liberty; God will give it me.” And the abbé, casting away his coverlet, resumed his place, and continued his calculations.\n“What is he doing there?” said the inspector.\n“Counting his treasures,” replied the governor.\nFaria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt. They went out. The turnkey closed the door behind them.\n“He was wealthy once, perhaps?” said the inspector.\n“Or dreamed he was, and awoke mad.”\n“After all,” said the inspector, “if he had been rich, he would not have been here.”\nSo the matter ended for the Abbé Faria.

This fortune will be wasted. Wouldn't it be better for the government to benefit? I offer six million, and I will accept the remainder, provided they grant me my liberty.\" The inspector whispered, \"Honestly, had I not been told previously that this man was insane, I might believe his words.\" \"I am not insane,\" Faria replied, his exceptionally acute prisoner's hearing catching the remark. \"The treasure I mention truly exists, and I propose to sign a contract with you, promising to guide you to the place where you can dig; if I have deceived you, just bring me back here\bI ask for nothing more.\" The governor chuckled. \"Is the location far from here?\" \"A hundred leagues.\" \"That's not a bad strategy,\" the governor remarked. \"If all prisoners decided to travel a hundred leagues, and their guards agreed to go along, they'd have an excellent chance of escaping.\" The inspector commented, \"That plan is widely known; and the abbé's proposal lacks any originality.\" He then turned to Faria, saying, \"I inquired if you are being adequately fed?\" \"Swear to me,\" Faria insisted, \"to release me if my account proves accurate, and I will stay here while you visit the site.\" \"Are you being adequately fed?\" the inspector repeated. \"Sir, you face no risk, for, as I told you, I will remain here; there is no possibility of my escaping.\" \"You are not answering my question,\" the inspector said impatiently. \"Nor are you answering mine!\" the abbé exclaimed. \"You will not accept my gold; I will keep it. You deny me my freedom; God will grant it to me.\" And the abbé, discarding his blanket, returned to his position and resumed his calculations. \"What is he doing there?\" asked the inspector. \"Counting his fortunes,\" the governor answered. Faria responded to this jab with a look of profound disdain. They exited. The guard locked the door behind them. \"Perhaps he was wealthy at one time?\" the inspector speculated. \"Or he dreamt he was, and lost his mind upon waking.\" \"After all,\" the inspector concluded, \"if he had truly been rich, he wouldn't be held here.\" Thus, the matter concluded for Abbé Faria. He stayed in his cell, and this visit only served to strengthen the conviction of his madness.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As the inspector prepared to leave, Faria tried to convince him that it wasn’t necessary to speak in private; the governor could stay if they wished. The governor remarked that he already knew what Faria wanted to discuss—it was his alleged treasure. Faria, with a determined look, confirmed that was the subject. The governor then informed the inspector that he had heard Faria’s story repeatedly over the past several years. Faria replied that the governor was like the people in the Bible who could not see or hear the truth even when it was right before them. The inspector told Faria that the government didn’t need his treasure, implying he should keep it until he was freed. Excited, Faria grabbed the inspector’s hand and pleaded, asking what would happen if he died in prison and the treasure went unfound. He offered to give the government six million if they would release him, saying he would be happy with the rest. The inspector, whispering, noted that if he hadn’t been told Faria was mad, he might have believed him. Faria, overhearing, insisted he was sane and the treasure was real, and he offered to sign a contract promising to lead them to its location, agreeing to be returned to prison if he was lying. The governor laughed about the location being a hundred leagues away and joked that all prisoners would want to travel that far if allowed. They both dismissed the notion, with the inspector noting the plan wasn’t even original. Changing the subject, the inspector asked if Faria was well fed. Faria begged again for release if his story proved true, promising to stay behind so they would risk nothing. The inspector impatiently repeated his question about Faria’s food, but Faria pointed out that his own requests were being ignored. He said that if his gold was refused, he would keep it, and if denied liberty, God would grant it to him. He threw aside his blanket and returned to his calculations. When the inspector asked what Faria was doing, the governor sarcastically said he was counting his treasures. Faria responded with a contemptuous look as the men left and the door was shut. Outside, the inspector wondered if Faria had once been rich, and the governor speculated perhaps he had only dreamed of it and gone insane. The inspector concluded that if Faria ever had wealth, he would not be in prison now. Thus, Faria’s request was ignored, and the visit only strengthened their belief that he was mad."

However, modern kings, limited by what is merely probable, lack both the courage and the desire for such acts. They fear those who might overhear their commands and those who scrutinize their actions. Unlike rulers of the past who believed themselves descended from Jupiter and protected by birthright, today's monarchs are not immune from consequence. It has always been against the policy of authoritarian governments to let those they have persecuted reappear publicly. Similar to how the Inquisition rarely showed its victims with bodies twisted and flesh torn by torture, madness is kept concealed in its cell. If the afflicted person must leave, they are sent to a grim hospital where the doctor, receiving a damaged individual from the jailer, pays no attention to the man or his mind. Abbé Faria's madness itself, a result of his imprisonment, sentenced him to indefinite captivity. The inspector honored his promise to Dantès; he checked the record and found the following entry about him: Edmond Dantès: A fervent supporter of Bonaparte; played a significant role in the return from Elba. Extreme caution and vigilance required. This note was in different handwriting, indicating it was added after his initial detention. The inspector could not dispute this charge; he simply wrote, 'Nothing to be done,' signifying that no action could be taken to help Dantès.",

However, modern monarchs, confined by what is plausible, lack both the courage and inclination to do so. They are intimidated by those who oversee their commands and actions. In the past, kings considered themselves the descendants of gods and saw themselves as protected by their birthright; now, they no longer possess this invincibility. Absolute rulers have always avoided letting the targets of their oppression resurface. The Inquisition, for example, seldom exposed those it tortured to the public, hiding their broken bodies and suffering. So, too, is insanity kept out of sight in its cell, and if released, the afflicted are sent to shadowy asylums where doctors, guided only by the guards’ reports, see nothing but ruined minds and bodies. This is what happened to Abbé Faria, whose madness in prison consigned him to lifelong imprisonment. The inspector kept his promise to Dantès and reviewed the records, discovering this note: \"Edmond Dantès: Ardent Bonapartist; actively aided the return from Elba. Must be watched and secured at all times.\" The handwriting was not like the others, indicating it had been added after his arrest.

He was sustained at first by that pride of conscious innocence which is the sequence to hope; then he began to doubt his own innocence, which justified in some measure the governor’s belief in his mental alienation; and then, relaxing his sentiment of pride, he addressed his supplications, not to God, but to man. God is always the last resource. Unfortunates, who ought to begin with God, do not have any hope in him till they have exhausted all other means of deliverance.\nDantès asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another, even if it were darker and deeper, for a change, however disadvantageous, was still a change, and would afford him some amusement. He entreated to be allowed to walk about, to have fresh air, books, and writing materials. His requests were not granted, but he went on asking all the same. He accustomed himself to speaking to the new jailer, although the latter was, if possible, more taciturn than the old one; but still, to speak to a man, even though mute, was something. Dantès spoke for the sake of hearing his own voice; he had tried to speak when alone, but the sound of his voice terrified him.\nOften, before his captivity, Dantès’ mind had revolted at the idea of assemblages of prisoners, made up of thieves, vagabonds, and murderers. He now wished to be amongst them, in order to see some other face besides that of his jailer; he sighed for the galleys, with the infamous costume, the chain, and the brand on the shoulder. The galley-slaves breathed the fresh air of heaven, and saw each other. They were very happy.\nHe besought the jailer one day to let him have a companion, were it even the mad abbé. The jailer, though rough and hardened by the constant sight of so much suffering, was yet a man. At the bottom of his heart he had often had a feeling of pity for this unhappy young man who suffered so; and he laid the request of number 34 before the governor; but the latter sapiently imagined that Dantès wished to conspire or attempt an escape, and refused his request. Dantès had exhausted all human resources, and he then turned to God.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "As a prisoner experiencing uncertainty, Dantès went through a range of emotional torments. Initially, he was buoyed by the self-assurance that comes with knowing one is innocent, a feeling that follows from hope. However, he then began to question his own blamelessness, which somewhat validated the governor's suspicion of his mental instability. Letting go of his pride, he started directing his appeals not towards God, but towards other people. God is typically the final refuge. Unfortunate individuals, who should ideally turn to God first, only find hope in divine intervention after they have exhausted all other possibilities for liberation. Dantès requested a transfer from his current cell to a different one, even if it was more confined or darker, believing that any alteration, regardless of how unfavorable, was still a change and would offer some distraction. He begged for permission to exercise, breathe fresh air, and access books and writing materials. His pleas were denied, but he continued to make them nonetheless. He made an effort to converse with the new jailer, who was perhaps even less talkative than the previous one. Still, having a conversation with a human, even a silent one, felt significant. Dantès spoke primarily to hear the sound of his own voice; attempting to speak when entirely alone had frightened him. Before his imprisonment, Dantès had often felt repulsed by the idea of groups of prisoners, comprised of thieves, drifters, and murderers. Now, he desperately wished to be among them just to see faces other than his jailer's. He yearned for the life of the galleys, complete with the infamous uniform, the chains, and the branded mark on the shoulder. The galley-slaves, at least, had access to open air and could see one another. He considered them fortunate. One day, he implored the jailer to allow him a companion, even if it was the so-called mad abbé. Despite being toughened by the constant exposure to suffering, the jailer retained a spark of humanity. Deep down, he had often felt compassion for this suffering young man. Consequently, he presented prisoner number 34's request to the governor. However, the governor shrewdly suspected that Dantès was planning a conspiracy or an escape attempt and refused his request. Having depleted all available human means of assistance, Dantès finally turned his hopes towards God.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Dantès experienced every kind of anguish that a prisoner awaiting his fate could endure. At first, his sense of his own innocence gave him hope and pride. But soon, he even started doubting himself, making the governor’s suspicion of his sanity somewhat understandable. As his pride faded, Dantès started begging not for God’s help, but for help from people. People in misery often only turn to God after every other hope is gone, even though they ought to do so first. Dantès requested to be moved to another cell, no matter how much worse it was, simply to have a change. He asked for privileges like walking outside, getting fresh air, books, and writing materials, but all these were denied—though he continued to ask. He started talking to his new guard, even though this guard was friendlier, barely spoke at all; still, having someone to talk to, even one who wouldn’t respond, meant something. Speaking just to hear his own voice was more comforting than silence, although at first, even his own voice disturbed him when he was alone. Before being imprisoned, Dantès would have been horrified at the idea of being among murderers and thieves, but now he yearned for any company other than just his jailer; he even found himself wishing to be a galley-slave, wearing the marks of infamy—at least those prisoners could see each other and breathe fresh air, which seemed a kind of happiness. One day, he begged the guard for any companion at all, even the mad abbé. The jailer, hardened by suffering around him, still felt pity for Dantès and took his request to the governor. But the governor, suspecting the request was a plot to escape or conspire, refused. Having exhausted every hope from other people, Dantès at last turned to God."

He prayed, and prayed aloud, no longer terrified at the sound of his own voice, for he fell into a sort of ecstasy. He laid every action of his life before the Almighty, proposed tasks to accomplish, and at the end of every prayer introduced the entreaty oftener addressed to man than to God: “Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us.” Yet in spite of his earnest prayers, Dantès remained a prisoner.\nThen gloom settled heavily upon him. Dantès was a man of great simplicity of thought, and without education; he could not, therefore, in the solitude of his dungeon, traverse in mental vision the history of the ages, bring to life the nations that had perished, and rebuild the ancient cities so vast and stupendous in the light of the imagination, and that pass before the eye glowing with celestial colors in Martin’s Babylonian pictures. He could not do this, he whose past life was so short, whose present so melancholy, and his future so doubtful. Nineteen years of light to reflect upon in eternal darkness! No distraction could come to his aid; his energetic spirit, that would have exalted in thus revisiting the past, was imprisoned like an eagle in a cage. He clung to one idea—that of his happiness, destroyed, without apparent cause, by an unheard-of fatality; he considered and reconsidered this idea, devoured it (so to speak), as the implacable Ugolino devours the skull of Archbishop Roger in the Inferno of Dante.\nRage supplanted religious fervor. Dantès uttered blasphemies that made his jailer recoil with horror, dashed himself furiously against the walls of his prison, wreaked his anger upon everything, and chiefly upon himself, so that the least thing,—a grain of sand, a straw, or a breath of air that annoyed him, led to paroxysms of fury. Then the letter that Villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind, and every line gleamed forth in fiery letters on the wall like the mene, mene, tekel upharsin of Belshazzar. He told himself that it was the enmity of man, and not the vengeance of Heaven, that had thus plunged him into the deepest misery. He consigned his unknown persecutors to the most horrible tortures he could imagine, and found them all insufficient, because after torture came death, and after death, if not repose, at least the boon of unconsciousness.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "All the devout thoughts he had long neglected resurfaced. He remembered the prayers his mother had taught him, finding profound meaning in every word, unlike during times of prosperity when prayers seemed like mere recitations. Only in misfortune does the suffering individual truly grasp the significance of the sacred language used to implore divine mercy. He prayed, even aloud now, no longer afraid of his own voice, entering a state of near ecstasy. He reviewed his entire life before God, committed to future tasks, and concluded each prayer with an appeal more often directed at people than the divine: \"Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.\" Yet, despite his heartfelt supplications, Dantès remained incarcerated. Deep despair then overwhelmed him. Dantès possessed a simple mind and lacked formal education. Consequently, in his isolated cell, he couldn't mentally travel through history, resurrect vanished civilizations, or reconstruct immense ancient cities in his imagination, seeing them vivid and glowing as depicted in Martin’s paintings of Babylon. This was beyond him, a man whose past was brief, present sorrowful, and future uncertain. He had only nineteen years of past light to contemplate in perpetual darkness. No mental escape was possible; his dynamic spirit, which would have found joy in revisiting the past, was confined like a caged eagle. He fixated on one thought: the destruction of his happiness, caused by an inexplicable stroke of fate, without apparent reason. He dwelled on this idea incessantly, metaphorically consuming it, much like the unforgiving Ugolino gnaws on Archbishop Ruggieri's skull in Dante's Inferno. Religious devotion was replaced by intense fury. Dantès uttered blasphemies that horrified his jailer, violently threw himself against the prison walls, unleashing his rage on everything, especially himself. Even the smallest irritations—a grain of sand, a piece of straw, or a slight draft—triggered violent outbursts. Then, the letter Villefort had shown him came back to mind, each line appearing in fiery letters on the wall, like Belshazzar’s ominous writing: mene, mene, tekel upharsin. He concluded that his profound misery was the result of human hostility, not divine retribution. He wished the most terrible tortures imaginable upon his unknown tormentors, but found all such ideas inadequate, because after torture came death, and after death, if not peace, then at least the blessing of unconsciousness.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "All the religious thoughts that Dantès had long neglected now returned to him; he remembered the prayers his mother had taught him, but now each phrase held new significance for him. While life was good, prayer had seemed little more than empty words, but now, faced with suffering, he finally grasped the profound meaning behind those words as he pleaded for divine mercy. He prayed aloud, unafraid of hearing his own voice echoing back, and slipped into a kind of trance. He recounted every deed of his life to God, made promises to do better, and repeatedly pleaded for forgiveness, echoing the familiar entreaty: “Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.” Despite his sincerity, Dantès remained imprisoned.\n\nDespair soon overcame him. Lacking formal education and being a straightforward thinker, Dantès could not distract himself by recalling the grand sweep of history, imagining lost civilizations, or rebuilding ancient cities in his mind the way a scholar or a person of vast imagination might. All he had was the brief, bright period of his life to brood over, surrounded now by unending darkness. No distraction was possible; his intense spirit, which might have found solace in reflection, was now as trapped as a caged eagle. He fixated on one overwhelming thought—that his happiness had been senselessly destroyed by some unimaginable twist of fate. He obsessed over this idea, turning it over and over in his mind, much like Dante’s Ugolino gnawed the skull of his enemy in the Inferno.\n\nHis devotion gave way to fury. Dantès began shouting curses so shocking that they frightened his jailer; he hurled himself in anger against his cell walls, lashing out at anything he could, especially himself, becoming violently upset even at the smallest annoyances. The letter Villefort had shown him haunted him, each line of it burning in his memory like the fateful words written on Belshazzar’s wall. He became convinced that it was men’s malice—not divine justice—that had condemned him. He imagined the worst torments for his unknown enemies, but even these seemed inadequate because death, after all, brings either rest or oblivion."

Unhappy he, who, on the brink of misfortune, broods over ideas like these!\nBefore him is a dead sea that stretches in azure calm before the eye; but he who unwarily ventures within its embrace finds himself struggling with a monster that would drag him down to perdition. Once thus ensnared, unless the protecting hand of God snatch him thence, all is over, and his struggles but tend to hasten his destruction. This state of mental anguish is, however, less terrible than the sufferings that precede or the punishment that possibly will follow. There is a sort of consolation at the contemplation of the yawning abyss, at the bottom of which lie darkness and obscurity.\nEdmond found some solace in these ideas. All his sorrows, all his sufferings, with their train of gloomy spectres, fled from his cell when the angel of death seemed about to enter. Dantès reviewed his past life with composure, and, looking forward with terror to his future existence, chose that middle line that seemed to afford him a refuge.\n“Sometimes,” said he, “in my voyages, when I was a man and commanded other men, I have seen the heavens overcast, the sea rage and foam, the storm arise, and, like a monstrous bird, beating the two horizons with its wings. Then I felt that my vessel was a vain refuge, that trembled and shook before the tempest. Soon the fury of the waves and the sight of the sharp rocks announced the approach of death, and death then terrified me, and I used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a sailor to struggle against the wrath of God. But I did so because I was happy, because I had not courted death, because to be cast upon a bed of rocks and seaweed seemed terrible, because I was unwilling that I, a creature made for the service of God, should serve for food to the gulls and ravens. But now it is different; I have lost all that bound me to life, death smiles and invites me to repose; I die after my own manner, I die exhausted and broken-spirited, as I fall asleep when I have paced three thousand times round my cell,—that is thirty thousand steps, or about ten leagues.”\nNo sooner had this idea taken possession of him than he became more composed, arranged his couch to the best of his power, ate little and slept less, and found existence almost supportable, because he felt that he could throw it off at pleasure, like a worn-out garment. Two methods of self-destruction were at his disposal. He could hang himself with his handkerchief to the window bars, or refuse food and die of starvation. But the first was repugnant to him. Dantès had always entertained the greatest horror of pirates, who are hung up to the yard-arm; he would not die by what seemed an infamous death. He resolved to adopt the second, and began that day to carry out his resolve.\nNearly four years had passed away; at the end of the second he had ceased to mark the lapse of time. Dantès said, “I wish to die,” and had chosen the manner of his death, and fearful of changing his mind, he had taken an oath to die. “When my morning and evening meals are brought,” thought he, “I will cast them out of the window, and they will think that I have eaten them.”",

How unfortunate is the person who, facing misfortune, dwells on such thoughts! Before them lies a calm-looking sea, but anyone who unwisely enters it will find themselves battling a monster that seeks to drag them down to ruin. Once caught, only God's protective hand can rescue them; otherwise, any struggle merely hastens their destruction. Yet, this state of mental distress is less terrifying than the sufferings that came before or the potential punishment that might follow. There is a certain solace in contemplating the dark, deep abyss that lies ahead. Edmond found some comfort in these ideas. All his sorrows and sufferings, with their gloomy companions, vanished from his cell as the prospect of death seemed imminent. Dantès reviewed his past life with tranquility and, looking forward with dread to his future, chose suicide as a middle ground that offered refuge. He reflected, \"Sometimes during my voyages, when I was free and commanded others, I saw the sky darken, the sea churn and foam, and a storm arise, like a giant bird beating the horizon with its wings. Then, I felt my ship was a fragile shelter, trembling against the tempest. Soon, the violent waves and the sight of sharp rocks signaled the approach of death, and death terrified me then. I used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a sailor to fight against what seemed God's anger. But I did this because I was happy, because I had not invited death, because being thrown onto rocks and seaweed seemed dreadful, and because I, a creature made for God's service, was unwilling to become food for gulls and ravens. But now, it is different; I have lost everything that bound me to life, death smiles and beckons me to rest. I will die my own way, exhausted and defeated, just as I fall asleep after pacing three thousand times around my cell—that's thirty thousand steps, about ten leagues.\" As soon as this thought settled in his mind, he became calmer. He tidied his bed as best he could, ate little, slept less, and found existence almost bearable because he felt he could end it whenever he wished, like shedding an old garment. He had two potential methods of self-destruction. He could hang himself with his handkerchief from the window bars, or he could refuse food and die of starvation. The first method repulsed him. Dantès had always intensely disliked pirates who were hanged from the yardarm; he refused to die by such a seemingly infamous method. He decided on the second and began that day to carry out his decision. Nearly four years had passed; after the second year, he had stopped tracking the passage of time. Dantès said, \"I wish to die,\" and had chosen his method of death, and fearing he might change his mind, he had sworn an oath to die. He thought, \"When my morning and evening meals are brought, I will throw them out the window, and they will think I have eaten them.\"",

Woe to the person who, facing misfortune, succumbs to such thoughts! Ahead lies an apparently calm and serene dead sea, but one who steps into it will find themselves grappling with a creature that seeks to pull them into ruin. Once ensnared, unless rescued by the hand of God, all is lost and any struggle only brings about a quicker demise. Yet, this particular anguish of spirit is somewhat less than both the previous torments or what might come after. There is a strange comfort in gazing into the abyss, with its underlying darkness and mystery. Edmond found a measure of relief in these musings. All his pain and suffering, with their host of dark images, departed from his cell whenever he felt that death's messenger was drawing near. He calmly reflected on his past and, dreading the future, settled on a middle path that seemed to offer shelter. \"There were times,\" he said, \"on my voyages as a commanding man, when the sky darkened, the sea stormed and frothed, and storms soared like monstrous creatures. Then it felt as though my ship, trembling in the tempest, was a frail refuge. Confronted by furious seas and menacing rocks, the approach of death terrified me, and I did all I could as both man and sailor to defy God's wrath, because then I was happy, not seeking death, unwilling to become food for birds. But now things have changed; I have lost every attachment to life. Death appears inviting, promising rest. I would die on my own terms, from weariness and hopelessness, as peacefully as one dozes off from exhaustion after endlessly circling my cell—thirty thousand steps, or about ten leagues.\" Once this thought gripped him, Edmond felt more tranquil, made his bed as best he could, ate little, slept even less, and found life almost bearable, knowing he could end it at his choosing, like discarding worn clothes. He had two options for ending his life: by hanging himself with a handkerchief or starving himself. He rejected the first option, revolted by the idea, as he found the death of pirates—hung from the yard-arm—especially abhorrent. He decided to starve himself and began immediately. Almost four years had gone by; after two years, Edmond stopped keeping track of time. He resolved to die, choosing how to do so, and, fearing he might reconsider, vowed to follow through: \"When my daily meals arrive,\" he thought, \"I'll throw them out the window, so they will believe I have eaten them.\""

Nothing but the recollection of his oath gave him strength to proceed. Hunger made viands once repugnant, now acceptable; he held the plate in his hand for an hour at a time, and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat, of tainted fish, of black and mouldy bread. It was the last yearning for life contending with the resolution of despair; then his dungeon seemed less sombre, his prospects less desperate. He was still young—he was only four or five-and-twenty—he had nearly fifty years to live. What unforseen events might not open his prison door, and restore him to liberty? Then he raised to his lips the repast that, like a voluntary Tantalus, he refused himself; but he thought of his oath, and he would not break it. He persisted until, at last, he had not sufficient strength to rise and cast his supper out of the loophole. The next morning he could not see or hear; the jailer feared he was dangerously ill. Edmond hoped he was dying.\nThus the day passed away. Edmond felt a sort of stupor creeping over him which brought with it a feeling almost of content; the gnawing pain at his stomach had ceased; his thirst had abated; when he closed his eyes he saw myriads of lights dancing before them like the will-o’-the-wisps that play about the marshes. It was the twilight of that mysterious country called Death!\nSuddenly, about nine o’clock in the evening, Edmond heard a hollow sound in the wall against which he was lying.\nSo many loathsome animals inhabited the prison, that their noise did not, in general, awake him; but whether abstinence had quickened his faculties, or whether the noise was really louder than usual, Edmond raised his head and listened. It was a continual scratching, as if made by a huge claw, a powerful tooth, or some iron instrument attacking the stones.\nAlthough weakened, the young man’s brain instantly responded to the idea that haunts all prisoners—liberty! It seemed to him that heaven had at length taken pity on him, and had sent this noise to warn him on the very brink of the abyss. Perhaps one of those beloved ones he had so often thought of was thinking of him, and striving to diminish the distance that separated them.\nNo, no, doubtless he was deceived, and it was but one of those dreams that forerun death!\nEdmond still heard the sound. It lasted nearly three hours; he then heard a noise of something falling, and all was silent.\nSome hours afterwards it began again, nearer and more distinct. Edmond was intensely interested. Suddenly the jailer entered.\nFor a week since he had resolved to die, and during the four days that he had been carrying out his purpose, Edmond had not spoken to the attendant, had not answered him when he inquired what was the matter with him, and turned his face to the wall when he looked too curiously at him; but now the jailer might hear the noise and put an end to it, and so destroy a ray of something like hope that soothed his last moments.\nThe jailer brought him his breakfast. Dantès raised himself up and began to talk about everything; about the bad quality of the food, about the coldness of his dungeon, grumbling and complaining, in order to have an excuse for speaking louder, and wearying the patience of his jailer, who out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread for his prisoner.\nFortunately, he fancied that Dantès was delirious; and placing the food on the rickety table, he withdrew. Edmond listened, and the sound became more and more distinct.\n“There can be no doubt about it,” thought he; “it is some prisoner who is striving to obtain his freedom. Oh, if I were only there to help him!”\nSuddenly another idea took possession of his mind, so used to misfortune, that it was scarcely capable of hope—the idea that the noise was made by workmen the governor had ordered to repair the neighboring dungeon.\nIt was easy to ascertain this; but how could he risk the question? It was easy to call his jailer’s attention to the noise, and watch his countenance as he listened; but might he not by this means destroy hopes far more important than the short-lived satisfaction of his own curiosity? Unfortunately, Edmond’s brain was still so feeble that he could not bend his thoughts to anything in particular. He saw but one means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his judgment. He turned his eyes towards the soup which the jailer had brought, rose, staggered towards it, raised the vessel to his lips, and drank off the contents with a feeling of indescribable pleasure.\nHe had the resolution to stop with this. He had often heard that shipwrecked persons had died through having eagerly devoured too much food. Edmond replaced on the table the bread he was about to devour, and returned to his couch—he did not wish to die. He soon felt that his ideas became again collected—he could think, and strengthen his thoughts by reasoning. Then he said to himself:\n“I must put this to the test, but without compromising anybody. If it is a workman, I need but knock against the wall, and he will cease to work, in order to find out who is knocking, and why he does so; but as his occupation is sanctioned by the governor, he will soon resume it. If, on the contrary, it is a prisoner, the noise I make will alarm him, he will cease, and not begin again until he thinks everyone is asleep.”\nEdmond rose again, but this time his legs did not tremble, and his sight was clear; he went to a corner of his dungeon, detached a stone, and with it knocked against the wall where the sound came. He struck thrice.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Staying true to his word, he twice daily threw out the food his jailer brought, starting cheerfully, then with hesitation, and finally with regret. Only the memory of his vow enabled him to continue. Hunger made food he once found repulsive now desirable; he would hold the plate for an hour, staring intently at the small portion of poor quality meat, spoiled fish, and moldy bread. This was his last will to live battling the despair of his situation. At times, his cell seemed less grim, his future less hopeless. He was still young, only twenty-four or twenty-five, with potentially fifty years ahead. He pondered what unforeseen events might free him. He'd bring the food to his lips, like a voluntary Tantalus denying himself, but his oath stopped him. He persevered until he lacked the strength to even get up and discard his supper. The next morning, he was unable to see or hear; the jailer feared he was seriously ill. Edmond, however, hoped he was dying. The day passed in this state. Edmond felt a growing numbness, bringing a sense of peace; the gnawing stomach pain stopped, his thirst lessened, and closing his eyes, he saw countless lights, like marsh ignis fatuus, dancing before him—the threshold of the mysterious realm of Death! Suddenly, around nine in the evening, Edmond heard a hollow sound in the wall he was lying against. So many unpleasant creatures inhabited the prison that their sounds usually didn't disturb him, but whether starvation had sharpened his senses or the noise was genuinely louder, Edmond lifted his head to listen. It was a constant scraping, as if from a large claw, strong tooth, or metal tool attacking the stone. Despite his weakness, the prisoner's brain instantly seized upon the universal hope of inmates—liberty! It felt as though fate had finally taken pity, sending this noise as a warning on the edge of the abyss. Perhaps someone he cared about was thinking of him and trying to reach him. No, he decided, he must be mistaken, just another hallucination preceding death. Edmond still heard the noise. It lasted about three hours, then he heard something fall, and silence followed. Several hours later, it began again, closer and clearer. Edmond was captivated. Just then, the jailer entered. For a week since resolving to die, and during the four days he had been acting on it, Edmond hadn't spoken to the jailer, hadn't answered his questions about his condition, and had turned away when looked at too closely. But now, the jailer might hear the noise and stop it, crushing the fragile spark of hope that eased his final moments. The jailer brought his breakfast. Dantès sat up and began talking about everything—complaining loudly about the poor food and the cold cell, using the complaints as an excuse to talk louder and wear down the jailer, who, out of kindness, had brought broth and white bread. Fortunately, the jailer thought Dantès was delirious and, placing the food on the shaky table, left. Edmond listened, and the sound became even clearer. \"There's no doubt,\" he thought, \"it's another prisoner trying to escape. Oh, if only I could help!\" Suddenly, another idea struck his mind, one so accustomed to misfortune it barely allowed for hope—that the noise was made by workmen ordered by the governor to repair the nearby cell. This was easy to verify, but how could he ask without giving himself away? He could point out the noise to the jailer and watch his reaction, but might that risk destroying hopes far more significant than satisfying his own temporary curiosity? Unfortunately, Edmond's mind was still too weak to focus. He saw only one way to regain mental clarity. He looked at the soup the jailer had left, got up, stumbled towards it, raised the bowl, and drank its contents with intense pleasure. He had the willpower to stop after that. He'd heard how shipwreck survivors sometimes died from eating too much too quickly. Edmond put the bread back on the table; he no longer wished to die. Soon, his thoughts became coherent again; he could think and reinforce his ideas with logic. Then he told himself, \"I must test this, but without endangering anyone. If it's a workman, I just need to knock on the wall, and he'll stop to see who's knocking and why. Since his work is authorized by the governor, he'll soon resume. If, however, it's a prisoner, my noise will alarm him, he'll stop, and won't start again until he believes everyone is asleep.\" Edmond got up again, but this time his legs were steady, and his vision was clear. He went to a corner of his cell, pried loose a stone, and used it to knock on the wall where the sound was coming from. He struck three times.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "He kept his promise, throwing out the food his jailer brought through the barred opening twice each day—at first with optimism, then slowly, and finally with sorrow. Only remembering his vow gave him the will to continue. As hunger set in, even food he once found disgusting became appealing; he would hold a plate with spoiled meat, rotting fish, or moldy bread for an hour, staring at it. It was his last desire to live battling with his desperate resolve. His prison didn’t seem as dark and his situation not as hopeless; he was still just twenty-four or twenty-five, with potentially fifty years ahead—who knew what chance might free him? Occasionally, he almost ate the food, but his oath restrained him. He persisted until he was too weak to throw his meal away anymore. The next morning, he could neither see nor hear, and his jailer worried he was gravely ill. Edmond hoped he was dying.\n\nThe day slipped by in a daze; Edmond felt a numbness creep over him, bringing a peaceful sensation. The pain in his stomach faded, his thirst waned, and when his eyes closed, he saw flashing lights like will-o’-the-wisps on the marshes—the edge of death.\n\nSuddenly, around nine in the evening, Edmond heard a dull sound from the wall he was lying against. Normally, the scurrying of animals in prison didn’t disturb him, but perhaps due to his fasting or the noise being louder, he lifted his head and listened. Continuous scratching came, as though from a big claw, strong teeth, or a metal tool chiseling at the stones.\n\nDespite his weakness, the ever-hopeful idea of escape immediately seized his mind. It felt as though fate was finally sympathetic, sending him a warning at his lowest point. Perhaps those he loved were trying to reach him. But maybe it was just a dying man’s fantasy.\n\nStill, the scratching continued for almost three hours, followed by a thump and then silence. Hours later, it started again, even closer and clearer. Edmond became intensely alert, but then his jailer entered.\n\nFor a week since deciding to starve himself, and the four days he’d spent following through, Edmond hadn’t spoken to the attendant and turned away when addressed. Now though, fearing the jailer might hear the noise—which could jeopardize this newfound flicker of hope—he began to talk, complaining loudly about the food and the dungeon’s cold. The jailer, thinking Edmond delirious, left his meal and departed. As he listened, the noise grew even more distinct.\n\nEdmond thought to himself, 'It must be another prisoner trying to escape! If only I could help.' Another idea occurred—perhaps workmen were sent by the governor to fix the next cell. It would be easy to find out by drawing the jailer's attention, but he didn’t want to risk losing what hope he had. Edmond’s weakened mind couldn’t focus; he realized he needed food for mental clarity. He sipped some soup, resisting the urge to eat everything in case it made him ill, and soon his thoughts cleared.\n\nHe reasoned: if it’s a workman, knocking on the wall would cause only a brief break before resuming; if it’s a prisoner, he would stop and not start again until he thought everyone was asleep. Steadier now, Edmond took a stone from his cell, went to the wall where the sound came from, and knocked three times."

At intervals he listened to learn if the noise had not begun again, and grew impatient at the prudence of the prisoner, who did not guess he had been disturbed by a captive as anxious for liberty as himself.\nThree days passed—seventy-two long tedious hours which he counted off by minutes!\nAt length one evening, as the jailer was visiting him for the last time that night, Dantès, with his ear for the hundredth time at the wall, fancied he heard an almost imperceptible movement among the stones. He moved away, walked up and down his cell to collect his thoughts, and then went back and listened.\nThe matter was no longer doubtful. Something was at work on the other side of the wall; the prisoner had discovered the danger, and had substituted a lever for a chisel.\nEncouraged by this discovery, Edmond determined to assist the indefatigable laborer. He began by moving his bed, and looked around for anything with which he could pierce the wall, penetrate the moist cement, and displace a stone.\nHe saw nothing, he had no knife or sharp instrument, the window grating was of iron, but he had too often assured himself of its solidity. All his furniture consisted of a bed, a chair, a table, a pail, and a jug. The bed had iron clamps, but they were screwed to the wood, and it would have required a screw-driver to take them off. The table and chair had nothing, the pail had once possessed a handle, but that had been removed.\nDantès had but one resource, which was to break the jug, and with one of the sharp fragments attack the wall. He let the jug fall on the floor, and it broke in pieces.\nDantès concealed two or three of the sharpest fragments in his bed, leaving the rest on the floor. The breaking of his jug was too natural an accident to excite suspicion. Edmond had all the night to work in, but in the darkness he could not do much, and he soon felt that he was working against something very hard; he pushed back his bed, and waited for day.\nAll night he heard the subterranean workman, who continued to mine his way. Day came, the jailer entered. Dantès told him that the jug had fallen from his hands while he was drinking, and the jailer went grumblingly to fetch another, without giving himself the trouble to remove the fragments of the broken one. He returned speedily, advised the prisoner to be more careful, and departed.\nDantès heard joyfully the key grate in the lock; he listened until the sound of steps died away, and then, hastily displacing his bed, saw by the faint light that penetrated into his cell, that he had labored uselessly the previous evening in attacking the stone instead of removing the plaster that surrounded it.\nThe damp had rendered it friable, and Dantès was able to break it off—in small morsels, it is true, but at the end of half an hour he had scraped off a handful; a mathematician might have calculated that in two years, supposing that the rock was not encountered, a passage twenty feet long and two feet broad, might be formed.\nThe prisoner reproached himself with not having thus employed the hours he had passed in vain hopes, prayer, and despondency. During the six years that he had been imprisoned, what might he not have accomplished?\nThis idea imparted new energy, and in three days he had succeeded, with the utmost precaution, in removing the cement, and exposing the stone-work. The wall was built of rough stones, among which, to give strength to the structure, blocks of hewn stone were at intervals imbedded. It was one of these he had uncovered, and which he must remove from its socket.\nDantès strove to do this with his nails, but they were too weak. The fragments of the jug broke, and after an hour of useless toil, Dantès paused with anguish on his brow.\nWas he to be thus stopped at the beginning, and was he to wait inactive until his fellow workman had completed his task? Suddenly an idea occurred to him—he smiled, and the perspiration dried on his forehead.\nThe jailer always brought Dantès’ soup in an iron saucepan; this saucepan contained soup for both prisoners, for Dantès had noticed that it was either quite full, or half empty, according as the turnkey gave it to him or to his companion first.\nThe handle of this saucepan was of iron; Dantès would have given ten years of his life in exchange for it.\nThe jailer was accustomed to pour the contents of the saucepan into Dantès’ plate, and Dantès, after eating his soup with a wooden spoon, washed the plate, which thus served for every day. Now when evening came Dantès put his plate on the ground near the door; the jailer, as he entered, stepped on it and broke it.\nThis time he could not blame Dantès. He was wrong to leave it there, but the jailer was wrong not to have looked before him. The jailer, therefore, only grumbled. Then he looked about for something to pour the soup into; Dantès’ entire dinner service consisted of one plate—there was no alternative.\n“Leave the saucepan,” said Dantès; “you can take it away when you bring me my breakfast.”\nThis advice was to the jailer’s taste, as it spared him the necessity of making another trip. He left the saucepan.\nDantès was beside himself with joy. He rapidly devoured his food, and after waiting an hour, lest the jailer should change his mind and return, he removed his bed, took the handle of the saucepan, inserted the point between the hewn stone and rough stones of the wall, and employed it as a lever. A slight oscillation showed Dantès that all went well. At the end of an hour the stone was extricated from the wall, leaving a cavity a foot and a half in diameter.\nDantès carefully collected the plaster, carried it into the corner of his cell, and covered it with earth. Then, wishing to make the best use of his time while he had the means of labor, he continued to work without ceasing. At the dawn of day he replaced the stone, pushed his bed against the wall, and lay down. The breakfast consisted of a piece of bread; the jailer entered and placed the bread on the table.\n“Well, don’t you intend to bring me another plate?” said Dantès.\n“No,” replied the turnkey; “you destroy everything. First you break your jug, then you make me break your plate; if all the prisoners followed your example, the government would be ruined. I shall leave you the saucepan, and pour your soup into that. So for the future I hope you will not be so destructive.”\nDantès raised his eyes to heaven and clasped his hands beneath the coverlet. He felt more gratitude for the possession of this piece of iron than he had ever felt for anything. He had noticed, however, that the prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor; no matter, this was a greater reason for proceeding—if his neighbor would not come to him, he would go to his neighbor. All day he toiled on untiringly, and by the evening he had succeeded in extracting ten handfuls of plaster and fragments of stone. When the hour for his jailer’s visit arrived, Dantès straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could, and placed it in its accustomed place. The turnkey poured his ration of soup into it, together with the fish—for thrice a week the prisoners were deprived of meat. This would have been a method of reckoning time, had not Dantès long ceased to do so. Having poured out the soup, the turnkey retired.\nDantès wished to ascertain whether his neighbor had really ceased to work. He listened—all was silent, as it had been for the last three days. Dantès sighed; it was evident that his neighbor distrusted him. However, he toiled on all the night without being discouraged; but after two or three hours he encountered an obstacle. The iron made no impression, but met with a smooth surface; Dantès touched it, and found that it was a beam. This beam crossed, or rather blocked up, the hole Dantès had made; it was necessary, therefore, to dig above or under it. The unhappy young man had not thought of this.\n“Oh, my God, my God!” murmured he, “I have so earnestly prayed to you, that I hoped my prayers had been heard. After having deprived me of my liberty, after having deprived me of death, after having recalled me to existence, my God, have pity on me, and do not let me die in despair!”\n“Who talks of God and despair at the same time?” said a voice that seemed to come from beneath the earth, and, deadened by the distance, sounded hollow and sepulchral in the young man’s ears. Edmond’s hair stood on end, and he rose to his knees.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The moment Edmond struck the wall, the sound from the other side stopped abruptly. Edmond listened intensely, but for the next hour, then two, and throughout the entire day and night, there was complete silence from the wall. Filled with renewed hope, Edmond ate a little bread and water. Thanks to his strong constitution, he felt almost fully recovered. As the day passed in utter silence and night fell without the noise returning, Edmond joyfully thought, \"It's a prisoner!\" His mind raced, and his sense of life and energy surged back. The night remained perfectly quiet, and Edmond stayed awake. The next morning, the jailer brought fresh food, replacing what Edmond had eagerly consumed the day before. As he ate, he anxiously listened for the sound, pacing his cell, testing the bars of the small window, and exercising to regain his strength and agility, preparing himself for whatever lay ahead. Periodically, he paused to listen, growing impatient with his fellow prisoner's caution, who couldn't know he had been overheard by someone just as desperate for freedom. Three days passed – a weary seventy-two hours that Edmond counted minute by minute. Finally, one evening during the jailer's final rounds, as Dantès pressed his ear to the wall for what must have been the hundredth time, he thought he detected a nearly undetectable shift among the stones. He moved away, walked around to clear his head, then returned to listen again. There was no longer any doubt. Someone was working on the other side of the wall; the other prisoner had likely realized the disturbance and switched from a chisel to a lever. This discovery emboldened Edmond, and he decided to help the tireless worker. He began by moving his bed and searching for anything he could use to pierce the wall, break through the damp mortar, and dislodge a stone. He found nothing. He had no knife or sharp tool. The iron window grate was too solid, as he'd often confirmed. His sparse furnishings included only a bed, a chair, a table, a bucket, and a water jug. The bed had iron fixtures, but they were screwed on and required a screwdriver. The table and chair offered nothing. The bucket had once had a handle, but it was gone. Dantès had only one option: break the jug and use a sharp piece to attack the wall. He dropped the jug, and it shattered. Dantès hid two or three of the sharpest pieces in his bed, leaving the rest on the floor. The breaking of the jug seemed like a plausible accident that wouldn't arouse suspicion. Edmond had the whole night to work, but in the darkness, he couldn't achieve much and quickly felt his tool hitting something very hard. He pushed his bed back and waited for daylight. All night he heard the other prisoner digging. When day came, the jailer entered. Dantès explained his jug had slipped while he was drinking. The jailer grumbled but went to fetch another, not bothering to clear the broken fragments. He quickly returned, advised Dantès to be more careful, and left. Dantès heard the key turn in the lock with joy. He waited until the sound of footsteps faded, then hastily moved his bed. In the faint light entering his cell, he saw that his efforts the previous night had been wasted because he had tried to chip the stone itself instead of removing the plaster surrounding it. The dampness had made the plaster brittle, and Dantès could scrape it off in small pieces. Within half an hour, he had a handful. A mathematician could estimate that, avoiding solid rock, a tunnel twenty feet long and two feet wide could be dug in two years. The prisoner regretted the wasted hours spent in fruitless hope, prayer, and despair. What could he have accomplished in the six years he had been confined? This thought invigorated him. Over the next three days, working with extreme caution, he successfully removed the cement to expose the underlying stonework. The wall was constructed of rough stones, reinforced periodically with embedded blocks of dressed stone. He had uncovered one of these blocks and needed to get it out. Dantès tried using his fingernails, but they were too weak. The pieces of the jug broke. After an hour of fruitless struggle, Dantès stopped, anguish clouding his face. Would he be stopped so soon? Would he have to wait passively for his neighbor to finish? Suddenly, an idea struck him. He smiled, and the sweat dried on his forehead. The jailer always brought Dantès' soup in an iron saucepan, which served both prisoners; Dantès knew this because it was either full or half-empty depending on whose cell the jailer visited first. The handle of this saucepan was iron. Dantès would have traded ten years of his life for it. The jailer usually poured the soup into Dantès' plate, which Dantès washed after eating with a wooden spoon. That evening, Dantès placed his plate on the floor near the door. When the jailer entered, he stepped on it and broke it. This time, the jailer couldn't entirely blame Dantès; leaving it there was careless, but not looking where he stepped was also wrong. The jailer merely grumbled. Then he looked for something to pour the soup into. Dantès' only dinnerware was the broken plate – there was no alternative. \"Leave the saucepan,\" Dantès suggested. \"You can take it when you bring breakfast.\" This suited the jailer as it saved him an extra trip. He left the saucepan. Dantès was ecstatic. He quickly finished his food, waited an hour in case the jailer returned, then moved his bed. He took the saucepan handle, inserted its point between the dressed stone and the rough stones, and used it as a lever. A slight shift indicated success. After an hour, the stone was extracted, leaving a cavity about eighteen inches in diameter. Dantès carefully gathered the loose material, carried it to a corner of his cell, and covered it with earth. Wanting to make the most of his tool, he continued working nonstop. At dawn, he replaced the stone, pushed his bed against the wall, and lay down. Breakfast was a piece of bread. The jailer entered and placed it on the table. \"Well, aren't you going to bring me another plate?\" Dantès asked. \"No,\" the turnkey replied. \"You break everything. First your jug, then you make me break your plate. If all the prisoners did this, the government would be ruined. I'll leave you the saucepan and pour your soup into that from now on. I hope you'll be more careful in the future.\" Dantès looked up at the ceiling and clasped his hands under the blanket. He felt more grateful for possessing this piece of iron than he ever had for anything else. He noticed, however, that the prisoner on the other side had stopped working. No matter; this was even more reason to continue. If his neighbor wouldn't come to him, he would go to his neighbor. He worked tirelessly all day, and by evening, he had removed ten handfuls of plaster and stone fragments. When it was time for the jailer's visit, Dantès straightened the saucepan handle as best he could and put the saucepan back in its usual spot. The turnkey poured in his soup ration, along with fish – meat was omitted three times a week, which could have served as a time marker if Dantès still bothered to count days. After pouring the soup, the turnkey left. Dantès wanted to confirm his neighbor had indeed stopped working. He listened; all was silent, as it had been for three days. Dantès sighed; clearly, his neighbor didn't trust him. Nevertheless, he worked on all night, undiscouraged. But after two or three hours, he hit an obstacle. The iron tool made no impression, meeting a smooth surface. Dantès touched it and realized it was a beam. This beam crossed, or rather blocked, the hole Dantès had made. Therefore, he would have to dig above or below it. The unfortunate young man hadn't anticipated this. \"Oh, my God, my God!\" he murmured. \"I have prayed to you so earnestly, I hoped my prayers had been heard. After taking my liberty, after denying me death, after restoring me to life, my God, have pity on me, and do not let me die in despair!\" \"Who speaks of God and despair in the same breath?\" asked a voice that seemed to rise from below the earth, muffled by distance, sounding hollow and sepulchral in the young man's ears. Edmond's hair stood on end, and he dropped to his knees.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As soon as the first noise stopped, Edmond listened carefully. Hours went by without hearing anything, and all was quiet. Feeling hopeful, he ate some bread and water, which, along with his strong health, helped him recover. The whole day was silent, and when night fell, the noise didn’t come back. Edmond was excited, thinking another prisoner must be at work, and this hope revived his energy. He stayed awake all night, but still, no sounds came from the wall. In the morning, the jailer gave him more food, and Edmond quickly ate it, listening for any sign of activity. He walked around his cell, exercised, and frequently checked for any new hammering. Eventually, he grew impatient with the slow progress of the unknown worker on the other side, not realizing someone else wanted freedom as much as he did.\n\nThree long, slow days passed, with Edmond counting every minute. Then, one evening while the jailer made his nightly rounds, Edmond thought he heard a faint movement from the wall. He composed himself, listened again, and this time there was no doubt—a prisoner was definitely working, now using a lever instead of a chisel. Encouraged, Edmond decided to help. He moved his bed and searched for anything sharp he could use to break through the wall. With no knife or proper tool—since his only possessions were basic prison items—he realized he could break his jug and use one of its sharp pieces. After breaking the jug, he hid several shards in his bed, pretending the accident was natural, so the jailer wouldn’t be suspicious.\n\nThat night, Edmond tried working in the dark but had little success; he seemed to be hitting a very hard surface. He hid his progress when day came. The jailer replaced the jug with little fuss, so Edmond could keep the broken pieces. Realizing he should have been removing plaster, not attacking stone, Edmond tried again and made slow but visible progress scraping away crumbling plaster. He regretted the wasted years he spent hoping and despairing, thinking if only he had acted sooner. Inspired, he worked carefully each day, uncovering eventually a large stone that was part of the wall’s structure.\n\nLacking tools strong enough to move the stone, Edmond tried to use his nails and the jug fragments, but neither worked. Then, he recalled that his soup always came in an iron saucepan with a sturdy handle. Seizing his chance, Edmond engineered the breaking of his plate, so the jailer would have no choice but to leave the saucepan. With the iron handle, Edmond was able to pry the stone loose, creating a large hole in the wall. He hid the debris under earth in his cell’s corner. Each day, he covered his progress and then resumed work at night, grateful for the iron handle, which was now his most valued possession.\n\nSoon, Edmond noticed the other prisoner seemed to have stopped digging, which made him more determined to reach that person himself. As he made further progress, he encountered a beam blocking the hole. He realized he would need to dig above or below it, presenting another obstacle. Frustrated and despairing, Edmond prayed for help, pleading not to die in hopelessness after being denied both freedom and death. Suddenly, a deep, muffled voice asked, “Who talks of God and despair at the same time?” Startled, Edmond knelt, amazed and overwhelmed by hearing another person’s voice from beneath the earth."

          "text_segment": "“Ah,” said he, “I hear a human voice.” Edmond had not heard anyone speak save his jailer for four or five years; and a jailer is no man to a prisoner—he is a living door, a barrier of flesh and blood adding strength to restraints of oak and iron.\n“In the name of Heaven,” cried Dantès, “speak again, though the sound of your voice terrifies me. Who are you?”\n“Who are you?” said the voice.\n“An unhappy prisoner,” replied Dantès, who made no hesitation in answering.\n“Of what country?”\n“A Frenchman.”\n“Your name?”\n“Edmond Dantès.”\n“Your profession?”\n“A sailor.”\n“How long have you been here?”\n“Since the 28th of February, 1815.”\n“Your crime?”\n“I am innocent.”\n“But of what are you accused?”\n“Of having conspired to aid the emperor’s return.”\n“What! For the emperor’s return?—the emperor is no longer on the throne, then?”\n“He abdicated at Fontainebleau in 1814, and was sent to the Island of Elba. But how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all this?”\n“Since 1811.”\nDantès shuddered; this man had been four years longer than himself in prison.\n“Do not dig any more,” said the voice; “only tell me how high up is your excavation?”\n“On a level with the floor.”\n“How is it concealed?”\n“Behind my bed.”\n“Has your bed been moved since you have been a prisoner?”\n“No.”\n“What does your chamber open on?”\n“A corridor.”\n“And the corridor?”\n“On a court.”\n“Alas!” murmured the voice.\n“Oh, what is the matter?” cried Dantès.\n“I have made a mistake owing to an error in my plans. I took the wrong angle, and have come out fifteen feet from where I intended. I took the wall you are mining for the outer wall of the fortress.”\n“But then you would be close to the sea?”\n“That is what I hoped.”\n“And supposing you had succeeded?”\n“I should have thrown myself into the sea, gained one of the islands near here—the Isle de Daume or the Isle de Tiboulen—and then I should have been safe.”\n“Could you have swum so far?”\n“Heaven would have given me strength; but now all is lost.”\n“All?”\n“Yes; stop up your excavation carefully, do not work any more, and wait until you hear from me.”\n“Tell me, at least, who you are?”\n“I am—I am No. 27.”\n“You mistrust me, then,” said Dantès. Edmond fancied he heard a bitter laugh resounding from the depths.\n“Oh, I am a Christian,” cried Dantès, guessing instinctively that this man meant to abandon him. “I swear to you by him who died for us that naught shall induce me to breathe one syllable to my jailers; but I conjure you do not abandon me. If you do, I swear to you, for I have got to the end of my strength, that I will dash my brains out against the wall, and you will have my death to reproach yourself with.”\n“How old are you? Your voice is that of a young man.”\n“I do not know my age, for I have not counted the years I have been here. All I do know is, that I was just nineteen when I was arrested, the 28th of February, 1815.”\n“Not quite twenty-six!” murmured the voice; “at that age he cannot be a traitor.”\n“Oh, no, no,” cried Dantès. “I swear to you again, rather than betray you, I would allow myself to be hacked in pieces!”\n“You have done well to speak to me, and ask for my assistance, for I was about to form another plan, and leave you; but your age reassures me. I will not forget you. Wait.”\n“How long?”\n“I must calculate our chances; I will give you the signal.”\n“But you will not leave me; you will come to me, or you will let me come to you. We will escape, and if we cannot escape we will talk; you of those whom you love, and I of those whom I love. You must love somebody?”\n“No, I am alone in the world.”\n“Then you will love me. If you are young, I will be your comrade; if you are old, I will be your son. I have a father who is seventy if he yet lives; I only love him and a young girl called Mercédès. My father has not yet forgotten me, I am sure, but God alone knows if she loves me still; I shall love you as I loved my father.”\n“It is well,” returned the voice; “tomorrow.”\nThese few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his sincerity; Dantès rose, dispersed the fragments with the same precaution as before, and pushed his bed back against the wall. He then gave himself up to his happiness. He would no longer be alone. He was, perhaps, about to regain his liberty; at the worst, he would have a companion, and captivity that is shared is but half captivity. Plaints made in common are almost prayers, and prayers where two or three are gathered together invoke the mercy of heaven.\nAll day Dantès walked up and down his cell. He sat down occasionally on his bed, pressing his hand on his heart. At the slightest noise he bounded towards the door. Once or twice the thought crossed his mind that he might be separated from this unknown, whom he loved already; and then his mind was made up—when the jailer moved his bed and stooped to examine the opening, he would kill him with his water jug. He would be condemned to die, but he was about to die of grief and despair when this miraculous noise recalled him to life.\nThe jailer came in the evening. Dantès was on his bed. It seemed to him that thus he better guarded the unfinished opening. Doubtless there was a strange expression in his eyes, for the jailer said, “Come, are you going mad again?”\nDantès did not answer; he feared that the emotion of his voice would betray him. The jailer went away shaking his head. Night came; Dantès hoped that his neighbor would profit by the silence to address him, but he was mistaken. The next morning, however, just as he removed his bed from the wall, he heard three knocks; he threw himself on his knees.\n“Is it you?” said he; “I am here.”\n“Is your jailer gone?”\n“Yes,” said Dantès; “he will not return until the evening; so that we have twelve hours before us.”\n“I can work, then?” said the voice.\n“Oh, yes, yes; this instant, I entreat you.”\nIn a moment that part of the floor on which Dantès was resting his two hands, as he knelt with his head in the opening, suddenly gave way; he drew back smartly, while a mass of stones and earth disappeared in a hole that opened beneath the aperture he himself had formed. Then from the bottom of this passage, the depth of which it was impossible to measure, he saw appear, first the head, then the shoulders, and lastly the body of a man, who sprang lightly into his cell.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Upon hearing a voice, Edmond exclaimed, \"Ah, I hear a human voice.\" He hadn't heard anyone speak except his jailer in four or five years, and a jailer, to a prisoner, isn't truly a person but rather a physical obstacle, a living barrier reinforcing the prison's wooden and iron restraints. Trembling but desperate, Dantès cried out, \"In the name of Heaven, speak again, even though the sound of your voice frightens me. Who are you?\" The voice responded, \"Who are you?\" Without hesitation, Dantès replied, \"An unhappy prisoner.\" The voice then asked his nationality, to which he replied, \"A Frenchman.\" \"Your name?\" \"Edmond Dantès.\" \"Your profession?\" \"A sailor.\" \"How long have you been here?\" \"Since February 28, 1815.\" \"Your crime?\" \"I am innocent.\" \"But what are you accused of?\" \"Conspiring to aid the emperor's return.\" \"What! For the emperor's return? So, the emperor is no longer on the throne?\" \"He abdicated at Fontainebleau in 1814 and was sent to the Island of Elba. But how long have you been here that you don't know this?\" \"Since 1811.\" Dantès shivered, realizing this man had been imprisoned four years longer than himself. The voice instructed, \"Do not dig any more; just tell me how high up is your excavation?\" \"On a level with the floor.\" \"How is it hidden?\" \"Behind my bed.\" \"Has your bed been moved since you became a prisoner?\" \"No.\" \"What does your chamber open onto?\" \"A corridor.\" \"And the corridor?\" \"Onto a court.\" \"Alas!\" the voice murmured. \"Oh, what is wrong?\" cried Dantès. \"I've made a mistake due to a flaw in my plans. I chose the wrong angle and have ended up fifteen feet away from my intended spot. I thought the wall you are digging into was the fortress's outer wall.\" \"But in that case, you would be near the sea?\" \"That was my hope.\" \"And if you had succeeded?\" \"I would have thrown myself into the sea, swum to a nearby island—the Isle de Daume or the Isle de Tiboulen—and then I would have been safe.\" \"Could you have swum that far?\" \"Heaven would have given me strength; but now everything is lost.\" \"Everything?\" \"Yes; seal up your excavation carefully, stop working, and wait until you hear from me.\" \"Tell me, at least, who you are?\" \"I am—I am No. 27.\" \"You mistrust me, then,\" said Dantès. Edmond imagined he heard a bitter laugh echoing from the depths. \"Oh, I am a Christian,\" Dantès cried, instinctively feeling the man intended to abandon him. \"I swear to you by Him who died for us that nothing will make me say a word to my jailers; but I beg you, do not leave me. If you do, I swear to you, for I have reached the end of my endurance, that I will beat my head against the wall and kill myself, and my death will be on your conscience.\" \"How old are you? Your voice sounds young.\" \"I don't know my age, as I haven't counted the years here. All I know is I was just nineteen when I was arrested on February 28, 1815.\" \"Not quite twenty-six!\" the voice murmured; \"at that age, he cannot be a traitor.\" \"Oh, no, no,\" cried Dantès. \"I swear again, rather than betray you, I would let myself be cut to pieces!\" \"You did well to speak to me and ask for my help, for I was about to make a different plan and leave you; but your age reassures me. I will not forget you. Wait.\" \"How long?\" \"I must evaluate our options; I will give you the signal.\" \"But you won't leave me; you will come to me, or you will let me come to you. We will escape, and if we can't escape, we will talk; you about those you love, and I about those I love. You must love someone?\" \"No, I am alone in the world.\" \"Then you will love me. If you are young, I will be your friend; if you are old, I will be your son. I have a father who is seventy, if he's still alive; I only love him and a young woman named Mercédès. My father hasn't forgotten me, I'm sure, but only God knows if she still loves me; I will love you as I loved my father.\" \"Very well,\" the voice replied; \"tomorrow.\" These few words were spoken with an sincerity that dispelled any doubt. Dantès got up, cleared away the debris as carefully as before, and pushed his bed back against the wall. He then surrendered to his joy. He would no longer be alone. He was possibly on the verge of regaining freedom; at worst, he would have a companion, and shared captivity is only half captivity. Shared complaints are almost prayers, and prayers offered by two or three together appeal more strongly to Heaven's mercy. All day, Dantès paced his cell. He occasionally sat on his bed, pressing his hand to his heart. At the slightest sound, he rushed towards the door. The thought crossed his mind once or twice that he might be separated from this unknown man, whom he already felt affection for; and then his resolve hardened—if the jailer moved his bed and bent to examine the opening, he would kill him with his water jug. He would be condemned to death, but he was already close to dying from grief and despair when this miraculous sound brought him back to life. The jailer arrived in the evening. Dantès was on his bed, feeling that this position best protected the incomplete opening. There must have been an unusual look in his eyes, as the jailer asked, \"Come now, are you losing your mind again?\" Dantès didn't reply, fearing his voice's emotion would expose him. The jailer left, shaking his head. Night fell; Dantès hoped his neighbor would use the silence to speak to him, but he was wrong. However, the next morning, just as he moved his bed from the wall, he heard three knocks. He dropped to his knees. \"Is it you?\" he said; \"I am here.\" \"Is your jailer gone?\" \"Yes,\" said Dantès; \"he won't be back until the evening; so we have twelve hours.\" \"I can work, then?\" said the voice. \"Oh, yes, yes; right now, please.\" In an instant, the part of the floor where Dantès rested his hands as he knelt with his head near the opening suddenly collapsed; he quickly drew back as a mass of stones and earth vanished into a hole that appeared beneath the aperture he had made. Then, from the bottom of this passage, whose depth couldn't be seen, he saw first the head, then the shoulders, and finally the body of a man emerge, who sprang lightly into his cell.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Dantès, having not heard another human voice for years other than his jailer, is startled and hopeful upon hearing someone speak. To him, a jailer is more like an obstacle than a person. He calls out, desperate to communicate, and a conversation begins through the walls. The stranger gradually asks Dantès about his identity, circumstances, and the crime for which he is imprisoned. They both share their details, revealing how long they've been locked up and why. The stranger finds out that his own tunneling efforts to escape have actually led to Dantès’ cell due to a miscalculation. Originally, he hoped to reach the sea to swim to freedom, but now realizes he’ll need to reconsider. They agree to stop digging for the moment and promise to help each other. Dantès—unwilling to be abandoned and desperate for companionship—begs the stranger not to leave him, swearing loyalty and expressing his longing for connection. The stranger, reassured by Dantès' youth and sincerity, reluctantly agrees to help and promises to return. This gives Dantès immense hope—now he has a friend and potential escape partner, making his imprisonment less lonely. He spends the day anxiously awaiting further contact, determined to protect their secret. The next morning, their agreement is fulfilled: the stranger manages to break through the wall, and, to Dantès’ joy, appears in his cell, giving him renewed hope and companionship."

He had a deep-set, penetrating eye, almost buried beneath the thick gray eyebrow, and a long (and still black) beard reaching down to his breast. His thin face, deeply furrowed by care, and the bold outline of his strongly marked features, betokened a man more accustomed to exercise his mental faculties than his physical strength. Large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow, while the garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could only guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been fashioned.\nThe stranger might have numbered sixty or sixty-five years; but a certain briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it probable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of time. He received the enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with evident pleasure, as though his chilled affections were rekindled and invigorated by his contact with one so warm and ardent. He thanked him with grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome, although he must at that moment have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where he had fondly reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his liberty.\n“Let us first see,” said he, “whether it is possible to remove the traces of my entrance here—our future tranquillity depends upon our jailers being entirely ignorant of it.”\nAdvancing to the opening, he stooped and raised the stone easily in spite of its weight; then, fitting it into its place, he said:\n“You removed this stone very carelessly; but I suppose you had no tools to aid you.”\n“Why,” exclaimed Dantès, with astonishment, “do you possess any?”\n“I made myself some; and with the exception of a file, I have all that are necessary,—a chisel, pincers, and lever.”\n“Oh, how I should like to see these products of your industry and patience.”\n“Well, in the first place, here is my chisel.”\nSo saying, he displayed a sharp strong blade, with a handle made of beechwood.\n“And with what did you contrive to make that?” inquired Dantès.\n“With one of the clamps of my bedstead; and this very tool has sufficed me to hollow out the road by which I came hither, a distance of about fifty feet.”\n“Fifty feet!” responded Dantès, almost terrified.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Embracing his friend, whom he had longed for intensely, Dantès practically lifted him towards the window so the faint light filtering through the bars could reveal his features more clearly.\nHe was a man of modest height, whose hair was whitened more by hardship and grief than by age. He had intense, deep-set eyes, almost hidden by thick gray eyebrows, and a long, still black beard reaching his chest. His thin face, marked with deep lines from worry, and the strong contours of his face suggested someone who relied more on mental effort than physical strength. Large sweat drops beaded on his forehead, and his clothes were so worn that their original style was barely discernible.\nThe stranger appeared to be sixty to sixty-five years old, but his energetic movements indicated his age was more a result of his confinement than the passage of time. He received the young man's enthusiastic greeting with obvious pleasure, as if the warmth and intensity of this connection revitalized his own dulled emotions. He thanked him sincerely for the kind welcome, even though he must have been suffering greatly at that moment, having hoped to find a way to freedom instead of another cell.\n“First, let’s ensure,” he said, “that we conceal any evidence of my arrival here; our peace of mind depends on our captors remaining completely unaware.”\nMoving to the opening, he bent down and lifted the stone easily despite its weight; then, placing it back precisely, he remarked:\n“You lifted this stone quite carelessly, but I suppose you didn't have tools to help.”\n“What?” exclaimed Dantès, surprised. “Do you have any?”\n“I fashioned some myself; apart from a file, I have everything needed—a chisel, pliers, and a lever.”\n“Oh, I’d love to see what you’ve created through your effort and patience.”\n“Well, to begin, here is my chisel.”\nWith that, he showed a sharp, sturdy blade with a handle crafted from beechwood.\n“And how did you manage to make that?” Dantès asked.\n“From one of the metal fittings on my bed; and this very tool was enough for me to dig the tunnel I used to reach here, a distance of about fifty feet.”\n“Fifty feet!” Dantès replied, almost scared.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Dantès, overwhelmed with joy, eagerly embraced the friend he had longed for so much, nearly lifting him as he led him to the window to better see his face in the faint light that entered through the bars. The newcomer was a short man whose hair had turned white more from pain and hardship than from old age. His eyes were deep and piercing, set under thick gray brows, and a long, still-black beard reached down his chest. His face was thin and lined with worry, his features sharply defined—signs that he relied more on intellect than physical power. Sweat beaded on his forehead, and his clothes were so tattered that it was hard to guess their original design. The man appeared to be around sixty or sixty-five, but his energy suggested he had grown old because of imprisonment, not age. He warmly returned Dantès's enthusiastic greeting, as if the young man's affection rekindled his own. He gratefully thanked Dantès, even though he must have been devastated to find a new prison when he had hoped for an escape. \"First,\" he said, \"let's make sure there's no evidence of how I entered—our safety depends on the guards remaining unaware.\" The man went to the opening, bent down, and easily lifted the heavy stone, placing it back as it was. \"You didn’t remove this stone very carefully, but I suppose you had no tools,\" he observed. \"Do you have any?\" Dantès asked in surprise. \"I made some myself. Except for a file, I have all I need—a chisel, pincers, and a lever.\" \"I’d love to see them!\" Dantès exclaimed. \"Here's my chisel,\" the man said, showing a sharp blade with a beech handle. \"How did you make that?\" Dantès wondered. \"From one of my bed’s clamps. With it, I dug the entire passage—about fifty feet—to reach you.\" \"Fifty feet!\" Dantès repeated in shock."

I expected, as I told you, to reach the outer wall, pierce through it, and throw myself into the sea; I have, however, kept along the corridor on which your chamber opens, instead of going beneath it. My labor is all in vain, for I find that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled with soldiers.”\n“That’s true,” said Dantès; “but the corridor you speak of only bounds one side of my cell; there are three others—do you know anything of their situation?”\n“This one is built against the solid rock, and it would take ten experienced miners, duly furnished with the requisite tools, as many years to perforate it. This adjoins the lower part of the governor’s apartments, and were we to work our way through, we should only get into some lock-up cellars, where we must necessarily be recaptured. The fourth and last side of your cell faces on—faces on—stop a minute, now where does it face?”\nThe wall of which he spoke was the one in which was fixed the loophole by which light was admitted to the chamber. This loophole, which gradually diminished in size as it approached the outside, to an opening through which a child could not have passed, was, for better security, furnished with three iron bars, so as to quiet all apprehensions even in the mind of the most suspicious jailer as to the possibility of a prisoner’s escape. As the stranger asked the question, he dragged the table beneath the window.\n“Climb up,” said he to Dantès.\nThe young man obeyed, mounted on the table, and, divining the wishes of his companion, placed his back securely against the wall and held out both hands. The stranger, whom as yet Dantès knew only by the number of his cell, sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a person of his years, and, light and steady on his feet as a cat or a lizard, climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of Dantès, and from them to his shoulders; then, bending double, for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect, he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the window, so as to be able to command a perfect view from top to bottom.\nAn instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head, saying, “I thought so!” and sliding from the shoulders of Dantès as dextrously as he had ascended, he nimbly leaped from the table to the ground.",

The problem is, I didn’t curve correctly; I lacked the necessary geometric tools to calculate my path, so instead of an expected forty-foot ellipse, I dug fifty. As I mentioned, my goal was to reach the outer wall, break through, and escape into the sea. Instead, I ended up following the corridor your cell opens onto, instead of going underneath it. My work was useless, because I see now that the corridor looks out onto a courtyard filled with soldiers.”\n“That’s true,” Dantès agreed. “But that corridor only borders one side of my cell. There are three others—do you know anything about where they lead?”\n“This one,” pointing to one wall, “is built against solid rock. It would take ten experienced miners with the right equipment years and years to dig through it. This one,” pointing to another, “is next to the lower level of the governor’s rooms. If we dug through there, we’d only end up in some locked cellars, where we would certainly be caught again. The fourth and final side of your cell faces—faces—wait a moment, what exactly does it face?”\nThe wall he was referring to was the one containing the small opening or loophole that let light into the room. This loophole narrowed significantly towards the outside, becoming an opening too small for even a child to pass through. For extra security, it was fitted with three iron bars, removing any concern, even for the most watchful jailer, about a prisoner escaping. As the stranger asked his question, he pulled the table under the window.\n“Get up there,” he told Dantès.\nThe young man did as he was told, climbed onto the table, and, understanding what his companion wanted, braced himself firmly against the wall and extended both hands. The stranger, whose name Dantès didn’t yet know, only his cell number, sprang up with surprising agility for his age. Light and steady like a cat or lizard, he climbed from the table onto Dantès’ outstretched hands, and from there onto his shoulders. Then, bending low because the dungeon ceiling wasn’t high enough for him to stand straight, he managed to squeeze his head between the upper bars of the window to get a clear view of everything outside.\nAn instant later, he quickly pulled his head back, exclaiming, “Just as I suspected!” and sliding down from Dantès’ shoulders as skillfully as he had climbed up, he lightly jumped from the table back to the floor.",

Unfortunately, I miscalculated because I didn’t have the proper tools to measure precisely. Instead of tunneling an intended forty-foot curve, I went fifty feet. My plan was to reach the outside wall, break through, and escape into the sea. Instead, I stayed alongside the corridor outside your cell, not beneath it. It was pointless, as the corridor only opens onto a courtyard full of guards.\"\n\"That’s true,\" Dantès replied. \"But that corridor only borders one side of my cell. What about the other three? Do you know where they lead?\"\n\"One wall is built against solid rock—it would take ten miners with the right equipment years to break through.

The opening narrowed towards the outside, too small for even a child to escape, and was reinforced with three iron bars for extra security—ensuring even the strictest jailer would have no doubts about its safety. As the stranger pondered, he pulled the table under the window.\n\n\"Climb up,\" he told Dantès. Dantès did as instructed, got onto the table, and, intuitively understanding, braced himself against the wall and extended his hands. The stranger—whom Dantès still only knew by his cell number—nimbly vaulted from the table to Dantès’s hands, then to his shoulders. Stooped over by the low ceiling, the stranger managed to slip his head between the top bars of the window, giving himself a clear view outside.\n\nMoments later, he quickly withdrew his head, exclaiming, \"Just as I thought!\" Then, with the same agility, he slid from Dantès’s shoulders to the table and then to the floor."

This side of your cell faces an open area, a sort of walkway where patrols are constantly moving and guards stand watch day and night.” “Are you absolutely certain?” Dantès pressed. “Positive. I saw the shape of the soldier and the top of his rifle; that’s why I pulled my head back so quickly, fearing he might see me too.” “Go on?” Dantès prompted. “Then you realize it’s completely impossible to escape through your dungeon?” Faria stated. “Then…?” the young man pursued, his interest piqued. “Then,” the older prisoner replied, “God’s will be done!” As the old man slowly uttered these words, a look of deep resignation spread across his weary face.

That made me pull my head back so quickly because I was worried he might see me too.\" \"And then?\" Dantès prompted. \"So you understand why it's completely impossible to escape from your cell?\" the older prisoner said. \"Then—\" the young man said hopefully. \"Then,\" concluded the elder, \"we must accept the will of God.\" As he resigned himself to this fate, the worn lines on his face seemed to settle into a look of profound acceptance. Dantès looked at him in awe, amazed by someone able to give up hopes they'd cherished for so long with such philosophy. \"Please, tell me who you really are,\" Dantès asked. \"I've never met someone as extraordinary as you.\" \"Gladly,\" replied the stranger, \"if, that is, you want to know about someone who can no longer help you.\" \"Don't say that; you can still give me strength and comfort with your mind. Please tell me your story.\" The stranger gave a sad smile. \"Then listen. My name is Abbé Faria, and I've been imprisoned here at the Château d’If since 1811. Before that, I was locked up for three years at the fortress of Fenestrelle. In 1811, I was sent to Piedmont, France. During that time, I learned that Napoleon, whose wishes seemed to become reality, had a son who was called king of Rome even as an infant. I never expected the change you just told me about—that only four years later, this giant of power would fall. So who rules France now—Napoleon II?\" \"No, Louis XVIII.\" \"Louis XVI’s brother! The ways of Providence are so mysterious—for what great reason did fate bring down such a powerful man and raise up someone who was once low?\" Dantès listened closely, struck by how this man could set aside his own suffering and be absorbed in the fate of others."

It was the plan of Alexander VI. and Clement VII., but it will never succeed now, for they attempted it fruitlessly, and Napoleon was unable to complete his work.

There are even moments when my mind carries me beyond these walls, and I feel as though I am free.”\n“But why are you imprisoned?” Dantès inquired.\n“Because in 1807 I conceived the very plan Napoleon attempted to execute in 1811; because, like Machiavelli, I yearned to reshape Italy’s political landscape, aiming to unify it into a single, powerful empire instead of numerous small principalities governed by weak or oppressive rulers. And lastly, because I mistook a crowned fool, who pretended to support my vision only to betray me, for my desired leader, a new Cæsar Borgia. My plan echoed the failed ambitions of Alexander VI and Clement VII, and it seems doomed never to succeed now, given their lack of success and Napoleon’s inability to finish the task. Italy appears cursed by misfortune.” The old man lowered his head sadly.\nDantès found it hard to grasp how someone could risk their life over such matters.

I thought I’d found my Caesar Borgia in a foolish king who only pretended to support me, then betrayed me.

Would it not be expecting too much to hope to succeed at your first attempt? Why not try to find an opening in another direction from that which has so unfortunately failed?”\n“Alas, it shows how little notion you can have of all it has cost me to effect a purpose so unexpectedly frustrated, that you talk of beginning over again. In the first place, I was four years making the tools I possess, and have been two years scraping and digging out earth, hard as granite itself; then what toil and fatigue has it not been to remove huge stones I should once have deemed impossible to loosen. Whole days have I passed in these Titanic efforts, considering my labor well repaid if, by night-time I had contrived to carry away a square inch of this hard-bound cement, changed by ages into a substance unyielding as the stones themselves; then to conceal the mass of earth and rubbish I dug up, I was compelled to break through a staircase, and throw the fruits of my labor into the hollow part of it; but the well is now so completely choked up, that I scarcely think it would be possible to add another handful of dust without leading to discovery. Consider also that I fully believed I had accomplished the end and aim of my undertaking, for which I had so exactly husbanded my strength as to make it just hold out to the termination of my enterprise; and now, at the moment when I reckoned upon success, my hopes are forever dashed from me. No, I repeat again, that nothing shall induce me to renew attempts evidently at variance with the Almighty’s pleasure.”\nDantès held down his head, that the other might not see how joy at the thought of having a companion outweighed the sympathy he felt for the failure of the abbé’s plans.\nThe abbé sank upon Edmond’s bed, while Edmond himself remained standing. Escape had never once occurred to him. There are, indeed, some things which appear so impossible that the mind does not dwell on them for an instant. To undermine the ground for fifty feet—to devote three years to a labor which, if successful, would conduct you to a precipice overhanging the sea—to plunge into the waves from the height of fifty, sixty, perhaps a hundred feet, at the risk of being dashed to pieces against the rocks, should you have been fortunate enough to have escaped the fire of the sentinels; and even, supposing all these perils past, then to have to swim for your life a distance of at least three miles ere you could reach the shore—were difficulties so startling and formidable that Dantès had never even dreamed of such a scheme, resigning himself rather to death.\nBut the sight of an old man clinging to life with so desperate a courage, gave a fresh turn to his ideas, and inspired him with new courage. Another, older and less strong than he, had attempted what he had not had sufficient resolution to undertake, and had failed only because of an error in calculation. This same person, with almost incredible patience and perseverance, had contrived to provide himself with tools requisite for so unparalleled an attempt. Another had done all this; why, then, was it impossible to Dantès? Faria had dug his way through fifty feet, Dantès would dig a hundred; Faria, at the age of fifty, had devoted three years to the task; he, who was but half as old, would sacrifice six; Faria, a priest and savant, had not shrunk from the idea of risking his life by trying to swim a distance of three miles to one of the islands—Daume, Rattonneau, or Lemaire; should a hardy sailor, an experienced diver, like himself, shrink from a similar task; should he, who had so often for mere amusement’s sake plunged to the bottom of the sea to fetch up the bright coral branch, hesitate to entertain the same project? He could do it in an hour, and how many times had he, for pure pastime, continued in the water for more than twice as long! At once Dantès resolved to follow the brave example of his energetic companion, and to remember that what has once been done may be done again.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "For a moment, Dantès remained silent and still. Finally, he inquired, \"So, you have given up all hope of escaping?\" The abbé replied, \"I see clearly that it's completely impossible, and I believe it's wrong to attempt something that God obviously doesn't approve of.\" Dantès urged him not to be discouraged. \"Wouldn't it be unrealistic to expect success on your very first try? Why not attempt to find a way out in a different direction from the one that unfortunately didn't work?\" The abbé sighed, \"Alas, your suggestion of starting over shows you have no idea of the immense effort it cost me to pursue a goal that has been so unexpectedly thwarted. First of all, it took me four years just to create the tools I have, and I spent two more years scraping and digging through earth as hard as granite. And the sheer effort and fatigue required to move huge stones that I once thought impossible to budge! I spent entire days on these enormous tasks, feeling rewarded if, by nightfall, I had managed to remove just a single square inch of this densely packed cement, which time had turned into a substance as unyielding as the stones themselves. Then, to hide the large quantity of earth and debris I excavated, I had to break into a staircase and discard the results of my labor into its hollow space. But the well is now so entirely filled that I doubt another handful of dirt could be added without being discovered. Furthermore, consider that I genuinely believed I had achieved the ultimate goal of my undertaking, having so carefully conserved my energy to last precisely until the project's completion. And now, just when I was counting on succeeding, my hopes are forever shattered. No, I repeat, nothing will convince me to restart attempts that are clearly contrary to God's will.\" Dantès lowered his head so that the abbé couldn't see that his joy at the prospect of having a companion overshadowed the sympathy he felt for the failure of the abbé's plans. The abbé sat down on Edmond’s bed, while Edmond himself remained standing. Escape had truly never crossed his mind before. Indeed, some things seem so utterly impossible that one doesn't even consider them for a moment. To excavate fifty feet underground—to dedicate three years to a task which, if successful, would lead you to a cliff fifty, sixty, perhaps even a hundred feet above the sea—to plunge into the waves from that height, risking being crushed against the rocks even if you were lucky enough to avoid being shot by the sentinels; and even supposing you survived all those dangers, then having to swim desperately for at least three miles to reach the shore—these were difficulties so astonishing and formidable that Dantès had never even contemplated such a scheme, having resigned himself instead to death. But seeing an old man clinging to life with such fierce determination changed his perspective and filled him with renewed courage. Someone else, older and less strong than he, had attempted what he hadn't had the nerve to undertake, and had failed only due to a miscalculation. This same person, with almost unbelievable patience and persistence, had managed to equip himself with the necessary tools for such an unprecedented attempt. Another person had done all this; why, then, should it be impossible for Dantès? Faria had dug through fifty feet; Dantès would dig a hundred. Faria, at the age of fifty, had spent three years on the task; he, who was only half as old, would dedicate six. Faria, a priest and scholar, had not flinched from the idea of risking his life by trying to swim three miles to one of the islands—Daume, Rattonneau, or Lemaire. Should a robust sailor, an expert diver like himself, shrink from a similar task? Should he, who had often plunged to the bottom of the sea just for fun to retrieve vibrant coral branches, hesitate to embrace the same project? He could accomplish it in an hour, and many times, purely for enjoyment, he had remained in the water for more than twice as long! Immediately, Dantès resolved to follow the inspiring example of his energetic companion and to remember that anything that has been achieved once can be achieved again.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Dantès was silent and still for a moment before finally asking if all hope of escape was lost. The abbé replied that any escape now seemed truly impossible and he felt it would be irreverent to attempt something that fate, or God, clearly opposed. Dantès tried to encourage him, suggesting it was unreasonable to hope for success on the very first attempt and perhaps another route might be found. But the abbé explained how much effort had already gone into the failed plan: it took four years to make his tools, and then two years of scraping and digging through rock-hard earth, removing huge stones he once thought immovable, all in the hope of advancing a small amount each day. He had disposed of the earth and debris by breaking into a staircase and dropping it in, but now the well was so blocked that hiding more material would alert the guards. He had managed his strength meticulously, believing he was near to freedom, only to have his hopes dashed at the last moment. So, he insisted, nothing could persuade him to try again in opposition to God’s apparent will. Dantès bowed his head to hide that, despite sympathizing with the failed plan, he was also relieved to have another companion. The abbé sat on Edmond’s bed, dejected, while Dantès remained standing, reflecting. Escape had never even seemed possible to him: digging a tunnel for fifty feet, laboring for three years just to reach a dangerous cliff, facing the risk of sentry gunfire, then jumping into waves and swimming three miles to shore, all seemed so daunting Dantès had resigned himself to die in prison. Yet, seeing the old man willing to fight so hard for his life inspired Dantès anew. Faria, older and weaker, had completed the unthinkable, failing only because of a miscalculation, and had made all the needed tools. If the abbé could do so much, why couldn't Dantès? Faria had spent years digging fifty feet—Dantès could dig a hundred. Faria, at fifty, devoted three years to the work—Dantès, younger and stronger, could devote six. Faria, a scholar, was willing to risk swimming to an island miles away—shouldn’t Dantès, an experienced sailor and diver, be willing to do the same? He had swum for fun longer distances and dived to great depths before. Inspired, Dantès immediately resolved to follow Faria’s courageous example, determining that what one man had done could surely be done again."

We must pierce through the corridor by forming a side opening about the middle, as it were the top part of a cross. This time you will lay your plans more accurately; we shall get out into the gallery you have described; kill the sentinel who guards it, and make our escape. All we require to insure success is courage, and that you possess, and strength, which I am not deficient in; as for patience, you have abundantly proved yours—you shall now see me prove mine.”\n“One instant, my dear friend,” replied the abbé; “it is clear you do not understand the nature of the courage with which I am endowed, and what use I intend making of my strength. As for patience, I consider that I have abundantly exercised that in beginning every morning the task of the night before, and every night renewing the task of the day. But then, young man (and I pray of you to give me your full attention), then I thought I could not be doing anything displeasing to the Almighty in trying to set an innocent being at liberty—one who had committed no offence, and merited not condemnation.”\n“And have your notions changed?” asked Dantès with much surprise; “do you think yourself more guilty in making the attempt since you have encountered me?”\n“No; neither do I wish to incur guilt. Hitherto I have fancied myself merely waging war against circumstances, not men. I have thought it no sin to bore through a wall, or destroy a staircase; but I cannot so easily persuade myself to pierce a heart or take away a life.”\nA slight movement of surprise escaped Dantès.\n“Is it possible,” said he, “that where your liberty is at stake you can allow any such scruple to deter you from obtaining it?”\n“Tell me,” replied Faria, “what has hindered you from knocking down your jailer with a piece of wood torn from your bedstead, dressing yourself in his clothes, and endeavoring to escape?”\n“Simply the fact that the idea never occurred to me,” answered Dantès.\n“Because,” said the old man, “the natural repugnance to the commission of such a crime prevented you from thinking of it; and so it ever is because in simple and allowable things our natural instincts keep us from deviating from the strict line of duty. The tiger, whose nature teaches him to delight in shedding blood, needs but the sense of smell to show him when his prey is within his reach, and by following this instinct he is enabled to measure the leap necessary to permit him to spring on his victim; but man, on the contrary, loathes the idea of blood—it is not alone that the laws of social life inspire him with a shrinking dread of taking life; his natural construction and physiological formation——”\nDantès was confused and silent at this explanation of the thoughts which had unconsciously been working in his mind, or rather soul; for there are two distinct sorts of ideas, those that proceed from the head and those that emanate from the heart.",

But back then, young man (and I ask you to pay close attention), I felt I was not acting against God's will by trying to free an innocent person—someone who had committed no crime and didn't deserve his sentence.\" \"And your opinions have changed?\" Dantès asked, sounding very surprised. \"Do you feel more guilty attempting this escape since you've met me?\" \"No, nor do I want to become guilty. Up until now, I saw myself as simply fighting against circumstances, not against people. I didn't consider it wrong to bore through a wall or tear down a staircase, but I cannot so easily convince myself to stab a heart or take a life.\" Dantès showed a slight flicker of surprise. \"Is it possible,\" he said, \"that when your freedom is at stake, you would let such a moral reservation stop you from getting it?\" \"Tell me,\" Faria responded, \"what has prevented you from knocking out your jailer with a piece of wood from your bed, putting on his clothes, and trying to escape?\" \"Simply that the idea never crossed my mind,\" Dantès admitted. \"Because,\" the old man explained, \"the natural aversion to committing such a crime prevented you from even thinking of it. And that's how it is: our natural instincts, in simple and permissible situations, keep us from deviating from the correct path. A tiger, whose nature is to enjoy shedding blood, only needs its sense of smell to know when prey is near, and following this instinct allows it to judge the leap needed to pounce. But humans, on the contrary, are repelled by the thought of blood. It's not just that the rules of society make us dread taking a life; our natural structure and biological makeup--\" Dantès was confused and silent at this explanation, which shed light on the thoughts that had been unconsciously influencing his mind, or rather his soul, because there are two distinct types of thoughts: those that come from the intellect and those that originate from the heart.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "After a period of deep thought, the young man suddenly declared that he had found the answer they were looking for. Faria reacted with surprise and eagerness, asking what he had discovered. The young man pointed out that the tunnel Faria had dug from his cell ran parallel to the outer gallery and was only about fifteen feet away from it. He suggested that if they made a side passage from their tunnel—like the crossbar on a letter T—they could reach the gallery, overpower the guard, and escape. All they needed was bravery, which Faria clearly had, and strength, which the young man himself could provide; as for patience, Faria's endurance had already been proven, and now the young man would show his own. The abbé stopped him, explaining that the type of courage he had wasn't about violence. He had shown his patience by repeatedly working on his escape, believing it was right to free an innocent man. Now, he hesitated to shed blood in their escape, saying he could justify breaking walls but not hurting another person. Dantès was surprised, struggling to understand how Faria's moral qualms could outweigh his desire for freedom. Faria explained that, just as Dantès had never thought to attack a jailer to escape, it was because their conscience and nature restrained them. While a beast may kill instinctively, humans are naturally repelled by violence, not only because of society's rules but because of their own nature. Dantès was left contemplative and silent, realizing this explanation matched feelings he barely understood, showing that some ideas come from reason and others from the heart."

Those that have been crowned with full success have been long meditated upon, and carefully arranged; such, for instance, as the escape of the Duc de Beaufort from the Château de Vincennes, that of the Abbé Dubuquoi from For l’Evêque; of Latude from the Bastille. Then there are those for which chance sometimes affords opportunity, and those are the best of all. Let us, therefore, wait patiently for some favorable moment, and when it presents itself, profit by it.”\n“Ah,” said Dantès, “you might well endure the tedious delay; you were constantly employed in the task you set yourself, and when weary with toil, you had your hopes to refresh and encourage you.”\n“I assure you,” replied the old man, “I did not turn to that source for recreation or support.”\n“What did you do then?”\n“I wrote or studied.”\n“Were you then permitted the use of pens, ink, and paper?”\n“Oh, no,” answered the abbé; “I had none but what I made for myself.”\n“You made paper, pens and ink?”\n“Yes.”\nDantès gazed with admiration, but he had some difficulty in believing. Faria saw this.\n“When you pay me a visit in my cell, my young friend,” said he, “I will show you an entire work, the fruits of the thoughts and reflections of my whole life; many of them meditated over in the shades of the Colosseum at Rome, at the foot of St. Mark’s column at Venice, and on the borders of the Arno at Florence, little imagining at the time that they would be arranged in order within the walls of the Château d’If. The work I speak of is called A Treatise on the Possibility of a General Monarchy in Italy, and will make one large quarto volume.”\n“And on what have you written all this?”\n“On two of my shirts. I invented a preparation that makes linen as smooth and as easy to write on as parchment.”\n“You are, then, a chemist?”\n“Somewhat; I know Lavoisier, and was the intimate friend of Cabanis.”\n“But for such a work you must have needed books—had you any?”\n“I had nearly five thousand volumes in my library at Rome; but after reading them over many times, I found out that with one hundred and fifty well-chosen books a man possesses, if not a complete summary of all human knowledge, at least all that a man need really know. I devoted three years of my life to reading and studying these one hundred and fifty volumes, till I knew them nearly by heart; so that since I have been in prison, a very slight effort of memory has enabled me to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open before me. I could recite you the whole of Thucydides, Xenophon, Plutarch, Titus Livius, Tacitus, Strada, Jornandes, Dante, Montaigne, Shakespeare, Spinoza, Machiavelli, and Bossuet. I name only the most important.”\n“You are, doubtless, acquainted with a variety of languages, so as to have been able to read all these?”\n“Yes, I speak five of the modern tongues—that is to say, German, French, Italian, English, and Spanish; by the aid of ancient Greek I learned modern Greek—I don’t speak it so well as I could wish, but I am still trying to improve myself.”\n“Improve yourself!” repeated Dantès; “why, how can you manage to do so?”\n“Why, I made a vocabulary of the words I knew; turned, returned, and arranged them, so as to enable me to express my thoughts through their medium. I know nearly one thousand words, which is all that is absolutely necessary, although I believe there are nearly one hundred thousand in the dictionaries. I cannot hope to be very fluent, but I certainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes; and that would be quite as much as I should ever require.”\nStronger grew the wonder of Dantès, who almost fancied he had to do with one gifted with supernatural powers; still hoping to find some imperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings, he added, “Then if you were not furnished with pens, how did you manage to write the work you speak of?”\n“I made myself some excellent ones, which would be universally preferred to all others if once known. You are aware what huge whitings are served to us on maigre days. Well, I selected the cartilages of the heads of these fishes, and you can scarcely imagine the delight with which I welcomed the arrival of each Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday, as affording me the means of increasing my stock of pens; for I will freely confess that my historical labors have been my greatest solace and relief. While retracing the past, I forget the present; and traversing at will the path of history I cease to remember that I am myself a prisoner.”\n“But the ink,” said Dantès; “of what did you make your ink?”\n“There was formerly a fireplace in my dungeon,” replied Faria, “but it was closed up long ere I became an occupant of this prison. Still, it must have been many years in use, for it was thickly covered with a coating of soot; this soot I dissolved in a portion of the wine brought to me every Sunday, and I assure you a better ink cannot be desired. For very important notes, for which closer attention is required, I pricked one of my fingers, and wrote with my own blood.”\n“And when,” asked Dantès, “may I see all this?”\n“Whenever you please,” replied the abbé.\n“Oh, then let it be directly!” exclaimed the young man.\n“Follow me, then,” said the abbé, as he re-entered the subterranean passage, in which he soon disappeared, followed by Dantès.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Faria reflected on famous prison escapes, noting they were rarely successful. He stated that truly successful escapes were carefully planned over time, citing examples like the Duc de Beaufort or Latude. He also mentioned that sometimes chance provides the best opportunities, advising Dantès that they should patiently wait for such a moment and seize it. Dantès commented that Faria must have found the waiting easier because he was constantly busy and sustained by hope. Faria denied that hope was his main support, stating instead that he spent his time writing and studying. Dantès asked if he had been allowed writing materials. Faria replied that he had made them himself. Dantès expressed surprise and difficulty believing this. Noticing Dantès's skepticism, Faria invited him to his cell to see a complete book he had written, which contained thoughts from his entire life, conceived in various places like Rome, Venice, and Florence, never imagining they would be compiled in prison. He identified the work as 'A Treatise on the Possibility of a General Monarchy in Italy', a large quarto volume. Dantès asked what he wrote it on, and Faria revealed it was on his shirts, explaining he had invented a way to treat the linen to make it like parchment. Dantès then asked if he was a chemist. Faria confirmed he was somewhat knowledgeable, mentioning his acquaintance with Lavoisier and friendship with Cabanis. Dantès inquired about the books needed for such a treatise. Faria explained he had nearly five thousand volumes in his library but learned that one hundred and fifty well-chosen books could provide most essential human knowledge. He spent three years intensely studying these 150 books, memorizing them so completely he could recall their contents as if reading them, listing authors like Thucydides, Dante, Shakespeare, and others. Dantès asked about his language skills to read these works. Faria replied he spoke five modern languages (German, French, Italian, English, Spanish) and used ancient Greek to learn modern Greek, which he was still working to improve. Dantès questioned how he could improve in prison. Faria explained his method involved building a vocabulary from known words and arranging them to express ideas. He knew about a thousand words, enough for explaining needs, though far fewer than in dictionaries, acknowledging he couldn't be fluent but could communicate essentials. Dantès's amazement grew, almost seeing him as supernatural, but still seeking a human imperfection, he repeated the question about how he wrote without pens. Faria described making excellent pens from the cartilage of fish heads served on specific days (Wednesday, Friday, Saturday), finding great joy in this supply and considering his historical writing his greatest solace and escape from being a prisoner. Dantès asked about the ink. Faria explained it came from soot from the old fireplace in his cell, dissolved in his weekly wine ration, noting it made excellent ink. For very important notes, he used his own blood. Dantès then eagerly asked when he could see all this. Faria replied he could see it whenever he wished. Dantès immediately asked to see it then and there. Faria agreed, leading Dantès back into the underground passage towards his cell, and they both disappeared into the darkness.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Since I've been imprisoned,\" Faria began, \"I've considered every famous escape attempt I can recall. Most do not succeed. The ones that work have been carefully planned over a long period, such as the escape of the Duc de Beaufort from the Château de Vincennes, Abbé Dubuquoi from For l’Evêque, and Latude’s escape from the Bastille. Sometimes, though, pure luck offers a chance, and that is often the best kind of opportunity. So, we must wait patiently for the right moment and seize it when it comes.\"\n\nDantès replied, \"You can bear such a wait, since you always had something to occupy you. When your work tired you, your hopes kept you going.\"\n\nFaria assured him, \"Honestly, I didn't rely on either of those for comfort or distraction.\"\n\n\"Then what did you do?\" asked Dantès.\n\n\"I wrote and studied.\"\n\n\"Were you allowed pens, ink, and paper?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the abbé, \"I had to make them myself.\"\n\n\"You made your own paper, pens, and ink?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nDantès watched him with amazement, unable to believe it. Faria noticed this and offered, \"When you visit me in my cell, I’ll show you a work I’ve written – the product of years of thought and reflection, much of it conceived in Rome’s Colosseum, at the foot of St. Mark’s column in Venice, and along the banks of the Arno in Florence – though I never imagined it would be composed within the Château d’If’s walls. The work’s title is ‘A Treatise on the Possibility of a General Monarchy in Italy,’ and it fills a large quarto volume.\"\n\n\"And where did you write all of this?\"\n\n\"On two of my shirts. I invented a way to prepare linen so it is as smooth and writable as parchment.\"\n\n\"You’re a chemist, then?\"\n\n\"To a degree; I know Lavoisier’s work and was good friends with Cabanis.\"\n\n\"But didn’t you need books for your work? Did you have any?\"\n\n\"In Rome, I had almost five thousand books, but after rereading them many times, I realized that with a selection of about a hundred and fifty good books, a person can gather a full summary of all useful knowledge. I spent three years reading and studying these hundreds and fifty volumes until I almost memorized them. So now, during my imprisonment, it takes only a little effort to recall their contents as clearly as if I had the books open in front of me. I could recite all of Thucydides, Xenophon, Plutarch, Livy, Tacitus, Strada, Jornandes, Dante, Montaigne, Shakespeare, Spinoza, Machiavelli, and Bossuet – and those are just the best examples.\"\n\n\"You must know many languages, to have read them all?\"\n\n\"Indeed, I speak five modern languages: German, French, Italian, English, and Spanish. With my knowledge of ancient Greek, I learned modern Greek too, though I’m not as fluent as I wish; I’m still practicing.\"\n\n\"How do you keep improving?\" Dantès asked.\n\n\"I made a vocabulary of words I know and kept sorting and reviewing them until I could use them to express my thoughts. I know about a thousand words, which is enough for most needs, even though dictionaries list many more. I may not be very fluent, but I could always make myself understood, which is all I’d need.\"\n\nDantès was more and more amazed, almost feeling Faria had supernatural talents. Still skeptical, he pressed, \"But if you had no pens, how did you write your book?\"\n\n\"I made some, and they are so good that people would prefer them if they knew. You know the large whitings we get on maigre days? I used the cartilage from their heads. So, each Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday, I looked forward to getting more pens. Writing my history has truly been my greatest comfort and distraction, helping me forget I’m a prisoner as I immerse myself in the past.\"\n\n\"And what about the ink? How did you make that?\" Dantès asked.\n\n\"There used to be a fireplace in my cell, but it was closed up before I arrived, though it left a thick layer of soot. I mixed this soot with some of the wine I get every Sunday, making excellent ink. For important notes, when I needed even greater care, I pricked my finger and wrote with my own blood.\"\n\n\"When can I see all this?\" asked Dantès.\n\n\"Whenever you wish,\" said the abbé.\n\n\"Then let’s go now!\" cried Dantès.\n\n\"Come with me,\" said the abbé, leading the way back into the underground passage, with Dantès following close behind."

The floor of the abbé’s cell was paved, and it had been by raising one of the stones in the most obscure corner that Faria had been able to commence the laborious task of which Dantès had witnessed the completion.\nAs he entered the chamber of his friend, Dantès cast around one eager and searching glance in quest of the expected marvels, but nothing more than common met his view.\n“It is well,” said the abbé; “we have some hours before us—it is now just a quarter past twelve o’clock.” Instinctively Dantès turned round to observe by what watch or clock the abbé had been able so accurately to specify the hour.\n“Look at this ray of light which enters by my window,” said the abbé, “and then observe the lines traced on the wall. Well, by means of these lines, which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth, and the ellipse it describes round the sun, I am enabled to ascertain the precise hour with more minuteness than if I possessed a watch; for that might be broken or deranged in its movements, while the sun and earth never vary in their appointed paths.”\nThis last explanation was wholly lost upon Dantès, who had always imagined, from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in the Mediterranean, that it moved, and not the earth. A double movement of the globe he inhabited, and of which he could feel nothing, appeared to him perfectly impossible. Each word that fell from his companion’s lips seemed fraught with the mysteries of science, as worthy of digging out as the gold and diamonds in the mines of Guzerat and Golconda, which he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his earliest youth.\n“Come,” said he to the abbé, “I am anxious to see your treasures.”\nThe abbé smiled, and, proceeding to the disused fireplace, raised, by the help of his chisel, a long stone, which had doubtless been the hearth, beneath which was a cavity of considerable depth, serving as a safe depository of the articles mentioned to Dantès.\n“What do you wish to see first?” asked the abbé.\n“Oh, your great work on the monarchy of Italy!”\nFaria then drew forth from his hiding-place three or four rolls of linen, laid one over the other, like folds of papyrus. These rolls consisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long; they were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing, so legible that Dantès could easily read it, as well as make out the sense—it being in Italian, a language he, as a Provençal, perfectly understood.\n“There,” said he, “there is the work complete. I wrote the word finis at the end of the sixty-eighth strip about a week ago. I have torn up two of my shirts, and as many handkerchiefs as I was master of, to complete the precious pages. Should I ever get out of prison and find in all Italy a printer courageous enough to publish what I have composed, my literary reputation is forever secured.”\n“I see,” answered Dantès. “Now let me behold the curious pens with which you have written your work.”\n“Look!” said Faria, showing to the young man a slender stick about six inches long, and much resembling the size of the handle of a fine painting-brush, to the end of which was tied, by a piece of thread, one of those cartilages of which the abbé had before spoken to Dantès; it was pointed, and divided at the nib like an ordinary pen. Dantès examined it with intense admiration, then looked around to see the instrument with which it had been shaped so correctly into form.\n“Ah, yes,” said Faria; “the penknife. That’s my masterpiece. I made it, as well as this larger knife, out of an old iron candlestick.” The penknife was sharp and keen as a razor; as for the other knife, it would serve a double purpose, and with it one could cut and thrust.\nDantès examined the various articles shown to him with the same attention that he had bestowed on the curiosities and strange tools exhibited in the shops at Marseilles as the works of the savages in the South Seas from whence they had been brought by the different trading vessels.\n“As for the ink,” said Faria, “I told you how I managed to obtain that—and I only just make it from time to time, as I require it.”\n“One thing still puzzles me,” observed Dantès, “and that is how you managed to do all this by daylight?”\n“I worked at night also,” replied Faria.\n“Night!—why, for Heaven’s sake, are your eyes like cats’, that you can see to work in the dark?”\n“Indeed they are not; but God has supplied man with the intelligence that enables him to overcome the limitations of natural conditions. I furnished myself with a light.”\n“You did? Pray tell me how.”\n“I separated the fat from the meat served to me, melted it, and so made oil—here is my lamp.” So saying, the abbé exhibited a sort of torch very similar to those used in public illuminations.\n“But how do you procure a light?”\n“Oh, here are two flints and a piece of burnt linen.”\n“And matches?”\n“I pretended that I had a disorder of the skin, and asked for a little sulphur, which was readily supplied.”\nDantès laid the different things he had been looking at on the table, and stood with his head drooping on his breast, as though overwhelmed by the perseverance and strength of Faria’s mind.\n“You have not seen all yet,” continued Faria, “for I did not think it wise to trust all my treasures in the same hiding-place. Let us shut this one up.” They put the stone back in its place; the abbé sprinkled a little dust over it to conceal the traces of its having been removed, rubbed his foot well on it to make it assume the same appearance as the other, and then, going towards his bed, he removed it from the spot it stood in. Behind the head of the bed, and concealed by a stone fitting in so closely as to defy all suspicion, was a hollow space, and in this space a ladder of cords between twenty-five and thirty feet in length. Dantès closely and eagerly examined it; he found it firm, solid, and compact enough to bear any weight.\n“Who supplied you with the materials for making this wonderful work?”\n“I tore up several of my shirts, and ripped out the seams in the sheets of my bed, during my three years’ imprisonment at Fenestrelle; and when I was removed to the Château d’If, I managed to bring the ravellings with me, so that I have been able to finish my work here.”\n“And was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed?”\n“Oh, no, for when I had taken out the thread I required, I hemmed the edges over again.”\n“With what?”\n“With this needle,” said the abbé, as, opening his ragged vestments, he showed Dantès a long, sharp fish-bone, with a small perforated eye for the thread, a small portion of which still remained in it.\n“I once thought,” continued Faria, “of removing these iron bars, and letting myself down from the window, which, as you see, is somewhat wider than yours, although I should have enlarged it still more preparatory to my flight; however, I discovered that I should merely have dropped into a sort of inner court, and I therefore renounced the project altogether as too full of risk and danger. Nevertheless, I carefully preserved my ladder against one of those unforeseen opportunities of which I spoke just now, and which sudden chance frequently brings about.”\nWhile affecting to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder, the mind of Dantès was, in fact, busily occupied by the idea that a person so intelligent, ingenious, and clear-sighted as the abbé might probably be able to solve the dark mystery of his own misfortunes, where he himself could see nothing.",

As Dantès stepped into his friend's chamber, he eagerly looked around, hoping to find the extraordinary things he had heard about, but initially saw nothing out of the ordinary. 'It's fine,' the abbé said. 'We have several hours. It's precisely a quarter past twelve now.' Dantès instinctively turned, curious as to how the abbé could tell the time so accurately without a timepiece. 'Observe this beam of light entering through my window,' the abbé instructed, 'and then look at the lines etched on the wall. Using these lines, which align with the earth's two motions and its elliptical path around the sun, I can determine the exact hour with greater precision than if I owned a watch, which could break or malfunction. The sun and earth, conversely, never deviate from their set courses.' This final part of the explanation made no sense to Dantès, who, having seen the sun rise over the mountains and set in the Mediterranean, believed it was the sun that moved, not the earth. The idea of the planet he lived on having dual movements, which he couldn't feel, seemed completely impossible. Every word from his companion's mouth felt like it contained the secrets of science, as valuable as the gold and diamonds from the mines of Guzerat and Golconda, which he vaguely remembered visiting on a trip in his early youth. 'Come,' he urged the abbé, 'I'm eager to see your treasures.' The abbé smiled, walked to the old fireplace, and using his chisel, lifted a long stone that was likely the hearth. Beneath it was a relatively deep space, serving as a secure storage for the items he had mentioned to Dantès. 'What would you like to see first?' the abbé inquired. 'Oh, your significant work on the monarchy of Italy!' Faria then retrieved three or four rolls of linen from the hidden space, stacked one upon the other like ancient scrolls. These were strips of cloth, about four inches wide and eighteen inches long, each carefully numbered and densely covered in writing. The script was so clear that Dantès, being from Provence and understanding Italian perfectly, could easily read it and grasp its meaning. 'There,' he said, 'is the complete work. I wrote the word finis at the end of the sixty-eighth strip about a week ago. I sacrificed two shirts and all my handkerchiefs to finish these valuable pages. If I ever get out of prison and find a printer in Italy brave enough to publish what I've written, my literary reputation will be secured forever.' 'I see,' Dantès responded. 'Now let me examine the intriguing pens you used to write your work.' 'Look!' said Faria, showing the young man a slender stick about six inches long, resembling the handle of a fine paintbrush. Tied to the end with thread was one of the cartilages the abbé had spoken of earlier; it was sharpened and split at the tip like a standard pen. Dantès examined it with great admiration, then looked around for the tool used to shape it so perfectly. 'Ah, yes,' Faria said, 'the penknife. That is my finest creation. I made it, along with this larger knife, from an old iron candlestick.' The penknife was incredibly sharp, like a razor. The other knife was dual-purpose, usable for both cutting and thrusting. Dantès inspected the various objects shown to him with the same intense curiosity he had displayed when viewing the strange tools and curiosities in Marseilles shops, supposedly made by natives from the South Seas and brought back by trading ships. 'As for the ink,' Faria said, 'I explained how I managed to get that – I only produce it in small amounts as I need it.' 'One thing still confuses me,' Dantès remarked, 'and that's how you managed to accomplish all this during daylight?' 'I worked at night as well,' Faria replied. 'Night! Good heavens, do you have eyes like a cat, that you can see to work in the dark?' 'Indeed I do not. But God has given mankind the intellect to overcome natural constraints. I provided myself with light.' 'You did? Please tell me how.' 'I separated the fat from the meat I was served, melted it, and made oil. Here is my lamp.' Saying this, the abbé showed him a kind of torch similar to those used for public illuminations. 'But how do you light it?' 'Oh, I have two flints and a piece of burnt linen.' 'And matches?' 'I claimed to have a skin ailment and asked for a little sulfur, which they readily supplied.' Dantès placed the various items he had been examining on the table and stood with his head bowed, seemingly overwhelmed by the sheer persistence and intellectual power of Faria. 'You haven't seen everything yet,' Faria continued, 'as I didn't think it wise to keep all my treasures in one place. Let's close this up.' They replaced the stone. The abbé sprinkled a little dust over it to hide any signs of its removal, rubbed his foot firmly to make it look like the surrounding floor, and then moved his bed. Behind the head of the bed, hidden by a perfectly fitted stone that defied suspicion, was a hollow space. Within this space was a rope ladder, between twenty-five and thirty feet long. Dantès examined it closely and eagerly, finding it strong, sturdy, and able to support significant weight. 'Who gave you the materials to make this remarkable creation?' Dantès asked. 'During my three years of imprisonment at Fenestrelle,' Faria explained, 'I tore up several shirts and pulled the threads from the seams of my bed sheets. When I was transferred to the Château d'If, I managed to bring the unravelled threads with me, allowing me to finish my work here.' 'And wasn't it discovered that your sheets were unhemmed?' 'Oh, no, because after taking the thread I needed, I re-hemmed the edges.' 'With what?' 'With this needle,' the abbé said, opening his tattered clothes to show Dantès a long, sharp fish bone with a small hole for thread, a bit of which still remained in it. 'I once considered,' Faria continued, 'removing these iron bars and lowering myself from the window, which, as you can see, is somewhat wider than yours, although I would have enlarged it further before attempting escape. However, I realized I would merely drop into an inner courtyard, so I completely abandoned the plan as too risky and dangerous. Nevertheless, I carefully kept my ladder for one of those unforeseen opportunities I mentioned just now, which sudden chance often brings about.' While appearing deeply engrossed in inspecting the ladder, Dantès' mind was, in fact, busy with the thought that someone as intelligent, inventive, and perceptive as the abbé might possibly be able to unravel the dark mystery of his own misfortunes, where he himself could see nothing.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "After making their way without too much difficulty through the underground tunnel (though it was too low for them to stand upright), the two companions arrived at the far end, where the corridor connected to the abbé’s cell. From this point, the tunnel narrowed so much that it barely allowed a person to crawl on hands and knees. The cell’s floor was paved, and it was by lifting a stone in the darkest part of the room that Faria had started his exhausting work, the end of which Dantès had now witnessed. When Dantès entered his friend's chamber, he eagerly looked around for the anticipated wonders, but found nothing out of the ordinary. \n\n“It is good,” the abbé commented, “we have several hours ahead of us—it's just past twelve now.” Dantès instinctively turned to see how Faria could tell the time so accurately.\n\n“See that ray of sunlight entering my window?” the abbé said. “And notice the lines on the wall? Using these marks, which track the earth’s motion around the sun, I can determine the exact time more precisely than with a watch, which can break, while the earth and sun never fail in their paths.”\n\nThis explanation went over Dantès’ head; he had always believed from watching the sunrise and sunset that the sun moved, not the earth. The idea of the earth moving in two ways, while he felt nothing, struck him as impossible. Every word from the abbé felt to Dantès as mysterious and valuable as gold or jewels. \n\n“Come,” he said to the abbé, “show me your treasures.”\n\nThe abbé smiled, went to the old fireplace, and with a chisel lifted a long stone—likely the hearthstone—under which there was a deep cavity where he kept his valuables. \n\n“What do you want to see first?” the abbé asked.\n\n“Your great work on the monarchy of Italy!”\n\nFaria took out several rolls of linen, stacked like papyrus scrolls. Each was a narrow strip of cloth, heavily numbered and filled with clear Italian writing that Dantès, as a Provençal, could easily read.\n\n“There,” said Faria, “is the complete work. I finished the last of sixty-eight strips a week ago. I tore up shirts and handkerchiefs to make these pages. If I ever leave prison and find a brave publisher in Italy, my literary fame will be assured.”\n\n“I see,” said Dantès. “Now let me see the unusual pens you used.”\n\nFaria showed him a thin stick tied with thread to a small pointed cartilage, like a pen. Dantès examined it, admiring the craftsmanship, then looked for the tool that shaped it.\n\n“Ah yes, the penknife. That's my masterpiece. I made it and that larger knife from an old iron candlestick.” The penknife was as sharp as a razor, and the other could cut or stab.\n\nDantès examined these items as he would marvel at the exotic tools brought by ships to Marseilles from distant islands.\n\n“As for ink,” Faria continued, “I told you how I made it and prepare it only as needed.”\n\n“One thing still puzzles me,” said Dantès, “how did you do all this during the day?”\n\n“I worked at night too,” replied Faria.\n\n“At night? Can your eyes see in the dark like a cat’s?”\n\n“No, but God gave us intelligence to overcome our natural limits. I made myself a lamp.”\n\n“You did? How?”\n\n“I separated the fat from my meat, melted it, and made oil. Here is my lamp.” The abbé showed a makeshift torch, like those used in celebrations.\n\n“But how did you light it?”\n\n“Here are two flints and burnt cloth.”\n\n“And matches?”\n\n“I pretended to have a skin disorder and requested a little sulfur, which they supplied.”\n\nDantès put the items back on the table, humbled by Faria’s resourcefulness and determination.\n\n“You haven’t seen everything,” Faria said, “since I didn’t think it wise to keep all my treasures in one spot. Let's close up this one.” They put the stone back, dusted and disguised its displacement, then Faria moved his bed. Concealed behind it by a seamlessly fitting stone was a hollow containing a rope ladder, twenty-five to thirty feet in length. Dantès eagerly inspected it, finding it sturdy.\n\n“Where did you get materials for this remarkable creation?”\n\n“I tore shirts and sheets during my three-year imprisonment at Fenestrelle, and brought the threads to the Château d’If, where I finished it.”\n\n“And no one noticed your sheets were altered?”\n\n“No, I hemmed the edges again after taking the thread.”\n\n“With what?”\n\n“With this needle,” the abbé said, revealing a long fish-bone with a hole for thread.\n\n“I once tried to remove these bars and escape out the window, which is wider than yours. But I learned it only led to an interior courtyard, so I abandoned the plan. However, I kept my ladder in case an unexpected opportunity arose.”\n\nWhile pretending to study the ladder, Dantès was in fact thinking that someone as clever and inventive as the abbé might be able to unravel the mystery behind Dantès’s own misfortunes, which were beyond his own understanding."

          "text_segment": "What are you thinking of?” asked the abbé smilingly, imputing the deep abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe and wonder.\n“I was reflecting, in the first place,” replied Dantès, “upon the enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to reach the high perfection to which you have attained. What would you not have accomplished if you had been free?”\n“Possibly nothing at all; the overflow of my brain would probably, in a state of freedom, have evaporated in a thousand follies; misfortune is needed to bring to light the treasures of the human intellect. Compression is needed to explode gunpowder. Captivity has brought my mental faculties to a focus; and you are well aware that from the collision of clouds electricity is produced—from electricity, lightning, from lightning, illumination.”\n“No,” replied Dantès. “I know nothing. Some of your words are to me quite empty of meaning. You must be blessed indeed to possess the knowledge you have.”\nThe abbé smiled. “Well,” said he, “but you had another subject for your thoughts; did you not say so just now?”\n“I did!”\n“You have told me as yet but one of them—let me hear the other.”\n“It was this,—that while you had related to me all the particulars of your past life, you were perfectly unacquainted with mine.”\n“Your life, my young friend, has not been of sufficient length to admit of your having passed through any very important events.”\n“It has been long enough to inflict on me a great and undeserved misfortune. I would fain fix the source of it on man that I may no longer vent reproaches upon Heaven.”\n“Then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged?”\n“I do, indeed; and this I swear by the two beings most dear to me upon earth,—my father and Mercédès.”\n“Come,” said the abbé, closing his hiding-place, and pushing the bed back to its original situation, “let me hear your story.”\nDantès obeyed, and commenced what he called his history, but which consisted only of the account of a voyage to India, and two or three voyages to the Levant, until he arrived at the recital of his last cruise, with the death of Captain Leclere, and the receipt of a packet to be delivered by himself to the grand marshal; his interview with that personage, and his receiving, in place of the packet brought, a letter addressed to a Monsieur Noirtier—his arrival at Marseilles, and interview with his father—his affection for Mercédès, and their nuptual feast—his arrest and subsequent examination, his temporary detention at the Palais de Justice, and his final imprisonment in the Château d’If. From this point everything was a blank to Dantès—he knew nothing more, not even the length of time he had been imprisoned. His recital finished, the abbé reflected long and earnestly.\n“There is,” said he, at the end of his meditations, “a clever maxim, which bears upon what I was saying to you some little while ago, and that is, that unless wicked ideas take root in a naturally depraved mind, human nature, in a right and wholesome state, revolts at crime. Still, from an artificial civilization have originated wants, vices, and false tastes, which occasionally become so powerful as to stifle within us all good feelings, and ultimately to lead us into guilt and wickedness. From this view of things, then, comes the axiom that if you visit to discover the author of any bad action, seek first to discover the person to whom the perpetration of that bad action could be in any way advantageous. Now, to apply it in your case,—to whom could your disappearance have been serviceable?”\n“To no one, by Heaven! I was a very insignificant person.”\n“Do not speak thus, for your reply evinces neither logic nor philosophy; everything is relative, my dear young friend, from the king who stands in the way of his successor, to the employee who keeps his rival out of a place. Now, in the event of the king’s death, his successor inherits a crown,—when the employee dies, the supernumerary steps into his shoes, and receives his salary of twelve thousand livres. Well, these twelve thousand livres are his civil list, and are as essential to him as the twelve millions of a king. Everyone, from the highest to the lowest degree, has his place on the social ladder, and is beset by stormy passions and conflicting interests, as in Descartes’ theory of pressure and impulsion. But these forces increase as we go higher, so that we have a spiral which in defiance of reason rests upon the apex and not on the base. Now let us return to your particular world. You say you were on the point of being made captain of the Pharaon?”\n“Yes.”\n“And about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl?”\n“Yes.”\n“Now, could anyone have had any interest in preventing the accomplishment of these two things? But let us first settle the question as to its being the interest of anyone to hinder you from being captain of the Pharaon. What say you?”\n“I cannot believe such was the case. I was generally liked on board, and had the sailors possessed the right of selecting a captain themselves, I feel convinced their choice would have fallen on me. There was only one person among the crew who had any feeling of ill-will towards me. I had quarelled with him some time previously, and had even challenged him to fight me; but he refused.”\n“Now we are getting on. And what was this man’s name?”\n“Danglars.”\n“What rank did he hold on board?”\n“He was supercargo.”\n“And had you been captain, should you have retained him in his employment?”\n“Not if the choice had remained with me, for I had frequently observed inaccuracies in his accounts.”\n“Good again! Now then, tell me, was any person present during your last conversation with Captain Leclere?”\n“No; we were quite alone.”\n“Could your conversation have been overheard by anyone?”\n“It might, for the cabin door was open—and—stay; now I recollect,—Danglars himself passed by just as Captain Leclere was giving me the packet for the grand marshal.”\n“That’s better,” cried the abbé; “now we are on the right scent. Did you take anybody with you when you put into the port of Elba?”\n“Nobody.”\n“Somebody there received your packet, and gave you a letter in place of it, I think?”\n“Yes; the grand marshal did.”\n“And what did you do with that letter?”\n“Put it into my portfolio.”\n“You had your portfolio with you, then? Now, how could a sailor find room in his pocket for a portfolio large enough to contain an official letter?”\n“You are right; it was left on board.”\n“Then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in the portfolio?”\n“No.”\n“And what did you do with this same letter while returning from Porto-Ferrajo to the vessel?”\n“I carried it in my hand.”\n“So that when you went on board the Pharaon, everybody could see that you held a letter in your hand?”\n“Yes.”\n“Danglars, as well as the rest?”\n“Danglars, as well as others.”\n“Now, listen to me, and try to recall every circumstance attending your arrest. Do you recollect the words in which the information against you was formulated?”\n“Oh yes, I read it over three times, and the words sank deeply into my memory.”\n“Repeat it to me.”\nDantès paused a moment, then said, “This is it, word for word: ‘The king’s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion, that one Edmond Dantès, mate on board the Pharaon, this day arrived from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been intrusted by Murat with a packet for the usurper; again, by the usurper, with a letter for the Bonapartist Club in Paris. This proof of his guilt may be procured by his immediate arrest, as the letter will be found either about his person, at his father’s residence, or in his cabin on board the Pharaon.’”\nThe abbé shrugged his shoulders. “The thing is clear as day,” said he; “and you must have had a very confiding nature, as well as a good heart, not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair.”\n“Do you really think so? Ah, that would indeed be infamous.”\n“How did Danglars usually write?”\n“In a handsome, running hand.”\n“And how was the anonymous letter written?”\n“Backhanded.”\nAgain the abbé smiled. “Disguised.”\n“It was very boldly written, if disguised.”\n“Stop a bit,” said the abbé, taking up what he called his pen, and, after dipping it into the ink, he wrote on a piece of prepared linen, with his left hand, the first two or three words of the accusation. Dantès drew back, and gazed on the abbé with a sensation almost amounting to terror.\n“How very astonishing!” cried he at length. “Why your writing exactly resembles that of the accusation.”\n“Simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand; and I have noticed that——”\n“What?”\n“That while the writing of different persons done with the right hand varies, that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform.”\n“You have evidently seen and observed everything.”\n“Let us proceed.”\n“Oh, yes, yes!”\n“Now as regards the second question.”\n“I am listening.”\n“Was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage with Mercédès?”\n“Yes; a young man who loved her.”\n“And his name was——”\n“Fernand.”\n“That is a Spanish name, I think?”\n“He was a Catalan.”\n“You imagine him capable of writing the letter?”\n“Oh, no; he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife into me.”\n“That is in strict accordance with the Spanish character; an assassination they will unhesitatingly commit, but an act of cowardice, never.”\n“Besides,” said Dantès, “the various circumstances mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to him.”\n“You had never spoken of them yourself to anyone?”\n“To no one.”\n“Not even to your mistress?”\n“No, not even to my betrothed.”\n“Then it is Danglars.”\n“I feel quite sure of it now.”\n“Wait a little. Pray, was Danglars acquainted with Fernand?”\n“No—yes, he was. Now I recollect——”\n“What?”\n“To have seen them both sitting at table together under an arbor at Père Pamphile’s the evening before the day fixed for my wedding. They were in earnest conversation. Danglars was joking in a friendly way, but Fernand looked pale and agitated.”\n“Were they alone?”\n“There was a third person with them whom I knew perfectly well, and who had, in all probability made their acquaintance; he was a tailor named Caderousse, but he was very drunk. Stay!—stay!—How strange that it should not have occurred to me before! Now I remember quite well, that on the table round which they were sitting were pens, ink, and paper. Oh, the heartless, treacherous scoundrels!” exclaimed Dantès, pressing his hand to his throbbing brows.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The abbé, smiling, asked what occupied Dantès's thoughts, assuming his deep preoccupation stemmed from astonishment. Dantès responded, saying he was first thinking about the immense intellect and skill the abbé must have used to attain his current level of perfection, and what he might have accomplished if he had been free. The abbé replied that perhaps he would have achieved nothing at all; in freedom, his mental energy might have dispersed in countless foolish pursuits. He argued that misfortune is necessary to reveal the potential of human intelligence, just as compression is needed to explode gunpowder. Captivity, he said, had focused his abilities, and as Dantès knew, lightning comes from the collision of clouds, providing illumination. Dantès admitted his ignorance, stating that some of the abbé's words were meaningless to him, and that he must be truly fortunate to possess such knowledge. The abbé smiled and then asked if Dantès had mentioned having another thought, as he had indicated earlier. Dantès confirmed he had. The abbé pressed him to share it, having heard only the first one. Dantès explained that while the abbé had recounted his entire past, he knew nothing of Dantès's life. The abbé suggested Dantès's young life hadn't been long enough for very significant events. Dantès countered that it had been long enough to bring him great and undeserved suffering, and he wished to find a human source for it so he would stop blaming fate. The abbé then asked if Dantès claimed innocence regarding the crime he was accused of. Dantès affirmed this, swearing by his father and Mercédès, the two most important people in his life. 'Very well,' said the abbé, closing his hidden compartment and pushing the bed back into place, 'tell me your story.' Dantès complied, beginning what he called his history, which started with a voyage to India and two or three trips to the Levant, leading up to his final journey. He described Captain Leclere's death, being entrusted with a packet for the grand marshal, his stop in Elba, meeting the grand marshal, receiving a letter for a Monsieur Noirtier in exchange for the packet, his arrival back in Marseilles, seeing his father, his love for Mercédès and their wedding preparations, his arrest and questioning, brief detention at the courthouse, and his eventual imprisonment in the Château d'If. Beyond this point, Dantès had no memory, not even knowing how long he had been imprisoned. After Dantès finished, the abbé thought long and hard. 'There is,' he said, concluding his thoughts, 'a useful saying related to what I mentioned earlier: unless evil intentions are rooted in a naturally corrupt mind, human nature, when sound, resists crime. However, artificial civilization creates needs, vices, and distorted desires that can become strong enough to suppress good feelings and ultimately lead to guilt and wrongdoing. From this perspective comes the rule that if you seek the perpetrator of a bad deed, first identify the person who could have benefited from it in some way. Now, applying this to your situation, who would your disappearance have served?' 'Absolutely no one!' exclaimed Dantès. 'I was completely insignificant.' 'Do not say that,' the abbé replied, 'for your answer lacks logic and philosophy. Everything is relative, my dear young man, from a king who obstructs his successor to an employee who keeps a rival out of a job. When the king dies, his successor inherits a crown; when the employee dies, the substitute steps into his place and receives his salary of twelve thousand livres. Those twelve thousand livres are his livelihood, as vital to him as a king's twelve million. Everyone, high or low, has their place in society and is subject to intense emotions and conflicting interests, like in Descartes' theory of pressure and impulsion. But these forces grow stronger higher up, creating a spiral that, defying logic, rests on the top, not the bottom. Let's return to your specific world. You said you were on the verge of becoming captain of the Pharaon?' 'Yes,' Dantès confirmed. 'And about to marry a young and beautiful woman?' 'Yes.' 'Now, could anyone have had a motive to prevent both of these things? Let's first address whether anyone had a reason to stop you from becoming captain of the Pharaon. What do you say?' 'I can't believe that was the case,' Dantès replied. 'I was generally well-liked on board, and I'm sure if the sailors could choose the captain, they would have chosen me. There was only one person in the crew who disliked me. I had argued with him sometime before and even challenged him to a duel, but he refused.' 'Now we're making progress,' said the abbé. 'And what was this man's name?' 'Danglars.' 'What was his position on board?' 'He was the supercargo.' 'And if you had become captain, would you have kept him employed?' 'Not if it were up to me, because I had often noticed errors in his accounts.' 'Excellent!' the abbé said. 'Now, tell me, was anyone present during your last conversation with Captain Leclere?' 'No, we were completely alone.' 'Could your conversation have been overheard by someone?' 'It's possible, as the cabin door was open—wait; I just remembered—Danglars himself walked past just as Captain Leclere was giving me the packet for the grand marshal.' 'That's better,' cried the abbé. 'Now we're on the right track. Did you take anyone with you when you stopped at Elba?' 'No one.' 'Someone there received your packet and gave you a letter in its place, I believe?' 'Yes, the grand marshal did.' 'And what did you do with that letter?' 'Put it in my portfolio.' 'You had your portfolio with you, then? How could a sailor find space in his pocket for a portfolio large enough for an official letter?' 'You're right; it was left on board.' 'Then it wasn't until you returned to the ship that you put the letter in the portfolio?' 'No.' 'And what did you do with that letter while coming back from Porto-Ferrajo to the ship?' 'I carried it in my hand.' 'So when you came back on board the Pharaon, everyone could see you were holding a letter?' 'Yes.' 'Including Danglars?' 'Danglars, as well as others.' 'Now, listen carefully, and try to recall every detail surrounding your arrest. Do you remember the exact wording of the accusation against you?' 'Oh yes, I read it three times, and the words are etched in my memory.' 'Repeat it to me.' Dantès paused for a moment, then recited, 'This is it, word for word: \"The king's prosecutor has been informed by a friend to the throne and religion that one Edmond Dantès, mate aboard the Pharaon, which arrived today from Smyrna, after stopping at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, was entrusted by Murat with a packet for the usurper; and subsequently by the usurper with a letter for the Bonapartist Club in Paris. Proof of his guilt can be obtained through his immediate arrest, as the letter will be found either on his person, at his father's house, or in his cabin on the Pharaon.\"' The abbé shrugged his shoulders. 'It's as clear as day,' he said. 'You must have been extremely trusting, and had a very kind heart, not to have suspected the origin of the entire matter.' 'Do you really think so? Ah, that would be truly wicked.' 'How did Danglars typically write?' 'In a neat, flowing script.' 'And how was the anonymous letter written?' 'Backwards.' The abbé smiled again. 'Disguised.' 'It was very bold writing, if disguised.' 'Wait a moment,' said the abbé, picking up his makeshift pen and, after dipping it in ink, wrote the first few words of the accusation on a piece of prepared linen with his left hand. Dantès recoiled, looking at the abbé with a feeling close to fear. 'How astonishing!' he finally exclaimed. 'Why, your writing is exactly like the accusation!' 'Simply because that accusation was written with the left hand, and I've noticed that—' 'What?' '—while the writing of different people using their right hand varies, writing done with the left hand is consistently similar.' 'You have clearly seen and observed everything.' 'Let us continue.' 'Oh, yes, yes!' 'Now concerning the second question.' 'I'm listening.' 'Was there anyone who had an interest in preventing your marriage to Mercédès?' 'Yes, a young man who loved her.' 'And his name was—' 'Fernand.' 'That's a Spanish name, I think?' 'He was Catalan.' 'Do you believe he was capable of writing the letter?' 'Oh, no; he would be more likely to get rid of me by stabbing me.' 'That aligns perfectly with the Spanish character; they would assassinate without hesitation, but never commit an act of cowardice.' 'Besides,' Dantès added, 'Fernand was completely unaware of the various circumstances mentioned in the letter.' 'You had never spoken of them to anyone yourself?' 'To no one.' 'Not even to your betrothed?' 'No, not even to Mercédès.' 'Then it is Danglars.' 'I am absolutely certain of it now.' 'Hold on a moment. Was Danglars acquainted with Fernand?' 'No—yes, he was. Now I remember—' 'What?' 'Seeing them both sitting together at a table under an arbor at Père Pamphile's the evening before my wedding day. They were in serious conversation. Danglars was joking in a friendly manner, but Fernand looked pale and troubled.' 'Were they alone?' 'There was a third person with them whom I knew quite well, and who had probably made their acquaintance; he was a tailor named Caderousse, but he was very drunk. Wait! Wait! How strange that I didn't think of this before! Now I remember clearly that there were pens, ink, and paper on the table where they were sitting. Oh, the heartless, treacherous villains!' Dantès cried out, pressing his hand to his throbbing forehead.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The abbé noticed how lost in thought his guest looked, and, smiling, assumed it was because Dantès was overwhelmed by amazement. Dantès replied that he was first thinking about the immense intelligence and skill the abbé must possess to have achieved so much during his captivity, and wondered what he might have accomplished had he been free. The abbé responded that perhaps he would have achieved nothing; adversity is what uncovers the hidden strengths of the mind, like how powder only explodes when compressed. Captivity, he said, had focused his intellect. Dantès admitted that much of this wisdom was unfamiliar to him and envied the abbé’s knowledge. The abbé then prompted Dantès about a second matter he had been considering. Dantès said that although the abbé had shared his life story, he didn’t know anything about Dantès’ past. The abbé responded that Dantès was still young, probably without any great experiences, but Dantès insisted his life had been long enough to suffer a great, undeserved misfortune. He wanted to find the human cause of his woes, to stop blaming fate. When asked if he knew the crime he was accused of, Dantès swore by his father and fiancée Mercédès that he honestly did not. Hearing this, the abbé encouraged him to tell his full story. Dantès did, recounting his voyages, the death of Captain Leclere, being entrusted with a packet for the grand marshal, and, in exchange, receiving a letter for Monsieur Noirtier. He described his return to Marseilles, seeing his father, his love for Mercédès, their wedding plans, his arrest, inquiry, detention, and ultimate imprisonment in the Château d’If. Beyond that, he remembered nothing, not even how long he’d been there. Reflecting on what Dantès had told him, the abbé said that, generally, unless a mind is already wicked, people revolt at crime, but society breeds needs and vices that can smother good feelings and drive people to bad deeds. Thus, if you want to find who committed a wrongful act, first look for who benefits from it. He asked Dantès who could have gained by his disappearance. Dantès saw no one, but the abbé explained that even small advantages mean a lot—from kings to employees. He pressed Dantès about who would benefit from him not becoming captain of the Pharaon. Dantès only recalled Danglars, who disliked him and would not have kept his job if Dantès became captain. When asked if Danglars could have overheard crucial conversations, Dantès recalled seeing him when he got the important packet. They continued to break down the events, revealing Danglars had opportunity and motive. The abbé then asked about who might have wanted to prevent Dantès' marriage—Fernand, who also loved Mercédès. But Fernand, Dantès believed, would have used violence rather than conspiracy, and did not know the necessary information. Step by step, with the abbé’s reasoning, Dantès realized that it was Danglars, possibly in concert with Fernand and the drunken tailor Caderousse, who might have conspired against him. Dantès remembered seeing the three of them together just before his arrest, with pens and paper at their table, which finally convinced him of their betrayal."

          "text_segment": "Is there anything else I can assist you in discovering, besides the villany of your friends?” inquired the abbé with a laugh.\n“Yes, yes,” replied Dantès eagerly; “I would beg of you, who see so completely to the depths of things, and to whom the greatest mystery seems but an easy riddle, to explain to me how it was that I underwent no second examination, was never brought to trial, and, above all, was condemned without ever having had sentence passed on me?”\n“That is altogether a different and more serious matter,” responded the abbé. “The ways of justice are frequently too dark and mysterious to be easily penetrated. All we have hitherto done in the matter has been child’s play. If you wish me to enter upon the more difficult part of the business, you must assist me by the most minute information on every point.”\n“Pray ask me whatever questions you please; for, in good truth, you see more clearly into my life than I do myself.”\n“In the first place, then, who examined you,—the king’s attorney, his deputy, or a magistrate?”\n“The deputy.”\n“Was he young or old?”\n“About six or seven-and-twenty years of age, I should say.”\n“So,” answered the abbé. “Old enough to be ambitious, but too young to be corrupt. And how did he treat you?”\n“With more of mildness than severity.”\n“Did you tell him your whole story?”\n“I did.”\n“And did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination?”\n“He did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought me into this scrape. He seemed quite overcome by my misfortune.”\n“By your misfortune?”\n“Yes.”\n“Then you feel quite sure that it was your misfortune he deplored?”\n“He gave me one great proof of his sympathy, at any rate.”\n“And that?”\n“He burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated me.”\n“What? the accusation?”\n“No; the letter.”\n“Are you sure?”\n“I saw it done.”\n“That alters the case. This man might, after all, be a greater scoundrel than you have thought possible.”\n“Upon my word,” said Dantès, “you make me shudder. Is the world filled with tigers and crocodiles?”\n“Yes; and remember that two-legged tigers and crocodiles are more dangerous than the others.”\n“Never mind; let us go on.”\n“With all my heart! You tell me he burned the letter?”\n“He did; saying at the same time, ‘You see I thus destroy the only proof existing against you.’”\n“This action is somewhat too sublime to be natural.”\n“You think so?”\n“I am sure of it. To whom was this letter addressed?”\n“To M. Noirtier, Rue Coq-Héron, No. 13, Paris.”\n“Now can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could possibly have had in the destruction of that letter?”\n“Why, it is not altogether impossible he might have had, for he made me promise several times never to speak of that letter to anyone, assuring me he so advised me for my own interest; and, more than this, he insisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned in the address.”\n“Noirtier!” repeated the abbé; “Noirtier!—I knew a person of that name at the court of the Queen of Etruria,—a Noirtier, who had been a Girondin during the Revolution! What was your deputy called?”\n“De Villefort!” The abbé burst into a fit of laughter, while Dantès gazed on him in utter astonishment.\n“What ails you?” said he at length.\n“Do you see that ray of sunlight?”\n“I do.”\n“Well, the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you. Poor fellow! poor young man! And you tell me this magistrate expressed great sympathy and commiseration for you?”\n“He did.”\n“And the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter?”\n“Yes.”\n“And then made you swear never to utter the name of Noirtier?”\n“Yes.”\n“Why, you poor short-sighted simpleton, can you not guess who this Noirtier was, whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed? This Noirtier was his father!”\nHad a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of Dantès, or hell opened its yawning gulf before him, he could not have been more completely transfixed with horror than he was at the sound of these unexpected words. Starting up, he clasped his hands around his head as though to prevent his very brain from bursting, and exclaimed, “His father! his father!”\n“Yes, his father,” replied the abbé; “his right name was Noirtier de Villefort.”\nAt this instant a bright light shot through the mind of Dantès, and cleared up all that had been dark and obscure before. The change that had come over Villefort during the examination, the destruction of the letter, the exacted promise, the almost supplicating tones of the magistrate, who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce punishment,—all returned with a stunning force to his memory. He cried out, and staggered against the wall like a drunken man, then he hurried to the opening that led from the abbé’s cell to his own, and said, “I must be alone, to think over all this.”\nWhen he regained his dungeon, he threw himself on his bed, where the turnkey found him in the evening visit, sitting with fixed gaze and contracted features, dumb and motionless as a statue. During these hours of profound meditation, which to him had seemed only minutes, he had formed a fearful resolution, and bound himself to its fulfilment by a solemn oath.\nDantès was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of Faria, who, having also been visited by his jailer, had come to invite his fellow-sufferer to share his supper. The reputation of being out of his mind, though harmlessly and even amusingly so, had procured for the abbé unusual privileges. He was supplied with bread of a finer, whiter quality than the usual prison fare, and even regaled each Sunday with a small quantity of wine. Now this was a Sunday, and the abbé had come to ask his young companion to share the luxuries with him.\nDantès followed him; his features were no longer contracted, and now wore their usual expression, but there was that in his whole appearance that bespoke one who had come to a fixed and desperate resolve. Faria bent on him his penetrating eye.\n“I regret now,” said he, “having helped you in your late inquiries, or having given you the information I did.”\n“Why so?” inquired Dantès.\n“Because it has instilled a new passion in your heart—that of vengeance.”\nDantès smiled. “Let us talk of something else,” said he.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "With a laugh, the abbé asked if there was anything else he could help Dantès uncover, apart from his friends' treachery. Dantès eagerly replied, 'Yes, please, you who understand things so deeply and find the greatest mysteries simple. Explain why I wasn't given a second examination or a trial, and especially, why I was condemned without a sentence being passed on me.' The abbé responded, 'That's a completely different, more serious matter. Justice's workings are often too obscure to grasp easily. Everything we've discussed so far was simple. If you want me to delve into the harder part, you must provide me with the most detailed information on every point.' Dantès urged him, 'Ask me anything you want; truly, you see my life more clearly than I do.' The abbé began, 'First, who examined you—the king's attorney, his deputy, or a magistrate?' Dantès said, 'The deputy.' 'Was he young or old?' asked the abbé. 'Around twenty-six or twenty-seven,' Dantès estimated. 'Ah,' the abbé remarked, 'Old enough for ambition, too young for corruption. How did he treat you?' 'More gently than severely,' Dantès replied. 'Did you tell him your entire story?' 'Yes.' 'And did his behavior change during the examination?' 'He seemed very troubled when he read the letter that got me into this mess. He looked quite overcome by my misfortune.' 'By your misfortune?' the abbé questioned. 'Yes.' 'So, you're sure it was your misfortune he regretted?' 'At least he gave me one significant proof of his sympathy,' Dantès stated. 'Which was?' 'He burned the only evidence that could have incriminated me.' 'What? The accusation?' the abbé exclaimed. 'No, the letter.' 'Are you certain?' 'I saw him do it.' 'That changes everything. This man might be a greater villain than you imagined.' Dantès shivered, saying, 'Upon my word, you frighten me. Is the world full of tigers and crocodiles?' 'Yes,' the abbé confirmed, 'and remember that two-legged tigers and crocodiles are more dangerous.' 'Never mind,' said Dantès, 'let's continue.' 'With pleasure! You say he burned the letter?' 'He did, saying, “You see, I am destroying the only proof against you.”' The abbé commented, 'That action seems too noble to be natural.' 'You think so?' asked Dantès. 'I'm sure of it. Who was this letter addressed to?' 'To M. Noirtier, Rue Coq-Héron, No. 13, Paris.' 'Now, can you think of any reason your heroic deputy might have wanted that letter destroyed?' the abbé inquired. Dantès considered, 'Well, it's not entirely impossible. He made me promise several times never to tell anyone about that letter, saying it was for my own good. And more than that, he insisted I take a solemn oath never to speak the name in the address.' 'Noirtier!' the abbé repeated, 'Noirtier! I knew someone of that name at the court of the Queen of Etruria—a Noirtier who was a Girondin during the Revolution! What was your deputy called?' 'De Villefort!' Dantès answered. The abbé burst into loud laughter, leaving Dantès utterly astonished. 'What's wrong?' Dantès finally asked. 'Do you see that sunbeam?' the abbé replied. 'Yes.' 'Well, this whole situation is clearer to me than that sunbeam is to you. Poor fellow! Poor young man! And you say this magistrate expressed great sympathy and pity for you?' 'He did.' 'And the kind man destroyed your incriminating letter?' 'Yes.' 'And then made you swear never to utter the name of Noirtier?' 'Yes.' 'Why, you poor, blind simpleton, can't you guess who this Noirtier was, whose very name he was so careful to hide? This Noirtier was his father!' If lightning had struck at Dantès' feet or hell had opened before him, he couldn't have been more paralyzed with horror than by these unexpected words. He leaped up, clutching his head as if to keep his brain from exploding, and cried, 'His father! His father!' 'Yes, his father,' the abbé confirmed, 'His full name was Noirtier de Villefort.' At that instant, a brilliant light illuminated Dantès' mind, clarifying everything that had been dark and confusing. Villefort's change during the examination, the destruction of the letter, the forced promise, the magistrate's almost pleading tone, seeming to beg for mercy rather than deliver punishment—it all rushed back to his memory with stunning force. He cried out and stumbled against the wall like a drunkard, then rushed to the passage connecting the abbé's cell to his own, saying, 'I need to be alone to think about all this.' When he returned to his dungeon, he threw himself onto his bed. The turnkey found him there during the evening visit, sitting with a fixed stare and tense face, silent and still as a statue. During these hours of deep reflection, which felt like mere minutes to him, he formed a terrible resolution and bound himself to carry it out with a solemn oath. Dantès was eventually roused from his intense thoughts by Faria's voice. Having also been visited by his jailer, Faria had come to invite his fellow prisoner to share his supper. Because he was considered harmlessly, even amusingly, mad, the abbé had unusual privileges. He received finer, whiter bread than the standard prison issue and was even given a small amount of wine every Sunday. It was Sunday, and the abbé had come to ask his young companion to partake in these small luxuries. Dantès followed him; his features were no longer strained and had their usual look, but his whole appearance showed someone who had made a firm and desperate decision. Faria fixed his piercing gaze on him. 'I regret now,' he said, 'having helped you with your recent inquiries or giving you that information.' 'Why?' Dantès asked. 'Because it has planted a new passion in your heart—vengeance.' Dantès smiled. 'Let's talk about something else,' he said.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The abbé joked, asking if Dantès needed help uncovering anything else besides his friends' betrayal. Dantès, eager, asked the abbé, who seemed able to solve any mystery, to explain why he’d never had a second examination or a trial, and had been condemned without a verdict. The abbé replied that this was a more complex issue, as justice is often mysterious, and asked Dantès for every detail he could recall. Dantès agreed, saying the abbé understood his life better than he did. The abbé asked who questioned Dantès, and Dantès replied it was the deputy public prosecutor, a man around 26 or 27 years old, who treated him kindly. Dantès told his full story, and said the deputy seemed upset when reading the letter that had gotten Dantès in trouble, showing compassion by burning the letter—the only real evidence against Dantès—and making Dantès swear never to mention it or the addressee's name. The abbé realized the letter was addressed to Noirtier at a specific Paris address, and upon learning the deputy’s name was Villefort, laughed heartily. He explained that Villefort was Noirtier’s son, and had burned the letter to protect his father, not Dantès. Dantès was shocked, all at once understanding Villefort’s strange behavior, and withdrew to his cell, overwhelmed. There, he resolved—by oath—to do something drastic. Later, Faria, the abbé, invited Dantès to share his better Sunday meal. Noticing a change in Dantès, Faria regretted helping him, saying he had awakened a desire for revenge. Dantès only smiled and changed the subject."

          "text_segment": "Again the abbé looked at him, then mournfully shook his head; but in accordance with Dantès’ request, he began to speak of other matters. The elder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation, like that of all who have experienced many trials, contained many useful and important hints as well as sound information; but it was never egotistical, for the unfortunate man never alluded to his own sorrows. Dantès listened with admiring attention to all he said; some of his remarks corresponded with what he already knew, or applied to the sort of knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to acquire. A part of the good abbé’s words, however, were wholly incomprehensible to him; but, like the aurora which guides the navigator in northern latitudes, opened new vistas to the inquiring mind of the listener, and gave fantastic glimpses of new horizons, enabling him justly to estimate the delight an intellectual mind would have in following one so richly gifted as Faria along the heights of truth, where he was so much at home.\n“You must teach me a small part of what you know,” said Dantès, “if only to prevent your growing weary of me. I can well believe that so learned a person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being tormented with the company of one as ignorant and uninformed as myself. If you will only agree to my request, I promise you never to mention another word about escaping.”\nThe abbé smiled.\n“Alas, my boy,” said he, “human knowledge is confined within very narrow limits; and when I have taught you mathematics, physics, history, and the three or four modern languages with which I am acquainted, you will know as much as I do myself. Now, it will scarcely require two years for me to communicate to you the stock of learning I possess.”\n“Two years!” exclaimed Dantès; “do you really believe I can acquire all these things in so short a time?”\n“Not their application, certainly, but their principles you may; to learn is not to know; there are the learners and the learned. Memory makes the one, philosophy the other.”\n“But cannot one learn philosophy?”\n“Philosophy cannot be taught; it is the application of the sciences to truth; it is like the golden cloud in which the Messiah went up into heaven.”\n“Well, then,” said Dantès, “What shall you teach me first? I am in a hurry to begin. I want to learn.”\n“Everything,” said the abbé. And that very evening the prisoners sketched a plan of education, to be entered upon the following day. Dantès possessed a prodigious memory, combined with an astonishing quickness and readiness of conception; the mathematical turn of his mind rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation, while his naturally poetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality of arithmetical computation, or the rigid severity of geometry. He already knew Italian, and had also picked up a little of the Romaic dialect during voyages to the East; and by the aid of these two languages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others, so that at the end of six months he began to speak Spanish, English, and German.\nIn strict accordance with the promise made to the abbé, Dantès spoke no more of escape. Perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no room for such thoughts; perhaps the recollection that he had pledged his word (on which his sense of honor was keen) kept him from referring in any way to the possibilities of flight. Days, even months, passed by unheeded in one rapid and instructive course. At the end of a year Dantès was a new man.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "After another mournful look and a shake of his head, the abbé agreed to Dantès' wish to discuss subjects other than escape. The older prisoner's conversation, like that of others who have endured hardship, was full of practical advice and valuable insights, yet never self-centered or dwelling on his own suffering. Dantès listened attentively, finding that some of the abbé's points resonated with his own experiences from his life at sea. Other parts were completely new and profound, like a guiding light for a northern sailor, revealing unexplored intellectual territory and hinting at the profound satisfaction a curious mind could find in following someone as brilliant as Faria into the realm of truth and knowledge, where he was so comfortable.\n\n“You must teach me some of what you know,” Dantès urged, “even if only to keep you from finding my company tiresome. I understand that a learned man like you might prefer complete solitude to dealing with someone as uneducated and uninformed as myself. If you agree, I promise never to mention escaping again.”\n\nThe abbé smiled kindly.\n\n“My dear boy,” he replied, “human knowledge is quite limited. Once I teach you mathematics, physics, history, and the few modern languages I know, you will possess my full store of knowledge. It will likely take no more than two years for me to share all I have learned.”\n\n“Two years!” Dantès exclaimed in astonishment. “Do you truly think I can grasp all of that in such a short time?”\n\n“You can learn the *principles* within that time, certainly, but not necessarily their full *application*. Learning is not the same as knowing; there are those who learn, and those who are learned. Memory facilitates the former, while philosophy shapes the latter.”\n\n“But can one not learn philosophy?”\n\n“Philosophy cannot be directly taught; it is the application of scientific understanding to truth. It is like the radiant cloud that carried the Messiah to heaven.”\n\n“Very well, then,” said Dantès, eager to begin, “What topic will we start with? I am anxious to learn.”\n\n“Everything,” the abbé declared. That same evening, the two prisoners mapped out a course of study to begin the following day. Dantès possessed an extraordinary memory and a remarkably quick and sharp mind. His natural inclination towards mathematics made him adept at calculations, while a touch of poetic sensibility softened the starkness of arithmetic or the rigor of geometry. He was already fluent in Italian and had picked up some Greek (Romaic) during his Eastern travels. These languages helped him quickly understand the structure of others, enabling him to begin speaking Spanish, English, and German within just six months.\n\nFaithful to his promise, Dantès ceased speaking of escape. Perhaps the sheer joy of his studies occupied his mind entirely, or perhaps his deep sense of honor, which he valued greatly, prevented him from breaking his word. Days, even months, passed by unnoticed in the rapid, enriching flow of lessons. After one year, Dantès was profoundly transformed.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The abbé looked at Dantès again and sadly shook his head, but at Dantès’ urging, he began talking about other things. The older prisoner spoke in the wise and helpful way of someone who had endured many hardships, offering useful advice and information without ever discussing his own misfortunes. Dantès listened intently, recognizing some topics from his seafaring background, while other ideas were completely new to him—like glimpses of unexplored worlds that inspired his curiosity. He realized how rewarding it would be to learn from someone as knowledgeable as Faria.\n\nDantès asked the abbé to teach him some of his knowledge to keep their time together interesting. He admitted he felt unworthy next to such an educated man and hoped to be taught, promising not to mention escape again if the abbé agreed. The abbé smiled and explained that human knowledge is limited: once he had taught Dantès everything he knew—mathematics, physics, history, and several languages—it would take less than two years for Dantès to reach his level. Dantès was surprised it could happen so quickly, and the abbé clarified that Dantès would learn the principles in that time, but true understanding came from applying them; memorization makes a student, but true wisdom is gained through philosophy. Dantès asked if philosophy could be taught, but Faria replied philosophy is experienced, not instructed—it is the use of knowledge to discover truth, something transcendent.\n\nEager to learn, Dantès asked where they should begin. The abbé replied, \"With everything.\" That evening, they created a study plan to start the next day. Dantès’ sharp memory and quick understanding—along with his mathematical mind—helped him excel at calculations and made even dry or difficult topics enjoyable. He already spoke Italian and knew a little Greek dialect from his travels, which made learning other languages, like Spanish, English, and German, much easier, so that in six months, he spoke them fluently.\n\nTrue to his word, Dantès never brought up escape again, likely because he was so absorbed in his studies or because he honored his promise. Time passed quickly and filled with learning. After a year, Dantès had become a changed man."

          "text_segment": "Dantès observed, however, that Faria, in spite of the relief his society afforded, daily grew sadder; one thought seemed incessantly to harass and distract his mind. Sometimes he would fall into long reveries, sigh heavily and involuntarily, then suddenly rise, and, with folded arms, begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon. One day he stopped all at once, and exclaimed:\n“Ah, if there were no sentinel!”\n“There shall not be one a minute longer than you please,” said Dantès, who had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though his brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest operations.\n“I have already told you,” answered the abbé, “that I loathe the idea of shedding blood.”\n“And yet the murder, if you choose to call it so, would be simply a measure of self-preservation.”\n“No matter! I could never agree to it.”\n“Still, you have thought of it?”\n“Incessantly, alas!” cried the abbé.\n“And you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom, have you not?” asked Dantès eagerly.\n“I have; if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in the gallery beyond us.”\n“He shall be both blind and deaf,” replied the young man, with an air of determination that made his companion shudder.\n“No, no,” cried the abbé; “impossible!”\nDantès endeavored to renew the subject; the abbé shook his head in token of disapproval, and refused to make any further response. Three months passed away.\n“Are you strong?” the abbé asked one day of Dantès. The young man, in reply, took up the chisel, bent it into the form of a horseshoe, and then as readily straightened it.\n“And will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry, except as a last resort?”\n“I promise on my honor.”\n“Then,” said the abbé, “we may hope to put our design into execution.”\n“And how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work?”\n“At least a year.”\n“And shall we begin at once?”\n“At once.”\n“We have lost a year to no purpose!” cried Dantès.\n“Do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted?” asked the abbé.\n“Forgive me!” cried Edmond, blushing deeply.\n“Tut, tut!” answered the abbé, “man is but man after all, and you are about the best specimen of the genus I have ever known. Come, let me show you my plan.”\nThe abbé then showed Dantès the sketch he had made for their escape. It consisted of a plan of his own cell and that of Dantès, with the passage which united them. In this passage he proposed to drive a level as they do in mines; this level would bring the two prisoners immediately beneath the gallery where the sentry kept watch; once there, a large excavation would be made, and one of the flag-stones with which the gallery was paved be so completely loosened that at the desired moment it would give way beneath the feet of the soldier, who, stunned by his fall, would be immediately bound and gagged by Dantès before he had power to offer any resistance. The prisoners were then to make their way through one of the gallery windows, and to let themselves down from the outer walls by means of the abbé’s ladder of cords.\nDantès’ eyes sparkled with joy, and he rubbed his hands with delight at the idea of a plan so simple, yet apparently so certain to succeed. That very day the miners began their labors, with a vigor and alacrity proportionate to their long rest from fatigue and their hopes of ultimate success. Nothing interrupted the progress of the work except the necessity that each was under of returning to his cell in anticipation of the turnkey’s visits. They had learned to distinguish the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their dungeons, and happily, never failed of being prepared for his coming. The fresh earth excavated during their present work, and which would have entirely blocked up the old passage, was thrown, by degrees and with the utmost precaution, out of the window in either Faria’s or Dantès’ cell, the rubbish being first pulverized so finely that the night wind carried it far away without permitting the smallest trace to remain.\nMore than a year had been consumed in this undertaking, the only tools for which had been a chisel, a knife, and a wooden lever; Faria still continuing to instruct Dantès by conversing with him, sometimes in one language, sometimes in another; at others, relating to him the history of nations and great men who from time to time have risen to fame and trodden the path of glory. The abbé was a man of the world, and had, moreover, mixed in the first society of the day; he wore an air of melancholy dignity which Dantès, thanks to the imitative powers bestowed on him by nature, easily acquired, as well as that outward polish and politeness he had before been wanting in, and which is seldom possessed except by those who have been placed in constant intercourse with persons of high birth and breeding.\nAt the end of fifteen months the level was finished, and the excavation completed beneath the gallery, and the two workmen could distinctly hear the measured tread of the sentinel as he paced to and fro over their heads. Compelled, as they were, to await a night sufficiently dark to favor their flight, they were obliged to defer their final attempt till that auspicious moment should arrive; their greatest dread now was lest the stone through which the sentry was doomed to fall should give way before its right time, and this they had in some measure provided against by propping it up with a small beam which they had discovered in the walls through which they had worked their way. Dantès was occupied in arranging this piece of wood when he heard Faria, who had remained in Edmond’s cell for the purpose of cutting a peg to secure their rope-ladder, call to him in a tone indicative of great suffering.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Dantès noticed that despite the comfort his company provided, Faria grew sadder each day, seemingly tormented by a persistent thought. At times, he would enter long periods of contemplation, sigh deeply without meaning to, then suddenly stand and pace his confined cell with folded arms. One day, he stopped abruptly and exclaimed, \"Ah, if only there were no sentinel!\" Dantès, who understood Faria's thoughts as clearly as if he could see into his mind, replied, \"There won't be one for a moment longer than you desire.\" The abbé responded, \"I've told you before, I detest the idea of shedding blood.\" Dantès countered, \"Yet the killing, if that's how you see it, would simply be an act of self-preservation.\" \"No matter! I could never agree to it,\" Faria insisted. \"Still, you've considered it?\" \"Constantly, sadly!\" cried the abbé. \"And you've discovered a way for us to regain our freedom, haven't you?\" Dantès asked eagerly. \"I have,\" Faria replied, \"if only we could place a deaf and blind sentinel in the passage beyond us.\" The young man, with a resolve that made his companion shiver, declared, \"He shall be both blind and deaf.\" \"No, no,\" the abbé cried, \"impossible!\" Dantès tried to revisit the topic, but the abbé shook his head in disagreement and refused to say more. Three months went by. One day, the abbé asked Dantès, \"Are you strong?\" The young man demonstrated his strength by taking the chisel, bending it into a horseshoe shape, and then easily straightening it again. \"And will you promise not to harm the guard unless absolutely necessary, as a last resort?\" Faria asked. \"I promise on my honor,\" Dantès replied. \"Then,\" said the abbé, \"we can hope to carry out our plan.\" \"And how long will the necessary work take us?\" Dantès inquired. \"At least a year.\" \"And shall we start immediately?\" \"Immediately.\" \"We've wasted a year for nothing!\" cried Dantès. \"Do you consider the past twelve months lost?\" the abbé questioned. \"Forgive me!\" Edmond said, blushing deeply. \"Tut, tut!\" replied the abbé, \"Man is only human after all, and you are perhaps the finest example I've ever encountered. Come, let me show you my plan.\" The abbé then showed Dantès the diagram he had drawn for their escape. It included maps of his own cell, Dantès' cell, and the connecting passage. From this passage, he proposed digging a horizontal tunnel, like miners do, which would lead the two prisoners directly beneath the gallery where the sentinel stood guard. Once there, they would make a large excavation, and one of the flagstones paving the gallery would be loosened so thoroughly that at the opportune moment, it would give way under the soldier's feet. Stunned by the fall, he would be immediately tied up and gagged by Dantès before he could offer any resistance. The prisoners would then escape through one of the gallery windows and lower themselves from the outer walls using the abbé's rope ladder. Dantès' eyes lit up with joy, and he eagerly rubbed his hands at the prospect of a plan so simple yet seemingly so certain to succeed. That very day, the digging began with an intensity and enthusiasm fueled by their long period of rest and their hopes for eventual freedom. The work was only interrupted when they had to return to their cells to anticipate the turnkey's visits. They had learned to recognize the nearly silent sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their dungeons and were fortunately always ready for his arrival. The fresh earth excavated during this new work, which would have completely blocked the old passage, was gradually and cautiously disposed of by throwing it out the windows of either Faria's or Dantès' cell. The debris was first ground into such a fine powder that the night wind carried it far away without leaving any trace. More than a year was spent on this task, with the only tools being a chisel, a knife, and a wooden lever. During this time, Faria continued to educate Dantès by conversing with him in various languages, and at other times, recounting the histories of nations and famous individuals who had achieved recognition and greatness throughout history. The abbé was a sophisticated man who had also associated with the highest levels of society. He possessed a sad dignity that Dantès, thanks to his natural ability to imitate, easily adopted, along with the outward refinement and politeness he had previously lacked, qualities seldom found except among those who have had regular interaction with people of high status and breeding. After fifteen months, the tunnel was completed, and the excavation beneath the gallery finished. The two workers could clearly hear the measured pace of the sentinel walking back and forth above them. Forced to wait for a night dark enough to facilitate their escape, they had to delay their final attempt until that favorable moment arrived. Their greatest fear was now that the stone through which the sentry was meant to fall might give way too soon. They had taken steps to prevent this by propping it up with a small beam they had discovered in the walls they had dug through. Dantès was busy adjusting this piece of wood when he heard Faria, who had remained in Edmond's cell to cut a peg for their rope ladder, call out to him in a tone indicating severe pain.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Dantès noticed that despite enjoying his company, Faria was becoming more troubled every day, as if a constant worry gnawed at his mind. Faria often drifted into deep thought, sighed heavily, and then would suddenly get up to pace his cramped cell. One day, Faria abruptly exclaimed his frustration about the prison guard.\n\nDantès immediately promised that there would be no guard if Faria didn’t want one, having guessed Faria's thoughts as if he could see into his mind. But the abbé replied that he found the idea of killing repugnant, even if it was only for survival. Although Faria admitted to having thought about it often, he remained firm in his refusal. Dantès pressed for any escape plan, and the abbé replied he had one, if only they could somehow make the guard incapable of noticing them. Dantès insisted that they could manage this, but Faria rejected any plan involving harm to the guard.\n\nWhen Dantès tried to revisit the subject, the abbé refused to discuss it further. Three months passed before the abbé finally asked Dantès if he was strong. Dantès demonstrated his strength by bending a chisel, and pledged only to harm the guard if absolutely necessary. Satisfied, the abbé agreed to try their plan and estimated it would require at least a year of work, to begin immediately. Dantès regretted the year lost, but the abbé reassured him that their time together hadn’t really been wasted, and began explaining his plan.\n\nThe abbé produced detailed sketches of their cells and the passage connecting them. He proposed tunneling beneath the gallery where a sentry walked, loosening the floor there so the guard would fall through and be quickly tied up by Dantès. They would escape through a gallery window and descend using a rope ladder that the abbé had made.\n\nElated, Dantès immediately joined Faria in digging, both working with great energy and hope. They worked in secret, always returning to their cells before the guard’s rounds, having learned to anticipate even the faintest sound of his approach. Dirt from the digging was carefully crushed and discreetly scattered out the cell windows.\n\nUsing only a chisel, a knife, and a wooden lever, they spent over a year on the tunnel. During this time, Faria continued to educate Dantès in various subjects and languages, telling him about the world and its greatest people. Faria’s dignified, noble manner and refined habits influenced Dantès, who began to acquire similar sophistication.\n\nAfter fifteen months, the tunnel was finished beneath the gallery, and they could clearly hear the sentry’s steps above. Still, they had to wait for a suitably dark night for their escape. They feared the stone under the sentry might fall too soon, but they braced it with a wooden beam they had found. While Dantès was fixing this beam, Faria, who was making a peg for the rope ladder in Dantès’s cell, suddenly called out in pain."

I am seized with a terrible, perhaps mortal illness; I can feel that the paroxysm is fast approaching. I had a similar attack the year previous to my imprisonment. This malady admits but of one remedy; I will tell you what that is. Go into my cell as quickly as you can; draw out one of the feet that support the bed; you will find it has been hollowed out for the purpose of containing a small phial you will see there half-filled with a red-looking fluid. Bring it to me—or rather—no, no!—I may be found here, therefore help me back to my room while I have the strength to drag myself along. Who knows what may happen, or how long the attack may last?”\nIn spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly frustrated his hopes, Dantès did not lose his presence of mind, but descended into the passage, dragging his unfortunate companion with him; then, half-carrying, half-supporting him, he managed to reach the abbé’s chamber, when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed.\n“Thanks,” said the poor abbé, shivering as though his veins were filled with ice. “I am about to be seized with a fit of catalepsy; when it comes to its height I shall probably lie still and motionless as though dead, uttering neither sigh nor groan. On the other hand, the symptoms may be much more violent, and cause me to fall into fearful convulsions, foam at the mouth, and cry out loudly. Take care my cries are not heard, for if they are it is more than probable I should be removed to another part of the prison, and we be separated forever. When I become quite motionless, cold, and rigid as a corpse, then, and not before,—be careful about this,—force open my teeth with the knife, pour from eight to ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial down my throat, and I may perhaps revive.”\n“Perhaps!” exclaimed Dantès in grief-stricken tones.\n“Help! help!” cried the abbé, “I—I—die—I——”\nSo sudden and violent was the fit that the unfortunate prisoner was unable to complete the sentence; a violent convulsion shook his whole frame, his eyes started from their sockets, his mouth was drawn on one side, his cheeks became purple, he struggled, foamed, dashed himself about, and uttered the most dreadful cries, which, however, Dantès prevented from being heard by covering his head with the blanket. The fit lasted two hours; then, more helpless than an infant, and colder and paler than marble, more crushed and broken than a reed trampled under foot, he fell back, doubled up in one last convulsion, and became as rigid as a corpse.\nEdmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend, then, taking up the knife, he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed jaws, carefully administered the appointed number of drops, and anxiously awaited the result. An hour passed away and the old man gave no sign of returning animation. Dantès began to fear he had delayed too long ere he administered the remedy, and, thrusting his hands into his hair, continued gazing on the lifeless features of his friend. At length a slight color tinged the livid cheeks, consciousness returned to the dull, open eyeballs, a faint sigh issued from the lips, and the sufferer made a feeble effort to move.\n“He is saved! he is saved!” cried Dantès in a paroxysm of delight.\nThe sick man was not yet able to speak, but he pointed with evident anxiety towards the door. Dantès listened, and plainly distinguished the approaching steps of the jailer. It was therefore near seven o’clock; but Edmond’s anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his head.\nThe young man sprang to the entrance, darted through it, carefully drawing the stone over the opening, and hurried to his cell. He had scarcely done so before the door opened, and the jailer saw the prisoner seated as usual on the side of his bed. Almost before the key had turned in the lock, and before the departing steps of the jailer had died away in the long corridor he had to traverse, Dantès, whose restless anxiety concerning his friend left him no desire to touch the food brought him, hurried back to the abbé’s chamber, and raising the stone by pressing his head against it, was soon beside the sick man’s couch. Faria had now fully regained his consciousness, but he still lay helpless and exhausted on his miserable bed.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Dantès hurried to his friend's cell and found Faria standing in the center of the room, looking deathly pale, covered in sweat, and with his hands tightly clenched. Dantès cried out in alarm, asking what was wrong and what had happened. The abbé urgently told him to listen quickly. Dantès looked with fear and astonishment at Faria's discolored face; his eyes, already sunken and dull, were circled by dark rings, his lips were as white as a dead person's, and his hair seemed to be standing on end. Letting his chisel drop, Dantès begged him to say what was ailing him. Faria faltered, saying it was over for him, that he was afflicted with a terrible, possibly fatal illness, and could feel the intense attack coming quickly. He mentioned having a similar attack the year before his imprisonment. He explained this illness has only one cure and told Dantès what it was: go to his (Faria's) cell as fast as possible, remove one of the bed legs which was hollowed out, find a small bottle inside containing a reddish liquid, and bring it to him. He immediately corrected himself, realizing he might be discovered there, and urged Dantès to help him get back to his own room while he still had strength, uncertain what would happen or how long the attack would last. Despite the sudden catastrophe that destroyed his hopes, Dantès remained calm. He led his suffering friend into the passage, partly supporting and partly carrying him, until they reached the abbé's room where he immediately helped the sick man onto his bed. Shivering as if his blood were ice, the poor abbé thanked him. He explained he was about to suffer a cataleptic fit. At its peak, he might be still and silent as if dead, or the symptoms could be much more severe, causing violent spasms, foaming at the mouth, and loud screams. He emphasized the importance of preventing his cries from being heard, as it would likely result in him being moved to another part of the prison and permanently separated from Dantès. He instructed Dantès that when he became completely still, cold, and stiff like a corpse, but not before, he should carefully use the knife to force open his teeth and pour eight to ten drops of the liquid from the phial into his throat, stating that this might revive him. 'Perhaps!' Dantès exclaimed, heartbroken. 'Help! help!' cried the abbé, 'I—I—die—I—' The fit was so sudden and powerful that the unfortunate prisoner could not finish his sentence. A violent convulsion shook his entire body, his eyes protruded, his mouth twisted to one side, his cheeks turned purple, and he thrashed, foamed, struggled, and let out horrific screams which Dantès muffled by covering his head with the blanket. The attack lasted two hours. Afterwards, Faria collapsed, bent over in a final spasm, becoming rigid as a corpse, more helpless than a baby, colder and paler than marble, and more broken than a crushed reed. Edmond waited until his friend showed no signs of life. Then, taking the knife, he with difficulty forced open Faria's tightly closed jaw, carefully administered the specified number of drops, and anxiously waited for a result. An hour passed with no indication of the old man reviving. Dantès began to fear he had waited too long to give the remedy, and clutching his hair, continued to stare at his friend's lifeless face. At last, a faint color returned to the pallid cheeks, awareness appeared in the dull, open eyes, a soft sigh escaped his lips, and the sick man made a weak attempt to move. 'He is saved! He is saved!' Dantès shouted in an outburst of joy. The sick man was not yet able to speak but pointed anxiously towards the door. Dantès listened and clearly heard the approaching footsteps of the jailer. It was therefore almost seven o'clock, though Edmond's worry had made him forget the time. The young man quickly went to the tunnel entrance, slipped through, carefully replaced the stone covering, and hurried to his cell. He had barely done so before the door opened, and the jailer saw him sitting as usual on the side of his bed. Almost before the key had finished turning in the lock and the jailer's departing footsteps had faded down the long corridor, Dantès, whose intense worry for his friend left him no appetite, rushed back to the abbé's room. Pushing the stone open with his head, he was soon back beside the sick man. Faria had now fully regained consciousness but still lay weak and exhausted on his poor bed.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Dantès hurried to the cell where he found the abbé standing in the middle, as pale as a ghost, sweating, and with his hands clenched. Alarmed, Dantès asked what was wrong, but the abbé urgently told him to listen. Dantès, shocked by the abbé’s ghastly appearance—sunken eyes, purple circles, white lips, and hair standing up—again begged to know what was happening. The abbé, struggling to speak, revealed that he was experiencing a severe, possibly fatal illness, a relapse of something from before his imprisonment. He explained there was only one remedy: Dantès must go to his cell, break off a bed leg, retrieve a hidden vial of red liquid, and bring it to him. However, realizing the risk of being found in the wrong cell, the abbé told Dantès to help him back to his own room first. Despite his disappointment at this setback, Dantès kept calm and half-carried the stricken abbé back to his chamber, laying him on his bed. Shivering, the abbé warned Dantès that he would soon become cataleptic—motionless like a corpse, or possibly suffer violent convulsions and cries. He urged Dantès to muffle the cries to avoid their discovery and separation. When the fit left him apparently dead, Dantès was to force his mouth open and give him several drops of the potion in the vial. The abbé suddenly collapsed in a terrible convulsion, eyes bulging, mouth twisted, struggling and shrieking, but Dantès muffled the noise. The attack lasted two hours, after which the abbé was limp, cold, and stiff. Dantès, thinking him dead, pried his jaw open with a knife and administered the remedy, then waited anxiously. After an hour, the abbé finally showed signs of recovery, returning color, a sigh, and some movement—Dantès rejoiced to see him revived. The abbé pointed in alarm to the door as the jailer approached. Dantès hurried away, closing the hidden opening behind him, and returned to his own cell just in time to avoid suspicion. Once the jailer left, Dantès rushed back to check on the abbé, who was now conscious but still too weak to move from his bed."

          "text_segment": "I did not expect to see you again,” said he feebly, to Dantès.\n“And why not?” asked the young man. “Did you fancy yourself dying?”\n“No, I had no such idea; but, knowing that all was ready for flight, I thought you might have made your escape.”\nThe deep glow of indignation suffused the cheeks of Dantès.\n“Without you? Did you really think me capable of that?”\n“At least,” said the abbé, “I now see how wrong such an opinion would have been. Alas, alas! I am fearfully exhausted and debilitated by this attack.”\n“Be of good cheer,” replied Dantès; “your strength will return.” And as he spoke he seated himself near the bed beside Faria, and took his hands. The abbé shook his head.\n“The last attack I had,” said he, “lasted but half an hour, and after it I was hungry, and got up without help; now I can move neither my right arm nor leg, and my head seems uncomfortable, which shows that there has been a suffusion of blood on the brain. The third attack will either carry me off, or leave me paralyzed for life.”\n“No, no,” cried Dantès; “you are mistaken—you will not die! And your third attack (if, indeed, you should have another) will find you at liberty. We shall save you another time, as we have done this, only with a better chance of success, because we shall be able to command every requisite assistance.”\n“My good Edmond,” answered the abbé, “be not deceived. The attack which has just passed away, condemns me forever to the walls of a prison. None can fly from a dungeon who cannot walk.”\n“Well, we will wait,—a week, a month, two months, if need be,—and meanwhile your strength will return. Everything is in readiness for our flight, and we can select any time we choose. As soon as you feel able to swim we will go.”\n“I shall never swim again,” replied Faria. “This arm is paralyzed; not for a time, but forever. Lift it, and judge if I am mistaken.”\nThe young man raised the arm, which fell back by its own weight, perfectly inanimate and helpless. A sigh escaped him.\n“You are convinced now, Edmond, are you not?” asked the abbé. “Depend upon it, I know what I say. Since the first attack I experienced of this malady, I have continually reflected on it. Indeed, I expected it, for it is a family inheritance; both my father and grandfather died of it in a third attack. The physician who prepared for me the remedy I have twice successfully taken, was no other than the celebrated Cabanis, and he predicted a similar end for me.”\n“The physician may be mistaken!” exclaimed Dantès. “And as for your poor arm, what difference will that make? I can take you on my shoulders, and swim for both of us.”\n“My son,” said the abbé, “you, who are a sailor and a swimmer, must know as well as I do that a man so loaded would sink before he had done fifty strokes. Cease, then, to allow yourself to be duped by vain hopes, that even your own excellent heart refuses to believe in. Here I shall remain till the hour of my deliverance arrives, and that, in all human probability, will be the hour of my death. As for you, who are young and active, delay not on my account, but fly—go—I give you back your promise.”\n“It is well,” said Dantès. “Then I shall also remain.” Then, rising and extending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old man’s head, he slowly added, “By the blood of Christ I swear never to leave you while you live.”\nFaria gazed fondly on his noble-minded, single-hearted, high-principled young friend, and read in his countenance ample confirmation of the sincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his purpose.\n“Thanks,” murmured the invalid, extending one hand. “I accept. You may one of these days reap the reward of your disinterested devotion. But as I cannot, and you will not, quit this place, it becomes necessary to fill up the excavation beneath the soldier’s gallery; he might, by chance, hear the hollow sound of his footsteps, and call the attention of his officer to the circumstance. That would bring about a discovery which would inevitably lead to our being separated. Go, then, and set about this work, in which, unhappily, I can offer you no assistance; keep at it all night, if necessary, and do not return here tomorrow till after the jailer has visited me. I shall have something of the greatest importance to communicate to you.”\nDantès took the hand of the abbé in his, and affectionately pressed it. Faria smiled encouragingly on him, and the young man retired to his task, in the spirit of obedience and respect which he had sworn to show towards his aged friend.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Weakly, Faria told Dantès that he didn't expect to see him again. Dantès asked why, wondering if Faria thought he was dying. 'No,' Faria replied, 'I didn't think that, but knowing we were prepared for escape, I thought you might have already fled.' Dantès's cheeks flushed with deep indignation. 'Without you? Did you truly believe me capable of that?' Faria responded, 'At least I see now how wrong that assumption would have been. Alas, I am terribly worn out and weakened by this attack.' 'Cheer up,' Dantès said reassuringly, 'your strength will come back.' As he spoke, he sat down beside Faria's bed and took his hands. The abbé shook his head. 'My last attack,' he explained, 'only lasted half an hour, and afterward I felt hungry and could get up by myself. Now, I can't move my right arm or leg, and my head feels strange, which indicates a hemorrhage in the brain. The third attack will either kill me or leave me permanently paralyzed.' 'No, no,' cried Dantès, 'you are mistaken—you won't die! And if you have another attack, you'll be free when it happens. We'll save you again, just like this time, but with a better chance because we'll have everything we need.' 'My dear Edmond,' Faria answered, 'don't deceive yourself. This recent attack has condemned me to remain within these prison walls forever. No one who cannot walk can escape from a dungeon.' 'Alright, we'll wait then,' Dantès insisted, 'a week, a month, even two months if necessary—and during that time, your strength will return. We have everything ready for our escape and can choose the perfect moment. As soon as you feel strong enough to swim, we'll go.' 'I will never swim again,' Faria stated. 'This arm is paralyzed, not temporarily, but permanently. Lift it yourself and see if I am wrong.' The young man lifted the arm, which fell back lifeless and useless under its own weight. A sigh escaped him. 'You are convinced now, Edmond, aren't you?' Faria asked. 'Trust me, I know what I'm talking about. Since the first time I suffered this illness, I have thought about it constantly. In fact, I expected it, as it runs in my family; both my father and grandfather died from a third attack. The doctor who prepared the medicine I successfully used twice was the renowned Cabanis, and he predicted the same fate for me.' 'The doctor could be wrong!' Dantès exclaimed. 'And as for your poor arm, what difference does that make? I can carry you on my shoulders and swim for both of us.' 'My son,' Faria said, 'you, being a sailor and swimmer, must understand as well as I do that a man burdened like that would sink before swimming fifty strokes. Please stop clinging to vain hopes that even your kind heart knows are impossible. I will remain here until my deliverance comes, which, in all likelihood, will be the hour of my death. As for you, who are young and capable, do not delay on my account, but escape—go—I release you from your promise.' 'Very well,' Dantès said. 'Then I shall remain here too.' Rising and solemnly extending his hand over the old man's head, he slowly added, 'By the blood of Christ, I swear never to leave you as long as you live.' Faria looked fondly at his noble-minded, sincere, principled young friend, seeing clearly in his face the confirmation of his devoted loyalty and steadfast resolve. 'Thank you,' the invalid murmured, extending one hand. 'I accept. One day you may receive a reward for your selfless devotion. But since I cannot leave, and you will not, we must fill the excavation beneath the soldier's walkway. He might notice the hollow sound of his steps and bring it to his officer's attention. That would lead to a discovery that would inevitably separate us. Go now and begin this work, in which, regrettably, I cannot help you. Keep at it all night if needed, and do not return here tomorrow until after the jailer has made his visit. I will have something of the utmost importance to tell you then.' Dantès took Faria's hand, pressing it affectionately. Faria smiled encouragingly, and the young man withdrew to perform the task, filled with the spirit of obedience and respect he had vowed to show his elderly friend.",

Did you really think I'd do that?\"\n\"At least,\" said the abbé, \"I now realize how wrong that idea was. Unfortunately, I'm terribly weak and drained from this seizure.\"\n\"Don't lose hope,\" Dantès said. \"Your strength will come back.\" As he spoke, he sat down by Faria's bed and took his hands. The abbé shook his head.\n\"The last time this happened it lasted only half an hour, and afterward I was hungry and could get up without help. Now, I can't move my right arm or leg, and my head feels strange—signs that there's bleeding on the brain. The third attack will either kill me or paralyze me for life.\"\n\"No!\" Dantès cried. \"You're wrong—you won't die! And if you have a third attack, it'll find you free. Next time, we'll save you again with a better chance, because we're prepared for every possibility.\"\n\"My dear Edmond,\" the abbé replied, \"don't fool yourself. What just happened means I'm stuck in this cell forever. No one escapes from prison if they can't walk.\"\n\"Then we'll wait—a week, a month, even two months if needed—until you're stronger. Everything's ready for our escape, and we can leave anytime. Once you can swim, we'll go.\"\n\"I'll never swim again,\" Faria said. \"This arm is paralyzed permanently. Try lifting it and see for yourself.\"\nThe young man lifted Faria's arm, but it dropped back uselessly. Dantès sighed.\n\"Now do you understand, Edmond? Trust me, I know what this means. Since my first attack, I've thought it through. I knew it was coming—it's hereditary; my father and grandfather died after a third attack like this. The doctor who made my remedy was the famous Cabanis, and he told me I'd likely die the same way.\"\n\"The doctor could be wrong!\" Dantès insisted. \"And your arm—what does it matter? I can carry you and swim for both of us.\"\n\"My son,\" said the abbé, \"as a sailor, you must know carrying another person through the water is almost impossible. You'd sink before going fifty strokes. Please, stop hoping for what can't be. I'll remain here until my deliverance, which will likely be my death. As for you, you're young and strong, so don't stay for my sake—escape. I release you from your promise.\"\n\"Very well,\" said Dantès, \"then I will stay as well.\" Then, standing and raising his hand solemnly over Faria, he added, \"By the blood of Christ, I swear I won't leave you while you live.\"\nFaria looked fondly at his noble and devoted friend, recognizing in him pure sincerity and loyalty.\n\"Thank you,\" he murmured, reaching out his hand. \"I accept your vow. Someday, you may be rewarded for your selfless devotion. But since neither of us can or will leave, we need to fill in the tunnel beneath the soldier's gallery; he might hear a hollow sound and draw attention to it, which could lead to us being discovered and separated. Go and do this work—work all night if you have to, and don't come back until after the jailer has been here. I have something very important to tell you then.\"\nDantès took the abbé's hand and squeezed it affectionately. Faria smiled, and Dantès left to complete the task, determined to fulfill the obedience and respect he had promised his old friend."

          "text_segment": "When Dantès returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in captivity, he found Faria seated and looking composed. In the ray of light which entered by the narrow window of his cell, he held open in his left hand, of which alone, it will be recollected, he retained the use, a sheet of paper, which, from being constantly rolled into a small compass, had the form of a cylinder, and was not easily kept open. He did not speak, but showed the paper to Dantès.\n“What is that?” he inquired.\n“Look at it,” said the abbé with a smile.\n“I have looked at it with all possible attention,” said Dantès, “and I only see a half-burnt paper, on which are traces of Gothic characters inscribed with a peculiar kind of ink.”\n“This paper, my friend,” said Faria, “I may now avow to you, since I have the proof of your fidelity—this paper is my treasure, of which, from this day forth, one-half belongs to you.”\nThe sweat started forth on Dantès’ brow. Until this day and for how long a time!—he had refrained from talking of the treasure, which had brought upon the abbé the accusation of madness. With his instinctive delicacy Edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord, and Faria had been equally silent. He had taken the silence of the old man for a return to reason; and now these few words uttered by Faria, after so painful a crisis, seemed to indicate a serious relapse into mental alienation.\n“Your treasure?” stammered Dantès. Faria smiled.\n“Yes,” said he. “You have, indeed, a noble nature, Edmond, and I see by your paleness and agitation what is passing in your heart at this moment. No, be assured, I am not mad. This treasure exists, Dantès, and if I have not been allowed to possess it, you will. Yes—you. No one would listen or believe me, because everyone thought me mad; but you, who must know that I am not, listen to me, and believe me so afterwards if you will.”\n“Alas,” murmured Edmond to himself, “this is a terrible relapse! There was only this blow wanting.” Then he said aloud, “My dear friend, your attack has, perhaps, fatigued you; had you not better repose awhile? Tomorrow, if you will, I will hear your narrative; but today I wish to nurse you carefully. Besides,” he said, “a treasure is not a thing we need hurry about.”\n“On the contrary, it is a matter of the utmost importance, Edmond!” replied the old man. “Who knows if tomorrow, or the next day after, the third attack may not come on? and then must not all be over? Yes, indeed, I have often thought with a bitter joy that these riches, which would make the wealth of a dozen families, will be forever lost to those men who persecute me. This idea was one of vengeance to me, and I tasted it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my captivity. But now I have forgiven the world for the love of you; now that I see you, young and with a promising future,—now that I think of all that may result to you in the good fortune of such a disclosure, I shudder at any delay, and tremble lest I should not assure to one as worthy as yourself the possession of so vast an amount of hidden wealth.”\nEdmond turned away his head with a sigh.\n“You persist in your incredulity, Edmond,” continued Faria. “My words have not convinced you. I see you require proofs. Well, then, read this paper, which I have never shown to anyone.”\n“Tomorrow, my dear friend,” said Edmond, desirous of not yielding to the old man’s madness. “I thought it was understood that we should not talk of that until tomorrow.”\n“Then we will not talk of it until tomorrow; but read this paper today.”\n“I will not irritate him,” thought Edmond, and taking the paper, of which half was wanting,—having been burnt, no doubt, by some accident,—he read:\n“this treasure, which may amount to two...\nof Roman crowns in the most distant a...\nof the second opening wh...\ndeclare to belong to him alo...\nheir.\n                    “25th April, 149’”\n“Well!” said Faria, when the young man had finished reading it.\n“Why,” replied Dantès, “I see nothing but broken lines and unconnected words, which are rendered illegible by fire.”\n“Yes, to you, my friend, who read them for the first time; but not for me, who have grown pale over them by many nights’ study, and have reconstructed every phrase, completed every thought.”\n“And do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning?”\n“I am sure I have, and you shall judge for yourself; but first listen to the history of this paper.”\n“Silence!” exclaimed Dantès. “Steps approach—I go—adieu!”\nAnd Dantès, happy to escape the history and explanation which would be sure to confirm his belief in his friend’s mental instability, glided like a snake along the narrow passage; while Faria, restored by his alarm to a certain amount of activity, pushed the stone into place with his foot, and covered it with a mat in order the more effectually to avoid discovery.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The next morning, Dantès found his fellow prisoner, Faria, sitting calmly. Faria was holding a tightly rolled piece of paper in his usable left hand, illuminated by the thin beam of light from his cell window. The paper, difficult to keep flat, was the color of a cylinder from being frequently rolled. Without speaking, he showed it to Dantès, who asked what it was. Faria, smiling, told him to look. Dantès said he had examined it closely but only saw a partially burned paper with faint, old-style writing in unusual ink. Faria then confessed that this document was his long-discussed treasure, and since he had proven his loyalty, half of it now belonged to Dantès. Dantès broke out in a sweat. For a long time, he had avoided mentioning the treasure, which was seen as proof of Faria's madness. Out of respect, Edmond had steered clear of the topic, and Faria had also been silent. Dantès had taken this silence as a sign the old man was recovering his reason. Faria's words after his recent severe illness seemed to confirm a serious return of his delusion. Dantès hesitantly asked, \"Your treasure?\" Faria smiled, affirming it was. He told Edmond he had a noble character and understood his current shock and paleness. He reassured Dantès he was not mad, asserting the treasure's existence and that Dantès would inherit it, as no one else believed him because they thought him insane. He urged Edmond, who knew he wasn't mad, to listen and believe if he chose. Edmond inwardly sighed, thinking it a dreadful relapse and the final blow. Aloud, he suggested Faria rest, as his recent attack might have tired him. He offered to listen to the story tomorrow, preferring to care for him today. He added that a treasure wasn't something that required immediate attention. Faria insisted it was of utmost importance, warning that another attack could happen any day. He admitted he had often felt a bitter satisfaction that this fortune, enough to enrich a dozen families, would be lost to his persecutors – an idea of vengeance that comforted him in his captivity. But now, for Edmond's sake, seeing him young and promising, and considering the potential benefits, he was anxious about any delay and trembled at the thought of not securing such vast wealth for someone as worthy as Edmond. Edmond turned away, sighing with disbelief. Faria noticed his skepticism, stating his words hadn't convinced him and that he needed proof. He offered the paper to read, something he had shown no one before. Edmond, wanting to avoid engaging with what he perceived as madness, suggested waiting until tomorrow as previously agreed. Faria agreed to wait to discuss it but insisted he read the paper now. Edmond, deciding not to provoke him, took the paper, which was missing about half, likely burned by accident. He read the fragmented lines: \"this treasure, which may amount to two... of Roman crowns in the most distant a... of the second opening wh... declare to belong to him alo... heir. 25th April, 149'\". When Edmond finished, Faria asked his reaction. Dantès replied he saw only scattered, fire-damaged lines and disconnected words. Faria explained that while illegible to him on a first read, he had spent countless nights deciphering and reconstructing every phrase. He was certain he had found the hidden meaning and invited Edmond to judge for himself after hearing the paper's history. Suddenly, Dantès cried, \"Silence! Steps are coming – I must go – farewell!\" Dantès, relieved to escape the story that would surely confirm his friend's delusion, quickly slipped away down the passage. Faria, startled into action, used his foot to push the stone back into place and covered it with a mat to prevent detection.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "When Dantès went back to Faria’s cell the next morning, he found the old man sitting up, looking calm. In the little bit of sunlight shining through the tiny window, Faria held a rolled-up piece of paper in his left hand—the only hand he could use—which looked cylindrical from being kept that way. Instead of speaking, Faria just showed the paper to Dantès. \n\n“What is that?” Dantès asked.\n\n“Take a look,” Faria replied, smiling.\n\n“I’ve looked as closely as I can,” Dantès said, “and all I see is a partially burnt paper with some Gothic writing in strange ink.”\n\n“This, my friend,” Faria answered, “is my treasure. Now that I can trust you, I can tell you—half of it is yours from today.”\n\nDantès began to sweat. Up until now, he hadn’t brought up the matter of the treasure since it was said to be the reason people thought Faria was insane. Out of respect, Edmond had avoided the topic, and Faria hadn’t mentioned it either, making Edmond think he’d become sensible again. Now, hearing Faria talk of the treasure again after his illness made Edmond fear his friend’s mind was failing once more.\n\n“Your treasure?” Dantès stammered. Faria smiled and said, “Yes. You have a noble spirit, Edmond, and I can see from your reaction what you’re feeling. But I assure you, I’m not mad. The treasure exists; if I can’t claim it, you will. No one believed me since they thought I was mad, but you know I’m not. Listen to me—judge after.”\n\nEdmond thought sadly to himself that this seemed like a terrible setback for Faria. Then he said aloud, “You must be tired after your attack; perhaps you should rest. Tell me the story tomorrow. For now, let me look after you. Besides, there’s no rush where treasure is concerned.”\n\nFaria disagreed. “On the contrary, Edmond, it is vital! Who knows if another attack won’t kill me soon? If that happens, all would be lost. Sometimes I even thought with bitter satisfaction about those who persecuted me losing out on such riches. But I have forgiven them for your sake. Now, seeing your youth and promise, I am anxious to secure it for you before it’s too late.”\n\nEdmond sighed and turned away.\n\n“You still don’t believe me, Edmond,” Faria continued. “You need proof. Well, read this paper. I have shown it to no one else.”\n\n“Tomorrow, my friend,” Edmond replied, still not wanting to encourage what he thought was Faria’s delusion. “We agreed not to discuss it until tomorrow.”\n\n“Then we won’t talk about it, but read it today.”\n\nNot wanting to upset Faria, Edmond took the paper—half of it missing, likely burnt—and read:\n\n“this treasure, which may amount to two... of Roman crowns in the most distant a... of the second opening wh... declare to belong to him alo... heir. 25th April, 149’”\n\n“Well?” Faria asked.\n\n“I only see fragments and incomplete words, made hard to read by fire,” Dantès replied.\n\n“That’s because it’s your first time seeing it,” Faria said. “But I have studied it at night, piecing together every word.”\n\n“And you think you know its meaning?”\n\n“I am certain. Listen to the history of this paper.”\n\n“Wait!” Dantès interrupted, hearing footsteps. “I must go—goodbye!”\n\nGlad for the excuse to avoid what he feared was more evidence of Faria’s madness, Dantès slipped quickly away, while Faria, re-energized, covered the secret entrance to his cell to avoid being discovered."

The pope had also need of money to bring matters to an end with Louis XII. King of France, who was formidable still in spite of his recent reverses; and it was necessary, therefore, to have recourse to some profitable scheme, which was a matter of great difficulty in the impoverished condition of exhausted Italy. His holiness had an idea. He determined to make two cardinals.’\n“By choosing two of the greatest personages of Rome, especially rich men—this was the return the Holy Father looked for. In the first place, he could sell the great appointments and splendid offices which the cardinals already held; and then he had the two hats to sell besides. There was a third point in view, which will appear hereafter.\n“The pope and Cæsar Borgia first found the two future cardinals; they were Giovanni Rospigliosi, who held four of the highest dignities of the Holy See, and Cæsar Spada, one of the noblest and richest of the Roman nobility; both felt the high honor of such a favor from the pope. They were ambitious, and Cæsar Borgia soon found purchasers for their appointments. The result was, that Rospigliosi and Spada paid for being cardinals, and eight other persons paid for the offices the cardinals held before their elevation, and thus eight hundred thousand crowns entered into the coffers of the speculators.\n“It is time now to proceed to the last part of the speculation. The pope heaped attentions upon Rospigliosi and Spada, conferred upon them the insignia of the cardinalate, and induced them to arrange their affairs and take up their residence at Rome. Then the pope and Cæsar Borgia invited the two cardinals to dinner. This was a matter of dispute between the Holy Father and his son. Cæsar thought they could make use of one of the means which he always had ready for his friends, that is to say, in the first place, the famous key which was given to certain persons with the request that they go and open a designated cupboard. This key was furnished with a small iron point,—a negligence on the part of the locksmith. When this was pressed to effect the opening of the cupboard, of which the lock was difficult, the person was pricked by this small point, and died next day. Then there was the ring with the lion’s head, which Cæsar wore when he wanted to greet his friends with a clasp of the hand. The lion bit the hand thus favored, and at the end of twenty-four hours, the bite was mortal.\n“Cæsar proposed to his father, that they should either ask the cardinals to open the cupboard, or shake hands with them; but Alexander VI. replied: ‘Now as to the worthy cardinals, Spada and Rospigliosi, let us ask both of them to dinner, something tells me that we shall get that money back. Besides, you forget, Cæsar, an indigestion declares itself immediately, while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day or two.’ Cæsar gave way before such cogent reasoning, and the cardinals were consequently invited to dinner.\n“The table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope, near San Pierdarena, a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by report. Rospigliosi, quite set up with his new dignities, went with a good appetite and his most ingratiating manner. Spada, a prudent man, and greatly attached to his only nephew, a young captain of the highest promise, took paper and pen, and made his will. He then sent word to his nephew to wait for him near the vineyard; but it appeared the servant did not find him.\n“Spada knew what these invitations meant; since Christianity, so eminently civilizing, had made progress in Rome, it was no longer a centurion who came from the tyrant with a message, ‘Cæsar wills that you die.’ but it was a legate à latere, who came with a smile on his lips to say from the pope, ‘His holiness requests you to dine with him.’\n“Spada set out about two o’clock to San Pierdarena. The pope awaited him. The first sight that attracted the eyes of Spada was that of his nephew, in full costume, and Cæsar Borgia paying him most marked attentions. Spada turned pale, as Cæsar looked at him with an ironical air, which proved that he had anticipated all, and that the snare was well spread.\n“They began dinner and Spada was only able to inquire of his nephew if he had received his message. The nephew replied no; perfectly comprehending the meaning of the question. It was too late, for he had already drunk a glass of excellent wine, placed for him expressly by the pope’s butler. Spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach him, which he was pressed to taste. An hour afterwards a physician declared they were both poisoned through eating mushrooms. Spada died on the threshold of the vineyard; the nephew expired at his own door, making signs which his wife could not comprehend.\n“Then Cæsar and the pope hastened to lay hands on the heritage, under pretense of seeking for the papers of the dead man. But the inheritance consisted in this only, a scrap of paper on which Spada had written:—‘I bequeath to my beloved nephew my coffers, my books, and, amongst others, my breviary with the gold corners, which I beg he will preserve in remembrance of his affectionate uncle.’\n“The heirs sought everywhere, admired the breviary, laid hands on the furniture, and were greatly astonished that Spada, the rich man, was really the most miserable of uncles—no treasures—unless they were those of science, contained in the library and laboratories. That was all. Cæsar and his father searched, examined, scrutinized, but found nothing, or at least very little; not exceeding a few thousand crowns in plate, and about the same in ready money; but the nephew had time to say to his wife before he expired: ‘Look well among my uncle’s papers; there is a will.’\n“They sought even more thoroughly than the august heirs had done, but it was fruitless. There were two palaces and a vineyard behind the Palatine Hill; but in these days landed property had not much value, and the two palaces and the vineyard remained to the family since they were beneath the rapacity of the pope and his son. Months and years rolled on. Alexander VI. died, poisoned,—you know by what mistake. Cæsar, poisoned at the same time, escaped by shedding his skin like a snake; but the new skin was spotted by the poison till it looked like a tiger’s. Then, compelled to quit Rome, he went and got himself obscurely killed in a night skirmish, scarcely noticed in history.\n“After the pope’s death and his son’s exile, it was supposed that the Spada family would resume the splendid position they had held before the cardinal’s time; but this was not the case. The Spadas remained in doubtful ease, a mystery hung over this dark affair, and the public rumor was, that Cæsar, a better politician than his father, had carried off from the pope the fortune of the two cardinals. I say the two, because Cardinal Rospigliosi, who had not taken any precaution, was completely despoiled.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Following the conclusion of the major conflicts in Romagna, Cesare Borgia, having successfully conquered the region, required funds to finance his ambition of acquiring all of Italy. Simultaneously, the Pope needed money to finalize negotiations with King Louis XII of France, who remained a significant power despite recent setbacks. To address this financial necessity in a weakened and impoverished Italy, a profitable plan was devised: the Pope decided to appoint two new cardinals. The Holy Father intended to choose two of Rome's wealthiest and most prominent figures. This strategy offered multiple benefits: firstly, the high positions and lucrative roles already held by these chosen individuals could be sold; secondly, the cardinal's hats themselves could be sold; and a third, subsequent advantage would also become apparent. The Pope and Cesare Borgia identified their intended cardinals: Giovanni Rospigliosi, who possessed four of the highest ecclesiastical titles, and Cesare Spada, a member of Rome's most noble and affluent families. Both men were ambitious and flattered by the Pope's favor. Cesare Borgia quickly arranged for their existing offices to be purchased. Consequently, Rospigliosi and Spada paid for their cardinal appointments, while eight other individuals paid for the positions vacated by the new cardinals, bringing a total of eight hundred thousand crowns into the pockets of the scheme's orchestrators. The final phase of the plan was then set in motion. The Pope lavished attention on Rospigliosi and Spada, bestowed upon them the symbols of their new rank, and encouraged them to settle their affairs and establish residence in Rome. Following this, the Pope and Cesare Borgia invited the two cardinals to dinner. Cesare initially suggested using one of his usual methods for disposing of people he no longer needed: the famous key with a concealed iron point that would prick and poison the user when trying to open a specific cabinet, or the ring with a biting lion's head that delivered a fatal poison upon a handshake. Cesare proposed either having the cardinals open the poisoned cabinet or shake hands with them. However, Alexander VI disagreed, saying, 'Regarding the respectable cardinals, Spada and Rospigliosi, let us invite them to dinner. I have a feeling we can recover that money. Besides, Cesare, you forget that indigestion is immediate, whereas a prick or a bite causes a delay of one or two days.' Cesare yielded to this practical argument, and the cardinals received the dinner invitation. The meal was planned for a vineyard belonging to the Pope near San Pierdarena, a location the cardinals knew well by reputation for its beauty. Rospigliosi, feeling confident and pleased with his new status, arrived with a healthy appetite and his most agreeable demeanor. Spada, being a cautious man and deeply devoted to his only nephew, a promising young captain, took the precaution of writing his will. He then sent a message asking his nephew to wait for him near the vineyard, though the servant reportedly failed to find him. Spada understood the true nature of such invitations; he knew that with the civilizing influence of Christianity in Rome, the message from a ruler was no longer a centurion declaring, 'Caesar wills your death,' but rather a papal legate, smilingly conveying, 'His holiness requests your presence at dinner.' Spada departed for San Pierdarena around two o'clock. The Pope was waiting for him. To Spada's surprise, he immediately saw his nephew there, dressed formally, with Cesare Borgia paying him significant attention. Spada paled, observing Cesare's ironic expression, which confirmed that his plan had been anticipated and the trap was set. Dinner commenced, and Spada could only manage to ask his nephew if he had received his message. The nephew replied no, fully grasping the implication of the question. It was already too late for him, as he had just consumed a glass of excellent wine specifically poured for him by the Pope's butler. At the same moment, Spada saw another bottle being offered to him, and he was urged to taste it. An hour later, a physician pronounced both men poisoned from eating mushrooms. Spada died on the threshold of the vineyard, while his nephew expired at his own door, making hand gestures his wife could not understand. Immediately, Cesare and the Pope seized the inheritance under the pretense of searching for the deceased's papers. However, the only significant item found was a scrap of paper where Spada had written, 'To my beloved nephew, I bequeath my strongboxes, my books, and, among them, my breviary with gold corners, which I ask him to cherish as a memento of his affectionate uncle.' The supposed heirs searched everywhere, admired the breviary, took possession of the furnishings, but were astonished that the wealthy Spada seemed to have left no treasure, only perhaps the intellectual wealth contained in his library and laboratories. Cesare and his father searched, examined, and scrutinized but found little of significant value – only a few thousand crowns in silverware and a similar amount in cash. However, before expiring, the nephew had managed to tell his wife, 'Search carefully among my uncle's papers; there is a will.' His wife and others searched even more diligently than the papal heirs, but found nothing. There were two palaces and a vineyard near the Palatine Hill, but in that era, land was not particularly valuable, so these properties remained with the family, deemed not worth the greed of the Pope and his son. Months and years passed. Alexander VI died, poisoned, due to a known error. Cesare, also poisoned at the same time, survived by shedding his skin like a snake, but his new skin remained marked by the poison, resembling a tiger's. Subsequently forced to leave Rome, he met an obscure death in a minor night skirmish, barely noted by history. After the Pope's death and Cesare's exile, it was expected that the Spada family would regain their former prominence, but this did not happen. The Spadas remained in a state of moderate comfort, overshadowed by the mystery of this dark affair, with public speculation suggesting that Cesare, being more cunning than his father, had managed to abscond with the fortunes of both cardinals. Rospigliosi, having taken no precautions, was completely stripped of his wealth.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "At the conclusion of the wars in Romagna, Cæsar Borgia, having consolidated his power, was in need of substantial funds to pursue his ambitions of controlling all of Italy. Similarly, the pope required money to resolve ongoing matters with the French King, Louis XII, who, though recently defeated, still posed a significant threat. Faced with Italy’s impoverished state, they sought a lucrative solution. The pope decided to create two new cardinals, selecting two of Rome's most prominent and wealthy figures for the positions—anticipating not only payments for the appointments themselves but also the sale of the high offices the candidates would vacate. Thus, through the appointments of Giovanni Rospigliosi, who held several top positions within the Church, and Cæsar Spada, a nobleman of great wealth, the scheme yielded a total of eight hundred thousand crowns from various buyers for the offices.\n\nMoving to the final part of their plot, the pope honored Rospigliosi and Spada, encouraging them to manage their affairs and take up residence in Rome. Then, the pope and Cæsar Borgia invited the two new cardinals to a special dinner. Cæsar suggested using his notorious methods—either a poisoned key designed to prick and kill, or a deadly ring—to dispose of them, but the pope preferred a swifter solution: inviting both to dinner, where he believed they could recover the money immediately. During the meal, held in a picturesque vineyard near San Pierdarena, Spada, who suspected treachery, made out his will and tried to warn his nephew, but was unsuccessful. Both Spada and his nephew were poisoned, allegedly by mushrooms served at the dinner, and died soon after—Spada at the vineyard and his nephew at home, unable to communicate the danger.\n\nAfter their deaths, the pope and Cæsar quickly seized their possessions under the guise of looking for official papers. All Spada left was a note to his nephew, bequeathing his possessions, books, and a special breviary. Surprisingly, no significant wealth was found, only some valuables and cash amounting to a modest sum. Before his death, the nephew hinted to his wife to search for the will, but nothing else was discovered. Although the family retained some properties, these were of little value at the time, and the supposed vast fortune vanished. After the deaths of Alexander VI and the exile and eventual death of Cæsar Borgia, there were expectations that the Spada family would regain its former status, but they remained moderately well-off, and it was rumored that Cæsar Borgia had absconded with the fortune. Cardinal Rospigliosi, who took no precautions, lost everything."

The family began to get accustomed to their obscurity. Years rolled on, and amongst the descendants some were soldiers, others diplomatists; some churchmen, some bankers; some grew rich, and some were ruined. I come now to the last of the family, whose secretary I was—the Count of Spada. I had often heard him complain of the disproportion of his rank with his fortune; and I advised him to invest all he had in an annuity. He did so, and thus doubled his income. The celebrated breviary remained in the family, and was in the count’s possession. It had been handed down from father to son; for the singular clause of the only will that had been found, had caused it to be regarded as a genuine relic, preserved in the family with superstitious veneration. It was an illuminated book, with beautiful Gothic characters, and so weighty with gold, that a servant always carried it before the cardinal on days of great solemnity.\n“At the sight of papers of all sorts,—titles, contracts, parchments, which were kept in the archives of the family, all descending from the poisoned cardinal, I in my turn examined the immense bundles of documents, like twenty servitors, stewards, secretaries before me; but in spite of the most exhaustive researches, I found—nothing. Yet I had read, I had even written a precise history of the Borgia family, for the sole purpose of assuring myself whether any increase of fortune had occurred to them on the death of the Cardinal Cæsar Spada; but could only trace the acquisition of the property of the Cardinal Rospigliosi, his companion in misfortune.\n“I was then almost assured that the inheritance had neither profited the Borgias nor the family, but had remained unpossessed like the treasures of the Arabian Nights, which slept in the bosom of the earth under the eyes of the genie. I searched, ransacked, counted, calculated a thousand and a thousand times the income and expenditure of the family for three hundred years. It was useless. I remained in my ignorance, and the Count of Spada in his poverty.\n“My patron died. He had reserved from his annuity his family papers, his library, composed of five thousand volumes, and his famous breviary. All these he bequeathed to me, with a thousand Roman crowns, which he had in ready money, on condition that I would have anniversary masses said for the repose of his soul, and that I would draw up a genealogical tree and history of his house. All this I did scrupulously. Be easy, my dear Edmond, we are near the conclusion.\n“In 1807, a month before I was arrested, and a fortnight after the death of the Count of Spada, on the 25th of December (you will see presently how the date became fixed in my memory), I was reading, for the thousandth time, the papers I was arranging, for the palace was sold to a stranger, and I was going to leave Rome and settle at Florence, intending to take with me twelve thousand francs I possessed, my library, and the famous breviary, when, tired with my constant labor at the same thing, and overcome by a heavy dinner I had eaten, my head dropped on my hands, and I fell asleep about three o’clock in the afternoon.\n“I awoke as the clock was striking six. I raised my head; I was in utter darkness. I rang for a light, but, as no one came, I determined to find one for myself. It was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which I should soon be under the necessity of adopting. I took a wax-candle in one hand, and with the other groped about for a piece of paper (my match-box being empty), with which I proposed to get a light from the small flame still playing on the embers. Fearing, however, to make use of any valuable piece of paper, I hesitated for a moment, then recollected that I had seen in the famous breviary, which was on the table beside me, an old paper quite yellow with age, and which had served as a marker for centuries, kept there by the request of the heirs. I felt for it, found it, twisted it up together, and putting it into the expiring flame, set light to it.\n“But beneath my fingers, as if by magic, in proportion as the fire ascended, I saw yellowish characters appear on the paper. I grasped it in my hand, put out the flame as quickly as I could, lighted my taper in the fire itself, and opened the crumpled paper with inexpressible emotion, recognizing, when I had done so, that these characters had been traced in mysterious and sympathetic ink, only appearing when exposed to the fire; nearly one-third of the paper had been consumed by the flame. It was that paper you read this morning; read it again, Dantès, and then I will complete for you the incomplete words and unconnected sense.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“Up to this point,” Faria interjected, pausing his story, “you likely find this quite uninteresting, don't you?” Dantès enthusiastically replied, “On the contrary, my friend, it feels like I'm engrossed in a fascinating tale; please continue.” Faria agreed. “The family eventually grew accustomed to their lack of prominence. Years passed, and descendants became soldiers, diplomats, churchmen, bankers; some prospered, others were ruined. My employer, the last of the line, was Count of Spada. He often complained about his limited wealth relative to his title, so I advised him to invest everything in an annuity, which doubled his income. The famous breviary stayed in the family and belonged to the Count. Passed down through generations due to a peculiar clause in the only discovered will, it was treated as a sacred heirloom with deep reverence. It was an illuminated book with beautiful Gothic script, so heavy with gold that a servant carried it before the cardinal on important occasions. I examined vast collections of documents in the family archives—titles, contracts, parchments—all inherited from the poisoned cardinal, just as many others had before me. Yet, despite exhaustive investigation, I found nothing. I had even researched and written a precise history of the Borgias specifically to see if they gained wealth upon the death of Cardinal Cæsar Spada, but could only find evidence of their acquisition of property from Cardinal Rospigliosi, his fellow victim. I was almost certain the inheritance had benefited neither the Borgias nor the Spada family, but remained untouched, like mythical treasures guarded by genies. I spent years analyzing, counting, and calculating the family’s income and expenses over three centuries. It was fruitless. I remained ignorant, and the Count of Spada remained poor. My patron died. He kept his family papers, his library of five thousand books, and his renowned breviary from his annuity. He left these to me, along with a thousand Roman crowns he had on hand, on the condition I arrange annual masses for his soul and create a genealogical tree and history of his family. I performed all these tasks diligently. Rest assured, my dear Edmond, we are nearing the end. In 1807, a month before my arrest and two weeks after Count Spada's death, on December 25th (the date is unforgettable, as you'll see), I was going through papers I was organizing for the thousandth time. The palace was being sold, and I planned to leave Rome for Florence, taking my twelve thousand francs, my library, and the famous breviary. Tired from repeatedly working on the same task and heavy from dinner, my head fell into my hands, and I dozed off around three in the afternoon. I woke up as the clock struck six. Raising my head, I found myself in complete darkness. I rang for a light, but no one came, so I decided to find one myself—an early adaptation to the simple life I’d soon be forced into. Holding a wax candle, I felt around for a piece of paper (my matchbox was empty) to light it from the dying embers in the fireplace. Hesitating to use a valuable paper, I suddenly remembered an old, yellowed paper I had seen in the famous breviary next to me, which had served as a centuries-old bookmark, kept there at the heirs' request. I felt for it, found it, twisted it, and put it into the flickering flame to light it. But beneath my fingers, as if by magic, as the fire burned the paper, yellow characters appeared. I snatched it, quickly put out the flame, lit my candle from the fire itself, and opened the crumpled paper with intense emotion. I realized the characters were written in mysterious, sympathetic ink, visible only when heated; nearly a third of the paper was already consumed. That was the paper you read this morning; read it again, Dantès, and I will explain the missing words and clarify the meaning.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Faria paused in his story and said, “So far, this probably seems rather pointless to you, doesn’t it?”\n\nDantès replied eagerly, “Not at all! I find this tale fascinating—please, go on.”\n\nFaria continued, explaining that over time the family grew used to being unremarkable. Generations passed, with their descendants becoming soldiers, diplomats, clergymen, bankers, with some finding wealth and others losing everything. He then spoke of the last member of the family, whom Faria had served as secretary—the Count of Spada. The Count often lamented that his social status was far greater than his wealth; Faria advised him to invest his money in an annuity, which increased his annual income. The family still possessed the famed breviary, a beautifully decorated book with gold adornments, which had been treasured and passed down due to a peculiar clause in the family will. On important occasions, a servant would carry this heavy book in front of the cardinal.\n\nFaria described searching through the family’s archives—documents, titles, old contracts inherited from an ancestor who had been poisoned. Like all others before him, he found nothing meaningful. He had even studied and written in detail about the Borgia family, hoping to discover whether the family had grown richer after the death of Cardinal Cæsar Spada. All he could confirm was that they’d only acquired the assets of Cardinal Rospigliosi, another victim, but no sign of any hidden treasure.\n\nHe became convinced that neither the Borgias nor the Spada family ever gained from the cardinal’s hidden wealth; it seemed to lie dormant and undiscovered, like fabled Arabian Nights treasures lost beneath the earth. Faria searched through centuries of documents, checking all income and expenses, but his investigation was fruitless, and both he and the Count remained in ignorance and poverty.\n\nWhen his patron died, the Count left Faria the family papers, an extensive library, and the famous breviary—along with a thousand crowns in cash. In return, Faria was to organize the family history and have memorial masses said. Faria fulfilled all of this respectfully, assuring Dantès that his story was nearing its end.\n\nIn 1807, shortly after the Count’s death and just before Faria’s own arrest, he was preparing to leave Rome, having sold the palace, and was sorting through the family documents for the last time. Exhausted from his work and a large meal, he nodded off in the afternoon. He awoke in darkness, and needing a light, he searched for a spare piece of paper since his matches were out. Not wanting to waste anything valuable, he remembered an old yellowed paper long used as a bookmark in the breviary. Using it to catch a flame, he noticed mysterious writing starting to appear as the fire warmed the paper. Startled, he extinguished the flame as quickly as possible, lit his candle, and opened the paper. He realized it had been written in invisible ink, which only revealed itself near heat—although a portion had already burned away. This, Faria explained, was the very document Dantès had read earlier, and he now offered to help Dantès make sense of its fragments."

If we lay hands on this fortune, we may enjoy it without remorse.”\n“And you say this treasure amounts to——”\n“Two millions of Roman crowns; nearly thirteen millions of our money.”\n“Impossible!” said Dantès, staggered at the enormous amount.\n“Impossible? and why?” asked the old man. “The Spada family was one of the oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century; and in those times, when other opportunities for investment were wanting, such accumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare; there are at this day Roman families perishing of hunger, though possessed of nearly a million in diamonds and jewels, handed down by entail, and which they cannot touch.”\nEdmond thought he was in a dream—he wavered between incredulity and joy.\n“I have only kept this secret so long from you,” continued Faria, “that I might test your character, and then surprise you. Had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy, I should have conducted you to Monte Cristo; now,” he added, with a sigh, “it is you who will conduct me thither. Well, Dantès, you do not thank me?”\n“This treasure belongs to you, my dear friend,” replied Dantès, “and to you only. I have no right to it. I am no relation of yours.”\n“You are my son, Dantès,” exclaimed the old man. “You are the child of my captivity. My profession condemns me to celibacy. God has sent you to me to console, at one and the same time, the man who could not be a father, and the prisoner who could not get free.”\nAnd Faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to the young man, who threw himself upon his neck and wept.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "With an air of triumph, Faria presented the paper to Dantès, who this time read fragmented words written in reddish ink, resembling rust. The lines read: “This 25th day of April, 1498, be...

Two openings have been made in these caves; the treasure is in the furthest angle in the second; which treasure I bequeath and leave entire to him as my sole heir. “25th April, 1498. “Cæsar † Spada.”\n\n“Well, do you understand now?” Faria inquired.\n\n“It is Cardinal Spada's declaration, the will that has been sought for so long,” Edmond replied, still finding it difficult to believe.\n\n“Yes, absolutely, yes!”\n\n“And who put it together like this?”\n\n“I did. Using the remaining fragment, I deduced the rest. I estimated the length of the missing lines based on the paper's size and inferred the hidden meaning from what was partially revealed, much like using a small ray of light in a cavern to guide you.”\n\n“And what did you do after reaching this conclusion?”\n\n“I decided to leave immediately, and indeed I set out at that very moment, taking the initial draft of my major work on the unification of the Italian kingdom. However, the imperial police at that time (who, contrary to Napoleon's later wishes once he had a son, favored dividing the provinces) were watching me. My swift departure, whose reason they couldn't guess, raised their suspicions, and I was arrested just as I was leaving Piombino.”\n\nFaria continued, addressing Dantès with a look that was almost paternal, “Now, my dear fellow, you know everything I do. If we ever escape together, half of this treasure is yours. If I die here and you escape alone, it all belongs to you.”\n\n“But,” Dantès hesitated, “does this treasure not have a more legitimate owner in the world than us?”\n\n“No, no, set your mind at ease about that. The family line is extinct. Furthermore, the last Count of Spada made me his heir, bequeathing this symbolic breviary to me, and with it, everything it contained. No, no, you can be certain on that point. If we acquire this fortune, we can enjoy it without any guilt.”\n\n“And you say this treasure amounts to——”\n\n“Two million Roman crowns, which is nearly thirteen million of our current money.”\n\n“Impossible!” Dantès exclaimed, stunned by the vast sum.\n\n“Impossible? Why?” the old man asked. “The Spada family was one of the oldest and most powerful families in the fifteenth century. In those days, lacking other investment opportunities, such large accumulations of gold and jewels were not uncommon. There are even Roman families today who are starving, yet possess nearly a million in entailed diamonds and jewels that they cannot access.”\n\nEdmond felt as though he were dreaming, wavering between disbelief and elation.\n\n“I only kept this secret from you for so long,” Faria went on, “to test your character, and then to surprise you. Had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy, I would have led you to Monte Cristo. Now,” he added with a sigh, “it is you who will lead me there. Well, Dantès, aren't you going to thank me?”\n\n“This treasure belongs to you, my dear friend,” Dantès replied, “and only to you. I have no right to it. I am not related to you.”\n\n“You are my son, Dantès,” the old man cried out. “You are the child of my imprisonment. My vows require me to remain unmarried. God sent you to me to bring comfort simultaneously to the man who could not be a father and the prisoner who could not gain his freedom.”\n\nAnd Faria extended the arm he could still use towards the young man, who threw his arms around his neck and wept.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Faria, looking pleased and triumphant, handed a paper to Dantès, who read the words written in reddish, rust-colored ink. The fragmented text, dating from April 25, 1498, suggested it was written by Cæsar Spada out of fear that Pope Alexander VI, after inviting him to dinner, might try to claim his inheritance, as the Pope had allegedly poisoned Cardinals Caprara and Bentivoglio. In the document, Spada declares his nephew, Guido Spada, as his sole heir, stating that he has hidden a vast treasure — including gold, money, jewels, diamonds, and gems — in the caves of the small Island of Monte Cristo, and that only Guido knows about its existence. The approximate value of the treasure is nearly two million Roman crowns, and instructions are given on how to find it by moving a certain rock from a creek to the east. The document concludes that the treasure is concealed in the farthest chamber of the second cave, and Spada bequeaths the entire fortune to his nephew.\n\nAfter Dantès finishes reading, Faria encourages him to piece together the fragments, which form a coherent message confirming the treasure's location and value. Faria explains how he reconstructed the message from the partial evidence by guessing the missing parts and using deduction, much like navigating a dark cave with the help of a faint light. Upon reaching his conclusion, Faria attempted to retrieve the treasure but was arrested by imperial police before he could depart Piombino.\n\nFaria now tells Dantès that he shares the secret with him: if they escape together, the treasure will be divided, but if Faria dies and Dantès escapes alone, Dantès will inherit everything. Dantès worries about whether the treasure has a rightful owner, but Faria assures him that the Spada family is extinct and that he himself was named heir by the last Count of Spada. Faria confirms the legitimacy, so there is no reason for guilt. He states that the fortune is worth almost thirteen million in their currency, leaving Dantès stunned at the amount. Faria explains such riches were not unusual among 15th-century noble families.\n\nFaria admits he withheld the secret to test Dantès’ character and surprise him. Had they escaped before Faria’s illness, Faria would have led Dantès to Monte Cristo; now, it would be the reverse. Dantès initially feels unworthy of such a fortune, but Faria, who regards him as a spiritual son, insists otherwise, expressing gratitude for Dantès’ companionship in captivity. The scene ends with Dantès moved to tears, deeply affected by Faria’s kindness."

This island was, always had been, and still is, completely deserted. It is a rock of almost conical form, which looks as though it had been thrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean. Dantès drew a plan of the island for Faria, and Faria gave Dantès advice as to the means he should employ to recover the treasure. But Dantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man. It was past a question now that Faria was not a lunatic, and the way in which he had achieved the discovery, which had given rise to the suspicion of his madness, increased Edmond’s admiration of him; but at the same time Dantès could not believe that the deposit, supposing it had ever existed, still existed; and though he considered the treasure as by no means chimerical, he yet believed it was no longer there.\nHowever, as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last chance, and making them understand that they were condemned to perpetual imprisonment, a new misfortune befell them; the gallery on the sea side, which had long been in ruins, was rebuilt. They had repaired it completely, and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hole Dantès had partly filled in. But for this precaution, which, it will be remembered, the abbé had made to Edmond, the misfortune would have been still greater, for their attempt to escape would have been detected, and they would undoubtedly have been separated. Thus a new, a stronger, and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the realization of their hopes.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The treasure, which the abbé had contemplated for so long, gained immense value in his eyes now that it could secure the future happiness of Dantès, whom he genuinely cared for like a son. Each day, he would dwell on the fortune's size, detailing to Dantès all the positive actions that thirteen or fourteen million francs could enable a man to do for his friends in that era. Dantès' expression, however, would darken, as the memory of his vow for vengeance resurfaced, leading him to ponder how much harm a man with such wealth could inflict upon his adversaries in those times. While the abbé was unfamiliar with the Island of Monte Cristo, Dantès knew it well, having sailed past it frequently. Located twenty-five miles from Pianosa, between Corsica and the Island of Elba, he had even stopped there once. This island was, and remained, entirely uninhabited – a nearly cone-shaped rock that appeared to have been forced up from the ocean floor by volcanic activity. Dantès sketched a map of the island for Faria, and Faria, in turn, advised Dantès on the methods he should use to recover the wealth. However, Dantès lacked the old man's enthusiasm and conviction. By this point, it was clear Faria was not insane, and the ingenious way he had arrived at his discovery, which had initially raised doubts about his sanity, only deepened Edmond's respect for him. Yet, Dantès found it hard to believe that the hidden wealth, assuming it had ever been placed there, was still present. Although he didn't consider the treasure itself imaginary, he felt certain it was no longer in its original location. Nevertheless, as if destiny intended to strip the prisoners of their last hope and emphasize their lifelong confinement, a new misfortune struck: the old, ruined gallery by the sea was rebuilt. They completely repaired it, sealing the opening Dantès had partially filled with large stones. Had it not been for this precaution, which the abbé had previously mentioned to Edmond, the outcome would have been worse, as their escape attempt would have been discovered, and they would certainly have been separated. Thus, a new, stronger, and more unforgiving obstacle was put in place, blocking the fulfillment of their aspirations.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Now that the treasure, which had occupied the abbé’s thoughts for so long, could potentially guarantee the happiness of the man he cared for as a son, it became twice as precious to him. Each day, he described to Dantès the vast possibilities for good that someone could achieve for their friends with thirteen or fourteen million francs. Yet these discussions cast a shadow over Dantès, reminding him of his vow for revenge and making him consider how much harm such a fortune could inflict on his enemies. Although the abbé was unfamiliar with the Island of Monte Cristo, Dantès knew it well, having passed by it often and once visited. The island, situated between Corsica and Elba, about twenty-five miles from Pianosa, was—like now—entirely deserted, a steep, rocky cone shaped by volcanic activity. Dantès sketched a map of the island for Faria, who in return gave him advice on how to retrieve the treasure. Still, Dantès could not share Faria’s optimism, believing that though the treasure might have once been real, it was likely gone by now. When the damaged seaside gallery in their prison, which had offered a hope for escape, was finally repaired and sealed with heavy stones, the two prisoners understood that they were being firmly cut off from any hope of freedom. Without the abbé’s earlier warning to Edmond about fixing the hole, their escape plan could have been discovered and they might have been separated, making their situation even worse. Instead, fate had introduced a new, seemingly insurmountable obstacle to dash any hope of escape."

I have promised to remain forever with you, and now I could not break my promise if I would. The treasure will be no more mine than yours, and neither of us will quit this prison. But my real treasure is not that, my dear friend, which awaits me beneath the sombre rocks of Monte Cristo, it is your presence, our living together five or six hours a day, in spite of our jailers; it is the rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain, the languages you have implanted in my memory, and which have taken root there with all their philological ramifications. These different sciences that you have made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of them, and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced them—this is my treasure, my beloved friend, and with this you have made me rich and happy. Believe me, and take comfort, this is better for me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds, even were they not as problematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the sea, which we take for terra firma, and which evaporate and vanish as we draw near to them. To have you as long as possible near me, to hear your eloquent speech,—which embellishes my mind, strengthens my soul, and makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things, if I should ever be free,—so fills my whole existence, that the despair to which I was just on the point of yielding when I knew you, has no longer any hold over me; and this—this is my fortune—not chimerical, but actual. I owe you my real good, my present happiness; and all the sovereigns of the earth, even Cæsar Borgia himself, could not deprive me of this.”\nThus, if not actually happy, yet the days these two unfortunates passed together went quickly. Faria, who for so long a time had kept silence as to the treasure, now perpetually talked of it. As he had prophesied would be the case, he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left leg, and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself. But he was continually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion, and anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy. For fear the letter might be some day lost or stolen, he compelled Dantès to learn it by heart; and Dantès knew it from the first to the last word. Then he destroyed the second portion, assured that if the first were seized, no one would be able to discover its real meaning. Whole hours sometimes passed while Faria was giving instructions to Dantès,—instructions which were to serve him when he was at liberty. Then, once free, from the day and hour and moment when he was so, he could have but one only thought, which was, to gain Monte Cristo by some means, and remain there alone under some pretext which would arouse no suspicions; and once there, to endeavor to find the wonderful caverns, and search in the appointed spot,—the appointed spot, be it remembered, being the farthest angle in the second opening.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "With a sadly resigned tone, the young man said to Faria, \"You see, God seems to intend that I receive no credit for my loyalty to you. I vowed to stay by you forever, and now, even if I wished to leave, I couldn't break that promise. The treasure will belong to both of us equally, and neither of us will ever leave this prison. But, my dear friend, my real treasure isn't the wealth hidden under the dark rocks of Monte Cristo. It is your presence, our shared hours each day despite the guards; it is the understanding you've sparked in my mind, the languages you've instilled in my memory, which have taken deep root with all their intricate details. The various subjects you've made so accessible through your profound knowledge and clear explanations – this is my treasure, my beloved friend, and through this, you've made me rich and happy. Believe me, and find comfort in this: it is worth more to me than immense amounts of gold and countless diamonds, even if they weren't as uncertain as the morning clouds over the sea, which look like land but disappear as one approaches. Having you close for as long as possible, hearing your eloquent words – which refine my thoughts, strengthen my spirit, and prepare me for great and challenging deeds should I ever be free – fills my life so completely that the despair I was about to succumb to before meeting you no longer affects me. This, this is my fortune, not an illusion but a reality. I owe you my true well-being, my current happiness, and no ruler on earth, not even Cæsar Borgia himself, could take this from me.\" Thus, even if not genuinely happy, the days the two unfortunate men spent together passed swiftly. Faria, who had long been silent about the treasure, now spoke of it incessantly. As he had predicted, he remained paralyzed on his right side (arm and leg) and had abandoned any hope of ever enjoying the treasure himself. However, he constantly devised plans for his young companion's escape, anticipating the joy Dantès would experience. To prevent the letter from being lost or stolen, he insisted that Dantès learn it by heart, which Dantès did, memorizing every word. Then, Faria destroyed the second part, certain that if the first part were discovered, no one could decipher its true meaning. Sometimes, whole hours were spent with Faria giving Dantès instructions for his life once free. Upon achieving liberty, his single focus, from that moment forward, should be to somehow reach Monte Cristo, remain there alone under a plausible, unsuspicious guise, and then search for the remarkable caverns, specifically the designated spot – the farthest corner of the second entrance.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The young man, feeling a profound sense of resignation, told Faria that fate had ensured neither of them could claim the treasure for themselves or leave the prison, thus rendering his devoted promise to stay with Faria moot. He admitted that the true value for him was not the treasure supposedly hidden at Monte Cristo, but the companionship, knowledge, and intellectual stimulation Faria had given him. The time they spent together, the learning of languages, and the understanding of sciences—all imparted with Faria’s unmatched clarity—were his real treasures, making him feel richer and happier than he ever could with gold or jewels. His friend’s influence filled his life with meaning and strength, banishing previous despair. He concluded that this happiness, owing to Faria, was something that no ruler could take from him. \n\nAlthough they could not be considered truly happy, the days passed swiftly for the two prisoners. Faria, who had previously kept silent about the treasure, now spoke of it often, knowing he would never be able to enjoy it himself due to his paralysis. Still, he devoted his efforts to devising ways for Dantès to escape and preparing him for that eventuality. He insisted Dantès memorize the treasure letter in case it was lost or stolen, eventually destroying one part so its secret couldn’t be uncovered if found. Faria spent many hours instructing Dantès on what to do once free: how to reach Monte Cristo discreetly and search the deepest part of the cave for the treasure."

Faria, as we have said, without having recovered the use of his hand and foot, had regained all the clearness of his understanding, and had gradually, besides the moral instructions we have detailed, taught his youthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner, who learns to make something from nothing. They were thus perpetually employed,—Faria, that he might not see himself grow old; Dantès, for fear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his memory like a distant light wandering in the night. So life went on for them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose activities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of Providence.\nBut beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young man, and perhaps in that of the old man, many repressed desires, many stifled sighs, which found vent when Faria was left alone, and when Edmond returned to his cell.\nOne night Edmond awoke suddenly, believing that he heard someone calling him. He opened his eyes upon utter darkness. His name, or rather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name, reached him. He sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow. Undoubtedly the call came from Faria’s dungeon.\n“Alas,” murmured Edmond; “can it be?”\nHe moved his bed, drew up the stone, rushed into the passage, and reached the opposite extremity; the secret entrance was open. By the light of the wretched and wavering lamp, of which we have spoken, Dantès saw the old man, pale, but yet erect, clinging to the bedstead.

          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Time passed, if not quickly, then at least acceptably. As noted earlier, Faria had recovered his mental faculties, though not the use of his hand and foot. He had progressively taught his young friend, in addition to the character lessons detailed before, the noble and patient discipline of a prisoner who learns to create something from nothing. They remained continuously busy—Faria to avoid seeing himself age, and Dantès to prevent himself from recalling the nearly extinguished past, which now only drifted in his memory like a weak light moving in the night. Their lives thus unfolded like those of people untouched by hardship, whose daily routines flow automatically and calmly under the gaze of Providence. However, beneath this outward calm, both the young man's heart, and perhaps the old man's too, held many suppressed desires and stifled sighs, which found expression when Faria was left alone and when Edmond returned to his own cell. One night, Edmond woke up suddenly, believing he heard someone calling him. He opened his eyes into complete darkness. He heard his name, or rather a sorrowful voice struggling to pronounce it. He sat up in bed, a cold sweat breaking out on his brow. There was no doubt the call came from Faria’s cell. \"Oh no,\" Edmond whispered, \"can it be?\" He pushed his bed aside, lifted the stone, rushed into the passage, and reached the far end; the hidden entrance was open. By the light of the poor, unsteady lamp we mentioned, Dantès saw the old man, pale but still standing, gripping the bedstead. His face was twisted with the terrible symptoms he recognized, the same ones that had so seriously frightened him when he first witnessed them.",

Faria, though he hadn't regained movement in his hand and foot, had fully recovered his sharp mind, and, in addition to the lessons in morality he had already shared, he gradually taught his young friend the noble and patient art of a prisoner—to create something out of nothing. They kept themselves busy in this way—Faria to forget the passage of time and his own aging, and Dantès to avoid dwelling on memories that now felt faded and distant, like a faint light in the dark. In this manner, their lives continued much like those who aren't suffering misfortune, with routines that flowed calmly under the watch of Providence.\nHowever, beneath this outward calm, both the young and the old man harbored suppressed longings and unspoken sorrows, which emerged only when they were alone—Faria in solitude, and Edmond when he returned to his cell.\nOne night, Edmond was startled awake, convinced he heard someone call his name. He opened his eyes to pitch darkness as a mournful voice struggled to say his name. He sat up in bed, breaking into a cold sweat. He was certain the call came from Faria's cell.\n\"Oh no,\" Edmond whispered, \"can this be?\"\nQuickly, he moved his bed, lifted the stone, hurried through the passage, and arrived at the far end—finding the secret entrance already open. By the unsteady and poor light of their lamp, Dantès saw Faria standing, though pale and gripping the bed frame, his face contorted with those terrible symptoms Edmond knew well, and which had so alarmed him the first time he witnessed them."

We must now only think of you, my dear friend, and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your flight possible. It would require years to do again what I have done here, and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew we had communicated with each other. Besides, be assured, my dear Edmond, the dungeon I am about to leave will not long remain empty; some other unfortunate being will soon take my place, and to him you will appear like an angel of salvation. Perhaps he will be young, strong, and enduring, like yourself, and will aid you in your escape, while I have been but a hindrance. You will no longer have half a dead body tied to you as a drag to all your movements. At length Providence has done something for you; he restores to you more than he takes away, and it was time I should die.”\nEdmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim, “Oh, my friend, my friend, speak not thus!” and then resuming all his presence of mind, which had for a moment staggered under this blow, and his strength, which had failed at the words of the old man, he said, “Oh, I have saved you once, and I will save you a second time!” And raising the foot of the bed, he drew out the phial, still a third filled with the red liquor.\n“See,” he exclaimed, “there remains still some of the magic draught. Quick, quick! tell me what I must do this time; are there any fresh instructions? Speak, my friend; I listen.”\n“There is not a hope,” replied Faria, shaking his head, “but no matter; God wills it that man whom he has created, and in whose heart he has so profoundly rooted the love of life, should do all in his power to preserve that existence, which, however painful it may be, is yet always so dear.”\n“Oh, yes, yes!” exclaimed Dantès; “and I tell you that I will save you yet.”\n“Well, then, try. The cold gains upon me. I feel the blood flowing towards my brain. These horrible chills, which make my teeth chatter and seem to dislocate my bones, begin to pervade my whole frame; in five minutes the malady will reach its height, and in a quarter of an hour there will be nothing left of me but a corpse.”\n“Oh!” exclaimed Dantès, his heart wrung with anguish.\n“Do as you did before, only do not wait so long, all the springs of life are now exhausted in me, and death,” he continued, looking at his paralyzed arm and leg, “has but half its work to do. If, after having made me swallow twelve drops instead of ten, you see that I do not recover, then pour the rest down my throat. Now lift me on my bed, for I can no longer support myself.”\nEdmond took the old man in his arms, and laid him on the bed.\n“And now, my dear friend,” said Faria, “sole consolation of my wretched existence,—you whom Heaven gave me somewhat late, but still gave me, a priceless gift, and for which I am most grateful,—at the moment of separating from you forever, I wish you all the happiness and all the prosperity you so well deserve. My son, I bless thee!”\nThe young man cast himself on his knees, leaning his head against the old man’s bed.\n“Listen, now, to what I say in this my dying moment. The treasure of the Spadas exists. God grants me the boon of vision unrestricted by time or space. I see it in the depths of the inner cavern. My eyes pierce the inmost recesses of the earth, and are dazzled at the sight of so much riches. If you do escape, remember that the poor abbé, whom all the world called mad, was not so. Hasten to Monte Cristo—avail yourself of the fortune—for you have indeed suffered long enough.”\nA violent convulsion attacked the old man. Dantès raised his head and saw Faria’s eyes injected with blood. It seemed as if a flow of blood had ascended from the chest to the head.\n“Adieu, adieu!” murmured the old man, clasping Edmond’s hand convulsively—“adieu!”\n“Oh, no,—no, not yet,” he cried; “do not forsake me! Oh, succor him! Help—help—help!”\n“Hush! hush!” murmured the dying man, “that they may not separate us if you save me!”\n“You are right. Oh, yes, yes; be assured I shall save you! Besides, although you suffer much, you do not seem to be in such agony as you were before.”\n“Do not mistake! I suffer less because there is in me less strength to endure. At your age we have faith in life; it is the privilege of youth to believe and hope, but old men see death more clearly. Oh, ’tis here—’tis here—’tis over—my sight is gone—my senses fail! Your hand, Dantès! Adieu! adieu!”\nAnd raising himself by a final effort, in which he summoned all his faculties, he said,—“Monte Cristo, forget not Monte Cristo!” And he fell back on the bed.\nThe crisis was terrible, and a rigid form with twisted limbs, swollen eyelids, and lips flecked with bloody foam, lay on the bed of torture, in place of the intellectual being who so lately rested there.\nDantès took the lamp, placed it on a projecting stone above the bed, whence its tremulous light fell with strange and fantastic ray on the distorted countenance and motionless, stiffened body. With steady gaze he awaited confidently the moment for administering the restorative.\nWhen he believed that the right moment had arrived, he took the knife, pried open the teeth, which offered less resistance than before, counted one after the other twelve drops, and watched; the phial contained, perhaps, twice as much more. He waited ten minutes, a quarter of an hour, half an hour,—no change took place. Trembling, his hair erect, his brow bathed with perspiration, he counted the seconds by the beating of his heart. Then he thought it was time to make the last trial, and he put the phial to the purple lips of Faria, and without having occasion to force open his jaws, which had remained extended, he poured the whole of the liquid down his throat.\nThe draught produced a galvanic effect, a violent trembling pervaded the old man’s limbs, his eyes opened until it was fearful to gaze upon them, he heaved a sigh which resembled a shriek, and then his convulsed body returned gradually to its former immobility, the eyes remaining open.",

There's no need for me to explain.\" Edmond cried out in anguish, losing control and rushing towards the door, shouting, \"Help, help!\" Faria just managed to hold him back. \"Quiet,\" he warned, \"or you will ruin everything. From now on, we must only consider your fate, my dear friend, to make your imprisonment easier or your escape possible. It would take years to rebuild what I've accomplished here, and it would be instantly ruined if our guards discovered we've been communicating. Besides, rest assured, my dear Edmond, the cell I'm leaving won't stay empty for long; some other poor soul will soon occupy it, and to him, you'll seem like a savior. Perhaps he'll be young, strong, and resilient like you, and assist your escape, whereas I've only been a burden. You'll no longer have a semi-paralyzed body dragging you down. Finally, Providence has acted in your favor; it gives you back more than it takes away, and it was time for me to die.\" Edmond could only wring his hands, crying, \"Oh, my friend, my friend, don't talk like that!\" Regaining his composure, which had been momentarily shattered by the news, and his strength, which had deserted him at the old man's words, he declared, \"Oh, I saved you once, and I will save you again!\" Lifting the foot of the bed, he pulled out the small bottle, still one-third full of the reddish liquid. \"Look,\" he exclaimed, \"there's still some of the miraculous medicine left. Quick, quick! Tell me what to do this time; are there different instructions? Speak, my friend; I'm listening.\" \"There is no hope,\" Faria replied, shaking his head, \"but it doesn't matter; God intends for the man He created, in whose heart He has so deeply instilled the love of life, to do everything possible to preserve that existence, which, no matter how painful, is always so precious.\" \"Oh, yes, yes!\" exclaimed Dantès; \"and I swear I will still save you.\" \"Very well, then, try. The cold is spreading through me. I feel the blood rushing to my brain. These terrible shivers, making my teeth chatter and seeming to dislocate my bones, are starting to consume my entire body; in five minutes the attack will peak, and in fifteen minutes there will be nothing left of me but a corpse.\" \"Oh!\" cried Dantès, his heart aching with sorrow. \"Do as you did before, but don't wait as long; all my life force is spent now, and death,\" he continued, looking at his paralyzed arm and leg, \"only has half its work left. If, after giving me twelve drops instead of ten, you don't see me recover, then pour the rest down my throat. Now, help me onto the bed, for I cannot support myself any longer.\" Edmond gently lifted the old man into his arms and placed him on the bed. \"And now, my dear friend,\" Faria said, \"the only comfort of my miserable life—you whom Heaven sent me rather late, but still sent me, a gift beyond price, for which I am deeply grateful—at the moment of parting from you forever, I wish you all the happiness and success you so richly deserve. My son, I bless you!\" The young man fell to his knees, resting his head against the old man's bed. \"Listen closely, now, to my words in this, my final moment. The Spada treasure truly exists. God grants me a vision not limited by time or space. I see it in the depths of the inner cavern. My eyes penetrate the deepest parts of the earth, and are blinded by the sight of such wealth. If you manage to escape, remember that the poor abbé, whom everyone called mad, was not. Hurry to Monte Cristo—claim the fortune—for you have indeed suffered long enough.\" A violent seizure wracked the old man's body. Dantès raised his head and saw Faria's eyes bloodshot. It seemed as if blood had surged from his chest to his head. \"Farewell, farewell!\" the old man murmured, clutching Edmond's hand with a spasm—\"farewell!\" \"Oh, no—no, not yet,\" he cried; \"don't abandon me! Oh, help him! Help—help—help!\" \"Hush! hush!\" the dying man whispered, \"so they won't separate us if you save me!\" \"You're right. Oh, yes, yes; rest assured I will save you! Besides, although you're suffering greatly, you don't seem to be in as much agony as before.\" \"Don't be mistaken! I suffer less because I have less strength left to endure. At your age, you believe in life; it's the privilege of youth to hope and believe, but older men see death more clearly. Oh, it's here—it's here—it's over—my sight is gone—my senses are failing! Your hand, Dantès! Farewell! farewell!\" And making one last supreme effort, summoning all his remaining energy, he said, \"Monte Cristo, don't forget Monte Cristo!\" And he collapsed back onto the bed. The crisis was dreadful, and a stiff form with contorted limbs, swollen eyelids, and lips flecked with bloody foam lay on the bed of anguish, in place of the intelligent being who had rested there just moments before. Dantès took the lamp, placed it on a stone ledge above the bed, from where its flickering light cast strange and eerie shadows on the distorted face and motionless, rigid body. With a steady gaze, he confidently waited for the right moment to administer the restorative medicine. When he believed the opportune moment had arrived, he took the knife, gently pried open the teeth, which offered less resistance than before, carefully counted twelve drops, and watched; the bottle contained perhaps twice that amount more. He waited ten minutes, a quarter of an hour, half an hour—no change occurred. Shaking, his hair standing on end, his forehead slick with sweat, he counted the seconds by the pounding of his heart. Then he decided it was time for the final attempt, and he brought the bottle to Faria's purplish lips, and without needing to force open his jaws, which had remained slack, he poured the entire contents down his throat. The dose had a convulsive effect, a violent tremor ran through the old man's limbs, his eyes opened terrifyingly wide, he let out a sigh that sounded like a shriek, and then his twitching body slowly returned to its former stillness, his eyes remaining open.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Faria, sounding resigned, said to Edmond that he did not need to explain his condition, as Edmond already understood. Edmond, devastated, cried out in distress and tried to get help, but Faria, despite his weakness, managed to stop him, warning that making noise would put them both in greater danger. Faria insisted they should focus on Edmond’s welfare and potential escape, arguing that if their communication was discovered, all their efforts would be wasted and that another unfortunate prisoner would soon take Faria's place, potentially someone who could even help Edmond more than Faria had. Faria assured Edmond that Providence was now giving him an advantage, as Faria was no longer a burden, and expressed gratefulness for Edmond's friendship. Edmond, deeply upset, promised to save Faria again and prepared the remaining red liquid as medicine, asking for further instructions.\n\nFaria declared there was no hope, but encouraged Edmond to try, saying it was human nature to cling to life. As the illness intensified, he told Edmond to administer twelve drops this time, and if he saw no recovery, to pour the rest of the liquid down Faria's throat. Edmond helped Faria onto the bed, overwhelmed by emotion. Faria, before dying, thanked Edmond for his companionship and blessed him, telling him that the Spada treasure truly existed at Monte Cristo and urging Edmond to seek it if he escaped; Faria insisted he was not mad. Then Faria suffered a final convulsion and, gripping Edmond, said farewell, urging him not to call for help and risk separation.\n\nEdmond desperately promised to save him, but Faria explained that he was not in great pain because he had little strength left; old men sense death more clearly than the young do. As Faria’s senses faded, he made a last plea not to forget Monte Cristo, then collapsed. His body became rigid and distorted in death. Edmond, waiting for a chance to revive him, tried the restorative: he forced Faria's mouth open to give twelve drops, waited, then finally poured the remaining liquid into Faria's mouth when there was no response. Faria’s body reacted with a sudden violent trembling, his eyes flew open, then his body became still again, the eyes left open, with no further sign of recovery."

He made his way back through the underground passage, arriving in time to hear the jailer's shouts for assistance. More jailers arrived, followed by the distinct sound of soldiers marching. Finally, the governor appeared. Edmond heard the creak of the bed as they moved the lifeless body, then the governor's voice instructing them to splash water on the deceased man's face. Noticing this didn't revive him, they decided to send for a doctor. The governor departed, and Dantès overheard words of pity mixed with harsh laughter. One voice remarked, 'Well, well, the lunatic has gone off to find his treasure. Safe travels to him!' Another added, 'Even with all his millions, he won't have enough for a burial shroud!' A third chimed in, 'Oh, shrouds at the Château d’If are hardly expensive!' One of the earlier speakers suggested, 'Perhaps, since he was a cleric, they might spend a bit on him.' 'They might even give him the 'honors of the sack'.' Edmond didn't miss a word, though he understood very little of the meaning. The voices soon faded, making it seem as though everyone had left the cell. However, he was afraid to enter, suspecting a jailer might have been left to guard the body. So, he remained silent and still, barely daring to breathe. About an hour later, he heard a slight noise that grew louder. It was the governor returning, accompanied by the doctor and other attendants. There was a moment of silence—clearly the doctor was examining the corpse. Soon after, the questions and investigation began.",

He made his way back through the underground passage and arrived just as the guard was calling for assistance. More guards soon appeared, followed by the sound of marching soldiers, and finally the governor arrived. Edmond listened as the bed creaked while they moved the body, and he heard the governor order water to be thrown on the dead man's face; when this didn't revive the prisoner, they summoned the doctor. The governor then left, and Edmond heard words of sympathy mixed with harsh jokes. One person remarked that the madman must have gone in search of his treasure and wished him a good journey, another added that even with all his fortune, he couldn't afford his burial shroud, while a third said that burial shrouds at Château d’If were not expensive. Someone else speculated that, since he was a churchman, they might spend more than usual for him, though another suggested he would just get the 'honors of the sack'. Edmond caught every word but understood little of it, and once the voices stopped, he sensed the cell had been vacated. Not daring to go in, in case a guard was still there, he remained silent and still for an hour. Then he heard faint noises that grew louder—the governor had returned with the doctor and others, and after a stretch of silence as the doctor examined the body, the questioning began."

In spite of all appearances, be so kind, therefore, as to finish your duty by fulfilling the formalities described by law.”\n“Let the irons be heated,” said the doctor; “but really it is a useless precaution.”\nThis order to heat the irons made Dantès shudder.

The perspiration poured forth upon the young man’s brow, and he felt as if he should faint.\n“You see, sir, he is really dead,” said the doctor; “this burn in the heel is decisive. The poor fool is cured of his folly, and delivered from his captivity.”\n“Wasn’t his name Faria?” inquired one of the officers who accompanied the governor.\n“Yes, sir; and, as he said, it was an ancient name.

The first speaker asked, “Did you tie the knot?” “Why carry the extra weight now?” was the response. “I can do that when we reach the destination.” “Yes, you're correct,” agreed his companion. Dantès wondered what the knot was for. They laid the presumed corpse onto the stretcher. Edmond made his body rigid to convincingly imitate a dead person, and then the group, led by the man holding the torch, went up the stairs. Suddenly, he felt the cool, biting night air, and Dantès realized the mistral wind was blowing. The feeling was a strange mix of pleasure and discomfort. The men carrying the stretcher walked about twenty paces, then stopped and set the bier down on the ground. One of them walked off, and Dantès heard the sound of his shoes on the stone surface. “Where could I be?” he thought to himself. “He's certainly not a light load at all!” exclaimed the other bearer, sitting on the edge of the hand-barrow. Dantès' immediate instinct was to try and escape, but luckily, he didn't make the attempt. “Shine a light here,” the waiting bearer requested, “or I'll never find what I need.” The torchbearer obeyed, despite the impolite tone of the request. “What could he be searching for?” Edmond wondered. “Maybe the spade.” A satisfied exclamation showed that the grave-digger had found what he was looking for. “Here it is finally,” he announced, adding, “It took a bit of searching, though.” “True,” was the reply, “but waiting hasn't harmed it.” As he spoke, the man approached Edmond, who heard something heavy and metallic placed near him, and instantly, a rope was tied around his feet with sudden, painful force. “Okay, did you get the knot tied?” asked the grave-digger, observing the action. “Yes, and quite securely, I can assure you,” came the answer. “Let's go, then.” With that, the stretcher was lifted again, and they moved forward. They continued fifty paces further, pausing to open a door before moving on again. As they advanced, Dantès clearly heard the sound of waves crashing against the rocky foundation of the château. “Nasty weather!” one bearer commented. “Not a good night for a swim in the sea.” “Indeed,” said the other, “the abbé might get rather wet”; this was followed by harsh, cruel laughter. Dantès didn't understand the joke, but he felt a shiver of fear that made his hair stand on end.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"He's quite heavy for an old, thin man,\" remarked one of the men as he lifted the head. \"They say each year adds half a pound to the bones,\" replied the other, grabbing the feet. \"Have you tied the knot?\" the first asked. \"Why carry extra weight now?\" the second responded. \"I can do it when we get there.\" \"Good point,\" agreed his companion. Dantès wondered, \"What's the knot for?\" They set what they believed was a corpse onto the stretcher. Edmond tensed himself to imitate a dead body as they, guided by a torchbearer, headed up the stairs. Soon, Edmond felt the cold, sharp night air, realizing the mistral winds were blowing—a mix of pleasure and pain for him. The men carried him about twenty more steps before setting the stretcher down. One walked off, his footsteps echoing on the stone. \"Where am I?\" Edmond wondered. \"He’s not exactly light!\" complained the remaining man, sitting on the edge. Edmond’s first thought was to run, but wisely he stayed still. \"Give me some light,\" the man called out. The torchbearer obliged, though grudgingly. \"What’s he searching for?\" Edmond thought, \"Maybe a spade.\" A pleased exclamation meant the gravedigger had found what he sought. \"Here it finally is,\" he announced, \"though it took some searching.\" \"Yes, but it’s no worse for the wait,\" replied the other. As the man approached Edmond, he heard a heavy metal object put down beside him and felt a rope suddenly and tightly tied around his feet. \"Tied the knot?\" the gravedigger asked. \"Tightly,\" came the reply. \"Let’s go then.\" They lifted the stretcher and moved on. After fifty more paces, they stopped to open a door and advanced again. The sound of waves crashing against the château’s rocks reached Edmond. \"Nasty weather tonight,\" one bearer commented, \"not a good night for a swim.\" \"Yes, the abbé may get pretty wet,\" joked the other, and both men laughed harshly. Edmond didn’t get the joke, but the fear made his hair stand on end.\""

Finally, with a horrifying splash, he shot into the freezing water like an arrow, and as he did, he let out a piercing scream instantly cut short by his submersion beneath the waves.

Finally, he hit the icy water with a tremendous splash, letting out a sharp cry that was instantly muffled by the sea. Dantès had been cast into the ocean, pulled under by a massive thirty-six pound weight fastened to his legs. For prisoners of the Château d’If, the sea was their grave."

Ratonneau and Pomègue are the nearest islands of all those that surround the Château d’If, but Ratonneau and Pomègue are inhabited, as is also the islet of Daume. Tiboulen and Lemaire were therefore the safest for Dantès’ venture. The islands of Tiboulen and Lemaire are a league from the Château d’If; Dantès, nevertheless, determined to make for them. But how could he find his way in the darkness of the night?\nAt this moment he saw the light of Planier, gleaming in front of him like a star. By leaving this light on the right, he kept the Island of Tiboulen a little on the left; by turning to the left, therefore, he would find it. But, as we have said, it was at least a league from the Château d’If to this island. Often in prison Faria had said to him, when he saw him idle and inactive:\n“Dantès, you must not give way to this listlessness; you will be drowned if you seek to escape, and your strength has not been properly exercised and prepared for exertion.”\nThese words rang in Dantès’ ears, even beneath the waves; he hastened to cleave his way through them to see if he had not lost his strength. He found with pleasure that his captivity had taken away nothing of his power, and that he was still master of that element on whose bosom he had so often sported as a boy.\nFear, that relentless pursuer, clogged Dantès’ efforts. He listened for any sound that might be audible, and every time that he rose to the top of a wave he scanned the horizon, and strove to penetrate the darkness. He fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat, and he redoubled his exertions, increasing rapidly his distance from the château, but exhausting his strength. He swam on still, and already the terrible château had disappeared in the darkness. He could not see it, but he felt its presence.\nAn hour passed, during which Dantès, excited by the feeling of freedom, continued to cleave the waves.\n“Let us see,” said he, “I have swum above an hour, but as the wind is against me, that has retarded my speed; however, if I am not mistaken, I must be close to Tiboulen. But what if I were mistaken?”\nA shudder passed over him. He sought to tread water, in order to rest himself; but the sea was too violent, and he felt that he could not make use of this means of recuperation.\n“Well,” said he, “I will swim on until I am worn out, or the cramp seizes me, and then I shall sink;” and he struck out with the energy of despair.\nSuddenly the sky seemed to him to become still darker and more dense, and heavy clouds seemed to sweep down towards him; at the same time he felt a sharp pain in his knee. He fancied for a moment that he had been shot, and listened for the report; but he heard nothing. Then he put out his hand, and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had gained the shore.\nBefore him rose a grotesque mass of rocks, that resembled nothing so much as a vast fire petrified at the moment of its most fervent combustion. It was the Island of Tiboulen. Dantès rose, advanced a few steps, and, with a fervent prayer of gratitude, stretched himself on the granite, which seemed to him softer than down. Then, in spite of the wind and rain, he fell into the deep, sweet sleep of utter exhaustion.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "He needed to orient himself. Of the islands surrounding the Château d’If, Ratonneau and Pomègue were closest, but they were inhabited, as was the small island of Daume. This made Tiboulen and Lemaire the safer options for Dantès' escape attempt. These islands were about a league (roughly three miles) from the Château d’If, but Dantès resolved to head for them nonetheless. His challenge was finding his way in the dark night. He then saw the Planier light ahead, shining like a star. By keeping this light to his right, he knew Tiboulen Island would be slightly to his left, meaning a turn to the left would lead him there. However, as noted, it was a considerable distance away. During his imprisonment, Faria had often cautioned him when he saw him idle: \"Dantès, you must not succumb to laziness; if you try to escape, you will drown because your strength is not adequately trained and prepared for such effort.\" These words echoed in Dantès' mind even underwater. He quickly began swimming vigorously to assess if his strength had diminished. He was relieved to find that his time in prison had not lessened his physical capability and that he still controlled the element he had enjoyed since childhood. Fear, his persistent companion, hindered his progress. He strained to hear any sounds and, whenever he rode a wave crest, he scanned the horizon, trying to see through the darkness. He imagined each wave behind him was a boat chasing him, which made him push harder, increasing his distance from the château rapidly but also draining his energy. He kept swimming, and soon the formidable château vanished into the night. Although he couldn't see it, he could still feel its presence. An hour passed, during which Dantès, invigorated by his newfound freedom, continued to cut through the waves. \"Let's see,\" he thought, \"I've been swimming for over an hour, and the headwind has slowed me down. Still, if I'm right, I should be near Tiboulen. But what if I'm wrong?\" A tremor went through him. He tried to tread water to rest, but the sea was too rough, and he realized he couldn't recuperate that way. \"Very well,\" he told himself, \"I will swim until I'm completely exhausted or get a cramp, and then I will sink.\" He swam on with the intensity of despair. Suddenly, the sky seemed to grow even darker and heavier, with dense clouds seeming to bear down on him. At the same moment, he felt a sharp pain in his knee. For an instant, he thought he had been shot and listened for a gunshot, but heard nothing. He then extended his hand and struck something. With another stroke, he knew he had reached the shore. Before him loomed a strange formation of rocks, looking strikingly like a massive fire frozen at its peak intensity. It was the Island of Tiboulen. Dantès stood up, took a few steps, offered a heartfelt prayer of thanks, and lay down on the granite, which felt incredibly soft to him. Then, despite the wind and rain, he fell into the deep, sweet slumber of utter exhaustion.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Dantès had to figure out where he was and where to go next. Of the islands close to the Château d’If, Ratonneau, Pomègue, and Daume were all inhabited, so they were too dangerous as possible destinations. The islands of Tiboulen and Lemaire, each about a league away, were uninhabited and provided the safest chance for escape. Dantès decided to head for them, but navigating in the darkness posed a challenge. Just then, he spotted the light at Planier ahead, shining like a star. By keeping this light on his right, he would ensure Tiboulen stayed slightly to his left, guiding his course. Still, it was a long swim across open water.\n\nHe remembered how, in prison, Faria had warned him that inactivity would weaken him, and those words echoed in Dantès’ mind as he swam, testing his strength. Surprisingly, he found he was still as strong in the water as he had been in his youth.\n\nDespite his determination, fear pressed on him—he was alert for any sound, every cresting wave behind him feeling like a threatening pursuer. He pushed himself harder, increasing his distance from the prison, although his energy dwindled. The outline of the château disappeared into the darkness, yet he felt its ominous aura.\n\nAn hour passed as Dantès swam, exhilarated by his newfound freedom. He tried to judge how far he'd made it—surely he must be close to Tiboulen, though the opposing wind had slowed him. If he'd miscalculated, exhaustion or cramp could doom him to drown. He resigned himself to keep swimming until his strength failed.\n\nSuddenly, the darkness deepened and clouds gathered overhead. He felt a sudden pain in his knee, imagining for an instant he’d been shot, but heard nothing. Reaching out, his hand struck something solid—it was the shore. He recognized the strange, rocky shape of the Island of Tiboulen. Climbing out, he offered a prayer of thanks and lay down gratefully on the hard rocks, which felt soft to his exhausted body. Despite the harsh weather, he quickly fell into a deep and peaceful sleep."

He knew that it was barren and without shelter; but when the sea became more calm, he resolved to plunge into its waves again, and swim to Lemaire, equally arid, but larger, and consequently better adapted for concealment.\nAn overhanging rock offered him a temporary shelter, and scarcely had he availed himself of it when the tempest burst forth in all its fury. Edmond felt the trembling of the rock beneath which he lay; the waves, dashing themselves against it, wetted him with their spray. He was safely sheltered, and yet he felt dizzy in the midst of the warring of the elements and the dazzling brightness of the lightning. It seemed to him that the island trembled to its base, and that it would, like a vessel at anchor, break moorings, and bear him off into the centre of the storm.\nHe then recollected that he had not eaten or drunk for four-and-twenty hours. He extended his hands, and drank greedily of the rainwater that had lodged in a hollow of the rock.\nAs he rose, a flash of lightning, that seemed to rive the remotest heights of heaven, illumined the darkness. By its light, between the Island of Lemaire and Cape Croiselle, a quarter of a league distant, Dantès saw a fishing-boat driven rapidly like a spectre before the power of winds and waves. A second after, he saw it again, approaching with frightful rapidity. Dantès cried at the top of his voice to warn them of their danger, but they saw it themselves. Another flash showed him four men clinging to the shattered mast and the rigging, while a fifth clung to the broken rudder. The men he beheld saw him undoubtedly, for their cries were carried to his ears by the wind. Above the splintered mast a sail rent to tatters was waving; suddenly the ropes that still held it gave way, and it disappeared in the darkness of the night like a vast sea-bird.\nAt the same moment a violent crash was heard, and cries of distress. Dantès from his rocky perch saw the shattered vessel, and among the fragments the floating forms of the hapless sailors. Then all was dark again.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "An hour later, Edmond awoke to the loud noise of thunder. The storm had begun, violently striking the air; occasionally, lightning flashed across the sky like a fiery snake, illuminating the massive, chaotic waves of clouds. Dantès had correctly identified his location – he had reached Tiboulen, the first of the two islands. He knew it was bare and offered no protection, but planned to re-enter the water and swim to Lemaire, which was also arid but larger and therefore better suited for hiding, once the sea calmed down. An overhanging rock provided temporary refuge. He had barely gotten beneath it when the full force of the storm hit. Edmond felt the rock under which he lay vibrate; waves crashing against it sprayed him with water. Though safely sheltered, he felt disoriented amidst the clashing elements and the blinding flashes of lightning. It seemed as though the island was shaking from its foundation and might break away like a moored ship, carrying him into the heart of the storm. He then realized he had not eaten or drunk anything for twenty-four hours. Reaching out his hands, he eagerly drank the rainwater collected in a hollow of the rock. As he stood up, a flash of lightning, so intense it seemed to split the highest points of the sky, cut through the darkness. By its light, between the Island of Lemaire and Cape Croiselle, about a quarter of a league away, Dantès saw a fishing boat being swept along rapidly like a ghost by the force of the wind and waves. A moment later, he saw it again, approaching alarmingly fast. Dantès shouted as loud as he could to warn them of their danger, but they had already seen it themselves. Another flash revealed four men clinging to the broken mast and rigging, while a fifth held onto the shattered rudder. The men he saw undoubtedly saw him, as their cries were carried to him by the wind. Above the splintered mast, a sail, ripped to shreds, was flapping; suddenly, the ropes holding it gave way, and it vanished into the night's darkness like a large seabird. At that same instant, a violent crash was heard, followed by cries of distress. From his vantage point on the rock, Dantès saw the wrecked vessel and, among the debris, the bodies of the unfortunate sailors floating. Then, darkness returned once more.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "After an hour had passed, Edmond awoke to the sound of thunder. A fierce storm raged, powerful winds churning the sky; lightning sporadically lit up the clouds in brilliant, snaking flashes. Dantès realized he had reached the first of the two islands—Tiboulen. Although he knew it was barren and offered no refuge, his plan was to wait until the sea calmed and then attempt to swim to Lemaire, which was also bleak but larger and provided better hiding places.\nA protruding rock gave Edmond some shelter, and just as he settled beneath it, the storm intensified. The rock shook under the force of the weather, and sea spray hit him as the waves crashed nearby. Though safe for the moment, Edmond felt dizzy amidst the chaos of thunder, wind, and blazing lightning. He imagined the entire island trembling and feared it might detach from its place, swept off like a ship into the heart of the storm.\nRemembering he hadn’t eaten or drunk anything for twenty-four hours, Edmond collected and drank rainwater from a hollow in the rock. As he stood up, a violent flash of lightning illuminated the sky. By its brief glow, he spotted a fishing boat between Lemaire and Cape Croiselle, being tossed dangerously by the storm. Moments later, he saw it once more, hurtling closer. Edmond shouted a warning, but the people on board were already aware of the peril. Another lightning strike revealed four men clinging to the broken mast and rigging, while a fifth held onto the shattered rudder. Edmond could hear their desperate cries carried by the wind. The torn sail flapped wildly until its remaining ropes snapped, and it vanished into the dark.\nSuddenly, a loud crash and more cries rang out. Edmond watched from his shelter as the boat was destroyed, and saw the sailors struggling in the water among the wreckage. Then, complete darkness returned."

Soon a red streak became visible in the horizon, the waves whitened, a light played over them, and gilded their foaming crests with gold.

He turned towards the fortress, and looked at both sea and land. The gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing majesty and seemed to dominate the scene. It was about five o’clock. The sea continued to get calmer.\n“In two or three hours,” thought Dantès, “the turnkey will enter my chamber, find the body of my poor friend, recognize it, seek for me in vain, and give the alarm. Then the tunnel will be discovered; the men who cast me into the sea and who must have heard the cry I uttered, will be questioned.

Morning had arrived.\n\nDantès stood silent and still before this magnificent sight, as though it were his first time seeing such beauty; being imprisoned in the Château d’If had made him forget what such scenes looked like. He looked back at the fortress, and surveyed both the ocean and the land. The dark structure rose majestically from the sea, dominating the surroundings. It was around five o’clock, and the sea grew ever calmer.\n\n“In a few hours,” Dantès thought, “the jailer will come into my cell, find the body of my dear friend, realize who it is, search for me without success, and raise the alarm. The tunnel will be discovered; those who threw me into the sea and must have heard my shout will be questioned. Then boats full of armed men will chase after the unlucky escapee.

She was coming out of Marseilles harbor, and was standing out to sea rapidly, her sharp prow cleaving through the waves.\n“Oh,” cried Edmond, “to think that in half an hour I could join her, did I not fear being questioned, detected, and conveyed back to Marseilles! What can I do? What story can I invent? under pretext of trading along the coast, these men, who are in reality smugglers, will prefer selling me to doing a good action. I must wait. But I cannot—I am starving. In a few hours my strength will be utterly exhausted; besides, perhaps I have not been missed at the fortress. I can pass as one of the sailors wrecked last night. My story will be accepted, for there is no one left to contradict me.”\nAs he spoke, Dantès looked toward the spot where the fishing-vessel had been wrecked, and started. The red cap of one of the sailors hung to a point of the rock and some timbers that had formed part of the vessel’s keel, floated at the foot of the crag. In an instant Dantès’ plan was formed. He swam to the cap, placed it on his head, seized one of the timbers, and struck out so as to cut across the course the vessel was taking.\n“I am saved!” murmured he.

It moved across the water like a bird searching for food, and with his seasoned sailor's knowledge, he identified it as a Genoese tartan. The vessel was leaving Marseilles harbor, sailing rapidly offshore with its sharp front cutting through the waves. Edmond cried out, expressing his wish that he could reach the boat within half an hour, but was held back by the fear of being questioned, recognized, and sent back to Marseilles. He wondered what he could do and what explanation he could invent, aware that these individuals, who were likely smugglers pretending to trade along the coast, would probably hand him over rather than help him. He felt he had to wait, but also knew he couldn't due to his extreme hunger and rapidly fading strength. He also considered that perhaps his absence from the fortress hadn't been noticed yet. He thought he could pass himself off as one of the fishermen who were shipwrecked the previous night, certain his story would be accepted since no one else from that vessel survived to contradict him. As he spoke, Dantès looked towards the location of the fishing boat disaster and was startled. A sailor's red cap was snagged on a point of the rock, and some pieces of wood from the boat's keel were floating at the foot of the cliff. Instantly, Dantès conceived his plan. He swam to the cap, placed it on his head, grabbed one of the timbers, and began swimming with effort to cut across the path of the vessel. He murmured, \"I am saved!\" and this certainty revitalized him.",

Using his seafaring experience, he recognized it as a Genoese tartan departing quickly from Marseilles harbor, the boat’s sharp front slicing through the water. \n\n“Oh,” exclaimed Edmond, “if not for the risk of being questioned, recognized, and sent back to Marseilles, I could be on that boat in thirty minutes! But what should I do? What excuse could I make up? These men, actually smugglers pretending to be traders, would likely sell me before helping me out. I’ll have to wait. But I’m starving; soon, I’ll be too weak. Maybe no one has noticed my disappearance from the prison yet. I might be able to pose as one of the sailors shipwrecked here last night. They would probably believe it, since there’s no one left to say otherwise.”\n\nAs he said this, Dantès glanced over to where the fishing vessel had broken apart. He was startled to see a red sailor’s cap caught on a rocky point and some pieces of the boat’s keel floating below. Instantly deciding on a plan, Dantès swam to the cap, put it on, grabbed a timber, and began paddling to intercept the approaching vessel.\n\n“I am saved!” he whispered to himself, the realization giving him renewed energy."

He rose on the waves, making signs of distress; but no one on board saw him, and the vessel stood on another tack. Dantès would have shouted, but he knew that the wind would drown his voice.\nIt was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber, for without it he would have been unable, perhaps, to reach the vessel—certainly to return to shore, should he be unsuccessful in attracting attention.\nDantès, though almost sure as to what course the vessel would take, had yet watched it anxiously until it tacked and stood towards him.

The two sailors redoubled their efforts, and one of them cried in Italian, “Courage!”\nThe word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength to surmount passed over his head. He rose again to the surface, struggled with the last desperate effort of a drowning man, uttered a third cry, and felt himself sinking, as if the fatal cannon shot were again tied to his feet.

He rose in the water, signaling for help, but no one on board saw him, and the ship continued its course. Dantès thought about shouting, but he knew the wind would make his voice inaudible.

Summoning all his strength, he raised himself partially out of the water, waved his cap, and shouted loudly in a manner distinct to sailors. This time he managed to catch their attention, and the ship turned toward him, preparing to launch a boat.\n\nMoments later, a small boat with two men hurried out towards him. Dantès, thinking the timber was no longer needed, let it go and swam energetically toward them. But he had overestimated his endurance and soon understood how vital the timber had actually been as his arms stiffened, his legs weakened, and he became almost unable to breathe.\n\nHe shouted again for help. The two sailors sped up, and one yelled \"Courage!\" in Italian. As he heard this, a wave he couldn’t overcome rolled over him. He surfaced, fought desperately to stay afloat, cried out a third time, and began to sink as if weighted down. Water closed over his head, and his vision blurred. In a final spasm, he broke the surface once more, felt someone grab his hair, and then lost consciousness."

His immediate priority was to check their direction; they were rapidly moving away from the Château d’If. Dantès was so utterly spent that his exclamation of joy was mistaken for a mere sigh. As mentioned, he lay on the deck. One sailor was vigorously rubbing his limbs with a woollen cloth, while another, whom he recognized as the one who had shouted encouragement, held a gourd of rum to his mouth. The third man, an old sailor who served as both pilot and captain, watched with that particular kind of self-interested compassion people feel for misfortune they have recently avoided and might still encounter in the future. A few sips of the rum revived his dormant vitality, and the rubbing restored flexibility to his limbs. \"Who are you?\" the pilot asked in broken French. \"I am a Maltese sailor,\" Dantès replied in poor Italian, \"We were traveling from Syracuse loaded with grain. Last night's storm caught us at Cape Morgiou, and we were shipwrecked on these rocks.\" \"Where have you come from?\" he was asked. \"From those very rocks I was fortunate enough to cling to,\" Dantès explained, \"while our captain and the rest of the crew were all lost. I saw your ship and, fearing I would be left to die on that deserted island, I swam out on a piece of wreckage to try and intersect your path. You've saved my life, and I am grateful,\" Dantès continued. \"I was about to drown when one of your sailors grabbed my hair.\" \"That was me,\" said a sailor with an open, honest face, \"and it was just in time, you were sinking.\" \"Yes,\" returned Dantès, extending his hand, \"I thank you again.\" \"I almost hesitated, though,\" the sailor admitted, \"With your beard six inches long and hair a foot long, you looked more like a bandit than an honest man.\" Dantès remembered that his hair and beard had not been cut during his entire imprisonment at the Château d’If. \"Yes,\" he said, \"I made a vow to Our Lady of the Grotto not to cut my hair or beard for ten years if I was saved from a dangerous situation; but that vow ends today.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "When Dantès opened his eyes, he found that he was lying on the deck of the tartan. His first instinct was to see which direction the ship was heading, and he saw that they were quickly sailing away from the Château d’If. Dantès was so tired that his joyful outcry was mistaken for a sigh. As mentioned, he was still lying on the deck. A sailor was rubbing his limbs with a woolen cloth to revive him, another—whom Dantès recognized as the one who shouted 'Courage!'—was holding a flask of rum to his lips, and a third, an older sailor who acted as both the captain and pilot, watched them with the self-interested sympathy people feel when they have narrowly escaped disaster themselves. Some rum helped to revive Dantès, and the rubbing restored movement to his limbs. The pilot, speaking poor French, asked who he was. Dantès replied in broken Italian that he was a sailor from Malta, whose grain ship from Syracuse had been smashed by a storm at Cape Morgiou. He explained that he had managed to cling to some rocks while the rest of the crew perished, and, spotting their vessel, swam out on driftwood to try and get their attention in the hope of rescue. He thanked them for saving his life, mentioning that one of their sailors had grabbed him by the hair just in time to pull him aboard. The sailor admitted it was him and noted that Dantès looked more like a criminal than a trustworthy man, with his long beard and hair. Dantès remembered he hadn't cut his hair or beard the whole time he was imprisoned and explained it was a vow to Our Lady of the Grotto that he wouldn’t cut them for ten years if he escaped danger, but that vow expired today."

This was also done, and, just as Dantès predicted, the ship passed safely twenty fathoms windward of the island.\n\n\"Well done!\" said the captain.\n\n\"Well done!\" echoed the crew, all staring in surprise at this man whose sharp eyes and newfound energy impressed them deeply."

Dantès glanced that way as he lifted the gourd to his mouth; then paused with hand in mid-air.\n“Hollo! what’s the matter at the Château d’If?” said the captain.\nA small white cloud, which had attracted Dantès’ attention, crowned the summit of the bastion of the Château d’If. At the same moment the faint report of a gun was heard. The sailors looked at one another.\n“What is this?” asked the captain.\n“A prisoner has escaped from the Château d’If, and they are firing the alarm gun,” replied Dantès.

He was nineteen when he entered the Château d’If; he was thirty-three when he escaped. A sorrowful smile passed over his face; he asked himself what had become of Mercédès, who must believe him dead. Then his eyes lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused him so long and wretched a captivity. He renewed against Danglars, Fernand, and Villefort the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in his dungeon.\nThis oath was no longer a vain menace; for the fastest sailor in the Mediterranean would have been unable to overtake the little tartan, that with every stitch of canvas set was flying before the wind to Leghorn.",

Dantès looked in that direction as he raised the gourd to his mouth; then he stopped, hand suspended in mid-air. \"Hello! What's the matter at the Château d’If?\" the captain exclaimed. A small white cloud, which had caught Dantès' attention, appeared atop the Château d’If's bastion. At the same moment, the faint sound of a cannon was heard.

Tell me, what year is it?\" \"The year 1829,\" Jacopo answered. It had been exactly fourteen years, day for day, since Dantès’ arrest. He was nineteen when he entered the Château d’If; he was thirty-three when he escaped. A melancholy smile crossed his face; he wondered what had become of Mercédès, who must believe him deceased. Then his eyes ignited with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused him such a long and miserable confinement. He renewed the oath of unforgiving vengeance against Danglars, Fernand, and Villefort that he had made in his dungeon.

Each man can ask for what he wants.\" Jacopo replied that he was only remarking on it. The captain suggested Jacopo find Dantès something to wear. Jacopo didn’t have a jacket, but offered a shirt and trousers. Dantès said that was sufficient, and Jacopo soon fetched them. The captain asked if he needed anything else. Dantès requested some bread and another glass of the excellent rum, since he hadn’t eaten or drunk in a long time. They brought him bread and rum; as he drank, the captain called to alter the course. Dantès noticed a small white cloud above the Château d’If and stopped, raising his hand. The captain asked what was happening; Dantès explained the gun was firing because a prisoner had escaped. The captain looked at him, but Dantès drank calmly, dispelling any possible suspicion. Dantès remarked on the rum’s strength, but internally he relished his new freedom. Pretending to be tired, Dantès offered to steer, and was given the helm, letting him watch Marseilles as they sailed away. Dantès then asked Jacopo what the date was. Jacopo replied it was February 28th; when asked the year, he expressed surprise, but Dantès claimed he had lost track due to last night’s fright. Jacopo told him it was 1829. It was fourteen years to the day since Dantès’ arrest—he had entered the Château d’If at nineteen and was thirty-three upon escape. A sad smile crossed his face as he wondered what had become of Mercédès, who must think him dead, and his expression shifted to hatred as he recalled Danglars, Fernand, and Villefort—the ones responsible for his long suffering. He renewed his vow of revenge against them, and now this was no idle threat, for no sailor in the Mediterranean could catch up with the small, fast vessel speeding toward Leghorn."

          "text_segment": "Dantès had not been a day on board before he had a very clear idea of the men with whom his lot had been cast. Without having been in the school of the Abbé Faria, the worthy master of La Jeune Amélie (the name of the Genoese tartan) knew a smattering of all the tongues spoken on the shores of that large lake called the Mediterranean, from the Arabic to the Provençal, and this, while it spared him interpreters, persons always troublesome and frequently indiscreet, gave him great facilities of communication, either with the vessels he met at sea, with the small boats sailing along the coast, or with the people without name, country, or occupation, who are always seen on the quays of seaports, and who live by hidden and mysterious means which we must suppose to be a direct gift of Providence, as they have no visible means of support. It is fair to assume that Dantès was on board a smuggler.\nAt first the captain had received Dantès on board with a certain degree of distrust. He was very well known to the customs officers of the coast; and as there was between these worthies and himself a perpetual battle of wits, he had at first thought that Dantès might be an emissary of these industrious guardians of rights and duties, who perhaps employed this ingenious means of learning some of the secrets of his trade. But the skilful manner in which Dantès had handled the lugger had entirely reassured him; and then, when he saw the light plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the Château d’If, and heard the distant report, he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one whose coming and going, like that of kings, was accompanied with salutes of artillery. This made him less uneasy, it must be owned, than if the new-comer had proved to be a customs officer; but this supposition also disappeared like the first, when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his recruit.\nEdmond thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was, without the owner knowing who he was; and however the old sailor and his crew tried to “pump” him, they extracted nothing more from him; he gave accurate descriptions of Naples and Malta, which he knew as well as Marseilles, and held stoutly to his first story. Thus the Genoese, subtle as he was, was duped by Edmond, in whose favor his mild demeanor, his nautical skill, and his admirable dissimulation, pleaded. Moreover, it is possible that the Genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know nothing but what they should know, and believe nothing but what they should believe.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Within a day of being on board, Dantès had formed a clear understanding of the crew he was traveling with. Although not formally educated like Abbé Faria, the skilled master of the Genoese ship named La Jeune Amélie possessed knowledge of various languages spoken around the vast Mediterranean Sea, ranging from Arabic to Provençal. This linguistic ability eliminated the need for interpreters, who were often troublesome and unreliable, and significantly improved communication when encountering other ships at sea, smaller coastal boats, or the mysterious individuals found in port areas who seem to live without obvious means, perhaps relying on a kind of divine provision. It was reasonable to conclude that Dantès had found himself on a smuggler's ship. Initially, the captain viewed Dantès with suspicion. He was well-known to coastal customs officials, with whom he was in a constant battle of wits, and he suspected Dantès might be an agent sent by these diligent enforcers of laws and taxes, perhaps using this clever method to learn the secrets of his trade. However, Dantès's expert handling of the lugger completely alleviated the captain's concerns. Furthermore, upon seeing the thin smoke trail rising from the Château d’If's rampart and hearing the distant sound of a cannon, he was immediately struck by the idea that he had taken on board someone whose arrival or departure, much like that of royalty, was marked by an artillery salute. This prospect, it must be admitted, caused him less anxiety than discovering the new passenger was a customs officer, but this assumption also vanished when he observed the newcomer's complete calmness. Edmond thus had the advantage of knowing the captain's profession while keeping his own identity secret. Despite the old sailor and his crew's attempts to probe him for information, they learned nothing more; he accurately described places like Naples and Malta, which he knew as well as Marseilles, but firmly stuck to his original story. Consequently, the cunning Genoese captain was outwitted by Edmond, whose composed manner, nautical skill, and impressive ability to feign ignorance worked in his favor. It is also possible that the Genoese belonged to that category of astute individuals who only need to know what is strictly necessary and only believe what serves their purpose.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Dantès quickly became familiar with the crew and circumstances aboard the ship. The captain of La Jeune Amélie, although not as formally educated as the Abbé Faria, was skilled in many of the languages spoken around the Mediterranean, from Arabic to Provençal. This knowledge helped him communicate easily with various people and ships he encountered, avoiding the need for interpreters who could be inconvenient and untrustworthy. The people he met on the docks often led mysterious lives, seemingly supported by luck or providence. It was likely that Dantès had joined a smuggling ship. The captain was initially suspicious of Dantès, fearing he was perhaps sent by customs officers to spy on him, as he was well-acquainted with their tricks and wary of their interest in his activities. However, Dantès proved his skill in handling the vessel, which set the captain's mind at ease. The captain's suspicion lifted further when he saw a salute fired from Château d’If, thinking only someone of significance could attract such attention. Ultimately, Dantès kept his true identity secret, answering all questions about his past with convincing details and sticking to his story, so that even the clever Genoese captain was fooled. Dantès’ calm behavior, seamanship, and ability to hide his intentions won the crew over, and it’s possible the captain was the kind of man to know only what he wanted to know, and believe only what he chose to believe."

          "text_segment": "In this state of mutual understanding, they reached Leghorn. Here Edmond was to undergo another trial; he was to find out whether he could recognize himself, as he had not seen his own face for fourteen years. He had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been, and was now to find out what the man had become. His comrades believed that his vow was fulfilled. As he had twenty times touched at Leghorn, he remembered a barber in St. Ferdinand Street; he went there to have his beard and hair cut. The barber gazed in amazement at this man with the long, thick and black hair and beard, which gave his head the appearance of one of Titian’s portraits. At this period it was not the fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long; now a barber would only be surprised if a man gifted with such advantages should consent voluntarily to deprive himself of them. The Leghorn barber said nothing and went to work.\nWhen the operation was concluded, and Edmond felt that his chin was completely smooth, and his hair reduced to its usual length, he asked for a looking-glass. He was now, as we have said, three-and-thirty years of age, and his fourteen years’ imprisonment had produced a great transformation in his appearance.\nDantès had entered the Château d’If with the round, open, smiling face of a young and happy man, with whom the early paths of life have been smooth, and who anticipates a future corresponding with his past. This was now all changed. The oval face was lengthened, his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked lines which betoken resolution; his eyebrows were arched beneath a brow furrowed with thought; his eyes were full of melancholy, and from their depths occasionally sparkled gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred; his complexion, so long kept from the sun, had now that pale color which produces, when the features are encircled with black hair, the aristocratic beauty of the man of the north; the profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused over his features a refined intellectual expression; and he had also acquired, being naturally of a goodly stature, that vigor which a frame possesses which has so long concentrated all its force within itself.\nTo the elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the solidity of a rounded and muscular figure. As to his voice, prayers, sobs, and imprecations had changed it so that at times it was of a singularly penetrating sweetness, and at others rough and almost hoarse.\nMoreover, from being so long in twilight or darkness, his eyes had acquired the faculty of distinguishing objects in the night, common to the hyena and the wolf. Edmond smiled when he beheld himself; it was impossible that his best friend—if, indeed, he had any friend left—could recognize him; he could not recognize himself.\n",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Upon reaching Leghorn with this shared understanding, Edmond faced another significant challenge: determining if he could recognize himself after fourteen years without seeing his reflection. While he retained a memory of his youthful appearance, he now needed to discover the man he had become. Believing his vow fulfilled, and remembering a specific barber shop on St. Ferdinand Street from previous visits, he went there to get his impressively long, thick, black hair and beard cut. The barber stared in amazement at this man, whose appearance, reminiscent of a Titian portrait, featured hair and a beard far longer than the fashion of the time dictated. Today, a barber would only be surprised if someone with such a gift *didn't* want to keep it. Silently, the Leghorn barber began his work. Once finished, with his chin smooth and hair trimmed to a conventional length, Edmond requested a mirror. At thirty-three years old, his fourteen years of imprisonment had dramatically altered his appearance. He had entered the Château d’If with the round, open, smiling face of a youthful, happy man, whose life had been smooth and who expected a similarly bright future. All that had changed. His face was now elongated, his former smile replaced by firm, determined lines that spoke of resolution. Thought had furrowed his brow above arched eyebrows, and his eyes, full of melancholy, occasionally flashed with dark sparks of misanthropy and hatred. His complexion, long deprived of sunlight, was now pale, giving him an aristocratic beauty, particularly framed by his black hair, like a man from the north. The deep knowledge he had acquired also lent a refined, intellectual expression to his features. Furthermore, being naturally tall, his body, which had conserved its strength for so long, now possessed remarkable vigor. His previous slender, nervous frame had given way to a solid, rounded, muscular build. His voice, transformed by years of prayers, sobs, and curses, could be unsettlingly sweet at times, and at others, rough and nearly hoarse. Moreover, his eyes, long accustomed to dim light or darkness, had gained the ability to discern objects at night, a skill common to hyenas and wolves. Edmond smiled at his reflection; it was impossible that even his closest friend—if any remained—could recognize him. Indeed, he barely recognized himself.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "After reaching Leghorn together in this understanding, Edmond faced a new ordeal: seeing if he could now recognize his own face after fourteen years without a mirror. He could still recall how he looked as a young man and was about to discover his current appearance. While his companions believed he had honored his vow, Edmond, who had docked in Leghorn many times before, remembered a barber on St. Ferdinand Street and went there for a shave and haircut. The barber was astonished at Edmond’s long, thick black hair and beard, which made him look like a figure from a Titian painting—this style was unusual for the time. Today, a barber might be more shocked at someone wanting to remove such distinctive hair. Without commenting, the barber cut Edmond’s hair and shaved his beard. When Edmond felt his face smooth and hair trimmed, he asked for a mirror. Now thirty-three, fourteen years of imprisonment had changed him greatly. He had entered prison as a cheerful young man, expecting a bright future, but now his face was longer, his mouth stern and determined, his brow lined with thought, and his eyes dark with sadness and often flashing with bitterness and hatred. His once sun-deprived skin was now pale, lending a certain northern nobility to his features, and the knowledge he had gained showed as a new intelligence in his appearance. Years of confinement had also given his body more strength and firmness, replacing his former slenderness with a sturdier build. His voice too had changed; it could now sound hauntingly sweet or harsh and rough, depending on his mood. Extended time in darkness had made his eyes see well at night, like nocturnal animals. Upon seeing himself, Edmond smiled, realizing that even his closest friend would no longer recognize him—and neither could he."

A customs officer was laid low, and two sailors wounded; Dantès was one of the latter, a ball having touched him in the left shoulder. Dantès was almost glad of this affray, and almost pleased at being wounded, for they were rude lessons which taught him with what eye he could view danger, and with what endurance he could bear suffering. He had contemplated danger with a smile, and when wounded had exclaimed with the great philosopher, “Pain, thou art not an evil.”\nHe had, moreover, looked upon the customs officer wounded to death, and, whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter, or the chill of human sentiment, this sight had made but slight impression upon him. Dantès was on the way he desired to follow, and was moving towards the end he wished to achieve; his heart was in a fair way of petrifying in his bosom.

This second loading operation was just as successful as the first, suggesting good fortune for La Jeune Amélie. The new shipment was bound for the coast of the Duchy of Lucca, primarily containing Havana cigars, sherry, and Malaga wines. Upon arrival, they faced opposition while trying to evade customs duties; indeed, avoiding excise men was a constant challenge for the captain of La Jeune Amélie. A conflict ensued where a customs officer was killed and two sailors were wounded. Dantès was among the wounded sailors, having been hit by a ball in his left shoulder. Dantès found a strange satisfaction in this skirmish and his injury, considering them valuable, albeit harsh, lessons that revealed his capacity to face danger and endure pain. He had confronted the peril calmly, even with a smile, and when injured, he quoted a noted philosopher, declaring, 'Pain, you are not an evil.' He also observed the fatally wounded customs officer but felt little impact from the sight, perhaps a result of the intense fight or a developing emotional coldness. Dantès felt he was on the correct course, advancing towards his objective, and his emotions were steadily hardening within him. Jacopo, upon seeing Dantès collapse, believed he had been killed. He rushed to his side, helped him up, and then tended to his injuries with the devoted care of a true friend.",

Their new cargo, mainly made up of Havana cigars, sherry, and Malaga wines, was meant for delivery to the coast of the Duchy of Lucca. While unloading it, they ran into some trouble trying to avoid the taxes; excise officers were always a nuisance to the captain of La Jeune Amélie. During the scuffle, a customs officer was fatally wounded and two sailors were hurt; Dantès was among the wounded, having been hit in the left shoulder. Oddly, Dantès felt almost satisfied by the fight and even by his injury, as it gave him a tough lesson about how he handled danger and pain—he realized he could face threats with composure and endure suffering with resolve, even echoing a philosopher's words that pain is not truly an evil. When he saw the dying customs officer, it barely affected him, perhaps due to adrenaline or growing indifference. Dantès knew he was pursuing his own path towards his goal, and his feelings were becoming hardened. Jacopo, thinking Dantès had been killed when he fell, hurried to help him and took care of him with great loyalty and concern."

He would invent a reason to land on Monte Cristo Island, which would then allow him to conduct his search. However, he knew he wouldn't be entirely free to act, as those accompanying him would undoubtedly be observing him.

Dantès had visited this bustling center of maritime commerce a few times before, and seeing these tough free-traders who supplied the entire coast for roughly two hundred leagues, he had wondered about the power a single person could wield by directing the varied intentions of all these different individuals. On this occasion, they were debating a significant deal involving a ship laden with Turkish carpets, fabrics from the Levant, and cashmeres. The challenge was to find a neutral location for the exchange and then successfully smuggle the goods onto the French coast. If the operation succeeded, the profits would be immense, with each crew member standing to gain fifty or sixty piastres. The captain of *La Jeune Amélie* suggested Monte Cristo Island as the landing site. Since it was completely uninhabited, lacking soldiers or customs officials, it seemed as if Mercury, the god of both merchants and thieves (categories antiquity appeared to lump together, unlike our modern distinction), had placed it in the middle of the ocean since the time of the ancient Greek gods. Hearing the name 'Monte Cristo' startled Dantès with joy. He stood up to hide his emotion and walked around the smoky tavern, where a pidgin mix of languages from all over the world could be heard.

One night more and he would be on his way.\nThe night was one of feverish distraction, and in its progress visions, good and evil, passed through Dantès’ mind. If he closed his eyes, he saw Cardinal Spada’s letter written on the wall in characters of flame—if he slept for a moment the wildest dreams haunted his brain. He ascended into grottos paved with emeralds, with panels of rubies, and the roof glowing with diamond stalactites. Pearls fell drop by drop, as subterranean waters filter in their caves. Edmond, amazed, wonderstruck, filled his pockets with the radiant gems and then returned to daylight, when he discovered that his prizes had all changed into common pebbles. He then endeavored to re-enter the marvellous grottos, but they had suddenly receded, and now the path became a labyrinth, and then the entrance vanished, and in vain did he tax his memory for the magic and mysterious word which opened the splendid caverns of Ali Baba to the Arabian fisherman. All was useless, the treasure disappeared, and had again reverted to the genii from whom for a moment he had hoped to carry it off.\nThe day came at length, and was almost as feverish as the night had been, but it brought reason to the aid of imagination, and Dantès was then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in his brain. Night came, and with it the preparation for departure, and these preparations served to conceal Dantès’ agitation. He had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he was almost like a commander on board; and as his orders were always clear, distinct, and easy of execution, his comrades obeyed him with celerity and pleasure.\nThe old patron did not interfere, for he too had recognized the superiority of Dantès over the crew and himself. He saw in the young man his natural successor, and regretted that he had not a daughter, that he might have bound Edmond to him by a more secure alliance. At seven o’clock in the evening all was ready, and at ten minutes past seven they doubled the lighthouse just as the beacon was kindled. The sea was calm, and, with a fresh breeze from the south-east, they sailed beneath a bright blue sky, in which God also lighted up in turn his beacon lights, each of which is a world. Dantès told them that all hands might turn in, and he would take the helm. When the Maltese (for so they called Dantès) had said this, it was sufficient, and all went to their bunks contentedly.\nThis frequently happened. Dantès, cast from solitude into the world, frequently experienced an imperious desire for solitude; and what solitude is more complete, or more poetical, than that of a ship floating in isolation on the sea during the obscurity of the night, in the silence of immensity, and under the eye of Heaven?",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "So, finally, through one of those unpredictable fortunate turns that occasionally happen to individuals who have long suffered under difficult circumstances, Dantès was on the verge of securing the opportunity he desired, by simple and direct methods, allowing him to land on the island without attracting any suspicion. Just one more night and he would be on his way. That night was filled with restless agitation, and during it, both positive and negative visions passed through Dantès’ mind. If he closed his eyes, he saw Cardinal Spada’s letter written on the wall in fiery characters. If he slept for a moment, the wildest dreams tormented him. He ascended into caverns with floors paved with emeralds, walls paneled with rubies, and roofs sparkling with diamond-like formations. Pearls dropped one by one, like underground water filtering through rock in their caves. Edmond, astonished and amazed, filled his pockets with the brilliant jewels, only to find upon returning to daylight that his treasures had all turned into ordinary pebbles. He then tried to re-enter the marvelous grottos, but they had suddenly moved away, and the path became a maze. Then the entrance vanished, and he searched his memory in vain for the magical and mysterious word that had opened Ali Baba’s splendid caverns for the Arabian fisherman. It was all useless; the treasure disappeared, having returned to the supernatural beings from whom he had for a moment hoped to take it. The day eventually arrived, and it was almost as restless as the night had been, but it brought logic to assist his imagination, enabling Dantès to finally organize a plan that had previously been vague and undecided in his mind. Night came, and with it the preparations for departure, and these preparations helped to conceal Dantès’s internal turmoil. By degrees, he had gained such authority over his companions that he was almost like the commander on board; and since his instructions were always clear, precise, and easy to carry out, his comrades obeyed him promptly and willingly. The old captain did not interfere, for he too had recognized Dantès’s superior capability over the crew and himself. He saw in the young man his natural successor and regretted not having a daughter so he might have bound Edmond to him through a more secure relationship. At seven o’clock in the evening, all was ready, and at ten minutes past seven, they rounded the lighthouse just as its beacon was lit. The sea was calm, and with a fresh breeze from the southeast, they sailed beneath a bright blue sky, where God also, in turn, lit up his own beacon lights, each one a world. Dantès told them that all hands could go to their bunks, and he would take the helm. When the Maltese (as they called Dantès) had said this, it was enough, and everyone went to sleep contentedly. This happened frequently. Dantès, having been cast from solitude back into the world, often experienced a powerful desire for solitude; and what solitude is more complete or more poetic than that of a ship floating in isolation on the sea during the darkness of night, in the silence of immensity, and under the eye of Heaven?",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Finally, after suffering for so long under misfortune, Dantès was at last presented with an unexpected stroke of luck, allowing him to reach the island he desired in an easy, natural way, and without raising any suspicion. Just one more night and he would be on his way. The night was a restless one, dominated by intense thoughts and dreams. When Dantès closed his eyes, he imagined Cardinal Spada’s letter burning vividly on the wall; if he slept, he was tormented by strange dreams. He imagined himself walking through underground chambers lined with emerald floors, ruby walls, and ceilings sparkling with diamond formations. Pearls dripped around him like water in a cave. Overwhelmed, he filled his pockets with these dazzling jewels, only to find they had transformed into ordinary stones when he returned to the surface. When he tried to find his way back into these wondrous caves, the path twisted into a maze and disappeared, and he couldn’t recall the magic word that would open the hidden treasures, like in the tale of Ali Baba. Ultimately, the treasure vanished, slipping away from him once more. At last, morning arrived, and though Dantès still felt restless, clarity returned—he was now able to form a concrete plan that had previously eluded him. As night approached again, Dantès prepared for departure, hiding his excitement in the bustle. Over time, he had gained such authority that he seemed almost the leader; he gave instructions clearly and efficiently, earning the quick obedience of his companions. The old captain did not object, having recognized Dantès’ natural leadership and even wishing he had a daughter to unite their fates more closely. By seven in the evening, everything was ready. Soon after, they passed the lighthouse just as its light was ignited. The sea was smooth, a gentle southeasterly wind pushed them under a bright, starry sky. Dantès announced that the crew could sleep while he took over the wheel, and everyone trusted him enough to obey. This was common; after having spent so long alone, Dantès often found himself yearning for solitude again—and nothing, he felt, was more peaceful or poetic than being alone at night on a ship, surrounded by the vast, silent sea, beneath the watchful sky."

The Island of Monte Cristo appeared large on the horizon. Edmond gave control of the small vessel back to the master and went to lie in his hammock; however, despite not having slept at all during the night, he found it impossible to close his eyes. Two hours later, he returned to the deck as the boat was preparing to round the Island of Elba. They were currently alongside Mareciana and just past the level but green Island of La Pianosa. The summit of Monte Cristo, tinged red by the intense sunlight, was visible against the clear blue sky. Dantès instructed the helmsman to turn the wheel to keep La Pianosa on the starboard side, knowing this would cut their journey by two or three knots. By about five o'clock in the evening, the island was clearly defined, and everything on it could be seen distinctly, thanks to the remarkable atmospheric clarity typical of the light cast by the setting sun. Edmond stared very intently at the collection of rocks, which displayed the full range of twilight colors, from the lightest pink to the deepest blue.

Edmond handed control of the lugger back to the captain and tried to get some rest in his hammock; nonetheless, although he was exhausted from a sleepless night, he was unable to fall asleep. After about two hours, Edmond returned to the deck as the boat was about to pass the Island of Elba, now alongside Mareciana and not far from La Pianosa, which was lush and low. Monte Cristo’s peak, glowing red in the bright sunlight, was clearly visible against the blue sky. Edmond told the helmsman to change course, leaving La Pianosa to starboard, knowing this would make their route shorter by a couple of knots. By around five o’clock in the evening, the island’s details became clear, thanks to the clear atmosphere and the unique golden light of the setting sun. Edmond studied the rocky island closely, watching as the colors shifted from vibrant pinks to dark blues in the twilight.

He was the first to jump on shore; and had he dared, he would, like Lucius Brutus, have “kissed his mother earth.” It was dark, but at eleven o’clock the moon rose in the midst of the ocean, whose every wave she silvered, and then, “ascending high,” played in floods of pale light on the rocky hills of this second Pelion.\nThe island was familiar to the crew of La Jeune Amélie,—it was one of her regular haunts. As to Dantès, he had passed it on his voyage to and from the Levant, but never touched at it. He questioned Jacopo.\n“Where shall we pass the night?” he inquired.\n“Why, on board the tartan,” replied the sailor.\n“Should we not do better in the grottos?”\n“What grottos?”\n“Why, the grottos—caves of the island.”\n“I do not know of any grottos,” replied Jacopo.\nThe cold sweat sprang forth on Dantès’ brow.\n“What, are there no grottos at Monte Cristo?” he asked.\n“None.”\nFor a moment Dantès was speechless; then he remembered that these caves might have been filled up by some accident, or even stopped up, for the sake of greater security, by Cardinal Spada. The point was, then, to discover the hidden entrance. It was useless to search at night, and Dantès therefore delayed all investigation until the morning. Besides, a signal made half a league out at sea, and to which La Jeune Amélie replied by a similar signal, indicated that the moment for business had come.\nThe boat that now arrived, assured by the answering signal that all was well, soon came in sight, white and silent as a phantom, and cast anchor within a cable’s length of shore.",

Though it was dark, the moon rose over the ocean at eleven, silvering each wave, and then, high in the sky, bathed the rocky terrain of this second Pelion in soft, pale light. The crew of La Jeune Amélie was familiar with the island, as it was one of their regular haunts. Dantès, conversely, had only sailed past it on trips to and from the Levant, never having set foot upon it. He questioned Jacopo, \"Where shall we spend the night?\" \"On the tartan,\" the sailor replied. \"Wouldn't we be better off in the caves?\" \"What caves?\" \"The grottos—the island's caverns.\" \"I don't know of any grottos,\" Jacopo stated. Cold sweat beaded on Dantès' brow. \"What, there are no grottos on Monte Cristo?\" he asked. \"None.\" Dantès was momentarily speechless, then recalled that the caves might have been blocked by some event or deliberately sealed for protection by Cardinal Spada. The key was to find the concealed entry. Searching in the darkness was pointless, so Dantès postponed any exploration until daybreak. Moreover, a signal emitted half a league out at sea, answered by a corresponding signal from La Jeune Amélie, indicated that the moment for their task had arrived.

The night was dark until the moon rose at eleven o’clock, illuminating the ocean in silvery light and casting a pale glow on the rugged hills of this island, likened to a second Pelion. The crew of La Jeune Amélie knew the island well, as they often frequented it. However, Dantès himself had only ever sailed past, never stopping. He asked Jacopo where they would sleep that night. Jacopo suggested staying aboard the tartan, but Dantès wondered if the caves on the island would be better. Jacopo, however, knew of no such caves, which caused Dantès some distress. Recalling that the caves might have been concealed or blocked off, possibly by Cardinal Spada, Dantès realized he would need to search for a hidden entrance, but decided it was pointless to do so in the dark. Meanwhile, a signal from a boat half a league offshore, which La Jeune Amélie answered, signaled that it was time for business. The arriving boat, reassured by the exchanged signals, soon became visible—appearing ghostly in the night—and anchored a short distance from the shore."

Still, Jacopo insisted on accompanying him, and Dantès accepted, not wanting to appear mistrustful. Shortly after, having shot a young goat, Dantès asked Jacopo to bring it back to their group, telling them to prepare it and signal him with a gunshot when the meal was ready. Their meal would consist of this meat, some dried fruit, and a bottle of Monte Pulciano wine. Dantès continued alone, pausing now and then to look around. From on top of a rock, he could see far below his friends, now joined by Jacopo, preparing the food that he had provided. Dantès observed them for a while, wearing the gentle, melancholic smile of a man above his peers. He thought to himself that within two hours, these men would each leave with fifty more piastres, only to risk their lives again for such gains, eventually amassing six hundred francs, which they would squander in a city with pride and arrogance. Right now, Dantès found such wealth meaningless, as hope set him above material riches; but he wondered if, should hope fail him, he might one day regret not treasuring such money. He reassured himself this would not happen—Faria could not be wrong about such things—and believed it was better to die than to continue such a dull, miserable existence."

Keeping along the shore, and examining the smallest object with serious attention, he thought he could trace, on certain rocks, marks made by the hand of man.\nTime, which encrusts all physical substances with its mossy mantle, as it invests all things of the mind with forgetfulness, seemed to have respected these signs, which apparently had been made with some degree of regularity, and probably with a definite purpose. Occasionally the marks were hidden under tufts of myrtle, which spread into large bushes laden with blossoms, or beneath parasitical lichen. So Edmond had to separate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the guide-marks were. The sight of marks renewed Edmond fondest hopes. Might it not have been the cardinal himself who had first traced them, in order that they might serve as a guide for his nephew in the event of a catastrophe, which he could not foresee would have been so complete. This solitary place was precisely suited to the requirements of a man desirous of burying treasure. Only, might not these betraying marks have attracted other eyes than those for whom they were made? and had the dark and wondrous island indeed faithfully guarded its precious secret?\nIt seemed, however, to Edmond, who was hidden from his comrades by the inequalities of the ground, that at sixty paces from the harbor the marks ceased; nor did they terminate at any grotto. A large round rock, placed solidly on its base, was the only spot to which they seemed to lead. Edmond concluded that perhaps instead of having reached the end of the route he had only explored its beginning, and he therefore turned round and retraced his steps.\nMeanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast, had got some water from a spring, spread out the fruit and bread, and cooked the kid. Just at the moment when they were taking the dainty animal from the spit, they saw Edmond springing with the boldness of a chamois from rock to rock, and they fired the signal agreed upon. The sportsman instantly changed his direction, and ran quickly towards them. But even while they watched his daring progress, Edmond’s foot slipped, and they saw him stagger on the edge of a rock and disappear. They all rushed towards him, for all loved Edmond in spite of his superiority; yet Jacopo reached him first.\nHe found Edmond lying prone, bleeding, and almost senseless. He had rolled down a declivity of twelve or fifteen feet.",

This shift wasn't inherent to Dantès himself, but rather a result of Providence, which, while restricting human power, instills in people endless aspirations. Meanwhile, following a path carved by a stream through a split in the rock walls, a route likely never before trod by human feet, Dantès approached the area where he believed the caves might be located. He walked along the coastline, carefully examining every detail, and thought he could discern man-made markings on certain rocks. Time, which covers physical objects with moss just as it blankets memories with forgetfulness, seemed to have spared these symbols, which appeared to be arranged somewhat systematically and likely served a specific purpose. Occasionally, these marks were concealed by thick myrtle bushes covered in flowers or hidden beneath parasitic lichen. Consequently, Edmond had to push aside branches or brush away the moss to locate the guiding signs. The discovery of these marks rekindled Edmond's most cherished hopes. He wondered if the cardinal himself might have made them initially as a guide for his nephew in case of an unexpected disaster, though he couldn't have predicted it would be so absolute. This isolated spot was perfectly suited for someone intending to bury treasure. However, he pondered whether these tell-tale signs might have attracted others besides their intended recipients, and if the mysterious, dark island had truly kept its valuable secret safe. To Edmond, who was hidden from his companions by the uneven terrain, it seemed the marks stopped about sixty paces from the harbor and did not lead to any cave. Instead, they appeared to point only towards a large, sturdy, round rock. Edmond concluded that instead of having reached the end, he might have only found the beginning of the trail, so he turned back and retraced his steps. In the meantime, his comrades had finished preparing their meal, fetching water from a spring, arranging the fruit and bread, and cooking the young goat. Just as they were taking the cooked animal off the spit, they saw Edmond leaping across the rocks with the agility of a mountain goat. They fired the agreed-upon signal. The 'sportsman' immediately changed direction and ran swiftly towards them. But even as they watched his bold movements, Edmond's foot slipped, and they saw him lose his balance on the edge of a rock and vanish from sight. They all rushed towards him, as everyone loved Edmond despite his obvious superiority, but Jacopo reached him first. He found Edmond lying face down, bleeding, and nearly unconscious. He had fallen down a slope approximately twelve to fifteen feet high.",

This insatiable yearning wasn’t Dantès’ fault but rather the work of Providence, which restricts human abilities but gives them limitless desires. Dantès made his way through a gap between two rocky walls, following a path likely made by a rushing stream and probably never before traveled by anyone. He moved along the shore carefully, inspecting every detail, and noticed what seemed to be man-made marks on some rocks. Strangely, time, which usually covers everything in moss and causes memories to fade, had left these marks visible, suggesting they were made purposefully and with a plan. Sometimes they were hidden by myrtle bushes or lichen, and Edmond had to move branches or clear the moss to uncover them. Seeing these signs rekindled his greatest hopes—perhaps the cardinal himself had left them to guide his nephew, should disaster strike, though he could never have anticipated how absolute it would be. The secluded area seemed perfect for hiding treasure. Yet Edmond wondered if these markings might have led someone else to discover the secret, or if the island truly kept the treasure well hidden. As he moved, Edmond—concealed from his companions by the uneven terrain—realized that about sixty paces from the harbor, the signs stopped before reaching any cave, ending at a large, round, firmly-set rock. He thought he might not have found the route’s end but only its start, so he turned around to search anew. Meanwhile, his friends had prepared a meal: they fetched water from a spring, spread out fruit and bread, and cooked the kid. Just as they were taking the cooked meat from the spit, they saw Edmond bounding nimbly across the rocks. They fired a predetermined signal, and Edmond quickly changed course toward them. But as they watched, his foot slipped—he stumbled at the edge and vanished from view. They all hurried to him, since they cared for Edmond despite his superiority, but Jacopo arrived first. He found Edmond lying face down, bleeding and barely conscious, having fallen twelve or fifteen feet down a slope."

          "text_segment": "They poured a little rum down his throat, and this remedy which had before been so beneficial to him, produced the same effect as formerly. Edmond opened his eyes, complained of great pain in his knee, a feeling of heaviness in his head, and severe pains in his loins. They wished to carry him to the shore; but when they touched him, although under Jacopo’s directions, he declared, with heavy groans, that he could not bear to be moved.\nIt may be supposed that Dantès did not now think of his dinner, but he insisted that his comrades, who had not his reasons for fasting, should have their meal. As for himself, he declared that he had only need of a little rest, and that when they returned he should be easier. The sailors did not require much urging. They were hungry, and the smell of the roasted kid was very savory, and your tars are not very ceremonious. An hour afterwards they returned. All that Edmond had been able to do was to drag himself about a dozen paces forward to lean against a moss-grown rock.\nBut, instead of growing easier, Dantès’ pains appeared to increase in violence. The old patron, who was obliged to sail in the morning in order to land his cargo on the frontiers of Piedmont and France, between Nice and Fréjus, urged Dantès to try and rise. Edmond made great exertions in order to comply; but at each effort he fell back, moaning and turning pale.\n“He has broken his ribs,” said the commander, in a low voice. “No matter; he is an excellent fellow, and we must not leave him. We will try and carry him on board the tartan.”\nDantès declared, however, that he would rather die where he was than undergo the agony which the slightest movement cost him.\n“Well,” said the patron, “let what may happen, it shall never be said that we deserted a good comrade like you. We will not go till evening.”\nThis very much astonished the sailors, although, not one opposed it. The patron was so strict that this was the first time they had ever seen him give up an enterprise, or even delay in its execution. Dantès would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his favor.\n“No, no,” he said to the patron, “I was awkward, and it is just that I pay the penalty of my clumsiness. Leave me a small supply of biscuit, a gun, powder, and balls, to kill the kids or defend myself at need, and a pickaxe, that I may build a shelter if you delay in coming back for me.”\n“But you’ll die of hunger,” said the patron.\n“I would rather do so,” was Edmond’s reply, “than suffer the inexpressible agonies which the slightest movement causes me.”\nThe patron turned towards his vessel, which was rolling on the swell in the little harbor, and, with sails partly set, would be ready for sea when her toilet should be completed.\n“What are we to do, Maltese?” asked the captain. “We cannot leave you here so, and yet we cannot stay.”\n“Go, go!” exclaimed Dantès.\n“We shall be absent at least a week,” said the patron, “and then we must run out of our course to come here and take you up again.”\n“Why,” said Dantès, “if in two or three days you hail any fishing-boat, desire them to come here to me. I will pay twenty-five piastres for my passage back to Leghorn. If you do not come across one, return for me.” The patron shook his head.\n“Listen, Captain Baldi; there’s one way of settling this,” said Jacopo. “Do you go, and I will stay and take care of the wounded man.”\n“And give up your share of the venture,” said Edmond, “to remain with me?”\n“Yes,” said Jacopo, “and without any hesitation.”\n“You are a good fellow and a kind-hearted messmate,” replied Edmond, “and heaven will recompense you for your generous intentions; but I do not wish anyone to stay with me. A day or two of rest will set me up, and I hope I shall find among the rocks certain herbs most excellent for bruises.”\nA peculiar smile passed over Dantès’ lips; he squeezed Jacopo’s hand warmly, but nothing could shake his determination to remain—and remain alone.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "After giving him a little rum, a remedy that had previously proven effective, Edmond recovered consciousness. He complained of intense pain in his knee, a heavy sensation in his head, and severe discomfort in his lower back. They attempted to carry him towards the shore, following Jacopo's instructions, but the moment they touched him, he groaned heavily and declared he could not tolerate being moved.Understandably, Dantès had lost his appetite, but he insisted that his crewmates, who weren't bound by his reasons for fasting, proceed with their meal. As for himself, he claimed he simply needed some rest and would feel better upon their return. The sailors didn't require much convincing; they were hungry, and the aroma of the roasted goat was appealing. Sailors are generally not ones for formality. An hour later, they came back. In the interim, Edmond had only managed to pull himself a mere dozen steps forward to lean against a rock covered in moss.However, instead of easing, Dantès' pain seemed to intensify dramatically. The older captain, who was under pressure to sail the following morning to unload cargo at the border between Piedmont and France, between Nice and Fréjus, urged Dantès to attempt to stand up. Edmond made significant efforts to comply, but with each try, he fell back down, groaning and turning pale.Whispering, the commander commented, \"He's broken his ribs. Nevertheless, he's a fine fellow, and we cannot abandon him. We'll try to get him onto the tartan.\"Dantès, however, maintained that he would prefer to die where he was rather than endure the agony caused by even the slightest movement.\"Alright,\" the captain said, \"come what may, it will never be said that we deserted a good comrade like you. We won't leave until evening.\"This decision greatly surprised the sailors, although none voiced opposition. The captain was known for his strict adherence to schedules; this was the first time they had ever seen him abandon or even delay an undertaking. Dantès was unwilling to allow such a departure from established rules and practices to be made on his behalf.\"No, no,\" he told the captain, \"I was clumsy, and it's only fair that I bear the consequences of my awkwardness. Leave me a small amount of biscuit, a gun, powder, and shot to hunt goats or defend myself if necessary, and a pickaxe so I can build a shelter should your return be delayed.\"\"But you'll starve to death,\" the captain pointed out.\"I would rather do that,\" Edmond replied, \"than suffer the unbearable pain that the smallest movement inflicts upon me.\"The captain looked towards his ship, which was gently rising and falling with the swell in the small bay. With her sails partially set, she would be ready to depart once her preparations were complete.\"What are we to do, Maltese?\" the captain asked. \"We can't leave you like this, and yet we can't stay.\"\"Go, go!\" Dantès urged.\"We'll be gone for at least a week,\" the captain said, \"and then we'll have to deviate from our route to come back here and pick you up.\"\"Look,\" Dantès proposed, \"if in two or three days you hail any fishing boat, ask them to come here for me. I'll pay twenty-five piastres for my return passage to Leghorn. If you don't come across one, then please return for me.\" The captain shook his head skeptically.\"Listen, Captain Baldi; there's a way to resolve this,\" Jacopo interjected. \"You go ahead, and I will stay behind to care for the injured man.\"\"And you'd give up your share of the voyage's profits,\" Edmond asked, \"just to stay with me?\"\"Yes,\" Jacopo confirmed, \"without hesitation.\"\"You are a good man and a kind shipmate,\" Edmond responded, \"and heaven will reward your generous intentions. But I don't want anyone to stay with me. A day or two of rest will help me recover, and I hope to find certain excellent herbs for bruises among the rocks.\"A subtle smile played on Dantès' lips; he clasped Jacopo's hand warmly, but nothing could sway his resolve to remain—and to remain alone.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "They gave Edmond a little rum, which helped him just as it had before. He woke up, mentioning severe pain in his knee, a heavy feeling in his head, and back pain. Although they wanted to carry him to shore following Jacopo’s advice, Edmond groaned and said the pain was too much to move. While he forgot about food himself, he encouraged his companions to eat since they had no reason to go hungry. Edmond only asked for some rest, hoping to feel better when they returned. The sailors, tempted by the smell of food, didn’t need to be asked twice. When they got back an hour later, Edmond had only managed to drag himself a short way to lean against a mossy rock. Unfortunately, his pain had increased rather than eased. The old captain, pressed for time because he needed to deliver cargo, urged Edmond to try getting up, but each attempt left Edmond faint and groaning. The commander guessed Edmond had broken his ribs but insisted they couldn’t abandon him and would try carrying him to the ship. Edmond refused, claiming he’d rather die on the spot than suffer the torment of being moved. The captain, surprisingly, decided they’d stay until evening instead of leaving, which was so unlike him that it stunned the crew. Edmond, however, wouldn’t allow them to break their routines for him. He asked them to leave him with basics—biscuits, a gun, ammunition, and a pickaxe—so he could feed and protect himself until their return. When the captain warned he might die of hunger, Edmond replied he preferred that to the horrible pain moving caused. The captain looked at his ship, torn about what to do. Edmond urged them to go and suggested that if they found a fishing boat in a few days, they could pay for his passage back; otherwise, they should return for him later. Jacopo volunteered to stay and care for Edmond, giving up his share of their trip, but Edmond wouldn’t hear of it. Gratefully, he said a couple of days’ rest and some wild herbs would suffice, firmly insisting on staying alone."

Thousands of grasshoppers, hidden in the bushes, chirped with a monotonous and dull note; the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees waved and rustled in the wind. At every step that Edmond took he disturbed the lizards glittering with the hues of the emerald; afar off he saw the wild goats bounding from crag to crag. In a word, the island was inhabited, yet Edmond felt himself alone, guided by the hand of God.\nHe felt an indescribable sensation somewhat akin to dread—that dread of the daylight which even in the desert makes us fear we are watched and observed. This feeling was so strong that at the moment when Edmond was about to begin his labor, he stopped, laid down his pickaxe, seized his gun, mounted to the summit of the highest rock, and from thence gazed round in every direction.\nBut it was not upon Corsica, the very houses of which he could distinguish; or on Sardinia; or on the Island of Elba, with its historical associations; or upon the almost imperceptible line that to the experienced eye of a sailor alone revealed the coast of Genoa the proud, and Leghorn the commercial, that he gazed. It was at the brigantine that had left in the morning, and the tartan that had just set sail, that Edmond fixed his eyes.\nThe first was just disappearing in the straits of Bonifacio; the other, following an opposite direction, was about to round the Island of Corsica.\nThis sight reassured him.",

Hidden in the bushes, thousands of grasshoppers produced a continuous, monotonous chirping sound; the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees swayed and rustled in the wind. With every step Edmond took, he startled emerald-colored lizards that scurried away; in the distance, he observed wild goats leaping between cliffs. In essence, the island was populated, yet Edmond felt completely alone, as if being guided by a higher power. He experienced an unsettling feeling, something akin to fear—the kind of daytime apprehension that makes one feel watched even in a desolate place. This sensation was so powerful that just as Edmond was about to start digging, he paused, put down his pickaxe, grabbed his rifle, ascended to the highest rock, and from there surveyed his surroundings in all directions. However, his gaze was not directed at Corsica, whose houses were visible, nor at Sardinia, nor the historically significant Island of Elba, nor the faint line on the horizon that only a skilled sailor would recognize as the proud coast of Genoa and the commercial port of Leghorn. Instead, he focused his eyes on the brigantine that had departed that morning and the tartan that had just set sail. The first vessel was disappearing into the Bonifacio straits, while the other was moving in the opposite direction, preparing to sail around the Island of Corsica. Witnessing this sight brought him a sense of relief.",

Countless grasshoppers, hidden among the bushes, chirped with a repetitive and dull sound; the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees fluttered and rustled in the breeze. With each step Edmond took, he startled lizards shimmering with emerald colors, while in the distance he could see wild goats leaping from one rocky outcrop to another. In summary, the island had plenty of animal life, but Edmond nonetheless felt completely alone, as if led only by divine guidance.\nHe was overcome by a strange and almost fearful sensation—a kind of anxiety that daylight sometimes brings, making one feel watched even in desolate places. This feeling grew so strong that, as Edmond was about to start working, he paused, put down his pickaxe, grabbed his gun, climbed to the top of the highest rock, and looked around in all directions.\nYet, his gaze was not directed toward Corsica, whose houses he could make out; nor toward Sardinia; nor at the Island of Elba, rich in history; nor at the barely visible outline of the coastlines of Genoa or Leghorn. Instead, Edmond focused on the brigantine that had sailed away earlier that morning, and the tartan that had just left port.\nThe first ship was now vanishing into the straits of Bonifacio, while the second sailed the opposite way, about to pass around Corsica.\nSeeing this put his mind at ease."

Then he descended with cautious and slow step, for he dreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned should happen in reality.\nDantès, as we have said, had traced the marks along the rocks, and he had noticed that they led to a small creek, which was hidden like the bath of some ancient nymph. This creek was sufficiently wide at its mouth, and deep in the centre, to admit of the entrance of a small vessel of the lugger class, which would be perfectly concealed from observation.\nThen following the clew that, in the hands of the Abbé Faria, had been so skilfully used to guide him through the Dædalian labyrinth of probabilities, he thought that the Cardinal Spada, anxious not to be watched, had entered the creek, concealed his little barque, followed the line marked by the notches in the rock, and at the end of it had buried his treasure.

As mentioned, Dantès had tracked the markings etched into the rocks and saw they led to a secluded cove, hidden as if it were a secret bathing spot for an ancient goddess. This inlet was broad enough at its entrance and deep enough in the middle to allow a small vessel, such as a lugger, to enter and be completely hidden from view. Following the same logic that Abbé Faria had so expertly employed to navigate him through a complex web of possibilities, Dantès reasoned that Cardinal Spada, wishing to avoid detection, must have entered the cove, hidden his small boat, followed the path indicated by the rock carvings, and buried his wealth at the end of it. This line of thinking was what had drawn Dantès back to the circular stone. However, one particular detail bothered Edmond and undermined his conclusion.",

He began to descend carefully and slowly, worried that a real mishap might occur, similar to the one he had previously pretended. As previously mentioned, Dantès had followed markings etched in the rocks and saw they led to a small, hidden inlet, tucked away like a secluded bathing spot from ancient times. The inlet was wide enough at the entrance and deep enough in the middle for a small boat, such as a lugger, to enter and remain hidden from view. Using the clues that Abbé Faria had so cleverly interpreted, which had helped him navigate the confusing web of possibilities, he reasoned that Cardinal Spada, wishing to avoid being seen, had entered the inlet, hid his small boat, and followed the signs on the rocks, ultimately burying his treasure at the end of the trail. This thought was what led Dantès to return to the round rock. However, one detail puzzled Edmond and cast doubt on his theory."

Instead of raising it, thought he, they have lowered it. And he sprang from the rock in order to inspect the base on which it had formerly stood.\nHe soon perceived that a slope had been formed, and the rock had slid along this until it stopped at the spot it now occupied. A large stone had served as a wedge; flints and pebbles had been inserted around it, so as to conceal the orifice; this species of masonry had been covered with earth, and grass and weeds had grown there, moss had clung to the stones, myrtle-bushes had taken root, and the old rock seemed fixed to the earth.\nDantès dug away the earth carefully, and detected, or fancied he detected, the ingenious artifice.

Suddenly, a thought struck him. What if, instead of being lifted, it had been lowered? He immediately jumped down from the rock to examine the base where it must have originally stood. He quickly saw that a ramp-like slope had been constructed, and the rock had apparently slid down this slope until it settled where it was. A large stone had been used as a wedge to stop it; flints and pebbles were placed around it to hide the opening. This sort of makeshift wall had been covered with soil, and over time, grass and weeds had grown there, moss had attached itself to the stones, myrtle bushes had taken root, making the old rock appear as if it had always been part of the landscape. Dantès carefully cleared away the earth and noticed, or perhaps imagined, the cleverness of the disguise. He used his pickaxe to attack this barrier that nature had helped cement over time. After working for ten minutes, the wall gave way, creating a hole large enough to put his arm through. Dantès went and cut the strongest olive tree he could find, removed its branches, inserted it into the hole, and tried to use it as a lever. However, the rock was too heavy and too deeply wedged for a single man, even one as strong as Hercules, to move it. Dantès realized he needed to deal with the wedge stone. But how? He looked around and spotted the horn filled with gunpowder that his friend Jacopo had left for him. He smiled, thinking this 'infernal' invention would serve his purpose. Using his pickaxe, Dantès, much like a resourceful pioneer, dug a space between the large rock and the stone holding it up, filled it with powder, then made a fuse by rolling his handkerchief in saltpetre.

A sudden realization struck him: perhaps the rock had been brought there by being lowered down rather than lifted up. He jumped down to examine the ground where the rock had originally rested and quickly noticed a sloped surface that the rock could have slid down to reach its current location. He observed a large stone was wedged underneath it, with smaller stones and pebbles packed around to hide an opening, all camouflaged with dirt and vegetation that made the rock look naturally settled. Carefully, Dantès removed the soil and uncovered what he believed was a cleverly constructed hiding spot. Using his pickaxe, he broke through this aged wall and made a hole big enough to fit his arm through. He then found a sturdy olive branch, trimmed it, and tried to use it as a lever, but the rock was too heavy for him to move alone. Realizing he needed to remove the wedge stone to progress, he looked around and noticed a horn of gunpowder left by his friend Jacopo. Thinking this would solve his problem, Dantès fashioned a small tunnel with his pickaxe, packed it with powder, made a makeshift fuse from his saltpeter-soaked handkerchief, lit it, and moved away to wait for the explosion."

He had only found the first grotto; he had now to seek the second. Dantès continued his search. He reflected that this second grotto must penetrate deeper into the island; he examined the stones, and sounded one part of the wall where he fancied the opening existed, masked for precaution’s sake.\nThe pickaxe struck for a moment with a dull sound that drew out of Dantès’ forehead large drops of perspiration. At last it seemed to him that one part of the wall gave forth a more hollow and deeper echo; he eagerly advanced, and with the quickness of perception that no one but a prisoner possesses, saw that there, in all probability, the opening must be.\nHowever, he, like Cæsar Borgia, knew the value of time; and, in order to avoid fruitless toil, he sounded all the other walls with his pickaxe, struck the earth with the butt of his gun, and finding nothing that appeared suspicious, returned to that part of the wall whence issued the consoling sound he had before heard.\nHe again struck it, and with greater force. Then a singular thing occurred. As he struck the wall, pieces of stucco similar to that used in the ground work of arabesques broke off, and fell to the ground in flakes, exposing a large white stone. The aperture of the rock had been closed with stones, then this stucco had been applied, and painted to imitate granite. Dantès struck with the sharp end of his pickaxe, which entered someway between the interstices.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Saying \"I will descend,\" he went down, smiling slightly and softly speaking that final philosophical word, \"Perhaps!\" Contrary to the deep gloom and foul air he anticipated, Dantès perceived a faint, blue-tinged light. Both the light and the air were coming in not only through the opening he had just made but also through the gaps and cracks in the rock face visible from the outside. Through these, he could make out the clear blue sky, the moving branches of evergreen trees, and the climbing plants growing on the rocks. After pausing for a few minutes inside the cave, which felt more warm than humid, Dantès' eyes, accustomed to the lack of light, could now see into the farthest corners of the chamber. The cave walls were made of granite that glittered like diamonds. \"Ah,\" Edmond remarked with a smile, \"these must be the treasures the cardinal mentioned. The poor abbé, having dreamed of these sparkling walls, must have been led to false hopes.\" However, he recalled the exact wording of the will, which he knew perfectly. The cardinal's will stated, \"In the farthest corner of the second opening.\" He had only discovered the first chamber; he needed to find the second. Dantès pressed on with his search. He reasoned that this subsequent cave must extend further into the island. He inspected the rocks and tapped a section of the wall where he suspected the entrance might be, assuming it was concealed for security. The pickaxe struck for a moment with a muffled sound that caused large beads of sweat to appear on Dantès' brow. Finally, it seemed to him that a section of the wall produced a more empty and resonant echo. He quickly moved closer, and with the sharp intuition unique to a prisoner, realized that this was, in all likelihood, where the entrance was located. Nevertheless, valuing efficiency like Cæsar Borgia, and wishing to avoid wasted effort, he tested all the other walls with his pickaxe and struck the ground with the end of his gun. Finding no other areas that seemed unusual, he returned to the part of the wall that had previously made the promising sound. He struck it again, this time with more force. At that moment, something unusual happened. As he hit the wall, bits of stucco resembling plaster used for decorative patterns flaked off and fell, revealing a large white stone underneath. The original rock opening had been sealed with stones, then covered with this stucco, which was painted to look like granite. Dantès jabbed with the pointed end of his pickaxe, which found its way into a gap between the stones.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"I will go down,\" he said, then descended with a smile and softly uttered that ultimate word of human wisdom: \"Perhaps!\" Yet instead of the darkness and suffocating air he had braced for, Dantès found a faint, bluish glow. Both the light and fresh air entered not just through the opening he’d made, but also through cracks and gaps in the rock, allowing him glimpses of blue sky, swaying oak branches, and vines trailing from the cliffs. After standing in the cavern, which was warm rather than damp, Dantès' eyes—used to darkness—could make out even the farthest corners, the granite walls sparkling like gems. With a wry smile, he remarked, \"So these are the treasures the cardinal left; the poor abbé, glimpsing such glittering stones in a dream, was deceived by false hopes.\" But then he recalled the words from the will, which he knew well: the treasure would be found \"in the farthest corner of the second opening.\" Having only discovered the first cave so far, Dantès realized he must keep looking. Thinking the second chamber must go deeper into the island, he examined the stones and tapped part of the wall where he suspected a hidden entrance. His pickaxe struck with a dull sound, sweat dripping from his forehead, until he thought he heard a more hollow, echoing noise from one spot. Sensing this must be the right place—helped by the keen intuition only a prisoner develops—he checked all the other walls with his pickaxe and gun butt to avoid wasted effort, but nothing else seemed out of the ordinary. Returning to the spot with the obvious echo, he struck harder, and something unusual happened: flakes of stucco, like those used in decorative artwork, broke off and revealed a large white stone. The rock opening had been sealed with stones, overlaid with stucco to disguise it as granite. Dantès used the pointed end of his pickaxe, pushing it into the cracks between the stones."

After several blows he perceived that the stones were not cemented, but had been merely placed one upon the other, and covered with stucco; he inserted the point of his pickaxe, and using the handle as a lever, with joy soon saw the stone turn as if on hinges, and fall at his feet.\nHe had nothing more to do now, but with the iron tooth of the pickaxe to draw the stones towards him one by one. The aperture was already sufficiently large for him to enter, but by waiting, he could still cling to hope, and retard the certainty of deception. At last, after renewed hesitation, Dantès entered the second grotto.\nThe second grotto was lower and more gloomy than the first; the air that could only enter by the newly formed opening had the mephitic smell Dantès was surprised not to find in the outer cavern. He waited in order to allow pure air to displace the foul atmosphere, and then went on.\nAt the left of the opening was a dark and deep angle. But to Dantès’ eye there was no darkness. He glanced around this second grotto; it was, like the first, empty.\nThe treasure, if it existed, was buried in this corner. The time had at length arrived; two feet of earth removed, and Dantès’ fate would be decided.\nHe advanced towards the angle, and summoning all his resolution, attacked the ground with the pickaxe. At the fifth or sixth blow the pickaxe struck against an iron substance. Never did funeral knell, never did alarm-bell, produce a greater effect on the hearer. Had Dantès found nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale.\nHe again struck his pickaxe into the earth, and encountered the same resistance, but not the same sound.\n“It is a casket of wood bound with iron,” thought he.\nAt this moment a shadow passed rapidly before the opening; Dantès seized his gun, sprang through the opening, and mounted the stair. A wild goat had passed before the mouth of the cave, and was feeding at a little distance. This would have been a favorable occasion to secure his dinner; but Dantès feared lest the report of his gun should attract attention.\nHe thought a moment, cut a branch of a resinous tree, lighted it at the fire at which the smugglers had prepared their breakfast, and descended with this torch.\n",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The pickaxe, which had seemed burdensome earlier, now felt incredibly light in his grip. He grabbed it and began striking the wall. After a few blows, he realized the stones weren't held together with mortar, but were simply stacked one on top of the other and covered with plaster. He inserted the tip of the pickaxe and used the handle as leverage, feeling relief as he saw a stone pivot as if on hinges and drop to his feet. His task was now just to pull the remaining stones towards him one by one using the pickaxe's iron point. The opening was already large enough for him to enter, but by delaying, he could hold onto hope a little longer and postpone the possible disappointment. Finally, after renewed hesitation, Dantès stepped into the second chamber. The second grotto was lower and dimmer than the first. The air entering only through the new opening carried the unpleasant smell that Dantès had been surprised not to find in the outer cave. He waited for the fresh air to clear the foul atmosphere before moving forward. To the left of the entrance was a dark, deep corner. However, to Dantès' eyes, darkness was no impediment. He scanned this second grotto; it was empty, just like the first. The treasure, if it actually existed, had to be buried in this specific corner. The moment had finally arrived; digging away just two feet of earth would reveal Dantès' fate. He moved towards the corner, gathered all his resolve, and began attacking the ground with the pickaxe. On the fifth or sixth swing, the pickaxe struck something metallic. No death knell or alarm bell could have had a more profound effect on him. Dantès couldn't have turned paler if he had found nothing at all. He struck the earth again with the pickaxe and met the same resistance, but the sound was different this time. 'It must be a wooden chest bound with iron,' he thought. Just then, a shadow darted across the opening. Dantès grabbed his gun, sprang through the hole, and climbed the steps. A wild goat had passed by the cave entrance and was grazing nearby. It would have been an ideal chance to secure food, but Dantès worried that the sound of his gun would attract unwanted attention. He paused for a moment, cut a branch from a resinous tree, lit it using the fire where the smugglers had cooked breakfast, and descended back into the cave with the torch.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The pickaxe, which had felt so burdensome before, now seemed weightless in his hands. He grabbed it eagerly and started breaking down the wall. After a few strikes, he noticed the stones were only stacked together without any cement, just covered in plaster; so he wedged the pickaxe’s point in and used the handle as a lever. With excitement, he watched a stone turn as if on hinges and drop at his feet. Now he only needed to pull the stones toward himself with the metal tip of the pickaxe, one at a time. The hole he’d opened was already big enough to climb through, but he hesitated, still hoping to postpone the possibility of disappointment. At last, after more hesitation, Dantès entered the second cave.\n\nThis second cave was darker and lower than the first, with air that had a poisonous smell—something Dantès had not noticed in the outer chamber, likely because fresh air had only just started flowing in. He waited for the air to clear before going farther. To the left of the entrance was a pitch-black, deep corner, but Dantès could see clearly despite the darkness. He looked around the cave, finding it empty like the first.\n\nIf the treasure existed at all, it had to be buried in the corner. The crucial moment had arrived; after removing two feet of earth, Dantès’ destiny would be determined. He walked over, gathered his courage, and struck the ground with the pickaxe. On the fifth or sixth hit, he struck something metallic. The shock was as great as hearing a funeral bell or alarm; even if he’d found nothing, he couldn’t have gone paler.\n\nHe hit the ground again and struck a similar resistance, but the sound was different. \"It must be a wooden chest with iron bands,\" he thought. At that instant, a shadow flashed in front of the opening. Dantès grabbed his gun, jumped through the opening, and climbed the stairs. It turned out a wild goat had passed by the cave entrance and was grazing nearby. Though Dantès could have easily hunted it for food, he worried the gunshot would alert someone. Pausing to think, he instead cut a branch from a pine tree, lit it with the smugglers’ fire, and descended into the cave with this improvised torch."

There was no longer any doubt: the treasure was there—no one would have been at such pains to conceal an empty casket. In an instant he had cleared every obstacle away, and he saw successively the lock, placed between two padlocks, and the two handles at each end, all carved as things were carved at that epoch, when art rendered the commonest metals precious.\nDantès seized the handles, and strove to lift the coffer; it was impossible. He sought to open it; lock and padlock were fastened; these faithful guardians seemed unwilling to surrender their trust.

He approached the pit he had been digging and, using the light from the torch, confirmed that his pickaxe had indeed struck metal and wood. He stuck the torch into the ground and continued his work. In moments, he had cleared an area measuring three feet long by two feet wide, revealing an oak chest reinforced with decorative cut steel. Centered on the lid was a bright, untarnished silver plate featuring the coat of arms of the Spada family: a sword standing upright on an oval shield, typical of Italian heraldry, topped by a cardinal's hat. Dantès immediately recognized the arms, as Faria had drawn them for him so frequently. All doubt vanished; the treasure was certainly here, as no one would invest such effort in concealing an empty container. He quickly removed all obstructions, revealing the locking system: a single lock secured between two padlocks, and handles at each end. All these parts were intricately carved in the style of that era when artistic craftsmanship elevated even common metals. Dantès gripped the handles and attempted to lift the chest, but it was too heavy. He then tried to open it, but the lock and padlocks held fast, like diligent protectors unwilling to yield their charge. Dantès inserted the sharp point of his pickaxe between the chest and the lid and leveraged the handle with all his might, forcing the fastenings to break open. The hinges gave way next, detaching themselves while still clutching splinters of wood, and the chest sprang open. Overcome by dizziness, Edmond prepared his gun and placed it next to him.",

Dantès recognized the emblem immediately; Faria had drawn it for him many times. There could be no doubt now: this was the treasure—no one would hide an empty chest so elaborately. He quickly removed any remaining dirt, revealing the chest’s lock, protected by two padlocks, and ornate handles at each end, all crafted with the skill of the era when even common metals were turned into art. Dantès grabbed the handles, attempting to lift the chest, but it would not budge. He tried to open it, but the locks held firm, as if they were determined to guard what was inside. Using the pointed end of the pickaxe, he wedged it between the chest and the lid, forcing the fastenings open with his strength.

He soon became calmer and more happy, for only now did he begin to realize his felicity.\nHe then set himself to work to count his fortune. There were a thousand ingots of gold, each weighing from two to three pounds; then he piled up twenty-five thousand crowns, each worth about eighty francs of our money, and bearing the effigies of Alexander VI. and his predecessors; and he saw that the complement was not half empty. And he measured ten double handfuls of pearls, diamonds, and other gems, many of which, mounted by the most famous workmen, were valuable beyond their intrinsic worth.\nDantès saw the light gradually disappear, and fearing to be surprised in the cavern, left it, his gun in his hand.

The chest was divided into three sections. The first was filled with gleaming piles of gold coins; the second contained rough gold bars, valuable solely for their weight; and in the third, Edmond scooped up handfuls of diamonds, pearls, and rubies, which clattered against each other like hail on glass as they fell. After touching, feeling, and examining these riches, Edmond raced through the underground chambers as if driven by madness; he sprang onto a rock from where he could view the sea. He was utterly alone—alone with this immeasurable, unprecedented treasure! Was this wakefulness, or merely a dream? A fleeting image, or was he facing reality? He desperately wanted to gaze upon his gold but felt too weak; for a moment, he held his head in his hands as if to ground himself, then frantically dashed across the rocks of Monte Cristo, his wild cries and movements frightening the wild goats and scattering the seabirds. He then returned and, still doubting his senses, hurried back into the grotto, finding himself once more before the vast hoard of gold and jewels. This time, he dropped to his knees, convulsively clasped his hands, and offered a prayer understood only by God. Soon, he grew calmer and a sense of profound happiness settled over him, as he began to truly grasp the magnitude of his good fortune. He then started the task of counting his wealth. There were a thousand gold ingots, each weighing between two and three pounds; next, he stacked twenty-five thousand crowns, each worth about eighty of our francs, bearing the images of Alexander VI. and earlier popes; and he noted that the chest was still more than half full. He also measured out ten double handfuls of pearls, diamonds, and other gems, many of which, set by master craftsmen, held value far exceeding their inherent worth. As the light began to fade, Dantès, fearful of being discovered in the cave, left it, carrying his gun. His supper consisted of a piece of biscuit and a little rum, and he managed to get a few hours of sleep lying near the entrance of the cave. It was a night marked by a mix of joy and terror, an intense emotional experience this man of extraordinary feelings had undergone perhaps only two or three times before in his life.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "He shut his eyes, like a child does to imagine more stars in the vivid darkness of their mind than exist in the sky, and then opened them again, astounded and unmoving. The chest was divided into three sections. The first overflowed with stacks of gold coins. In the second, rough gold bars were lined up, valuable for their worth alone. In the third, Edmond scooped up handfuls of diamonds, pearls, and rubies, which clattered together like hail against a window. After feeling and inspecting these riches, Edmond darted frantically through the caves, leaping onto a rock to look out at the sea. He was utterly alone with this unimaginable fortune. Was this reality, or just a fleeting dream? He wanted to stare at the treasure, but felt too overwhelmed; for a moment, he buried his head in his hands as if to regain his senses, then hurried excitedly through the rocks of Monte Cristo, startling the goats and birds with his shouts and gestures. Still doubting his senses, he hurried back into the grotto, standing again before this treasure trove. This time he dropped to his knees and, clutching his hands, murmured a prayer only God could understand. Soon he grew calmer and more joyful, as the happiness of his discovery began to sink in. He started estimating his riches: a thousand gold ingots, each two or three pounds; twenty-five thousand crowns—each worth about eighty francs and bearing the likeness of Alexander VI or earlier popes—and noticed that the chest was still more than half full. He measured out double handfuls of pearls and precious stones, many set by renowned jewelers and worth far more than their base value. As dusk approached, Dantès, wary of being discovered, left the cave with his gun. He ate a simple meal of biscuit and some rum, then slept for a few hours at the cave's entrance. That night was filled with both delight and anxiety—the sort of immense feeling he had only experienced a few times in his life."

Again he climbed the rocky height he had ascended the previous evening, and strained his view to catch every peculiarity of the landscape; but it wore the same wild, barren aspect when seen by the rays of the morning sun which it had done when surveyed by the fading glimmer of eve.\nDescending into the grotto, he lifted the stone, filled his pockets with gems, put the box together as well and securely as he could, sprinkled fresh sand over the spot from which it had been taken, and then carefully trod down the earth to give it everywhere a uniform appearance; then, quitting the grotto, he replaced the stone, heaping on it broken masses of rocks and rough fragments of crumbling granite, filling the interstices with earth, into which he deftly inserted rapidly growing plants, such as the wild myrtle and flowering thorn, then carefully watering these new plantations, he scrupulously effaced every trace of footsteps, leaving the approach to the cavern as savage-looking and untrodden as he had found it. This done, he impatiently awaited the return of his companions.

          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The new day, which Dantès had anticipated with great eagerness, finally arrived. As soon as it was light, Dantès continued his search. He once again ascended the rocky hill he had climbed the evening before, straining his sight to discern every detail of the terrain; but it presented the same wild, desolate appearance in the morning sun's rays as it had when viewed in the dwindling light of evening. Descending into the grotto, he lifted the stone, filled his pockets with jewels, reassembled the box as securely as he could, sprinkled fresh sand over the area from which it had been taken, and then carefully pressed down the earth to make it look uniform. Leaving the grotto, he replaced the stone cover, piling broken rocks and rough pieces of crumbling granite upon it, filling the spaces with earth into which he skillfully planted rapidly growing plants like wild myrtle and flowering thorn. After carefully watering these new plantings, he meticulously erased all traces of his presence, leaving the approach to the cavern looking as untamed and untrodden as he had found it. With this completed, he anxiously awaited the return of his companions. Staying on Monte Cristo merely to guard the immense riches that had fallen into his possession like a dragon did not satisfy his heart's desires. His true longing was to return and live among others, to acquire the status, authority, and influence that wealth invariably confers—that primary and most significant of all human forces.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The day Dantès had anxiously awaited arrived once more. As soon as daylight broke, he resumed his search, climbing the same stony hill he had scaled the night before and carefully observing the scenery, which looked just as wild and empty in the morning light as it had at sunset. Returning to the cave, he lifted the stone, filled his pockets with precious gems, fastened the box as securely as possible, covered the area with fresh sand, and pressed down the earth to make everything look untouched. Leaving the grotto, he put the stone back and piled broken rocks and chunks of granite on top, packing soil in between and planting quick-growing shrubs like myrtle and thorn. He watered these new plants and erased any sign of his presence, making the entrance appear just as wild and undisturbed as before. With this done, he waited impatiently for his friends to return. Guarding the immense treasure at Monte Cristo was not enough to satisfy him—his true desire was to return to society, using his newfound wealth to gain the position, influence, and respect that great riches inevitably bring."

He then inquired how they had fared in their trip. To this question the smugglers replied that, although successful in landing their cargo in safety, they had scarcely done so when they received intelligence that a guard-ship had just quitted the port of Toulon and was crowding all sail towards them. This obliged them to make all the speed they could to evade the enemy, when they could but lament the absence of Dantès, whose superior skill in the management of a vessel would have availed them so materially.

From a distance, Dantès recognized the appearance and maneuvering of La Jeune Amélie, and making his way with feigned difficulty towards the shore, he met his companions, assuring them that while he was much better than when they had left, he was still suffering intensely from his recent injury. He then asked about their voyage. The smugglers replied that they had successfully landed their cargo, but immediately afterward, they received news that a guard ship had departed Toulon harbor and was heading rapidly towards them. This forced them to make haste to escape their pursuer, leading them to lament the absence of Dantès, whose superior ability in handling a ship would have been extremely beneficial. The pursuing vessel had, in fact, almost overtaken them when, luckily, night arrived, allowing them to round the Cape of Corsica and avoid being caught. Despite the chase, the trip was successful enough to satisfy everyone involved; the crew, particularly Jacopo, expressed deep regret that Dantès had not shared equally in the profits, which amounted to fifty piastres for each man. Edmond maintained remarkable composure, not letting the slightest sign of a smile or disappointment show as they detailed the gains he would have earned if he had been able to leave the island; but as La Jeune Amélie had only come to Monte Cristo to collect him, he boarded that same night and traveled with the captain to Leghorn.",

He asked about their journey, and they told him that though they managed to unload their goods safely, they had to escape quickly when they learned a guard-ship had left Toulon and was coming after them. They regretted not having Dantès with them, as his skills at sailing would have helped. The enemy ship almost caught up, but nightfall allowed the smugglers to escape around Cape Corsica. Overall, the voyage was profitable, and the crew—especially Jacopo—were sorry Dantès hadn’t shared in their earnings, which amounted to fifty piastres each.

A bargain was therefore struck. Dantès led the owner of the yacht to the dwelling of a Jew; retired with the latter for a few minutes to a small back parlor, and upon their return the Jew counted out to the shipbuilder the sum of sixty thousand francs in bright gold pieces.\nThe delighted builder then offered his services in providing a suitable crew for the little vessel, but this Dantès declined with many thanks, saying he was accustomed to cruise about quite alone, and his principal pleasure consisted in managing his yacht himself; the only thing the builder could oblige him in would be to contrive a sort of secret closet in the cabin at his bed’s head, the closet to contain three divisions, so constructed as to be concealed from all but himself.

It had been commissioned by an Englishman who, having heard that Genoese shipbuilders were unrivaled in their creation of swift vessels in the Mediterranean, wanted an example of their craftsmanship. He had agreed to pay forty thousand francs for it. Dantès, impressed by the yacht’s beauty and performance, approached the owner with an offer of sixty thousand francs, provided he could take ownership immediately. The offer was too tempting to refuse—especially since the Englishman for whom the yacht was being built was away in Switzerland for at least three weeks or a month, and the builder believed he could finish another yacht in that time. Dantès and the owner went to the house of a Jewish moneylender, and after a brief meeting, the Jew paid the shipbuilder sixty thousand francs in gold. The builder, pleased, offered to recruit a crew for the yacht, but Dantès politely declined, explaining that he preferred to sail solo and took pleasure in handling the yacht himself. He only requested that the builder add a secret compartment with three sections in the cabin near his bed—concealed from anyone but himself. The builder gladly agreed, promising to finish the secret spaces by the following day using the specifications Dantès provided."

For his father’s death he was in some manner prepared; but he knew not how to account for the mysterious disappearance of Mercédès.\nWithout divulging his secret, Dantès could not give sufficiently clear instructions to an agent. There were, besides, other particulars he was desirous of ascertaining, and those were of a nature he alone could investigate in a manner satisfactory to himself. His looking-glass had assured him, during his stay at Leghorn, that he ran no risk of recognition; moreover, he had now the means of adopting any disguise he thought proper. One fine morning, then, his yacht, followed by the little fishing-boat, boldly entered the port of Marseilles, and anchored exactly opposite the spot from whence, on the never-to-be-forgotten night of his departure for the Château d’If, he had been put on board the boat destined to convey him thither.\nStill Dantès could not view without a shudder the approach of a gendarme who accompanied the officers deputed to demand his bill of health ere the yacht was permitted to hold communication with the shore; but with that perfect self-possession he had acquired during his acquaintance with Faria, Dantès coolly presented an English passport he had obtained from Leghorn, and as this gave him a standing which a French passport would not have afforded, he was informed that there existed no obstacle to his immediate debarkation.\nThe first person to attract the attention of Dantès, as he landed on the Canebière, was one of the crew belonging to the Pharaon. Edmond welcomed the meeting with this fellow—who had been one of his own sailors—as a sure means of testing the extent of the change which time had worked in his own appearance.

Furthermore, there were details he wanted to uncover himself, as only he could examine them to his satisfaction.

So, one lovely morning, his yacht, trailed by the small fishing boat, confidently entered Marseilles harbor and anchored precisely opposite the spot where, on the unforgettable night of his arrest and journey to the Château d’If, he had been placed onto the boat that took him there. Dantès still felt a shiver when a gendarme approached with the officials who needed to check his bill of health before the yacht could interact with the shore. However, with the perfect composure he had developed during his time with Faria, Dantès calmly showed an English passport from Leghorn. Since this provided him with a better status than a French one would have, he was informed he could disembark immediately without issue. As he stepped onto the Canebière, the first person Dantès noticed was a former crew member from the Pharaon. Edmond saw meeting this man, one of his old sailors, as an excellent opportunity to gauge how much his appearance had changed.

Dantès realized that unless he revealed his secrets, he couldn’t guide anyone to investigate adequately. There were other details he wanted to uncover, things only he could explore to his satisfaction. During his time in Leghorn, his reflection had convinced him he wouldn’t be recognized, and now he also had the resources to adopt any disguise he wished. One clear morning, the yacht, with the fishing boat following, sailed into Marseilles’ harbor and anchored right across from where, on that unforgettable night, he’d been sent to the Château d’If. Dantès still felt uneasy when he saw a gendarme with the customs officers seeking his bill of health before allowing anyone ashore; however, thanks to the confidence he’d gained from Faria, he calmly presented an English passport from Leghorn, which provided him with protection beyond what a French passport could. Therefore, he was told there was nothing stopping him from disembarking at once. As he stepped onto the Canebière, the first person Dantès noticed was a sailor from the Pharaon, his old ship. Dantès was glad; he saw this as a good opportunity to see how much his appearance had changed over time. He approached the sailor, asked him several questions on various topics, and closely observed his reactions—but the man showed no sign of recognizing Dantès as someone he had ever met before."

I see that I have made a trifling mistake, as you say; but by way of rewarding your honesty I give you another double Napoleon, that you may drink to my health, and be able to ask your messmates to join you.”\nSo extreme was the surprise of the sailor, that he was unable even to thank Edmond, whose receding figure he continued to gaze after in speechless astonishment. “Some nabob from India,” was his comment.\nDantès, meanwhile, went on his way. Each step he trod oppressed his heart with fresh emotion; his first and most indelible recollections were there; not a tree, not a street, that he passed but seemed filled with dear and cherished memories. And thus he proceeded onwards till he arrived at the end of the Rue de Noailles, from whence a full view of the Allées de Meilhan was obtained. At this spot, so pregnant with fond and filial remembrances, his heart beat almost to bursting, his knees tottered under him, a mist floated over his sight, and had he not clung for support to one of the trees, he would inevitably have fallen to the ground and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing there. Recovering himself, however, he wiped the perspiration from his brows, and stopped not again till he found himself at the door of the house in which his father had lived.\nThe nasturtiums and other plants, which his father had delighted to train before his window, had all disappeared from the upper part of the house.\nLeaning against the tree, he gazed thoughtfully for a time at the upper stories of the shabby little house. Then he advanced to the door, and asked whether there were any rooms to be let. Though answered in the negative, he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on the fifth floor, that, in despite of the oft-repeated assurance of the concierge that they were occupied, Dantès succeeded in inducing the man to go up to the tenants, and ask permission for a gentleman to be allowed to look at them.\nThe tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been scarcely married a week; and seeing them, Dantès sighed heavily. Nothing in the two small chambers forming the apartments remained as it had been in the time of the elder Dantès; the very paper was different, while the articles of antiquated furniture with which the rooms had been filled in Edmond’s time had all disappeared; the four walls alone remained as he had left them.\nThe bed belonging to the present occupants was placed as the former owner of the chamber had been accustomed to have his; and, in spite of his efforts to prevent it, the eyes of Edmond were suffused in tears as he reflected that on that spot the old man had breathed his last, vainly calling for his son.\nThe young couple gazed with astonishment at the sight of their visitor’s emotion, and wondered to see the large tears silently chasing each other down his otherwise stern and immovable features; but they felt the sacredness of his grief, and kindly refrained from questioning him as to its cause, while, with instinctive delicacy, they left him to indulge his sorrow alone.\nWhen he withdrew from the scene of his painful recollections, they both accompanied him downstairs, reiterating their hope that he would come again whenever he pleased, and assuring him that their poor dwelling would ever be open to him.\nAs Edmond passed the door on the fourth floor, he paused to inquire whether Caderousse the tailor still dwelt there; but he received for reply, that the person in question had got into difficulties, and at the present time kept a small inn on the route from Bellegarde to Beaucaire.",

Yes, I see I made a small error, as you noted; but as a reward for your honesty, I'll give you another double Napoleon, so you can drink to my health and invite your shipmates to join you.\" The sailor was so utterly taken aback that he couldn't even thank Edmond, whose retreating figure he watched in silent astonishment. \"He must be some wealthy man from India,\" the sailor mused. Meanwhile, Dantès pressed on. Each step he took stirred deep emotions; his earliest and most enduring memories were connected to this place. Every tree and street he passed seemed imbued with cherished recollections. He continued walking until he reached the end of the Rue de Noailles, from which he had a clear view of the Allées de Meilhan. At this spot, so full of loving memories of his father and past, his heart pounded furiously, his legs felt unsteady, and his vision blurred. He had to grasp a tree for support; otherwise, he would have surely fallen and been endangered by the constant traffic. Recovering himself, he wiped the sweat from his brow and did not stop again until he stood before the building where his father used to live. The nasturtiums and other plants that his father had enjoyed cultivating outside his window were no longer present on the upper part of the house. Leaning against the tree, he contemplated the upper stories of the humble little house for a while. Then, he approached the door and inquired if any rooms were available for rent. Although told there were none, he pleaded so sincerely to be allowed to see those on the fifth floor that, despite the concierge's repeated assurances that they were occupied, Dantès successfully convinced the man to go up and ask the tenants if a gentleman could view their rooms. The occupants of the modest apartment were a young couple who had been married for barely a week. Seeing them, Dantès sighed heavily. Nothing in the two small rooms forming the apartment remained as it had been during the time of the elder Dantès; even the wallpaper was different, and the old-fashioned furniture that had filled the rooms in Edmond's youth was gone. Only the four walls were unchanged. The current occupants' bed was placed where the previous resident had kept his. Despite his efforts to remain composed, Edmond's eyes welled up with tears as he reflected that his father had taken his last breath on that very spot, having called out for his son in vain. The young couple observed their visitor's emotional reaction with surprise, wondering why such large tears were silently falling down his otherwise stern and expressionless face. However, they recognized the sacredness of his grief and kindly refrained from asking him its cause, tactfully leaving him alone to process his sorrow. When he departed from the scene of his painful memories, they both accompanied him downstairs, reiterating their invitation for him to return whenever he pleased and assuring him their simple home would always be open to him. As Edmond passed the door on the fourth floor, he paused to ask if Caderousse the tailor still lived there. He was informed that the individual in question had encountered financial difficulties and was currently running a small inn located on the route between Bellegarde and Beaucaire.",

To reward your honesty, I am giving you another double Napoleon – have a drink to my health, and share with your friends.”\n\nThe sailor was so stunned, he could not even thank Edmond, simply standing and watching him walk away, amazed, muttering, “Must be some rich man from India.”\n\nDantès went on, feeling intense emotions with every step – everywhere he looked, familiar places brought back powerful and cherished memories. He walked until he reached the end of the Rue de Noailles, where he could see the Allées de Meilhan.

          "text_segment": "Such of my readers as have made a pedestrian excursion to the south of France may perchance have noticed, about midway between the town of Beaucaire and the village of Bellegarde,—a little nearer to the former than to the latter,—a small roadside inn, from the front of which hung, creaking and flapping in the wind, a sheet of tin covered with a grotesque representation of the Pont du Gard. This modern place of entertainment stood on the left-hand side of the post road, and backed upon the Rhône. It also boasted of what in Languedoc is styled a garden, consisting of a small plot of ground, on the side opposite to the main entrance reserved for the reception of guests. A few dingy olives and stunted fig-trees struggled hard for existence, but their withered dusty foliage abundantly proved how unequal was the conflict. Between these sickly shrubs grew a scanty supply of garlic, tomatoes, and eschalots; while, lone and solitary, like a forgotten sentinel, a tall pine raised its melancholy head in one of the corners of this unattractive spot, and displayed its flexible stem and fan-shaped summit dried and cracked by the fierce heat of the sub-tropical sun.\nAll these trees, great or small, were turned in the direction to which the Mistral blows, one of the three curses of Provence, the others being the Durance and the Parliament.\nIn the surrounding plain, which more resembled a dusty lake than solid ground, were scattered a few miserable stalks of wheat, the effect, no doubt, of a curious desire on the part of the agriculturists of the country to see whether such a thing as the raising of grain in those parched regions was practicable. Each stalk served as a perch for a grasshopper, which regaled the passers-by through this Egyptian scene with its strident, monotonous note.\nFor about seven or eight years the little tavern had been kept by a man and his wife, with two servants,—a chambermaid named Trinette, and a hostler called Pecaud. This small staff was quite equal to all the requirements, for a canal between Beaucaire and Aiguemortes had revolutionized transportation by substituting boats for the cart and the stagecoach. And, as though to add to the daily misery which this prosperous canal inflicted on the unfortunate innkeeper, whose utter ruin it was fast accomplishing, it was situated between the Rhône from which it had its source and the post-road it had depleted, not a hundred steps from the inn, of which we have given a brief but faithful description.\nThe innkeeper himself was a man of from forty to fifty-five years of age, tall, strong, and bony, a perfect specimen of the natives of those southern latitudes; he had dark, sparkling, and deep-set eyes, hooked nose, and teeth white as those of a carnivorous animal; his hair, like his beard, which he wore under his chin, was thick and curly, and in spite of his age but slightly interspersed with a few silvery threads. His naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of brown from the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of stationing himself from morning till eve at the threshold of his door, on the lookout for guests who seldom came, yet there he stood, day after day, exposed to the meridional rays of a burning sun, with no other protection for his head than a red handkerchief twisted around it, after the manner of the Spanish muleteers. This man was our old acquaintance, Gaspard Caderousse.\nHis wife, on the contrary, whose maiden name had been Madeleine Radelle, was pale, meagre, and sickly-looking. Born in the neighborhood of Arles, she had shared in the beauty for which its women are proverbial; but that beauty had gradually withered beneath the devastating influence of the slow fever so prevalent among dwellers by the ponds of Aiguemortes and the marshes of Camargue. She remained nearly always in her second-floor chamber, shivering in her chair, or stretched languid and feeble on her bed, while her husband kept his daily watch at the door—a duty he performed with so much the greater willingness, as it saved him the necessity of listening to the endless plaints and murmurs of his helpmate, who never saw him without breaking out into bitter invectives against fate; to all of which her husband would calmly return an unvarying reply, in these philosophic words:\n“Hush, La Carconte. It is God’s pleasure that things should be so.”\nThe sobriquet of La Carconte had been bestowed on Madeleine Radelle from the fact that she had been born in a village, so called, situated between Salon and Lambesc; and as a custom existed among the inhabitants of that part of France where Caderousse lived of styling every person by some particular and distinctive appellation, her husband had bestowed on her the name of La Carconte in place of her sweet and euphonious name of Madeleine, which, in all probability, his rude gutteral language would not have enabled him to pronounce.\nStill, let it not be supposed that amid this affected resignation to the will of Providence, the unfortunate innkeeper did not writhe under the double misery of seeing the hateful canal carry off his customers and his profits, and the daily infliction of his peevish partner’s murmurs and lamentations.\nLike other dwellers in the south, he was a man of sober habits and moderate desires, but fond of external show, vain, and addicted to display. During the days of his prosperity, not a festivity took place without himself and wife being among the spectators. He dressed in the picturesque costume worn upon grand occasions by the inhabitants of the south of France, bearing equal resemblance to the style adopted both by the Catalans and Andalusians; while La Carconte displayed the charming fashion prevalent among the women of Arles, a mode of attire borrowed equally from Greece and Arabia. But, by degrees, watch-chains, necklaces, parti-colored scarves, embroidered bodices, velvet vests, elegantly worked stockings, striped gaiters, and silver buckles for the shoes, all disappeared; and Gaspard Caderousse, unable to appear abroad in his pristine splendor, had given up any further participation in the pomps and vanities, both for himself and wife, although a bitter feeling of envious discontent filled his mind as the sound of mirth and merry music from the joyous revellers reached even the miserable hostelry to which he still clung, more for the shelter than the profit it afforded.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "For any of my readers who have traveled on foot in the southern region of France, you might have noticed a small inn located roughly halfway between the town of Beaucaire and the village of Bellegarde, slightly closer to Beaucaire. This modern establishment, situated on the left side of the main post road and bordering the Rhône river in the back, was identifiable by a metal sheet hanging from its facade, creaking and flapping in the wind, featuring a distorted image of the Pont du Gard. It also featured what is considered a garden in Languedoc: a small area across from the main entrance set aside for visitors. In this garden, a few straggly olive trees and stunted fig trees struggled to survive, their dry, dusty leaves clearly showing their difficult fight. Between these weak plants grew a sparse amount of garlic, tomatoes, and shallots. Standing alone in one corner of this unappealing plot, like a forgotten guard, was a tall pine tree. Its flexible trunk and fan-shaped top were dry and cracked from the intense heat of the almost tropical sun. All these trees, big or small, leaned in the direction of the Mistral wind, which is one of the three major problems in Provence, the others being the Durance river and the local Parliament. The surrounding flat land looked more like a dusty lake than firm ground. Scattered within it were a few sad stalks of wheat, likely planted out of sheer curiosity by local farmers wanting to see if growing grain was even possible in such dry conditions. Each wheat stalk served as a resting place for a grasshopper, which filled the air of this desolate, almost Egyptian-like scene with its loud, steady chirping, audible to anyone passing by. The little inn had been operated by a couple and their two servants, a maid named Trinette and a stablehand called Pecaud, for about seven or eight years. This small staff was sufficient because a newly built canal between Beaucaire and Aiguemortes had dramatically changed transportation, favoring boats over horse-drawn carts and stagecoaches. This canal, which originated from the Rhône and ran parallel to the post road it had nearly emptied of traffic, was located less than a hundred steps from the inn we've just described briefly but accurately. Its close proximity only worsened the daily hardships for the unfortunate innkeeper, whose business was rapidly failing because of it. The innkeeper himself was a man between 40 and 55 years old, tall, strong, and lean, a typical man from the southern parts of the country. He had dark, sharp, deep-set eyes, a hooked nose, and teeth as white as a wild animal's. His hair and the beard he wore under his chin were thick and curly, showing only a scattering of gray despite his age. His naturally dark skin had become even browner because he had developed the habit of standing at his doorway from morning till night, hoping for guests who rarely arrived. Day after day, he remained there, exposed to the intense midday sun with only a red handkerchief tied around his head like Spanish mule drivers do, offering any protection. This man was someone we've encountered before: Gaspard Caderousse. His wife, whose birth name was Madeleine Radelle, was the opposite: pale, thin, and sickly. Born near Arles, she had possessed the beauty for which women from that area are famous, but it had faded under the destructive effect of the slow fever common among those living near the ponds of Aiguemortes and the marshes of Camargue. She spent most of her time in their second-floor room, either shivering in a chair or lying weakly on her bed, while her husband kept his daily vigil at the door. He was quite willing to do this duty, as it saved him from having to listen to his wife's endless complaints and grumbling. Whenever she saw him, she would burst into bitter accusations against fate. To all of this, her husband would calmly offer the same philosophical response: 'Quiet, La Carconte. God wills it to be this way.' Madeleine Radelle received the nickname La Carconte because she was born in a village with that name, located between Salon and Lambesc. Since it was customary in the region where Caderousse lived to give people specific, distinguishing names, her husband used 'La Carconte' instead of her lovely name, Madeleine, which his rough, guttural way of speaking likely made difficult to pronounce. However, one should not think that despite this outward acceptance of fate, the struggling innkeeper didn't suffer internally. He was tormented by the twin misfortunes of seeing the detested canal take away his customers and profits, and enduring his nagging wife's constant complaints and sorrow. Like other people in the south, he was typically sober and had modest desires, but he was also vain and enjoyed showing off. In the days when he was doing well, he and his wife would always be among the spectators at local celebrations. He wore the distinctive traditional outfit worn on special occasions by southern French people, which resembled the styles of both Catalans and Andalusians. La Carconte displayed the attractive fashion favored by the women of Arles, a style influenced by both Greek and Arabian clothing. But gradually, everything disappeared: watch chains, necklaces, colorful scarves, embroidered vests, velvet jackets, finely worked stockings, striped gaiters, and silver shoe buckles. Gaspard Caderousse, unable to appear in public dressed in his former splendor, stopped participating in any social events or displays for himself and his wife. Still, a bitter feeling of jealous unhappiness filled him whenever the sounds of laughter and cheerful music from the joyous revelers reached even the poor inn where he continued to stay, more for shelter than for any income it provided.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Those of my readers who have traveled on foot through southern France might recall seeing a small inn about halfway between Beaucaire and Bellegarde, slightly closer to Beaucaire. A creaking tin sign with a comical painting of the Pont du Gard hangs at the front. This modern inn stands on the left side of the road beside the Rhône River and boasts a \"garden\" by local standards—a patch of ground across from the entrance, with a few scraggly olives and fig trees struggling to survive in the dry heat. Their dusty, withered leaves show the harshness of the environment. Among these sparse trees grow some garlic, tomatoes, and shallots; and standing alone in a corner is a tall pine, its dried and sun-beaten trunk and crown looking forlorn. All these trees are bent in the direction of the Mistral, one of Provence's three plagues alongside the Durance River and the Parliament. Around the inn, the plain resembles a dusty lake dotted with a few miserable wheat stalks, proof of the locals’ curious attempts to grow grain in such arid soil. Each stem is topped by a grasshopper, whose loud, repetitive chirps accompany travelers through this barren landscape.\n\nFor about seven or eight years, this inn has been run by a man and his wife, along with two servants: Trinette, the maid, and Pecaud, the hostler. This small staff is now sufficient, since a new canal between Beaucaire and Aiguemortes has drastically reduced coach traffic, replacing it with boat transport. The canal, which passes between the Rhône and the depleted post road less than a hundred steps from the inn, has led to the innkeeper’s financial ruin.\n\nThe innkeeper, Gaspard Caderousse, is a tall, strong, and lean man aged between forty and fifty-five, a typical example of a southern native, with deep-set, lively dark eyes, a hooked nose, and white carnivore-like teeth. His thick, curly hair and beard, only slightly streaked with gray, and his deeply tanned complexion come from years of standing at his doorway all day, hoping in vain for customers, and shielding his head only with a red handkerchief tied like a Spanish muleteer. \n\nHis wife, formerly Madeleine Radelle, is thin, pale, and sickly. Born near Arles, she once shared the celebrated beauty of local women, but illness common to the marshlands has sapped her health and looks. She spends most of her time upstairs, shivering or lying weakly in bed. Caderousse prefers keeping watch at the door—it not only gives him something to do, but also spares him from listening to his wife’s endless complaints, to which he always replies, \"Hush, La Carconte. It is God’s will.\"\n\nThe nickname \"La Carconte\" was given to her because she was born in the village of Carconte between Salon and Lambesc—a region where everyone is called by a distinctive name, and Caderousse likely found \"Madeleine\" too refined to pronounce.\n\nYet, Caderousse’s apparent acceptance of fate is not without bitterness. He keenly feels the loss of customers and profit due to the canal and his wife’s constant grumbling. Like many southerners, he is moderate and temperate but likes to show off. In better times, he and his wife would attend every local festivity, dressed in the bright, picturesque fashions of the area: he in clothes reminiscent of Catalonia and Andalusia, she in the charming dress of Arles women, with influences from Greece and Arabia. Over time, all their finery was lost—chains, necklaces, embroidered clothes, and silver buckles disappeared. Forced to give up his former ambitions and pleasures, Caderousse now clings to his shabby inn more for shelter than profit, a sense of envy and loss filling him whenever the music of local celebrations drifted to his somber doorstep."

There it lay stretching out into one interminable line of dust and sand, with its sides bordered by tall, meagre trees, altogether presenting so uninviting an appearance, that no one in his senses could have imagined that any traveller, at liberty to regulate his hours for journeying, would choose to expose himself in such a formidable Sahara.\nNevertheless, had Caderousse but retained his post a few minutes longer, he might have caught a dim outline of something approaching from the direction of Bellegarde; as the moving object drew nearer, he would easily have perceived that it consisted of a man and horse, between whom the kindest and most amiable understanding appeared to exist. The horse was of Hungarian breed, and ambled along at an easy pace. His rider was a priest, dressed in black, and wearing a three-cornered hat; and, spite of the ardent rays of a noonday sun, the pair came on with a fair degree of rapidity.\nHaving arrived before the Pont du Gard, the horse stopped, but whether for his own pleasure or that of his rider would have been difficult to say. However that might have been, the priest, dismounting, led his steed by the bridle in search of some place to which he could secure him. Availing himself of a handle that projected from a half-fallen door, he tied the animal safely and having drawn a red cotton handkerchief, from his pocket, wiped away the perspiration that streamed from his brow, then, advancing to the door, struck thrice with the end of his iron-shod stick.\nAt this unusual sound, a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode, snarling and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved how little he was accustomed to society. At that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor, and, with many bows and courteous smiles, the host of the Pont du Gard besought his guest to enter.\n“You are welcome, sir, most welcome!” repeated the astonished Caderousse. “Now, then, Margotin,” cried he, speaking to the dog, “will you be quiet? Pray don’t heed him, sir!—he only barks, he never bites. I make no doubt a glass of good wine would be acceptable this dreadfully hot day.” Then perceiving for the first time the garb of the traveller he had to entertain, Caderousse hastily exclaimed: “A thousand pardons! I really did not observe whom I had the honor to receive under my poor roof. What would the abbé please to have? What refreshment can I offer? All I have is at his service.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "As was his habit, Caderousse stood watching by the door, his gaze shifting lazily between a patch of closely mowed grass where chickens futilely scratched for food and the empty road leading north and south. His wife's sharp call interrupted him, and he grumbled as he headed upstairs to her room, but not before propping the entrance door wide open, hoping to attract any potential passers-by. Just as Caderousse left his customary spot by the door, the road he had been watching was completely deserted, like a desert at noon. It stretched out endlessly in a line of dust and sand, flanked by thin, sparse trees, looking so uninviting that no rational person planning their journey would willingly endure such a formidable 'Sahara'. However, if Caderousse had remained at his post for just a few more minutes, he would have spotted a faint shape approaching from the direction of Bellegarde. As the moving figure came closer, he would have clearly seen it was a man on a horse, and they seemed to share a very good relationship. The horse was a Hungarian breed, moving at a relaxed amble. Its rider was a priest in black clothes and a three-cornered hat; despite the intense heat of the midday sun, the pair advanced at a respectable speed. Upon reaching the Pont du Gard, the horse stopped, whether by its own will or the rider's was unclear. Regardless, the priest dismounted and led his horse by the reins to find a place to secure it. Using a handle sticking out from a partially collapsed door, he tied the animal safely. Then, pulling a red cotton handkerchief from his pocket, he wiped the sweat from his forehead. He then approached the door and struck it three times with the end of his iron-tipped stick. This unusual noise brought a large black dog charging out to confront the bold newcomer to its usually quiet home. It snarled, showing its sharp white teeth with fierce hostility, clearly indicating its unfamiliarity with visitors. At that moment, heavy steps were heard descending the wooden stairs from above. With many bows and polite smiles, the innkeeper of the Pont du Gard urged his guest to come inside. \"You are welcome, sir, truly welcome!\" the surprised Caderousse repeated. \"Now, Margotin,\" he said to the dog, \"be quiet! Please don't mind him, sir! He only barks, he doesn't bite. I'm sure a glass of good wine would be welcome on this terribly hot day.\" Noticing the traveler's attire for the first time, Caderousse quickly added, \"A thousand apologies! I didn't realize whom I had the honor of welcoming under my humble roof. What would the abbé like? What refreshment can I offer? Everything I have is at your service.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As usual, Caderousse sat idly at his usual spot by the door, casually watching some chickens peck unsuccessfully at the short grass and glancing along the empty road that stretched north and south. His wife’s sharp call broke his lethargy, and, grumbling, he headed upstairs to her, making sure to leave the door wide open to possibly attract any traveler passing by. At the moment he left his post, the road outside was completely deserted, stretching like a dusty, sun-baked path flanked by sparse trees—so uninviting that no sane person would choose to travel then. However, had Caderousse stayed a bit longer, he would have noticed a figure approaching from Bellegarde—a man and his horse, appearing completely in harmony with one another. The horse, of Hungarian breed, proceeded at a gentle pace, ridden by a priest in black attire and a three-cornered hat. Despite the heat of midday, they traveled steadily. Upon reaching the Pont du Gard, the horse paused, perhaps at its rider’s wish, perhaps its own. The priest dismounted, secured his horse using a projecting door handle, wiped his sweaty brow with a red cotton handkerchief, and rapped three times on the door with his iron-tipped cane. The noise brought a large black dog barreling out, growling and baring its teeth at the unfamiliar visitor. Just then, heavy footsteps sounded on the stairs and Caderousse appeared, greeting his guest with repeated welcomes and reassurances about the barking dog, who was harmless. Noticing his guest’s clerical garb, Caderousse apologized for not recognizing him sooner, offering refreshments and whatever hospitality his modest home could provide."

You formerly lived, I believe in the Allées de Meilhan, on the fourth floor?”\n“I did.”\n“And you followed the business of a tailor?”\n“True, I was a tailor, till the trade fell off. It is so hot at Marseilles, that really I believe that the respectable inhabitants will in time go without any clothing whatever. But talking of heat, is there nothing I can offer you by way of refreshment?”\n“Yes; let me have a bottle of your best wine, and then, with your permission, we will resume our conversation from where we left off.”\n“As you please, sir,” said Caderousse, who, anxious not to lose the present opportunity of finding a customer for one of the few bottles of Cahors still remaining in his possession, hastily raised a trap-door in the floor of the apartment they were in, which served both as parlor and kitchen.\nUpon issuing forth from his subterranean retreat at the expiration of five minutes, he found the abbé seated upon a wooden stool, leaning his elbow on a table, while Margotin, whose animosity seemed appeased by the unusual command of the traveller for refreshments, had crept up to him, and had established himself very comfortably between his knees, his long, skinny neck resting on his lap, while his dim eye was fixed earnestly on the traveller’s face.\n“Are you quite alone?” inquired the guest, as Caderousse placed before him the bottle of wine and a glass.\n“Quite, quite alone,” replied the man—“or, at least, practically so, for my poor wife, who is the only person in the house besides myself, is laid up with illness, and unable to render me the least assistance, poor thing!”\n“You are married, then?” said the priest, with a show of interest, glancing round as he spoke at the scanty furnishings of the apartment.\n“Ah, sir,” said Caderousse with a sigh, “it is easy to perceive I am not a rich man; but in this world a man does not thrive the better for being honest.” The abbé fixed on him a searching, penetrating glance.\n“Yes, honest—I can certainly say that much for myself,” continued the innkeeper, fairly sustaining the scrutiny of the abbé’s gaze; “I can boast with truth of being an honest man; and,” continued he significantly, with a hand on his breast and shaking his head, “that is more than everyone can say nowadays.”\n“So much the better for you, if what you assert be true,” said the abbé; “for I am firmly persuaded that, sooner or later, the good will be rewarded, and the wicked punished.”\n“Such words as those belong to your profession,” answered Caderousse, “and you do well to repeat them; but,” added he, with a bitter expression of countenance, “one is free to believe them or not, as one pleases.”\n“You are wrong to speak thus,” said the abbé; “and perhaps I may, in my own person, be able to prove to you how completely you are in error.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The priest regarded the man who spoke to him with a long, penetrating stare, even appearing to invite a similar scrutiny from the innkeeper. When he saw only profound surprise on Caderousse's face at the priest's delay in responding to such a polite question, he decided it was time to break the silence. Speaking with a strong Italian accent, he asked, 'I presume you are Mr. Caderousse?' 'Yes, sir,' replied the host, even more astonished by the question than by the silence that preceded it. 'I am Gaspard Caderousse, at your service.' 'Gaspard Caderousse,' the priest echoed. 'Yes, your first and last names are the same. I believe you used to live at Allées de Meilhan, on the fourth floor?' 'I did.' 'And your profession was a tailor?' 'True, I was a tailor, until business declined. It gets so hot in Marseilles, I honestly think respectable residents will eventually go without clothing altogether. But speaking of the heat, can I offer you any refreshment?' 'Yes, please bring me a bottle of your best wine, and then, if you don't mind, we'll continue our conversation from where we left off.' 'As you wish, sir,' said Caderousse. Eager not to miss the chance to sell one of the few remaining bottles of Cahors he possessed, he quickly lifted a trapdoor in the floor of the room, which served as both living area and kitchen. Emerging from his underground storage five minutes later, he found the abbé seated on a wooden stool, leaning his elbow on a table. Margotin, whose hostility seemed appeased by the traveler's unusual request for refreshments, had crept up and settled comfortably between his knees, his long, thin neck resting on his lap, his dull eyes fixed intently on the traveler's face. 'Are you completely alone?' the guest asked as Caderousse placed the bottle of wine and a glass before him. 'Completely, completely alone,' the man replied, 'or at least, essentially so. My poor wife, the only other person in the house, is ill and unable to help me in the slightest, poor thing!' 'So you are married?' the priest said with feigned interest, glancing around at the room's meager furnishings as he spoke. 'Ah, sir,' Caderousse sighed, 'it's easy to see I'm not a rich man. But in this world, being honest doesn't necessarily improve one's fortunes.' The abbé fixed him with a sharp, penetrating gaze. 'Yes, honest - I can certainly say that about myself,' the innkeeper continued, meeting the abbé's scrutiny steadily. 'I can truthfully claim to be an honest man; and,' he added significantly, placing a hand on his chest and shaking his head, 'that's more than everyone can say nowadays.' 'All the better for you if what you claim is true,' said the abbé, 'because I am firmly convinced that, eventually, good deeds will be rewarded, and wicked ones punished.' 'Those sorts of words are part of your profession,' Caderousse answered, 'and it's right that you repeat them. But,' he added with a bitter look, 'one is free to believe them or not, as one prefers.' 'You are wrong to speak like that,' said the abbé, 'and perhaps I may personally be able to demonstrate to you how completely mistaken you are.'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The priest gave the speaker a long, searching look, almost as if inviting the innkeeper to scrutinize him in return. Noting only astonishment in the innkeeper’s face for neglecting such a polite inquiry, he decided to break the silent tension. He asked, with a pronounced Italian accent, “Are you M. Caderousse?”\n\n“Yes, sir,” answered the host, more astonished by the question than by the preceding silence. “I am Gaspard Caderousse, at your service.”\n\nThe priest replied, “Gaspard Caderousse—yes, both first and last name. You used to live in the Allées de Meilhan, on the fourth floor, correct?”\n\n“I did.”\n\n“And you were a tailor by trade?”\n\n“Yes, it’s true, until the work dried up. The heat in Marseilles is so great now, I wonder if people will eventually do without clothes altogether. Speaking of the heat, may I offer you something to drink?”\n\n“Yes, please. Your best wine. Afterwards, if you don’t mind, we can continue our conversation.”\n\n“As you wish, sir,” Caderousse responded, eager to sell a rare bottle of Cahors. He quickly opened a trapdoor in the floor of the room, which served as both his parlor and kitchen.\n\nAfter five minutes below, Caderousse returned to find the priest sitting on a simple wooden stool, leaning his elbow on the table. The dog Margotin, its hostility abated by the prospect of refreshment, had nestled between the priest’s knees, resting its scrawny neck on his lap and watching him intently.\n\n“Are you alone here?” asked the priest as Caderousse served the wine and a glass.\n\n“Yes, entirely alone,” came the reply, “or almost—my wife is sick in bed and can’t assist at all, poor soul.”\n\n“So, you are married?” the priest noted, glancing at the sparsely furnished room.\n\n“Ah, sir,” sighed Caderousse, “it’s clear I’m not wealthy; in life, being honest doesn’t make a man prosper.” The priest fixed him with a piercing look.\n\n“Yes, honest—that I can truly claim,” Caderousse insisted, meeting the priest’s stare, and placing his hand on his chest. “That’s more than some can claim these days.”\n\n“If what you say is true, so much the better for you,” said the priest. “I am convinced the good will eventually be rewarded, and the wicked, punished.”\n\n“That sounds like something a priest would say,” Caderousse replied bitterly. “It’s all well and good to repeat it, but people can believe it or not, as they choose.”\n\n“You shouldn’t say that,” the priest answered, “and perhaps I myself can show you just how wrong you are.”"

Did I know poor dear Edmond? Why, Edmond Dantès and myself were intimate friends!” exclaimed Caderousse, whose countenance flushed darkly as he caught the penetrating gaze of the abbé fixed on him, while the clear, calm eye of the questioner seemed to dilate with feverish scrutiny.\n“You remind me,” said the priest, “that the young man concerning whom I asked you was said to bear the name of Edmond.”\n“Said to bear the name!” repeated Caderousse, becoming excited and eager. “Why, he was so called as truly as I myself bore the appellation of Gaspard Caderousse; but tell me, I pray, what has become of poor Edmond?

Ah,” continued Caderousse, speaking in the highly colored language of the South, “the world grows worse and worse. Why does not God, if he really hates the wicked, as he is said to do, send down brimstone and fire, and consume them altogether?”\n“You speak as though you had loved this young Dantès,” observed the abbé, without taking any notice of his companion’s vehemence.\n“And so I did,” replied Caderousse; “though once, I confess, I envied him his good fortune. But I swear to you, sir, I swear to you, by everything a man holds dear, I have, since then, deeply and sincerely lamented his unhappy fate.”\nThere was a brief silence, during which the fixed, searching eye of the abbé was employed in scrutinizing the agitated features of the innkeeper.\n“You knew the poor lad, then?” continued Caderousse.\n“I was called to see him on his dying bed, that I might administer to him the consolations of religion.”\n“And of what did he die?” asked Caderousse in a choking voice.\n“Of what, think you, do young and strong men die in prison, when they have scarcely numbered their thirtieth year, unless it be of imprisonment?” Caderousse wiped away the large beads of perspiration that gathered on his brow.\n“But the strangest part of the story is,” resumed the abbé, “that Dantès, even in his dying moments, swore by his crucified Redeemer, that he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention.”\n“And so he was,” murmured Caderousse. “How should he have been otherwise? Ah, sir, the poor fellow told you the truth.”\n“And for that reason, he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate, and to clear his memory should any foul spot or stain have fallen on it.”\nAnd here the look of the abbé, becoming more and more fixed, seemed to rest with ill-concealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was rapidly spreading over the countenance of Caderousse.\n“A rich Englishman,” continued the abbé, “who had been his companion in misfortune, but had been released from prison during the second restoration, was possessed of a diamond of immense value; this jewel he bestowed on Dantès upon himself quitting the prison, as a mark of his gratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which Dantès had nursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement. Instead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers, who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor, Dantès carefully preserved it, that in the event of his getting out of prison he might have wherewithal to live, for the sale of such a diamond would have quite sufficed to make his fortune.”\n“Then, I suppose,” asked Caderousse, with eager, glowing looks, “that it was a stone of immense value?”\n“Why, everything is relative,” answered the abbé. “To one in Edmond’s position the diamond certainly was of great value. It was estimated at fifty thousand francs.”\n“Bless me!” exclaimed Caderousse, “fifty thousand francs! Surely the diamond was as large as a nut to be worth all that.”\n“No,” replied the abbé, “it was not of such a size as that; but you shall judge for yourself. I have it with me.”\nThe sharp gaze of Caderousse was instantly directed towards the priest’s garments, as though hoping to discover the location of the treasure. Calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black shagreen, the abbé opened it, and displayed to the dazzled eyes of Caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained, set in a ring of admirable workmanship.\n“And that diamond,” cried Caderousse, almost breathless with eager admiration, “you say, is worth fifty thousand francs?”\n“It is, without the setting, which is also valuable,” replied the abbé, as he closed the box, and returned it to his pocket, while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated innkeeper.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Caderousse appeared surprised and asked, “What are you talking about?” The visitor replied, “Firstly, I need confirmation that you are the person I’m looking for.” Caderousse inquired, “What kind of proof do you need?” The visitor asked, “Did you, around 1814 or 1815, know a young sailor named Dantès?” Caderousse exclaimed, “Dantès? Poor dear Edmond? Why, Edmond Dantès and I were close friends!” His face darkened as he felt the visitor’s sharp gaze upon him, the questioner’s clear, steady eyes seemingly growing wider with intense scrutiny. The priest remarked, “You’re reminding me that the young man I asked about was said to be named Edmond.” Caderousse grew agitated and eager, repeating, “Said to bear the name! Why, that was his name, as surely as I am Gaspard Caderousse; but please, tell me, what became of poor Edmond? Did you know him? Is he alive and free? Is he successful and happy?” The visitor responded, “He died a more miserable, hopeless, heartbroken prisoner than the convicts serving sentences at the Toulon galleys.” A deathly paleness replaced the flush on Caderousse’s face. He turned away, and the priest observed him using the corner of his red headscarf to wipe tears from his eyes. “Poor fellow, poor fellow!” Caderousse mumbled. “Well, there, sir, is more evidence that good people are never rewarded on this earth, and only the wicked thrive. Ah,” Caderousse continued, speaking with the colorful intensity typical of the South, “the world is getting worse and worse. Why doesn’t God, if he truly despises the wicked as people say, send down fire and brimstone and destroy them all?” The abbé, ignoring Caderousse’s passionate outburst, commented, “You speak as if you cared for this young Dantès.” Caderousse replied, “And I did; though I admit, I once envied his good fortune. But I swear to you, sir, by everything a man holds dear, I have, since then, deeply and truly regretted his sad fate.” A brief silence followed as the abbé’s steady, probing gaze examined the innkeeper’s troubled face. “So you knew the poor young man?” Caderousse persisted. “I was called to attend him on his deathbed to provide him with religious comfort,” the visitor stated. “And what did he die of?” Caderousse asked, his voice strained. “What do you imagine young, strong men die of in prison, barely having reached their thirtieth year, if not imprisonment itself?” Caderousse wiped away the large drops of sweat beading on his forehead. “But the most unusual part of the story is,” the abbé resumed, “that even in his final moments, Dantès swore on his crucified Savior that he had no idea why he was imprisoned.” “And that was true,” Caderousse murmured. “How could he have known otherwise? Ah, sir, the poor fellow told you the truth.” “And because of that, he begged me to try and resolve a mystery he could never understand and to clear his reputation if it had been unjustly slandered.” As the abbé said this, his gaze became increasingly fixed, seemingly resting with barely hidden satisfaction on the deepening gloom spreading across Caderousse’s face. “A wealthy Englishman,” the abbé continued, “who had been his fellow prisoner but was released during the second restoration, owned a diamond of immense value; he gave this jewel to Dantès when he left prison as a token of gratitude for Dantès’s kind and brotherly care when the Englishman was severely ill during their confinement. Instead of using this diamond to try and bribe his guards, who might simply have taken it and betrayed him to the governor, Dantès carefully kept it, so that if he ever got out, he would have the means to live, as selling such a diamond would have been enough to make his fortune.” Caderousse, looking eager and excited, asked, “Then I assume it was an extremely valuable stone?” “Well, everything is relative,” the abbé replied. “For someone in Edmond’s situation, the diamond was certainly very valuable. It was estimated at fifty thousand francs.” “Good heavens!” exclaimed Caderousse, “fifty thousand francs! Surely the diamond must have been as big as a nut to be worth that much.” “No,” the abbé answered, “it wasn’t that large; but you can judge for yourself. I have it with me.” Caderousse’s sharp eyes immediately scanned the priest’s clothes, hoping to spot the treasure. Calmly, the abbé took a small box covered in black shagreen from his pocket, opened it, and revealed to Caderousse’s dazzled eyes the sparkling jewel it contained, set in a beautifully crafted ring. “And that diamond,” Caderousse cried, almost breathless with admiration, “you say it’s worth fifty thousand francs?” “That’s without the setting, which is also valuable,” the abbé replied, closing the box and returning it to his pocket, while the diamond’s brilliant light seemed to linger before the spellbound innkeeper’s eyes.",

The abbé calmly took a small box from his pocket, opened it, and showed Caderousse the sparkling jewel set in a beautifully crafted ring.\n\"And that diamond,\" Caderousse said, almost breathless with admiration, \"is worth fifty thousand francs?\"\n\"Yes,\" replied the abbé, \"even without its valuable setting.\" He closed the box and put it away, while Caderousse stared, the image of the dazzling jewel lingering in his eyes."

The name of one of the four friends is Caderousse.’” The innkeeper shivered.\n“‘Another of the number,’” continued the abbé, without seeming to notice the emotion of Caderousse, “‘is called Danglars; and the third, in spite of being my rival, entertained a very sincere affection for me.’”\nA fiendish smile played over the features of Caderousse, who was about to break in upon the abbé’s speech, when the latter, waving his hand, said, “Allow me to finish first, and then if you have any observations to make, you can do so afterwards. ‘The third of my friends, although my rival, was much attached to me,—his name was Fernand; that of my betrothed was’—Stay, stay,” continued the abbé, “I have forgotten what he called her.”\n“Mercédès,” said Caderousse eagerly.\n“True,” said the abbé, with a stifled sigh, “Mercédès it was.”\n“Go on,” urged Caderousse.\n“Bring me a carafe of water,” said the abbé.\nCaderousse quickly performed the stranger’s bidding; and after pouring some into a glass, and slowly swallowing its contents, the abbé, resuming his usual placidity of manner, said, as he placed his empty glass on the table:\n“Where did we leave off?”\n“The name of Edmond’s betrothed was Mercédès.”\n“To be sure. ‘You will go to Marseilles,’ said Dantès,—for you understand, I repeat his words just as he uttered them.

          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Curious, Caderousse inquired how the abbé came to possess the diamond and if Edmond had made him his heir. The abbé clarified he was merely the executor of Edmond's will. He quoted Edmond, who said he had 'four dear and faithful friends, in addition to the young woman he was engaged to,' believing they had all genuinely grieved his absence. Edmond named 'Caderousse' as one of these friends, causing the innkeeper to tremble. The abbé continued, seemingly ignoring Caderousse's reaction, stating that 'Another of this group is named Danglars,' and 'the third, despite being my rival, held a very sincere affection for me.' Caderousse's face twisted into a malicious smile, and he was about to interrupt when the abbé gestured for him to wait. 'Allow me to finish first,' the abbé said, 'and then you may comment. The third friend, despite competing with me, was deeply fond of me—his name was Fernand; and my betrothed was called'—Here the abbé paused, admitting he had forgotten her name. Caderousse quickly supplied, 'Mercédès.' 'Indeed,' the abbé confirmed with a barely audible sigh, 'it was Mercédès.' 'Please continue,' urged Caderousse. 'Fetch me a carafe of water,' requested the abbé. Caderousse promptly obeyed, and after pouring some water into a glass and deliberately drinking it, the abbé, recovering his composed demeanor, set the empty glass down and asked, 'Where were we?' 'The name of Edmond’s fiancée was Mercédès,' Caderousse reminded him. 'Ah, yes. 'You are to go to Marseilles,' Dantès instructed,' the abbé said, stressing that he was repeating Edmond's exact words. He checked if Caderousse understood, which the latter confirmed. ''You are to sell this diamond; you will divide the money into five equal shares, and distribute a share to each of these good friends, the only people on earth who loved me.'' 'But why five shares?' Caderousse questioned, 'You only mentioned four individuals.' 'Because the fifth person is deceased, or so I understand,' the abbé replied. 'The fifth beneficiary of Edmond's legacy was his own father.'",

The very dogs that wander houseless and homeless in the streets find some pitying hand to cast them a mouthful of bread; and that a man, a Christian, should be allowed to perish of hunger in the midst of other men who call themselves Christians, is too horrible for belief.

Better study a little common prudence. How do you know the motives that person may have for trying to extract all he can from you?”\n“I pledge you my word, madam,” said the abbé, “that my intentions are good; and that your husband can incur no risk, provided he answers me candidly.”\n“Ah, that’s all very fine,” retorted the woman. “Nothing is easier than to begin with fair promises and assurances of nothing to fear; but when poor, silly folks, like my husband there, have been persuaded to tell all they know, the promises and assurances of safety are quickly forgotten; and at some moment when nobody is expecting it, behold trouble and misery, and all sorts of persecutions, are heaped on the unfortunate wretches, who cannot even see whence all their afflictions come.”\n“Nay, nay, my good woman, make yourself perfectly easy, I beg of you. Whatever evils may befall you, they will not be occasioned by my instrumentality, that I solemnly promise you.”\nLa Carconte muttered a few inarticulate words, then let her head again drop upon her knees, and went into a fit of ague, leaving the two speakers to resume the conversation, but remaining so as to be able to hear every word they uttered.

          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“It is true, absolutely true!” Caderousse exclaimed, struggling with the rush of intense feelings that overwhelmed him. “The poor old man did indeed die.” The abbé responded, making a conscious effort to sound detached, “I learned as much when I was in Marseilles. However, given the significant time that has passed since the death of the elder Dantès, I couldn't get any details about how he met his end. Can you shed some light on that for me?” “I can't imagine who else could, if not me,” Caderousse said. “Why, I lived practically next door to the poor old man. Oh, yes, he died about a year after his son disappeared.” “What was the cause of his death?” “Well, the doctors diagnosed it as gastro-enteritis, I believe; his acquaintances say grief was the cause; but I, having witnessed his last moments, I maintain he died of——” Caderousse stopped speaking. “Died of what?” the priest pressed, both anxious and eager. “Why, of simple, outright starvation.” “Starvation!” the abbé cried out, leaping from his chair. “Even the most despised creatures aren't allowed to perish in such a way! The stray dogs roaming the streets, without homes or masters, find someone kind enough to toss them a piece of bread. And yet, a man, a Christian man, was permitted to starve to death amidst others who call themselves Christians? It’s too awful to contemplate! It’s impossible! Utterly impossible!” “What I said is what happened,” Caderousse replied. “And you're a fool for saying anything at all about it,” a voice called down from the top of the stairs. “Why are you involving yourself in matters that don’t concern you?” Both men turned quickly to see La Carconte’s pale face peering through the stair railings. Drawn by the sound of their voices, she had managed to weakly descend the stairs and was now seated on the bottom step, head resting on her knees, having listened to their conversation. “Mind your own business, wife,” Caderousse snapped back. “This gentleman is asking me for information, and common courtesy dictates that I shouldn't refuse.” “Courtesy, you simpleton!” La Carconte retorted. “What connection do you have with courtesy, I'd like to know? You’d be better off practicing a little common sense. How can you be sure of this person's intentions for trying to get every bit of information out of you?” “I assure you, madam,” the abbé said, “that my motives are honourable, and your husband faces no danger whatsoever, provided he answers truthfully.” “Oh, that sounds very nice,” the woman countered. “It's easy enough to start with pleasant promises and claims that there's nothing to fear. But once poor, foolish people like my husband here are convinced to reveal everything they know, those promises and assurances of safety are quickly forgotten. And then, when no one expects it, trouble, misery, and all sorts of hardship are piled upon the unfortunate souls, who can't even tell where all their suffering is coming from.” “No, no, my good woman, please set your mind completely at ease, I beg you. Whatever misfortunes may happen to you, I solemnly promise you they will not be the result of my actions.” La Carconte mumbled a few indistinct words, then dropped her head back onto her knees and began shivering with an attack of ague. She left the two men to continue their discussion, but remained where she could hear every word they spoke. The abbé was once again forced to drink some water to calm the powerful emotions that threatened to overwhelm him.",

A year after his son's disappearance, he passed away.\" \n\"What did he die of?\" \n\"Well, the doctors called it gastro-enteritis, if I recall; his friends said grief killed him.

Even stray dogs find someone to toss them food; that a man—a Christian among Christians—should waste away from hunger is unimaginable! I can't believe it—surely not!\" \n\"I've said what I have to say,\" retorted Caderousse. \n\"And you were foolish to say it,\" interrupted a voice from above. La Carconte's pale face appeared through the railing; she'd come down, drawn by the voices, and sat, head on knees, listening. \n\"Stay out of it, wife,\" Caderousse snapped. \"This gentleman asked for information—common courtesy means I must answer.\" \n\"Courtesy, you fool!\" La Carconte sniped. \"Why bother with that? You should think about keeping your mouth shut. Who knows what reasons this stranger has for prying into your business?\" \n\"I assure you, madam,\" said the abbé, \"my intentions are good, and your husband is perfectly safe as long as he is honest with me.\" \n\"It's easy to make promises like that,\" the woman shot back. \"But once simple folk have told all they know, such promises are fast forgotten—and before you know it, trouble falls on them without warning, from sources they can't even identify.\" \n\"Rest easy, madam,\" the abbé said gently. \"Whatever misfortune may befall you, it won't come from me—that I swear.\" \nLa Carconte muttered under her breath, then let her head fall forward and began trembling, but remained close enough to catch every word as the abbé, now struggling to master his surge of emotion, took another drink of water to compose himself."

And, regardless of what others might think,” Caderousse continued in his local dialect, which possessed a certain rough charm, “I confess I fear the curse of the dead more than the hostility of the living.”\n\n“Idiot!” exclaimed La Carconte.\n\n“Then, do you know how Fernand wronged Dantès?” the abbé asked Caderousse.\n\n“Do I? Better than anyone.”\n\n“Tell me then, what happened!”\n\n“Gaspard!” cried La Carconte, “do as you please; you are the master—but take my advice and keep quiet.”\n\n“All right, wife,” Caderousse replied, “perhaps you're right!”\n\n“So you won't say anything?” the abbé asked.\n\n“What would be the point?” Caderousse questioned. “If the poor fellow were alive and came to me asking for a candid assessment of his true and false friends, well, perhaps I wouldn't hesitate. But you say he's gone, and therefore has nothing to do with hatred or vengeance, so let all such feelings be buried with him.”\n\n“You would prefer, then,” the abbé said, “that I give the reward intended for true friendship to men you describe as false and deceitful?”\n\n“That's accurate,” Caderousse admitted. “You're right, poor Edmond's gift wasn't meant for traitors like Fernand and Danglars; besides, what would it mean to them? No more than a drop in the ocean.”\n\n“Remember,” La Carconte chimed in, “those two could crush you instantly!”\n\n“How so?” the abbé inquired. “Are these individuals truly so wealthy and powerful?”\n\n“You don't know their history?”\n\n“I do not. Please tell me about it!”\n\nCaderousse appeared to ponder for a few moments, then stated, “No, honestly, it would take too much time.”\n\n“Very well, my friend,” the abbé responded, in a tone suggesting complete lack of interest, “you are free to speak or remain silent, as you wish; for my part, I respect your reservations and admire your feelings; so let the matter end there. I shall perform my duty as conscientiously as I can and fulfill my promise to the dying man. My first task will be to handle this diamond.”\n\nSaying this, the abbé once again produced the small box from his pocket, opened it, and positioned it so that its brilliant, multicoloured flash shone before Caderousse's stunned eyes.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "After composing himself, he remarked, \"So the unfortunate old man you mentioned died abandoned by all—otherwise, surely, he wouldn't have met such a terrible end.\" Caderousse replied, \"Actually, not entirely abandoned; Mercédès the Catalan and Monsieur Morrel were kind to him, but the poor man deeply hated Fernand—the same Fernand you just described as one of Dantès’ loyal friends,\" he added with a sardonic grin. \n\n\"And wasn’t he indeed a true friend?\" the abbé questioned.\n\nFrom the stairway, the woman softly warned, \"Gaspard, careful what you say!\" Caderousse, annoyed but undeterred, turned to the abbé. \"How can someone be loyal to a man whose wife he wants for himself? But Dantès was so honest and upright that he trusted everyone’s declarations of friendship. Poor Edmond was badly misled; thankfully, he never discovered the truth, or forgiving his enemies might have been even harder on his deathbed. For myself,\" Caderousse continued, lapsing into his rustic dialect tinged with rough poetry, \"I’m more unnerved by the curse of the dead than by the hatred of the living.\"\n\n\"Idiot!\" La Carconte exclaimed.\n\n\"Do you know exactly what Fernand did to harm Dantès?\" the abbé asked Caderousse.\n\n\"Who would know better than me?\" he replied.\n\n\"Then speak up—tell me!\"\n\nLa Carconte urged, \"Gaspard! Do as you wish—you’re the master here—but my advice is to keep silent.\"\n\nCaderousse hesitated. \"Maybe you’re right, wife.\"\n\n\"So you won’t tell me anything?\" the abbé asked.\n\n\"What would be the point?\" said Caderousse. \"If poor Edmond were still alive and came to me asking who his real friends were, maybe I'd speak out. But you say he’s dead—he can’t seek revenge or hold any more resentment, so best to let all that be buried with him.\"\n\n\"Would you have me then, give the reward meant for loyal friendship to the very people you say are traitors and deceivers?\" the abbé pressed.\n\n\"That’s true,\" Caderousse admitted. \"Edmond's generosity wasn’t intended for men like Fernand or Danglars. What would such a gift matter to them anyway? It would be meaningless—a mere drop in the ocean.\"\n\nLa Carconte added, \"Those two could destroy you in an instant!\"\n\n\"How's that?\" asked the abbé. \"Are they so wealthy and influential?\"\n\n\"Don’t you know their stories?\"\n\n\"No, please, tell me,\" the abbé requested.\n\nCaderousse thought for a moment, then answered, \"No, it would take too long.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" replied the abbé with apparent indifference. \"You are free to speak or not, as you wish; I respect your scruples and admire your principles. That settles it. I’ll carry out my duty and honor my promise to the dying man. First, I need to take care of this diamond.\"\n\nWith that, the abbé took a small box from his pocket, opened it, and turned it so the dazzling light from the gem shone before Caderousse’s eyes."

The jewel is worth at least fifty thousand francs.”\n“Oh, what a magnificent jewel!” cried the astonished woman.\n“The fifth part of the profits from this stone belongs to us then, does it not?” asked Caderousse.\n“It does,” replied the abbé; “with the addition of an equal division of that part intended for the elder Dantès, which I believe myself at liberty to divide equally with the four survivors.”\n“And why among us four?” inquired Caderousse.\n“As being the friends Edmond esteemed most faithful and devoted to him.”\n“I don’t call those friends who betray and ruin you,” murmured the wife in her turn, in a low, muttering voice.\n“Of course not!” rejoined Caderousse quickly; “no more do I, and that was what I was observing to this gentleman just now. I said I looked upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery, perhaps crime.”\n“Remember,” answered the abbé calmly, as he replaced the jewel and its case in the pocket of his cassock, “it is your fault, not mine, that I do so. You will have the goodness to furnish me with the address of both Fernand and Danglars, in order that I may execute Edmond’s last wishes.”\nThe agitation of Caderousse became extreme, and large drops of perspiration rolled from his heated brow. As he saw the abbé rise from his seat and go towards the door, as though to ascertain if his horse were sufficiently refreshed to continue his journey, Caderousse and his wife exchanged looks of deep meaning.\n“There, you see, wife,” said the former, “this splendid diamond might all be ours, if we chose!”\n“Do you believe it?”\n“Why, surely a man of his holy profession would not deceive us!”\n“Well,” replied La Carconte, “do as you like. For my part, I wash my hands of the affair.”\nSo saying, she once more climbed the staircase leading to her chamber, her body convulsed with chills, and her teeth rattling in her head, in spite of the intense heat of the weather. Arrived at the top stair, she turned round, and called out, in a warning tone, to her husband, “Gaspard, consider well what you are about to do!”\n“I have both reflected and decided,” answered he.\nLa Carconte then entered her chamber, the flooring of which creaked beneath her heavy, uncertain tread, as she proceeded towards her armchair, into which she fell as though exhausted.\n“Well,” asked the abbé, as he returned to the apartment below, “what have you made up your mind to do?”\n“To tell you all I know,” was the reply.\n“I certainly think you act wisely in so doing,” said the priest. “Not because I have the least desire to learn anything you may please to conceal from me, but simply that if, through your assistance, I could distribute the legacy according to the wishes of the testator, why, so much the better, that is all.”\n“I hope it may be so,” replied Caderousse, his face flushed with cupidity.\n“I am all attention,” said the abbé.\n“Stop a minute,” answered Caderousse; “we might be interrupted in the most interesting part of my story, which would be a pity; and it is as well that your visit hither should be made known only to ourselves.”\nWith these words he went stealthily to the door, which he closed, and, by way of still greater precaution, bolted and barred it, as he was accustomed to do at night.\nDuring this time the abbé had chosen his place for listening at his ease. He removed his seat into a corner of the room, where he himself would be in deep shadow, while the light would be fully thrown on the narrator; then, with head bent down and hands clasped, or rather clenched together, he prepared to give his whole attention to Caderousse, who seated himself on the little stool, exactly opposite to him.\n“Remember, this is no affair of mine,” said the trembling voice of La Carconte, as though through the flooring of her chamber she viewed the scene that was enacting below.\n“Enough, enough!” replied Caderousse; “say no more about it; I will take all the consequences upon myself.”\nAnd he began his story.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Caderousse called out in a rough voice, \"Wife, wife! Come here!\" \"A diamond!\" La Carconte exclaimed, getting up and coming down to the room with a steady walk. \"What diamond are you talking about?\" \"Didn't you hear everything we said?\" Caderousse asked. \"It's a beautiful diamond left by the unfortunate Edmond Dantès. It's to be sold, and the money is to be shared among his father, Mercédès, his fiancée, Fernand, Danglars, and me. The jewel is worth at least fifty thousand francs.\" \"Oh, what a magnificent gem!\" cried the astonished woman. \"So we get a fifth of the money from this stone, right?\" Caderousse asked. \"You do,\" replied the abbé, \"plus an equal share of the portion intended for the elder Dantès, which I believe I am free to divide equally among the four of you who are still living.\" \"And why just us four?\" Caderousse inquired. \"Because you were the friends Edmond considered most faithful and devoted to him.\" \"People who betray and ruin you aren't friends,\" the wife muttered in a low voice in response. \"Exactly!\" Caderousse quickly agreed. \"Neither do I, and that's precisely what I was telling this gentleman just now. I said I thought it was a sacrilegious act, a profanation, to reward treachery, which might even be criminal.\" \"Remember,\" the abbé answered calmly, as he put the jewel and its case back into his cassock pocket, \"it is your fault, not mine, that I am doing this. Please be kind enough to give me the addresses of both Fernand and Danglars, so I can carry out Edmond's final wishes.\" Caderousse became extremely agitated, and heavy drops of sweat rolled down his hot forehead. As he saw the abbé stand up and move towards the door, as if to check if his horse was rested enough to continue his journey, Caderousse and his wife exchanged deeply meaningful looks. \"There, you see, wife,\" Caderousse said, \"this splendid diamond could all belong to us, if we wanted!\" \"Do you believe that?\" \"Well, surely a man of his holy calling wouldn't lie to us!\" \"Fine,\" replied La Carconte, \"do as you please. For my part, I want nothing to do with it.\" Saying this, she climbed the stairs back up to her room, her body shaking with chills, and her teeth chattering, despite the intense heat. Reaching the top step, she turned around and called out to her husband in a cautionary voice, \"Gaspard, think carefully about what you are about to do!\" \"I have both thought it over and decided,\" he answered. La Carconte then entered her room, the floorboards creaking under her heavy, uncertain steps as she moved towards her armchair, into which she collapsed as if exhausted. \"Well,\" the abbé asked, returning to the room below, \"what have you decided to do?\" \"To tell you everything I know,\" was the reply. \"I certainly think you are acting wisely by doing so,\" said the priest. \"Not because I have the slightest desire to learn anything you might wish to hide from me, but simply because if, with your help, I can distribute the legacy according to the wishes of the person who made the will, then that is much better, that is all.\" \"I hope that is the case,\" replied Caderousse, his face red with greed. \"I am ready to listen,\" said the abbé. \"Wait a minute,\" answered Caderousse. \"We might be interrupted at the most interesting part of my story, which would be a pity; and it is best that your visit here is known only to us.\" With these words, he went quietly to the door, which he closed, and, for even greater precaution, bolted and barred it, just as he usually did at night. Meanwhile, the abbé had chosen a place where he could listen comfortably. He moved his seat into a corner of the room, where he himself would be in deep shadow, while the light would fall fully on the narrator; then, with his head bowed and hands clasped tightly, he prepared to give his full attention to Caderousse, who seated himself on the small stool directly opposite him. \"Remember, this is not my affair,\" said La Carconte's trembling voice, as though she could see the scene unfolding below through the floor of her room. \"Enough, enough!\" replied Caderousse. \"Say no more about it; I will take all the consequences upon myself.\" And he began his story.",

The diamond is worth at least fifty thousand francs.\"\n\n\"What an amazing gemstone!\" cried La Carconte, surprised.\n\n\"So, a fifth of what we get is ours, right?\" asked Caderousse.\n\n\"Yes,\" the abbé replied, \"plus an equal share of what was meant for old Dantès, which I'm allowed to split among the four survivors.\"\n\n\"Why just us four?\" Caderousse questioned.\n\n\"Because Edmond considered you his most loyal and devoted friends.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't call those friends if they betray and ruin you,\" muttered Caderousse's wife under her breath.\n\n\"Nor would I!\" Caderousse agreed quickly. \"That's exactly what I said to this gentleman a moment ago. I said I find it disgraceful to reward betrayal or even crime.\"\n\n\"Just remember,\" the abbé answered calmly, as he put the jewel away in his cassock, \"I'm only doing this because of you, not me. Please give me the addresses of Fernand and Danglars so I can carry out Edmond's final wishes.\"\n\nCaderousse became nervous, sweat gathering on his brow. As the abbé got up and moved towards the door, apparently to check if his horse was rested enough to leave, Caderousse and his wife exchanged meaningful glances.\n\n\"There you see, wife,\" Caderousse said, \"we could have this marvelous diamond all to ourselves if we chose.\"\n\n\"Do you believe that?\"\n\n\"Surely a man of his calling wouldn't deceive us!\"\n\n\"Well, do as you like. I'm washing my hands of it,\" La Carconte replied.\n\nWith that, she went upstairs again, shivering despite the summer heat and her teeth chattering uncontrollably. At the top of the stairs, she turned and warned her husband, \"Gaspard, think carefully about what you're doing!\"\n\n\"I've thought it over and made my decision,\" he replied.\n\nLa Carconte then entered her room, the floor creaking under her unsteady movements as she slumped into her armchair, exhausted.\n\nBack downstairs, the abbé asked, \"Well, what have you decided?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you everything I know,\" came the answer.\n\n\"That's wise,\" said the priest. \"Not because I'm trying to learn anything you're hiding, but if your help lets me carry out Edmond's last wishes, so much the better.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" Caderousse replied, his face flush with greed.\n\n\"I'm listening,\" said the abbé.\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" said Caderousse, \"we might be interrupted right at the important part. It's best your visit remains between us.\"\n\nHe went quietly to the door, closed and locked it as he would at night, for even more privacy.\n\nMeanwhile, the abbé made himself comfortable in a dark corner of the room, where he could listen at ease while Caderousse sat directly opposite, well lit.\n\n\"Remember, I'm not part of this,\" chimed in La Carconte's trembling voice from her room upstairs, as though she could see the scene below.\n\n\"That's enough!\" replied Caderousse. \"I'll take full responsibility.\"\n\nThen, he began his story."

Oh, yes; I can see it all before me this moment.”\n“Was it not his betrothal feast?”\n“It was and the feast that began so gayly had a very sorrowful ending; a police commissary, followed by four soldiers, entered, and Dantès was arrested.”\n“Yes, and up to this point I know all,” said the priest. “Dantès himself only knew that which personally concerned him, for he never beheld again the five persons I have named to you, or heard mention of anyone of them.”\n“Well, when Dantès was arrested, Monsieur Morrel hastened to obtain the particulars, and they were very sad. The old man returned alone to his home, folded up his wedding suit with tears in his eyes, and paced up and down his chamber the whole day, and would not go to bed at all, for I was underneath him and heard him walking the whole night; and for myself, I assure you I could not sleep either, for the grief of the poor father gave me great uneasiness, and every step he took went to my heart as really as if his foot had pressed against my breast.\n“The next day Mercédès came to implore the protection of M. de Villefort; she did not obtain it, however, and went to visit the old man; when she saw him so miserable and heart-broken, having passed a sleepless night, and not touched food since the previous day, she wished him to go with her that she might take care of him; but the old man would not consent. ‘No,’ was the old man’s reply, ‘I will not leave this house, for my poor dear boy loves me better than anything in the world; and if he gets out of prison he will come and see me the first thing, and what would he think if I did not wait here for him?’ I heard all this from the window, for I was anxious that Mercédès should persuade the old man to accompany her, for his footsteps over my head night and day did not leave me a moment’s repose.”\n“But did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old man?” asked the abbé.\n“Ah, sir,” replied Caderousse, “we cannot console those who will not be consoled, and he was one of these; besides, I know not why, but he seemed to dislike seeing me. One night, however, I heard his sobs, and I could not resist my desire to go up to him, but when I reached his door he was no longer weeping but praying. I cannot now repeat to you, sir, all the eloquent words and imploring language he made use of; it was more than piety, it was more than grief, and I, who am no canter, and hate the Jesuits, said then to myself, ‘It is really well, and I am very glad that I have not any children; for if I were a father and felt such excessive grief as the old man does, and did not find in my memory or heart all he is now saying, I should throw myself into the sea at once, for I could not bear it.’”\n“Poor father!” murmured the priest.\n“From day to day he lived on alone, and more and more solitary. M. Morrel and Mercédès came to see him, but his door was closed; and, although I was certain he was at home, he would not make any answer. One day, when, contrary to his custom, he had admitted Mercédès, and the poor girl, in spite of her own grief and despair, endeavored to console him, he said to her,—‘Be assured, my dear daughter, he is dead; and instead of expecting him, it is he who is awaiting us; I am quite happy, for I am the oldest, and of course shall see him first.’\n“However well disposed a person may be, why, you see we leave off after a time seeing persons who are in sorrow, they make one melancholy; and so at last old Dantès was left all to himself, and I only saw from time to time strangers go up to him and come down again with some bundle they tried to hide; but I guessed what these bundles were, and that he sold by degrees what he had to pay for his subsistence. At length the poor old fellow reached the end of all he had; he owed three quarters’ rent, and they threatened to turn him out; he begged for another week, which was granted to him. I know this, because the landlord came into my apartment when he left his.\n“For the first three days I heard him walking about as usual, but, on the fourth I heard nothing. I then resolved to go up to him at all risks. The door was closed, but I looked through the keyhole, and saw him so pale and haggard, that believing him very ill, I went and told M. Morrel and then ran on to Mercédès. They both came immediately, M. Morrel bringing a doctor, and the doctor said it was inflammation of the bowels, and ordered him a limited diet. I was there, too, and I never shall forget the old man’s smile at this prescription.\n“From that time he received all who came; he had an excuse for not eating any more; the doctor had put him on a diet.”\nThe abbé uttered a kind of groan.\n“The story interests you, does it not, sir?” inquired Caderousse.\n“Yes,” replied the abbé, “it is very affecting.”\n“Mercédès came again, and she found him so altered that she was even more anxious than before to have him taken to her own home. This was M. Morrel’s wish also, who would fain have conveyed the old man against his consent; but the old man resisted, and cried so that they were actually frightened. Mercédès remained, therefore, by his bedside, and M. Morrel went away, making a sign to the Catalan that he had left his purse on the chimney-piece; but, availing himself of the doctor’s order, the old man would not take any sustenance; at length (after nine days of despair and fasting), the old man died, cursing those who had caused his misery, and saying to Mercédès, ‘If you ever see my Edmond again, tell him I die blessing him.’”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Under these circumstances, Caderousse felt he should reveal the truth about the friendship poor Edmond believed was so genuine. The abbé asked him to start with Edmond's father, as Edmond had spoken often of his deep love for the old man. Caderousse described the history as sad, asking if the abbé knew the beginning. The abbé confirmed he knew everything up to Edmond's arrest near Marseilles, at a small tavern. Caderousse vividly recalled the location, La Réserve, and the moment. The abbé asked if it was Edmond's engagement party. Caderousse confirmed it was, adding that the celebration, which started joyfully, ended tragically when a police commissary and four soldiers arrived and arrested Dantès. The priest stated he was aware up to this point, explaining that Dantès himself only knew what happened to him personally, never seeing or hearing about the five individuals mentioned again. Caderousse recounted that after Dantès' arrest, Monsieur Morrel quickly learned the distressing details. The heartbroken old man returned home alone, tearfully folded his wedding suit, and paced his room all day and night. Caderousse, living downstairs, heard him and couldn't sleep due to the father's distress, feeling every step like a weight on his chest. The next day, Mercédès unsuccessfully sought help from M. de Villefort before visiting the old man. Seeing his misery and sleepless, unfed state, she urged him to come live with her for care. He refused, insisting he must stay home because Edmond loved him most and would return there first upon release. Caderousse, listening from his window, wished Mercédès had persuaded him, as the constant pacing upstairs denied him rest. The abbé asked if Caderousse had tried to comfort the old man. Caderousse replied that some grief is inconsolable, and the father was like that; moreover, he seemed to dislike Caderousse's presence. One night, hearing sobs, Caderousse went upstairs but found the father praying passionately instead of weeping. Caderousse couldn't recall the exact words but described them as profoundly pious and grief-filled, far beyond mere lamentation. He, a cynical man who disliked Jesuits and pious cant, privately reflected that he was glad he had no children, for if he experienced such intense grief and couldn't find such eloquent words or faith, he would immediately end his life. The priest murmured, 'Poor father!' Caderousse continued that the father lived increasingly alone. M. Morrel and Mercédès visited, but the door remained closed, and though clearly home, he wouldn't answer. On one occasion, he allowed Mercédès in, and despite her own sadness, she tried to console him. He told her he was certain Edmond was dead, waiting for them, and he was content knowing he, being older, would see him first. Caderousse commented that people eventually stop visiting those in constant sorrow because it's too depressing. So, old Dantès was left entirely alone, and Caderousse only occasionally saw strangers leaving his apartment with hidden bundles, guessing the father was gradually selling his possessions to survive. Eventually, he ran out of everything, owed three quarters' rent, and faced eviction. He begged for an extra week, which was granted (Caderousse knew this from the landlord). For three days, Caderousse heard the usual pacing. On the fourth, there was silence. He decided to check, looked through the keyhole, and saw the father looking extremely pale and weak. Believing him seriously ill, he immediately notified M. Morrel and Mercédès. They arrived promptly, M. Morrel with a doctor, who diagnosed inflammation and prescribed a limited diet. Caderousse was there and would never forget the old man's smile upon hearing the prescription. From then on, the father received visitors, having an excuse for not eating due to the doctor's orders. The abbé groaned. Caderousse asked if the story interested him, and the abbé replied yes, finding it very affecting. Mercédès returned, finding the father so changed that she was even more determined to take him home, a wish M. Morrel shared, even considering moving the old man against his will. But the father resisted and cried so desperately that they were frightened. Mercédès stayed by his bedside. M. Morrel left, signaling to Mercédès that he'd left his purse. The old man, however, continued to refuse sustenance, citing the doctor's diet. Finally, after nine days of despair and fasting, the old man died, cursing those who had caused his suffering and telling Mercédès to convey his blessing to Edmond if she ever saw him again.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"In that case,\" said Caderousse, \"I feel it is my duty to explain to you that the friendship Edmond thought he could depend on was not as genuine as he believed.\" \n\n\"Please tell me about his father first,\" the abbé requested. \"Edmond spoke of him with such affection.\"\n\n\"It is a sad tale,\" Caderousse replied with a somber shake of his head. \"Are you familiar with the events leading up to Edmond's arrest?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the abbé. \"Edmond recounted everything up until he was taken into custody at a tavern near Marseilles.\"\n\n\"La Réserve, yes—I recall it clearly.\"\n\n\"It was his engagement celebration, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"It was—and what began as a joyful gathering ended in sorrow. The police arrived, accompanied by soldiers, and arrested Dantès.\"\n\n\"I know all of this,\" the priest said. \"After that night, Dantès never saw or heard from those close to him again.\"\n\n\"Once Dantès was taken, Monsieur Morrel tried to find out what had happened, and it was a distressing story. The elder Dantès returned home alone, tearfully putting away his son's wedding clothes. He spent the night pacing, unable to sleep—and I too couldn't rest, his anguish affected me deeply, as if each step he took was a pain in my own chest.\n\n\"The following day, Mercédès went to beg M. de Villefort for help, but without success. She then went to see Edmond's father and tried to persuade him to leave with her so she could care for him, but he refused. He told her, 'No—I cannot leave my home. Edmond loves me more than anything. If he gets out of prison, this is where he'll come first, and what would he think if I wasn't here?' I overheard this from my window, hoping she could convince him, as his constant pacing kept me awake, too.\n\n\"Did you try to comfort him?\" asked the abbé.\n\n\"Sir, it's not possible to console someone who refuses comfort, and he was one of those people. Strangely enough, he avoided seeing me. One night I did hear him weeping and went up, but found him praying instead of sobbing. I can't repeat his prayers, but they were so passionate—more than mere sorrow or devotion. It made me glad I didn’t have children, for if I felt such agony and didn’t have his faith or words to express it, I might have drowned myself.\n\n\"Poor father,\" the priest murmured.\n\n\"He became more isolated over time. While Morrel and Mercédès would visit, he wouldn’t answer the door. Occasionally, when he let Mercédès in—and even as distraught as she was, she tried to comfort him—he told her, 'Believe me, my dear, Edmond is dead. Rather than waiting for him, we should think of how he waits for us; and as I am old, I will go to him first.'\n\n\"Even the kindest visitors grow distant from grief in time, and so he was left alone. I would see only strangers coming and going from his room, often carrying concealed bundles—which I realized were his last belongings, being sold bit by bit so he could survive. Eventually, he had nothing left. Owing three months' rent, he was almost evicted, but got a one-week reprieve. I know this because the landlord discussed it with me after leaving his place.\n\n\"For three days after, I heard him pacing as usual, but then—silence. I decided to check on him, and saw through the keyhole that he looked deathly ill. I immediately told Morrel, then rushed to Mercédès. Both arrived with a doctor, who diagnosed inflammation of the bowels and prescribed a very restricted diet. The old man gave a faint smile at this, glad to have an excuse to refuse food.\n\n\"From then on, he didn't turn anyone away; the doctor's orders gave him a reason to eat nothing.\"\n\nThe abbé groaned softly.\n\n\"Does this story move you, sir?\" Caderousse asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the abbé, \"it is very touching.\"\n\n\"Mercédès visited again, finding him even weaker, and grew desperate to look after him in her home. Morrel agreed and tried to persuade him, but the old man resisted so vehemently they were frightened. Mercédès stayed at his bedside, while Morrel left, signaling to her that he’d left his purse for the old man. Still, the father refused to eat, using the doctor’s orders as an excuse. Nine days passed in sorrow and starvation before the poor man died, cursing those responsible for his misfortune, but telling Mercédès, 'If you ever see my Edmond again, let him know I blessed him as I died.'\""

It was cowardly, I confess, but it was not criminal.”\n“I understand—you allowed matters to take their course, that was all.”\n“Yes, sir,” answered Caderousse; “and remorse preys on me night and day. I often ask pardon of God, I swear to you, because this action, the only one with which I have seriously to reproach myself in all my life, is no doubt the cause of my abject condition. I am expiating a moment of selfishness, and so I always say to La Carconte, when she complains, ‘Hold your tongue, woman; it is the will of God.’” And Caderousse bowed his head with every sign of real repentance.",

Caderousse, astonished, asked, “I was there? Who informed you of that?” Realizing he had revealed too much, the abbé quickly added, “No one told me; but to know such details so precisely, you must have witnessed it personally.” “That’s true, it’s true!” Caderousse admitted, his voice thick with emotion, “I was indeed there.” “And you didn’t object to such a vile act?” the abbé pressed; “if not, you were complicit.” “Sir,” Caderousse responded, “they had given me so much to drink that my senses were barely functioning. I had only a vague awareness of what was happening around me. I said what little a man in that condition could say; but they both assured me it was merely a prank they were playing, completely innocent.” “The next day—the next day, sir, you surely understood clearly what they had done, yet you remained silent, even though you were present when Dantès was taken into custody.” “Yes, sir, I was there, and I was desperate to speak; but Danglars stopped me. He said, ‘If he truly is guilty, and actually landed on the Isle of Elba; if he really is carrying a letter for the Bonapartist committee in Paris, and they discover this letter on him, those who supported him will be seen as his accomplices.’ I admit, I was afraid, given the political climate at the time, and I kept quiet. It was cowardly, I confess, but not criminal.” “I see—you simply allowed events to unfold, nothing more.” “Yes, sir,” Caderousse confirmed; “and remorse torments me constantly. I swear to you, I frequently beg God for forgiveness, because this deed, the single act I truly regret in my entire life, is undoubtedly the cause of my wretched state. I am paying for a moment of self-interest, and that is what I always tell La Carconte when she complains, ‘Be quiet, woman; it is God’s will.’” And Caderousse lowered his head, displaying every sign of genuine sorrow.",

Suddenly, the abbé pointed out that Caderousse himself had been present. Surprised, Caderousse asked how the priest knew this. The abbé quickly covered by saying that, to know so many details, Caderousse must have witnessed it. Sheepishly, Caderousse admitted he had been there. The abbé questioned why Caderousse had not objected to such treachery, implying that failing to do so made him an accomplice. Caderousse explained that he had been made to drink so much that he was barely aware of the events, and while he tried to intervene as best he could given his condition, both Danglars and Fernand convinced him it was only a joke and harmless. The abbé pressed further, asking why Caderousse remained silent the next day, when Dantès was arrested and he could clearly see the outcome of their actions. Caderousse stated that although he wanted to speak out, Danglars stopped him, warning that anyone supporting Dantès could be seen as a collaborator if the accusations proved true, especially given the political situation. Out of fear, Caderousse kept quiet, admitting it was cowardly, but insisting it was not a crime. The abbé said he understood—Caderousse simply let events unfold—and Caderousse agreed, confessing he was haunted by remorse ever since. He told the priest he seeks God's forgiveness, believing that this one act is the cause of his wretched circumstances, and that whenever his wife La Carconte complains, he tells her to accept their fate as God's will. Caderousse bowed, visibly repentant."

Morrel,” he said; “who was he?”\n“The owner of the Pharaon and patron of Dantès.”\n“And what part did he play in this sad drama?” inquired the abbé.\n“The part of an honest man, full of courage and real regard. Twenty times he interceded for Edmond. When the emperor returned, he wrote, implored, threatened, and so energetically, that on the second restoration he was persecuted as a Bonapartist. Ten times, as I told you, he came to see Dantès’ father, and offered to receive him in his own house; and the night or two before his death, as I have already said, he left his purse on the mantelpiece, with which they paid the old man’s debts, and buried him decently; and so Edmond’s father died, as he had lived, without doing harm to anyone. I have the purse still by me—a large one, made of red silk.”\n“And,” asked the abbé, “is M. Morrel still alive?”\n“Yes,” replied Caderousse.\n“In that case,” replied the abbé, “he should be a man blessed of God, rich, happy.”\nCaderousse smiled bitterly. “Yes, happy as myself,” said he.\n“What! M. Morrel unhappy?” exclaimed the abbé.\n“He is reduced almost to the last extremity—nay, he is almost at the point of dishonor.”\n“How?”\n“Yes,” continued Caderousse, “so it is; after five-and-twenty years of labor, after having acquired a most honorable name in the trade of Marseilles, M. Morrel is utterly ruined; he has lost five ships in two years, has suffered by the bankruptcy of three large houses, and his only hope now is in that very Pharaon which poor Dantès commanded, and which is expected from the Indies with a cargo of cochineal and indigo. If this ship founders, like the others, he is a ruined man.”\n“And has the unfortunate man wife or children?” inquired the abbé.\n“Yes, he has a wife, who through everything has behaved like an angel; he has a daughter, who was about to marry the man she loved, but whose family now will not allow him to wed the daughter of a ruined man; he has, besides, a son, a lieutenant in the army; and, as you may suppose, all this, instead of lessening, only augments his sorrows. If he were alone in the world he would blow out his brains, and there would be an end.”\n“Horrible!” ejaculated the priest.",

Morrel several times,” he said; “who is he?” “The owner of the Pharaon and Dantès’ employer,” Caderousse answered. “And what part did he play in this sad situation?” the abbé asked. “The part of an honorable man, full of courage and genuine kindness. He intervened for Edmond twenty times. When the emperor returned, he wrote, pleaded, and even threatened with such force that after the second restoration, he was persecuted as a Bonapartist. As I said, he visited Dantès’ father ten times, offering to take him into his home; and the night or two before his death, as I mentioned, he left his purse on the mantelpiece, which was used to pay the old man’s debts and give him a proper burial. So Edmond’s father died just as he lived, having harmed no one. I still have the purse—it’s a large one, made of red silk.” “And,” the abbé asked, “is M. Morrel still living?” “Yes,” Caderousse replied. “In that case,” the abbé said, “he must be a man blessed by God, wealthy, and happy.” Caderousse smiled bitterly. “Yes, happy as I am,” he said. “What! M. Morrel unhappy?” the abbé exclaimed. “He is reduced almost to the very limit—indeed, he is nearly facing dishonor.” “How so?” “Yes,” Caderousse continued, “that is the situation; after twenty-five years of work, after building a most respected name in Marseilles trade, M. Morrel is completely ruined; he has lost five ships in two years, has suffered from the collapse of three large businesses, and his only remaining hope is in that very Pharaon that poor Dantès commanded, and which is expected back from the Indies carrying cochineal and indigo. If this ship is lost, like the others, he is a ruined man.” “And does this unfortunate man have a wife or children?” the abbé inquired. “Yes, he has a wife, who has remained like an angel through everything; he has a daughter, who was about to marry the man she loved, but whose family will now not permit him to marry the daughter of a ruined man; besides, he has a son, a lieutenant in the army; and, as you can imagine, all this, instead of lessening, only increases his sorrows.

The abbé stood and walked thoughtfully for a moment before sitting back down.\n\"You've mentioned someone named M. Morrel several times,\" the abbé said. \"Who is he?\"\n\"He owned the Pharaon and was Dantès' benefactor,\" Caderousse replied.\n\"What role did he play in all this?\" asked the abbé.\n\"He was a genuinely honorable and brave man. He intervened for Edmond repeatedly—twenty times, at least. When the Emperor returned, he pleaded, wrote letters, threatened—he fought so hard that during the second restoration, he was even persecuted as a Bonapartist. As I told you, ten times he visited Dantès’ father, offering him a home, and a day or so before the old man's death, left money on the mantelpiece for his debts and a proper burial. So Edmond’s father died as innocently as he lived. I still have the large red silk purse Morrel gave.\"\n\"And is M. Morrel still alive?\" the abbé asked.\n\"Yes,\" said Caderousse.\n\"Then he ought to be a fortunate and prosperous man,\" the abbé said.\nCaderousse gave a bitter smile. \"As happy as I am,\" he said.\n\"What? M. Morrel is unhappy?\" the abbé exclaimed in surprise.\n\"He's almost at ruin—nearly disgraced,\" said Caderousse.\n\"How did that happen?\"\n\"Yes, it's true. After twenty-five years of honest work and honorable business in Marseilles, M. Morrel is ruined. He's lost five ships in two years, and three big business partners went bankrupt. Now his only hope is in the Pharaon, which Dantès used to command and which is due back from the Indies with a cargo. If that ship is lost, he's finished.\"\n\"Does he have any family?\" inquired the abbé.\n\"Yes, a wife who’s been completely devoted, a daughter who was about to marry the man she loves—but now his family objects due to their financial ruin—and a son who is an army lieutenant. Naturally, this only makes his burden harder. If he were all alone, he’d likely end his life.\"\n\"How dreadful!\" cried the priest."

Why, he left Marseilles, and was taken, on the recommendation of M. Morrel, who did not know his crime, as cashier into a Spanish bank. During the war with Spain he was employed in the commissariat of the French army, and made a fortune; then with that money he speculated in the funds, and trebled or quadrupled his capital; and, having first married his banker’s daughter, who left him a widower, he has married a second time, a widow, a Madame de Nargonne, daughter of M. de Servieux, the king’s chamberlain, who is in high favor at court. He is a millionaire, and they have made him a baron, and now he is the Baron Danglars, with a fine residence in the Rue du Mont-Blanc, with ten horses in his stables, six footmen in his antechamber, and I know not how many millions in his strongbox.”\n“Ah!” said the abbé, in a peculiar tone, “he is happy.”\n“Happy? Who can answer for that? Happiness or unhappiness is the secret known but to one’s self and the walls—walls have ears but no tongue; but if a large fortune produces happiness, Danglars is happy.”\n“And Fernand?”\n“Fernand? Why, much the same story.”\n“But how could a poor Catalan fisher-boy, without education or resources, make a fortune? I confess this staggers me.”\n“And it has staggered everybody. There must have been in his life some strange secret that no one knows.”\n“But, then, by what visible steps has he attained this high fortune or high position?”\n“Both, sir—he has both fortune and position—both.”\n“This must be impossible!”\n“It would seem so; but listen, and you will understand. Some days before the return of the emperor, Fernand was drafted. The Bourbons left him quietly enough at the Catalans, but Napoleon returned, a special levy was made, and Fernand was compelled to join. I went too; but as I was older than Fernand, and had just married my poor wife, I was only sent to the coast. Fernand was enrolled in the active army, went to the frontier with his regiment, and was at the battle of Ligny. The night after that battle he was sentry at the door of a general who carried on a secret correspondence with the enemy. That same night the general was to go over to the English. He proposed to Fernand to accompany him; Fernand agreed to do so, deserted his post, and followed the general.\n“Fernand would have been court-martialed if Napoleon had remained on the throne, but his action was rewarded by the Bourbons. He returned to France with the epaulet of sub-lieutenant, and as the protection of the general, who is in the highest favor, was accorded to him, he was a captain in 1823, during the Spanish war—that is to say, at the time when Danglars made his early speculations. Fernand was a Spaniard, and being sent to Spain to ascertain the feeling of his fellow-countrymen, found Danglars there, got on very intimate terms with him, won over the support of the royalists at the capital and in the provinces, received promises and made pledges on his own part, guided his regiment by paths known to himself alone through the mountain gorges which were held by the royalists, and, in fact, rendered such services in this brief campaign that, after the taking of Trocadero, he was made colonel, and received the title of count and the cross of an officer of the Legion of Honor.”\n“Destiny! destiny!” murmured the abbé.\n“Yes, but listen: this was not all. The war with Spain being ended, Fernand’s career was checked by the long peace which seemed likely to endure throughout Europe. Greece only had risen against Turkey, and had begun her war of independence; all eyes were turned towards Athens—it was the fashion to pity and support the Greeks. The French government, without protecting them openly, as you know, gave countenance to volunteer assistance. Fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve in Greece, still having his name kept on the army roll.\nSome time after, it was stated that the Comte de Morcerf (this was the name he bore) had entered the service of Ali Pasha with the rank of instructor-general. Ali Pasha was killed, as you know, but before he died he recompensed the services of Fernand by leaving him a considerable sum, with which he returned to France, when he was gazetted lieutenant-general.”\n“So that now——?” inquired the abbé.\n“So that now,” continued Caderousse, “he owns a magnificent house—No. 27, Rue du Helder, Paris.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Caderousse then added, lamenting, \"And this is how God rewards goodness, sir? Look at me; the only wrong I ever committed was the one I told you about, yet I'm completely destitute, watching my poor wife succumb to fever with no means to help her. I'm facing starvation, just like old Dantès did, while Fernand and Danglars are living in absolute luxury.\" The abbé asked, \"How is that possible?\" \"Because their actions, however wicked, brought them prosperity, while honest people like me are left in misery,\" Caderousse explained. \"And what became of Danglars, the one who originated the plot and was therefore the most culpable?\" the abbé inquired. Caderousse replied, \"What became of him? He left Marseilles and, thanks to a recommendation from M. Morrel, who was unaware of his involvement in the crime, he got a job as a cashier in a bank in Spain. During the conflict with Spain, he worked for the French army's supply department and accumulated a fortune. He then used that money to speculate on the stock market, doubling or quadrupling his initial capital. After first marrying his banker's daughter, who passed away, he remarried a wealthy widow, Madame de Nargonne, whose father, M. de Servieux, is the king's influential chamberlain. He's a millionaire, has been granted the title of baron, and is now Baron Danglars. He lives in a grand mansion on Rue du Mont-Blanc, has ten horses, six footmen, and countless millions stashed away.\" \"Ah!\" the abbé remarked in a peculiar tone, \"He must be happy.\" Caderousse responded, \"Happy? Who can truly say? Happiness or unhappiness is something only you and the walls know—and walls hear but cannot speak. But if vast wealth equates to happiness, then yes, Danglars is happy.\" \"And Fernand?\" the abbé asked. \"Fernand? His story is quite similar,\" Caderousse said. \"But how could a humble fisherman from the Catalans, with no education or means, possibly acquire a fortune? This truly bewilders me,\" the abbé admitted. \"It bewildered everyone,\" Caderousse agreed. \"He must have a strange, hidden secret in his past that no one knows.\" \"But then, by what visible means did he reach this high level of wealth or status?\" the abbé pressed. \"Both, sir—he achieved both fortune and position,\" Caderousse stated. \"That seems impossible!\" \"It appears so, but listen, and I will explain. A few days before the Emperor returned, Fernand was conscripted. The Bourbons hadn't bothered him at the Catalans, but when Napoleon came back, a special draft was ordered, and Fernand had to join. I also joined, but being older and recently married, I was assigned only to coast guard duty. Fernand was sent to the active army, went to the border with his unit, and fought at the battle of Ligny. The night after the battle, he was on guard duty at the door of a general secretly corresponding with the enemy. That same night, the general planned to defect to the English. He proposed to Fernand that he join him, and Fernand agreed, abandoned his post, and followed the general. If Napoleon had stayed in power, Fernand would have faced a court-martial, but his actions were rewarded by the Bourbons. He returned to France with the rank of sub-lieutenant, and with the protection of the general, who held high favor, he became a captain by 1823, during the Spanish war—the same time Danglars was making his initial fortunes. Fernand, being of Spanish descent, was sent to Spain to gauge local sentiment. There, he connected with Danglars, became very close to him, gained the support of royalists in the capital and countryside, exchanged promises and made pledges, led his regiment through mountain passes known only to him which were held by the royalists, and in fact, rendered such significant services in this brief campaign that after the capture of Trocadero, he was promoted to colonel and given the title of count and the cross of an officer of the Legion of Honor.\" \"Destiny! destiny!\" the abbé murmured. \"Yes, but that wasn't the end,\" Caderousse continued. \"Once the war with Spain concluded, Fernand's advancement stalled due to the prolonged peace that seemed likely across Europe. Only Greece had risen against Turkey, starting its war for independence; everyone's attention turned to Athens—it was fashionable to sympathize with and assist the Greeks. The French government, without openly supporting them, as you know, permitted volunteer assistance. Fernand requested and received leave to go and fight in Greece, while still retaining his position on the army rolls. Sometime later, it was reported that the Comte de Morcerf (that was the name he used) had entered the service of Ali Pasha as an instructor-general. Ali Pasha was killed, as you are aware, but before his death, he compensated Fernand generously with a considerable sum. Fernand returned to France with this money and was then gazetted lieutenant-general.\" \"So now...?\" the abbé prompted. \"So now,\" Caderousse finished, \"he owns a magnificent residence—No. 27, Rue du Helder, in Paris.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "And so this is how heaven rewards virtue, sir,\" said Caderousse. \"Look at me—I've never done anything wrong except what I've already confessed to you—yet here I am, destitute, with my poor wife dying of fever before my eyes, and I can't do anything to help her; I will starve to death just as old Dantès did, while Fernand and Danglars enjoy lives of luxury and riches.\"\n\n\"How can that be?\"\n\n\"Because their actions have led to success for them, while honest folks like me are left to suffer in poverty.\"\n\n\"What has happened to Danglars, who started all of this and is therefore the most responsible?\"\n\n\"What happened to him? Well, he left Marseilles and was employed, thanks to a recommendation from Monsieur Morrel (who was unaware of his misdeeds), as a cashier at a bank in Spain. During the war with Spain, he worked in the supply corps for the French army and made his fortune. With that money, he invested further, multiplying his wealth several times. He first married his banker’s daughter, who died and left him a widower, and then remarried a widow named Madame de Nargonne, daughter of Monsieur de Servieux, the king’s chamberlain who is held in high esteem at court. He is now a millionaire, has been made a baron, and is known as Baron Danglars. He owns an impressive house on the Rue du Mont-Blanc, ten horses in his stables, six footmen in his entrance hall, and who knows how many millions in his vault.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the abbé, with a peculiar note in his voice, \"he is happy.\"\n\n\"Happy? Who can say for sure? True happiness or misery is something only one’s own heart and the walls around them can know—walls may hear, yet cannot speak; but if wealth brings happiness, then Danglars should be very happy.\"\n\n\"And Fernand?\"\n\n\"Fernand? Almost the same story.\"\n\n\"But how could a poor Catalan fisherman’s boy, without education or resources, become wealthy? I admit this surprises me.\"\n\n\"And it’s surprised everyone. There must be some mystery in his life that nobody knows.\"\n\n\"But, then, by what visible means did he gain such fortune and status?\"\n\n\"Both, sir—he has attained both wealth and rank.\"\n\n\"That seems impossible!\"\n\n\"It might seem so, but let me explain. A few days before the emperor returned, Fernand was called up. The Bourbons left him in peace among the Catalans, but when Napoleon came back, a special draft was made and Fernand had to join up. I was drafted, too, but being older than Fernand and newly married, I was sent to the coast. Fernand was put into the active army, went to the frontier with his regiment, and found himself at the battle of Ligny. On the night after the battle, he was on guard outside the quarters of a general who was secretly communicating with the enemy. That same night, the general intended to switch sides and join the English. He invited Fernand to go with him; Fernand accepted, deserted his post, and followed the general.\n\n\"If Napoleon had stayed in power, Fernand would have faced a court-martial, but his actions were rewarded when the Bourbons returned. He came back to France with the rank of sub-lieutenant, and thanks to the general’s powerful influence, he became a captain by 1823, during the Spanish war—just when Danglars embarked on his initial ventures. Fernand, being of Spanish origin, was sent to Spain on a mission and reconnected with Danglars there, became close with him, won the support of the royalists both in the capital and the countryside, made promises and secured commitments, and led his regiment through mountain passes known only to him that were occupied by royalist forces. He provided such valuable services in the short campaign that, after the capture of Trocadero, he was made a colonel, awarded the title of count, and given the officer’s cross of the Legion of Honor.\"\n\n\"Destiny! Destiny!\" murmured the abbé.\n\n\"Yes, but that’s not all. When the war with Spain ended, Fernand's career seemed to stall due to the general peace in Europe. Only Greece was in conflict, having risen against Turkey for independence, and all attention was now on Athens—it became popular to support the Greeks. The French government, though not directly intervening, allowed volunteers to help. Fernand got permission to serve in Greece while maintaining his name on the French army list. Some time later, it was reported that the Comte de Morcerf (as he was now called) had joined the service of Ali Pasha as a senior military instructor. Ali Pasha was eventually killed, as you know, but before dying, he rewarded Fernand’s service with a large sum of money, allowing him to return to France, where he was promoted to lieutenant-general.\"\n\n\"So now—?\" asked the abbé.\n\n\"So now,\" continued Caderousse, \"he owns a magnificent mansion at No. 27 Rue du Helder, Paris.\""

But I have seen things so extraordinary, that what you tell me seems less astonishing than it otherwise might.”\n“Mercédès was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which deprived her of Edmond. I have told you of her attempts to propitiate M. de Villefort, her devotion to the elder Dantès. In the midst of her despair, a new affliction overtook her. This was the departure of Fernand—of Fernand, whose crime she did not know, and whom she regarded as her brother. Fernand went, and Mercédès remained alone.\n“Three months passed and still she wept—no news of Edmond, no news of Fernand, no companionship save that of an old man who was dying with despair. One evening, after a day of accustomed vigil at the angle of two roads leading to Marseilles from the Catalans, she returned to her home more depressed than ever. Suddenly she heard a step she knew, turned anxiously around, the door opened, and Fernand, dressed in the uniform of a sub-lieutenant, stood before her.\n“It was not the one she wished for most, but it seemed as if a part of her past life had returned to her.\n“Mercédès seized Fernand’s hands with a transport which he took for love, but which was only joy at being no longer alone in the world, and seeing at last a friend, after long hours of solitary sorrow. And then, it must be confessed, Fernand had never been hated—he was only not precisely loved. Another possessed all Mercédès’ heart; that other was absent, had disappeared, perhaps was dead. At this last thought Mercédès burst into a flood of tears, and wrung her hands in agony; but the thought, which she had always repelled before when it was suggested to her by another, came now in full force upon her mind; and then, too, old Dantès incessantly said to her, ‘Our Edmond is dead; if he were not, he would return to us.’\n“The old man died, as I have told you; had he lived, Mercédès, perchance, had not become the wife of another, for he would have been there to reproach her infidelity. Fernand saw this, and when he learned of the old man’s death he returned. He was now a lieutenant. At his first coming he had not said a word of love to Mercédès; at the second he reminded her that he loved her.\n“Mercédès begged for six months more in which to await and mourn for Edmond.”\n“So that,” said the abbé, with a bitter smile, “that makes eighteen months in all. What more could the most devoted lover desire?” Then he murmured the words of the English poet, “‘Frailty, thy name is woman.’”\n“Six months afterwards,” continued Caderousse, “the marriage took place in the church of Accoules.”\n“The very church in which she was to have married Edmond,” murmured the priest; “there was only a change of bridegrooms.”\n“Well, Mercédès was married,” proceeded Caderousse; “but although in the eyes of the world she appeared calm, she nearly fainted as she passed La Réserve, where, eighteen months before, the betrothal had been celebrated with him whom she might have known she still loved, had she looked to the bottom of her heart. Fernand, more happy, but not more at his ease—for I saw at this time he was in constant dread of Edmond’s return—Fernand was very anxious to get his wife away, and to depart himself. There were too many unpleasant possibilities associated with the Catalans, and eight days after the wedding they left Marseilles.”\n“Did you ever see Mercédès again?” inquired the priest.\n“Yes, during the Spanish war, at Perpignan, where Fernand had left her; she was attending to the education of her son.”\nThe abbé started. “Her son?” said he.\n“Yes,” replied Caderousse, “little Albert.”\n“But, then, to be able to instruct her child,” continued the abbé, “she must have received an education herself. I understood from Edmond that she was the daughter of a simple fisherman, beautiful but uneducated.”\n“Oh,” replied Caderousse, “did he know so little of his lovely betrothed? Mercédès might have been a queen, sir, if the crown were to be placed on the heads of the loveliest and most intelligent. Fernand’s fortune was already waxing great, and she developed with his growing fortune. She learned drawing, music—everything. Besides, I believe, between ourselves, she did this in order to distract her mind, that she might forget; and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the weight on her heart. But now her position in life is assured,” continued Caderousse; “no doubt fortune and honors have comforted her; she is rich, a countess, and yet——”\nCaderousse paused.\n“And yet what?” asked the abbé.\n“Yet, I am sure, she is not happy,” said Caderousse.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The abbé paused, then, controlling himself, inquired, \"And Mercédès - I hear she vanished?\" \"Vanished,\" Caderousse repeated, \"yes, like the setting sun, only to reappear the next day with even greater brilliance.\" \"Did she also become wealthy?\" the abbé asked with a hint of mockery. \"Mercédès is now one of the most prominent ladies in Paris,\" Caderousse confirmed. \"Continue,\" the abbé urged. \"It feels as though I'm hearing a fantasy. However, having witnessed such extraordinary events, what you tell me seems less incredible than it otherwise would.\" Caderousse explained that Mercédès was initially heartbroken by Edmond's disappearance. He recounted her failed attempts to sway M. de Villefort and her dedication to old Dantès. Amidst her grief, another hardship struck: Fernand's departure. She was unaware of Fernand's crime and viewed him as family. Fernand left, leaving Mercédès completely alone. For three months, she continued to weep, receiving no news from Edmond or Fernand, with only a dying old man for company. One evening, after her usual sorrowful wait at the junction of two roads leading from the Catalans to Marseilles, she returned home more despondent than ever. Suddenly, she recognized a footstep, turned with anticipation, and the door opened to reveal Fernand, now in a sub-lieutenant's uniform. While it wasn't the person she longed for most, his presence felt like a fragment of her past returning. Mercédès clasped Fernand's hands with an intensity he mistook for love, but which was merely the relief of no longer being isolated and finally seeing a friend after long hours of solitary sorrow. And, admittedly, she had never truly disliked Fernand; she just didn't deeply love him. Someone else held her entire heart, but that person was gone, perhaps dead. This final thought, which she had always pushed away when others suggested it, now overwhelmed her completely, causing her to burst into tears and wring her hands in anguish. Adding to this, old Dantès constantly repeated, \"Our Edmond is dead; if he were alive, he would have returned.\" Caderousse continued, saying the old man died as he mentioned. He speculated that had old Dantès lived, Mercédès might not have married another, as he would have been there to disapprove of her faithlessness. Fernand recognized this and came back after the old man's death, now holding the rank of lieutenant. On his previous return, he hadn't spoken of love; this time, he reminded her of his feelings. Mercédès requested another six months to wait and mourn for Edmond. \"So,\" the abbé commented with a bitter smile, \"that totals eighteen months. What more could the most devoted lover ask for?\" He then quietly quoted the English poet, \"'Frailty, thy name is woman.'\" \"Six months later,\" Caderousse resumed, \"the wedding took place at the church of Accoules.\" \"The very church where she was to marry Edmond,\" the priest murmured, \"just a different groom.\" Caderousse proceeded, \"Yes, Mercédès was married. Although she appeared composed to everyone, she nearly collapsed passing La Réserve, the spot where, eighteen months earlier, her engagement to the man she knew deep down she still loved had been celebrated. Fernand, happier but clearly uneasy—for I observed he was in constant fear of Edmond's return—was very anxious to get his wife away and leave himself. The area around the Catalans held too many unpleasant memories. They left Marseilles eight days after the wedding.\" \"Did you ever see Mercédès again?\" the priest inquired. \"Yes,\" Caderousse replied, \"during the Spanish war, in Perpignan, where Fernand had stationed her. She was raising their son.\" The abbé started. \"Her son?\" he exclaimed. \"Yes,\" Caderousse confirmed, \"young Albert.\" \"But to teach her child,\" the abbé persisted, \"she must have been educated herself. Edmond told me she was a simple fisherman's daughter, beautiful but unlearned.\" \"Oh,\" Caderousse responded, \"how little he knew of his lovely betrothed! Mercédès could have been a queen, sir, if beauty and intelligence were the criteria for a crown. Fernand's wealth was already growing significantly, and she evolved along with his rising fortune. She learned drawing, music—everything. Also, between you and me, I think she did it to occupy her mind, to forget; she filled her head to ease the burden on her heart. But now her life is settled,\" Caderousse continued. \"Surely wealth and position have brought her comfort; she is rich, a countess, and yet—\" Caderousse paused. \"And yet what?\" the abbé prompted. \"Yet, I am certain, she is not happy,\" Caderousse concluded.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The abbé hesitated before asking, \"And what about Mercédès? I’ve heard she disappeared?\" Caderousse replied, \"Disappeared? Yes, but only to return more glorious, like the sun.\" The abbé asked ironically, \"Has she become rich as well?\" Caderousse explained, \"Mercédès is now one of Paris’ grandest ladies.\" The abbé urged him to continue, admitting the story seemed dreamlike but less surprising given the strange events he’s witnessed. Caderousse said Mercédès had been overwhelmed by despair after Edmond’s loss—she tried to win over M. de Villefort and cared deeply for Edmond’s father. Then Fernand, whom she loved as a brother and didn’t know was guilty, also left her. Alone, she mourned Edmond and Fernand, with only the dying elder Dantès for company. After months of grief, while returning home one night, she recognized a familiar step; Fernand had come back as a sub-lieutenant. Though she’d hoped for someone else, his return eased her loneliness. Mercédès greeted Fernand joyfully, more from relief at no longer being alone than out of love. She’d never hated Fernand, but all her heart had belonged to Edmond, who was now gone, possibly dead—a thought that brought her to tears. The notion that Edmond was dead pressed in on her, as old Dantès always said. Once the old man died, had he lived, Mercédès might never have married someone else. Fernand saw this, and after learning of the death, returned as a lieutenant, this time reminding her of his love. Mercédès pleaded for another six months to mourn Edmond. The abbé cynically remarked that amounted to eighteen months—a loyal wait—and quoted, “Frailty, thy name is woman.” Six months later, Mercédès married Fernand in the same church where she was to marry Edmond. She quietly suffered, nearly fainting as she passed the site of her engagement to Edmond. Fernand, fearful of Edmond’s return, was anxious to leave Marseilles, and they departed eight days after the wedding. The abbé asked if Caderousse saw Mercédès again. Caderousse said he had, during the Spanish war in Perpignan, where she was educating her son. The abbé was surprised—\"Her son?\" \"Yes,\" replied Caderousse, \"Albert.\" The abbé wondered how Mercédès could educate a child, as Edmond had described her as a beautiful but uneducated fisherman’s daughter. Caderousse replied that Edmond had underestimated her; Mercédès could have been a queen with her beauty and intelligence. As Fernand’s fortune grew, she learned drawing and music to distract herself from sorrow. Now, rich and noble, her position was secure. But, Caderousse concluded, despite all her advantages, he was sure she was not truly happy."

Take the diamond, then, and sell it; it is worth fifty thousand francs, and I repeat my wish that this sum may suffice to release you from your wretchedness.”\n“Oh, sir,” said Caderousse, putting out one hand timidly, and with the other wiping away the perspiration which bedewed his brow,—“Oh, sir, do not make a jest of the happiness or despair of a man.”\n“I know what happiness and what despair are, and I never make a jest of such feelings. Take it, then, but in exchange——”\nCaderousse, who touched the diamond, withdrew his hand.\nThe abbé smiled.\n“In exchange,” he continued, “give me the red silk purse that M. Morrel left on old Dantès’ chimney-piece, and which you tell me is still in your hands.”\nCaderousse, more and more astonished, went toward a large oaken cupboard, opened it, and gave the abbé a long purse of faded red silk, round which were two copper runners that had once been gilt. The abbé took it, and in return gave Caderousse the diamond.\n“Oh, you are a man of God, sir,” cried Caderousse; “for no one knew that Edmond had given you this diamond, and you might have kept it.”\n“Which,” said the abbé to himself, “you would have done.” The abbé rose, took his hat and gloves. “Well,” he said, “all you have told me is perfectly true, then, and I may believe it in every particular.”\n“See, sir,” replied Caderousse, “in this corner is a crucifix in holy wood—here on this shelf is my wife’s testament; open this book, and I will swear upon it with my hand on the crucifix.

Morrel left on old Dantès’ mantelpiece, which you say you still possess.” Caderousse, increasingly bewildered, went towards a large oak cabinet, opened it, and handed the abbé a long, faded red silk purse with two brass sliders that had once been gilded.

That he has given the diamond to us only?” inquired Caderousse, half bewildered with joy; “yes, nothing more true! See, here it is.”\nThe woman gazed at it a moment, and then said, in a gloomy voice, “Suppose it’s false?”\nCaderousse started and turned pale.\n“False!” he muttered. “False! Why should that man give me a false diamond?”\n“To get your secret without paying for it, you blockhead!”\nCaderousse remained for a moment aghast under the weight of such an idea.\n“Oh!” he said, taking up his hat, which he placed on the red handkerchief tied round his head, “we will soon find out.”\n“In what way?”\n“Why, the fair is on at Beaucaire, there are always jewellers from Paris there, and I will show it to them. Look after the house, wife, and I shall be back in two hours,” and Caderousse left the house in haste, and ran rapidly in the direction opposite to that which the priest had taken.\n“Fifty thousand francs!” muttered La Carconte when left alone; “it is a large sum of money, but it is not a fortune.”",

He opened the door himself, mounted his horse, gave another farewell nod to the innkeeper who continued to call out loudly, and then headed back along the route he had taken to get there. Turning around, Caderousse saw La Carconte standing behind him, her face even paler and her body trembling more noticeably than before. \"Is everything I overheard truly real?\" she asked. \"What? That he gave the diamond just to us?\" Caderousse replied, still slightly dazed with happiness. \"Yes, it's absolutely true! Look, here it is.\" The woman stared at it briefly, then said in a dejected tone, \"What if it's not real?\" Caderousse flinched, his face paling. \"Fake!\" he stammered. \"Fake! Why would that man present me with a false diamond?\" \"To trick you into revealing your secret without having to pay you, you idiot!\" Caderousse stood frozen for a moment, taken aback by the weight of this idea. \"Oh!\" he exclaimed, picking up his hat and placing it over the red kerchief tied around his head. \"We'll know soon enough.\" \"How?\" \"Well, the fair is happening in Beaucaire. There are always jewelers from Paris there, and I'll show it to them. Watch the place, wife, I'll be back in two hours.\" Caderousse then rushed out of the house and quickly ran in the direction opposite to where the priest had gone. \"Fifty thousand francs!\" La Carconte muttered to herself after he left. \"That's a significant sum, but it's hardly a fortune.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "With considerable effort, the abbé managed to free himself from Caderousse's fervent gratitude, then opened the door, went outside, mounted his horse, and bid farewell once again to the innkeeper, who continued to call out after him as he left the way he had come. When Caderousse faced his wife, La Carconte, he saw that she looked paler and more shaken than before. She asked, \"Is everything I heard really true?\" Caderousse, still somewhat dazed by happiness, replied, \"You mean that the diamond is really ours? Yes—it’s completely true! Look, here it is.\" La Carconte stared at the diamond for a while, then in a somber tone said, \"What if it’s not real?\" Caderousse was startled and turned pale. \"Not real?\" he muttered. \"Why would that man give us a fake diamond?\" She replied, \"To get your secret for nothing, fool!\" For a moment, Caderousse was stunned by this notion. “All right,” he said, putting his hat on the red scarf around his head, “we’ll find out soon enough.” \"How?\" she asked. \"Since the Beaucaire fair is on, there are always Parisian jewelers there. I’ll show it to them. Watch the house, wife. I’ll be back in two hours,\" and with that, Caderousse hurriedly left the house, running in the opposite direction to the abbé. Left alone, La Carconte murmured, “Fifty thousand francs is a lot of money, but it’s not a fortune.”"
