So I set perfectly still and waited and waited—till it seemed like all the trees was a-breathing, and every little sound was a-coming from Jim.

Then it begun to itch on the inside. Next I got to itching underneath. I didn’t know how I was going to set still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that. I was itching in eleven different places now.

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant interaction where Jim speaks again after his initial investigation, expressing suspicion and stating his intention to sit and listen for more sounds. This is a key moment that is missing from the middle of the passage.\n- The completion also leaves out the detail of Jim sitting down between the narrator and Tom, which is an important spatial and suspenseful element in the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence where Jim verbally wonders about the noise and declares his plan to sit and listen is absent.\n- The specific action of Jim sitting down on the ground between the two boys, leaning against a tree, and stretching out his legs is not included.\n- The progression of the narrator’s discomfort, including the increasing number and locations of itches and the internal struggle to remain still, is truncated and lacks the escalation present in the original.\n- The passage omits the narrator’s reflection on how itching occurs in situations where scratching is inappropriate, and how this has been noticed in various social contexts.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately moves directly from Jim’s initial investigation to him snoring, skipping over the intermediate suspenseful moments and dialogue.\n- The sequence of events is compressed, with the narrator’s discomfort and Jim’s actions not unfolding in the same order as the original.\n- The ending introduces a new concern about Jim possibly waking up and catching the boys, which is not present in the original passage and constitutes an invented reflection.\n\nTo improve, ensure all key actions, dialogue, and the gradual build-up of suspense and discomfort are included in the correct order, and avoid adding invented concerns or reflections not present in the source."

Every now and then, a twig would snap under our feet, and we’d freeze, listening hard, thinking maybe someone had heard us. But everything stayed quiet, except for the far-off barking of a dog and the soft hum of the river. Jim was right behind me, and I could feel him breathing heavy, like he was scared but trying not to show it.\n\nWe kept on, slow and careful, until we got to the back fence. There was a gap where the boards were loose, and I squeezed through first, holding the boards apart for Jim. He grunted a little as he came through, and I shushed him, though I was just as nervous as he was. Once we were out in the open, the moonlight made everything look silvery and strange. The grass was wet with dew, and it soaked through my shoes, but I didn’t care. I was thinking about what we were fixing to do, and how there wasn’t no turning back now.\n\nWe struck out for the river, keeping low, and soon we could see the water shining between the trees. The raft was tied up just where we left it, bobbing gentle against the bank. Jim went down first, careful not to make a splash, and I followed. We untied the rope and pushed off, letting the current take us. The shore slipped away behind us, and the lights of the widow’s house faded into the dark.\n\nFor a while, neither of us said nothing. The only sound was the water lapping against the logs and the frogs croaking in the reeds. I felt free and scared all at once, like I was doing something big and important, but also like I might get caught any minute. Jim sat at the back, steering with the pole, his face set and serious. I wondered what he was thinking, but I didn’t ask. It seemed like the kind of night where you just let your thoughts drift, same as the raft, and see where they take you.\n\nAfter a while, I lay back and looked up at the stars. They were bright and close, like you could reach out and grab a handful. I thought about all the things that might happen to us, and how far we might go before morning. But mostly, I just felt glad to be floating down the river, with Jim beside me, and the whole world spread out ahead."

Everything was still, except for the distant barking of a dog and the soft rustle of leaves in the night breeze.\n\nTom whispered, “You go first, Huck.”\n\nI slipped through a gap in the fence, careful not to make a sound. Tom followed, and we crouched behind a big old woodpile. From there, we could see the back porch, where a faint light shone through the kitchen window. We waited, hardly daring to breathe, until Tom nudged me and pointed toward the shed. I nodded, and we crawled over, moving slow and quiet as cats.\n\nWhen we reached the shed, Tom pulled out a bit of string and tied it to the latch, so we could open it from the outside if we needed to. Then he grinned at me, his eyes shining with excitement. “Now, Huck, we got to be careful. If anybody hears us, we’re in a peck of trouble.”\n\nI nodded again, feeling the thrill of adventure mixed with a little fear. Tom eased the shed door open just a crack and peeked inside. Satisfied it was empty, we slipped in and closed the door behind us. It was dark and smelled of old hay and tools. We waited a minute, listening for any sign we’d been discovered, but all was quiet.\n\nTom whispered, “We’ll wait here till the coast’s clear, then make our move.”\n\nWe sat in the darkness, my mind racing with thoughts of what might happen if we got caught. I could hear my own breathing and the faint creak of the shed settling. After what felt like forever, Tom nudged me again. “Come on, Huck. Now’s our chance.”\n\nWe slipped out of the shed and crept along the side of the house, keeping to the shadows. The moon was higher now, casting silver light over everything. We reached the corner of the house and peered around. The front yard was empty, but we could hear voices from inside. Tom grinned and motioned for me to follow him to the porch.\n\nWe tiptoed up the steps, careful not to let them creak. Tom reached into his pocket and pulled out a small piece of paper. He slipped it under the door, then turned and motioned for me to hurry. We darted back down the steps and ran for the fence, hearts pounding.\n\nOnce we were safely on the other side, Tom let out a low laugh. “That was close, Huck! But we did it.”\n\nI grinned back, the fear gone now, replaced by the wild joy of adventure. “What was on that paper, Tom?”\n\nHe winked. “You’ll see soon enough, Huck. Just wait.”\n\nWe melted into the night, two shadows slipping away, the thrill of our secret still buzzing in the air."

Then it begun to itch on the inside. Next I got to itching underneath. I didn’t know how I was going to set still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that. I was itching in eleven different places now. I reckoned I couldn’t stand it more’n a minute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try. Just then Jim begun to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore—and then I was pretty soon comfortable again.\n\nTom he made a sign to me—kind of a little noise with his mouth—and we went creeping away on our hands and knees. When we was ten foot off Tom whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun. But I said no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they’d find out I warn’t in. Then Tom said he hadn’t got candles enough, and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more. I didn’t want him to try. I said Jim might wake up and come. But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay. Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play something on him. I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was so still and lonesome.\n\nAs soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence, and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of the house. Tom said he slipped Jim’s hat off of his head and hung it on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn’t wake. Afterward Jim said the witches bewitched him and put him in a trance, and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again, and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. And next time Jim told it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back was all over saddle-boils. Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he got so he wouldn’t hardly notice the other niggers. Niggers would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country. Strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder. Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things, Jim would happen in and say, “Hm! What you know ’bout witches?” and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat. Jim always kept that five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it. Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they had, just to get him to touch that five-center piece to them and not say nothing. He was most ruined for a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches.\n\nWell, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and awful still and grand. We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard. So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half, to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.\n\nWe went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest part of the bushes. Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our hands and knees. We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked under a wall where you wouldn’t a noticed that there was a hole. We went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and sweaty and cold, and there we stopped. Tom says:\n\n“Now, we’ll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer’s",

When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a noise. We scrouched down and laid still. Miss Watson’s big nigger, named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty clear, because there was a light behind him. He got up and stretched his neck out about a minute, listening. Then he says:\n\n“Who dah?”\n\nHe listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between us; we could a touched him, nearly. Well, likely it was minutes and minutes that there warn’t a sound, and we all there so close together. There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I dasn’t scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back—right between my shoulders. Seemed like I’d die if I couldn’t scratch. Well, I’ve noticed that thing plenty times since. If you are with the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain’t sleepy—if you are anywheres where it won’t do for you to scratch, why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places.

So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on, and read it. It swore every boy to stick to the band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family must do it, and he mustn’t eat and he mustn’t sleep till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign of the band. And nobody that didn’t belong to the band could use that mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be killed. And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever.\n\nEverybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got it out of his own head.

Tom, he nudged me and whispered, \"Ain't it prime, Huck?\" and I nodded, for it did seem like the world was all ours, and nobody else in it but just us two. We set there a spell, not saying nothing, just listening and looking, and I felt so free and easy, like I could float right up with the stars if I wanted to.\n\nAfter a while, Tom says, \"We better get on, or we'll miss our chance.\" So we crept down the hill, keeping to the shadows, and made our way toward the old tanyard, where we was to meet Jim. The grass was wet with dew, and it soaked through my shoes, but I didn't mind. My heart was thumping, and I kept thinking about what we was fixing to do—helping Jim get away, and all the adventures that might come of it.\n\nWhen we got to the tanyard, we crouched behind the fence and listened. Everything was quiet, except for the frogs and the crickets. Then we heard a soft \"Who dat?\" and knew it was Jim. Tom answered with the signal, and Jim slipped out from behind a pile of barrels, looking scared but hopeful.\n\n\"You sure you boys ain't foolin'?\" he whispered. \"'Cause if dey catch me, I's done for.\"\n\n\"We ain't foolin', Jim,\" Tom said. \"We're going to help you, just like we promised.\"\n\nJim grinned, and I could see his teeth shining in the dark. We all felt like we was part of something big and important, and I reckon we was. Tom had a plan, of course—he always did—and he started whispering it to us, all about how we was going to sneak Jim down to the river, and get him on a raft, and float him out to freedom.\n\nThe night seemed to close in around us, and the stars looked down like they was watching to see what we'd do. I felt scared and excited all at once, but mostly I felt glad to be with my friends, doing something that mattered. We set off, quiet as could be, and the adventure began."

Why can’t Miss Watson fat up? No, says I to myself, there ain’t nothing in it. I went and told the widow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was “spiritual gifts.” This was too many for me, but she told me what she meant—I must help other people, and do everything I could for other people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about myself. This was including Miss Watson, as I took it. I went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn’t see no advantage about it—except for the other people; so at last I reckoned I wouldn’t worry about it any more, but just let it go.

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the specific term Tom used for the blazing stick as a signal, and does not mention the concept of a 'slogan' or its significance as a sign for the group to assemble.\n- The step where Tom claims to have received secret news from his spies is missing, which is important for the setup of the adventure.\n- The instruction to scour the swords and guns, and the detail about their being made of lath and broomsticks, is not fully included.\n- The detail about the day of the week when the ambush was planned is not mentioned.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately refers to the signal as a \"council fire\" instead of the term used in the original.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the group is described as meeting in the cave at night and then creeping out, which does not match the original order.\n- The moment of rushing out of the woods and down the hill is replaced with a halt and Tom's declaration that they are among the targets, which changes the action and pacing.\n- The ending has the group breaking and running, which is a slight shift from the original description of the teacher's intervention.\n- The repetition of earlier content at the end is out of place and disrupts the narrative sequence."

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces a new exchange about seeing genies and whether they exist, which is not present in the original passage. This invented dialogue shifts the focus and adds unnecessary content.\n- The completion omits the original's closing reflection about thinking over the events for several days before trying the experiment, which is a significant structural element.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the original's specific question about how to get genies, nor the detailed explanation of the process involving thunder, lightning, and smoke when the genies appear.\n- The sequence where one character questions who controls the genies and the explanation about the lamp or ring is less detailed and omits some steps and vivid descriptions from the original.\n- The original's playful threat about making the summoner climb the highest tree is missing, as is the direct rebuke about being a \"saphead.\"\n- The completion lacks the original's clear time frame of thinking things over for several days before attempting to summon a genie.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes some actions and lines, such as having Tom Sawyer respond to the genie skepticism in a way that is not present in the original.\n- There is an inaccurate sequence of events: the completion has the experiment with the lamp and ring occur immediately after the conversation, rather than after a period of reflection.\n- The completion introduces invented reasoning and internal monologue about the existence of genies, which is not part of the original passage.\n- There is a misattribution of the country of origin for the emperor's daughter, which differs from the original.\n- The completion changes the tone and content of the closing reflection, omitting the original's specific skepticism and conclusion about the story's truthfulness."

You just rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring, and out they come, tumbling over each other, ready to obey your orders. They can fetch you diamonds and gold by the bushel, and build you palaces in a night, and carry you to the ends of the earth on a flying carpet. There ain’t nothing they can’t do.”\n\nHuck looked doubtful. “Do you believe that, Tom?”\n\n“Why, of course I do. Didn’t you ever read about Aladdin and his wonderful lamp? It’s all in the book. And I bet if we had a lamp like that, we could have all the fun we wanted. We could be rich, and have all the pies and cakes we could eat, and never have to go to school again.”\n\nHuck scratched his head. “But where would we get a lamp like that? I never seen one, and I’ve been in all the houses in town.”\n\nTom grinned. “That’s just it, Huck. We got to go on an adventure and find one. Maybe there’s one buried somewhere, or maybe we could make one ourselves. Anyway, it’s worth a try. If we can’t find a real genie, we can pretend, and that’s almost as good.”\n\nHuck’s face brightened. “I like that, Tom. Let’s pretend we’re magicians, and we can call up genies whenever we want. We can make them do anything—steal watermelons, or scare old Mrs. Douglas’s cat, or even help us find treasure.”\n\nTom nodded eagerly. “That’s the spirit, Huck. We’ll start a band of robbers, and we’ll have secret signs and passwords, and we’ll meet in a cave at midnight. And if anybody tries to catch us, we’ll just call up a genie and he’ll whisk us away in a cloud of smoke.”\n\nHuck laughed. “That sounds like fun, Tom. But what if the genies don’t come?”\n\nTom waved his hand airily. “Oh, they’ll come, all right. You just got to believe in them. That’s the main thing. If you believe hard enough, anything can happen.”\n\nSo the two boys sat there in the warm summer night, spinning dreams of magic and adventure, their imaginations running wild with visions of genies and treasure and daring deeds. The river flowed quietly by, and the stars twinkled overhead, as if listening in on their plans. For Tom and Huck, the world was full of wonders, and anything seemed possible."

This addition shifts the tone and focus away from the original narrative.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits a specific mention of the narrator's uncertainty about where and how the bad luck would strike, which is present in the original and contributes to the sense of anxiety.\n- There is a missing reference to the idea that there are certain ways to ward off some types of bad luck, but not this particular kind, which is an important part of the narrator's reasoning.\n- The completion does not include the detail about the narrator choosing not to try any further remedies and instead moving along in a low-spirited and watchful manner.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of the narrator's thoughts is altered: the completion introduces a wishful regret and a general reflection on fate, which are not part of the original passage's progression.\n- The completion changes the focus from the narrator's specific concern about the consequences of the spilled salt to a broader philosophical musing, which is not present in the original.\n- The emotional tone at the end is less about being low-spirited and watchful, and more about resignation, which does not accurately reflect the original mood."

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents direct dialogue between the narrator and Jim that is not present in the original, particularly in the early part of the passage. This includes invented lines where the narrator explicitly asks Jim to use the hair-ball and requests an answer quickly.\n- The ending introduces a new reflection from the narrator, suggesting disbelief in Jim's claim about the potato, which is not present in the original passage.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the description of Jim's repeated attempts with the hair-ball, specifically the detail that he tried dropping it multiple times and that it behaved the same way each time.\n- The action of Jim getting down on his knees and listening to the hair-ball is missing.\n- The explanation about the potato's effect on the coin, including the narrator's prior knowledge of this trick, is not fully developed.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion condenses and changes the order of Jim's actions with the hair-ball, omitting the repeated attempts and the listening step.\n- The narrator's internal reasoning about the counterfeit coin is slightly altered, and the aside about the dollar from the judge is not presented in the same context as in the original.\n- The completion attributes a new, skeptical perspective to the narrator at the end, which is not present in the original passage."

It fell pretty solid, and Jim said it was a sign that pap warn’t going to stay long. He said, “Yo’ ole father doan’ know yit what he’s a-gwyne to do.

The room was still, except for the ticking of the clock on the mantel and the faint creak of the chair as he shifted his weight. I could see the lines in his face, deep and shadowed in the lamplight, and the way his eyes narrowed, studying me as if he was trying to read my thoughts. I felt uneasy, not knowing what he was going to say or do next, but I tried not to let on. I kept my hands in my lap and my eyes on the floor, but every now and then I’d glance up and catch him still watching me.\n\nAfter a while, he cleared his throat and leaned forward, letting the front legs of the chair come down with a thump. “So,” he said, “you been up to something, ain’t you?”\n\nI shook my head, but he just grunted. “Don’t lie to me, boy. I know you. You been sneakin’ around, and I aim to find out what you’re up to.”\n\nI didn’t say nothing. I knew better than to argue with him when he was in one of his moods. He got up and walked over to the window, peering out into the darkness. The moonlight made his shadow stretch long across the floor. He turned back to me, his face hard.\n\n“You think you’re smart, don’t you? Think you can fool your old pap. But I got my eye on you, Huck. Don’t you forget it.”\n\nHe came back and sat down again, this time closer to me. I could smell the whiskey on his breath. He reached out and grabbed my arm, squeezing it tight. “You been to school again, ain’t you? I told you I didn’t want you going to no school. You think you’re better than me, don’t you?”\n\nI shook my head again, but he just squeezed harder. “Don’t lie! I seen you with that book. You give it here.”\n\nI pulled the book out of my pocket and handed it to him. He looked at it, then threw it across the room. “There. That’s the end of that. You ain’t going to no school while I’m around. You hear me?”\n\nI nodded, not daring to say a word. He let go of my arm and leaned back in his chair again, watching me with those cold, hard eyes. I sat there, wishing I was anywhere else but there, and wondering how I was ever going to get away."

He kept me locked up in the old cabin by the river, and when he was there, he was always drinking and getting mad, and then he’d take it out on me. I tried to keep out of his way as much as I could, but it wasn’t easy in that little place. Sometimes he’d be gone for a day or two, and I’d have the run of the cabin, but I never knew when he’d come back, and I was always scared he’d catch me doing something he didn’t like.\n\nOne morning, after he’d been gone all night, I made up my mind to do something. I found an old saw, and I started to cut a hole in the back wall of the cabin, down close to the floor where the logs were rotten. I worked at it every chance I got, and after a few days I had a hole big enough to crawl through. I covered it up with an old blanket so pap wouldn’t see it.\n\nThen I started thinking about how I could get away without him knowing. I didn’t want him to come after me, so I made a plan to make it look like I’d been killed. I found an old pig in the woods, and I killed it and took it into the cabin. I smashed the door with an axe to make it look like someone had broken in, and I took the pig’s blood and made a trail out the door and down to the river. Then I dragged a sack of rocks down to the water and threw it in, to make it look like my body had been dumped in the river.\n\nWhen everything was ready, I crawled out through the hole in the wall and slipped away into the woods. I felt free for the first time in a long while, and I was glad to be away from pap and his hick’ry stick."

          "text_segment": "Pap warn’t in a good humor—so he was his natural self. He said he was down town, and everything was going wrong. His lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and Judge Thatcher knowed how to do it. And he said people allowed there’d be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian, and they guessed it would win this time. This shook me up considerable, because I didn’t want to go back to the widow’s any more and be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it. Then the old man got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of, and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn’t skipped any, and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round, including a considerable parcel of people which he didn’t know the names of, and so called them what’s-his-name when he got to them, and went right along with his cussing.\nHe said he would like to see the widow get me. He said he would watch out, and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place six or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till they dropped and they couldn’t find me. That made me pretty uneasy again, but only for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn’t stay on hand till he got that chance.\nThe old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got. There was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon, ammunition, and a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two newspapers for wadding, besides some tow. I toted up a load, and went back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest. I thought it all over, and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and take to the woods when I run away. I guessed I wouldn’t stay in one place, but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and hunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow couldn’t ever find me any more. I judged I would saw out and leave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would. I got so full of it I didn’t notice how long I was staying till the old man hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded.\nI got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark. While I was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of warmed up, and went to ripping again. He had been drunk over in town, and laid in the gutter all night, and he was a sight to look at. A body would a thought he was Adam—he was just all mud. Whenever his liquor begun to work he most always went for the govment, this time he says:\n“Call this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it’s like. Here’s the law a-standing ready to take a man’s son away from him—a man’s own son, which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and all the expense of raising. Yes, just as that man has got that son raised at last, and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin’ for him and give him a rest, the law up and goes for him. And they call that govment! That ain’t all, nuther. The law backs that old Judge Thatcher up and helps him to keep me out o’ my property. Here’s what the law does: The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and up’ards, and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets him go round in clothes that ain’t fitten for a hog. They call that govment! A man can’t get his rights in a govment like this. Sometimes I’ve a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all. Yes, and I told ’em so; I told old Thatcher so to his face. Lots of ’em heard me, and can tell what I said. Says I, for two cents I’d leave the blamed country and never come a-near it agin. Them’s the very words. I says look at my hat—if you call it a hat—but the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till it’s below my chin, and then it ain’t rightly a hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o’ stove-pipe. Look at it, says I—such a hat for me to wear—one of the wealthiest men in this town if I could git my rights.\n“Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. Why, looky here. There was a free nigger there from Ohio—a mulatter, most as white as a white man. He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the shiniest hat; and there ain’t a man in that town that’s got as fine clothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a silver-headed cane—the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State. And what do you think? They said he was a p’fessor in a college, and could talk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything. And that ain’t the wust. They said he could vote when he was at home. Well, that let me out. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming to? It was ’lection day, and I was just about to go and vote myself if I warn’t too drunk to get there; but when they told me there was a State in this country where they’d let that nigger vote, I drawed out. I says I’ll never vote agin. Them’s the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may rot for all me—I’ll never vote agin as long as I live. And to see the cool way of that nigger—why, he wouldn’t a give me the road if I hadn’t shoved him out o’ the way.",

That made me uneasy for a minute, but I made up my mind I wouldn’t be there when he tried it.\n\nThen he told me to go down to the skiff and fetch up a sack of corn meal, a side of bacon, ammunition, a four-gallon jug of whiskey, an old book, two newspapers for wadding, and some tow. I toted them up, one at a time, and when I got to the last load I set down on the skiff to rest. I must have set there a good while, for Pap hollered at me and asked if I was asleep. I went up, and while I was resting, I got to thinking how I’d have to get away. I’d take the gun and some lines, and slip off into the woods, and live on what I could catch or shoot, and keep moving, mostly at night, till I was so far away Pap and the widow couldn’t find me. I made up my mind I’d saw out that very night if Pap got drunk enough, which I reckoned he would.\n\nBy the time I got back, it was getting dark, and I went in and started supper. Pap took a drink or two, and then he begun to get worked up again. He looked pretty rough—mud all over him, and his clothes all rags, and his face so dirty you’d think he was made out of mud, like Adam was. He said he’d been drunk in town and laid out in the gutter all night.\n\nThen he started in on the government, the way he always done when he was drinking. He said it warn’t no account, letting a man’s own son be took away just when he was old enough to work and help his father. He said the law was all for Judge Thatcher, and here he was, a man worth six thousand dollars, living in a shanty and wearing rags, while Judge Thatcher had his money. He said he told Judge Thatcher he’d never leave the country, not for any money.\n\nThen Pap got to talking about a free nigger he’d seen in town—a mulatter, he called him, from Ohio, dressed up in a clean shirt and a white hat, with a gold watch and a silver-headed cane. Pap said the man was a college professor, could talk all kinds of languages, and what riled Pap most was that he could vote in his home state. Pap said, “There’s a state that lets a nigger vote. I says I’ll never vote agin as long as I live. Them’s the very words I said; they all heard me.” He said the man was so proud and sassy he had to shove him off the sidewalk.\n\nPap kept on, cussing and swearing, and every time he run out of folks to curse, he’d start over again, louder than before, till it seemed like he’d never stop. But I was just waiting for him to get drunk enough so I could saw out and be gone before morning.",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents some physical descriptions and actions for Pap (such as his hair being wild, his face scowling, and him stomping in) that are not present in the original passage.\n- There is an invented moment where Pap is described as being proud of sleeping in the gutter, which is not part of the original sequence.\n- The completion adds a specific monetary amount Pap supposedly offered to leave the country, which is not in the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the original's detailed escalation of Pap's cursing, including the repeated cursing of everyone and the specific way he refers to people he doesn't know.\n- The completion does not include the narrator's internal reaction to Pap's threats about hiding him, which in the original is described as a brief uneasiness followed by a resolution.\n- The completion leaves out the narrator's reflection on how long he was sitting on the skiff and being called by Pap, which is a transition in the original.\n- The original's description of Pap's appearance as being covered in mud and the comparison to Adam is not fully captured.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is sometimes altered: for example, the narrator's plan to escape is described before the full list of supplies is brought up, whereas in the original, the planning follows the action of carrying the supplies.\n- The completion attributes to Pap a statement about offering to leave the country for a specific sum, which is not accurate to the original's content.\n- The description of Pap's rant about the government and the law is condensed and some of the original's reasoning and examples are missing or altered.\n- The account of the free man from Ohio is summarized and some details are changed or omitted, such as the specifics of his clothing and the reactions of the townspeople.\n- The completion sometimes merges or reorders Pap's complaints and the narrator's reflections, which in the original are more clearly separated."

I kept still, and tried to look as meek as I could, for I knowed what was coming if I didn’t.\n\nPretty soon he says:\n\n\"Looky here—mind how you talk to me! I been in town two days, and I hain’t heard nothing but about you being rich. That’s what I been hearing. You think you’re better’n your pap, now, don’t you, because you can read and write?

And looky here—you drop that school, you hear? I’ll learn people to bring up a boy to put on airs over his own father and let on to be better’n what he is. You lemme catch you fooling around that school again, you hear? Your mother couldn’t read, and she couldn’t write, nuther, before she died. None of the family couldn’t before they died. I can’t; and here you’re a-swelling yourself up like this. I ain’t the man to stand it—you hear? Say, lemme hear you read.\"\n\nI took up a book and begun something about General Washington and the wars. When I’d read about a half a minute, he fetched the book a whack with his hand and knocked it across the house. He says:\n\n\"It’s so. You can do it. I had my doubts when you told me. Now looky here; you stop that putting on frills. I won’t have it. I’ll lay for you, my smartie; and if I catch you about that school I’ll tan you good. First you know you’ll get religion, too. I never see such a son.\"\n\nHe took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy, and says:\n\n\"What’s this?\"\n\n\"It’s something they give me for learning my lessons good.\"\n\nHe tore it up, and says:\n\n\"I’ll give you something better—I'll give you a cowhide.\"\n\nHe set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute, and then he says:\n\n\"Ain’t you a sweet-scented dandy, though? A bed; and bedclothes; and a looking-glass; and a piece of carpet on the floor—and your own father got to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard. I never see such a son. I bet I’ll take some o’ these frills out of you before I’m done with you. Why, there ain’t no end to your airs—they say you’re rich. Hey?—how’s that?\"\n\n\"They lie—that’s how.\"\n\n\"Looky here—mind how you talk to me; I’m a-standing about all I can stand now—so don’t gimme no sass. I’ve been in town two days, and I hain’t heard nothing but about you being rich. I heard about it away down the river, too. That’s why I come. You git me that money tomorrow—I want it.\"\n\n\"I hain’t got no money.\"\n\n\"It’s a lie. Judge Thatcher’s got it. You git it. I want it.\"\n\n\"I hain’t got no money, I tell you. I’ll ask Judge Thatcher, and he’ll tell you the same.\"\n\n\"All right. If you don’t git it I’ll bust you.\"\n\nHe left, and I watched him go, feeling mighty low. I knowed he’d be back, and I knowed he’d be madder than ever. I set there thinking, and wishing I was out of it, and wishing I was dead, and done with it all. But I warn’t dead, and I warn’t out of it, and I knowed I’d have to stand it, and make the best of it.\n\nThat night he come back, and he was drunker than ever. He cussed me, and he cussed the widow, and he cussed Judge Thatcher, and he cussed everybody he could think of, and then he cussed them all over again. He got to going on so, and he got to raising such a row, that the widow sent for the law to come and take him up. But they couldn’t do nothing with him; he was too strong for them, and he warn’t afraid of nobody. He swore he’d make me mind him, and he swore he’d have that money if he had to kill me for it.\n\nAfter that he watched me all the time, and he wouldn’t let me go nowhere, nor do nothing. He kept me locked up in the old cabin, and he’d go off and leave me there for hours at a time. I got to feeling mighty lonesome, and I got to wishing I was dead again. But I warn’t dead, and I warn’t out of it, and I knowed I’d have to stand it, and make the best of it.\n\nI tried to think of some way to get away, but I couldn’t see no way. Pap was always watching me, and he was always a-laying for me. I knowed if I tried to run away he’d catch me, and then he’d kill me sure.

That was always his word. I judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I could steal the key, or saw myself out, one or t’other. He drank and drank, and tumbled down on his blankets by and by; but luck didn’t run my way. He didn’t go sound asleep, but was uneasy. He groaned and moaned and thrashed around this way and that for a long time. At last I got so sleepy I couldn’t keep my eyes open all I could do, and so before I knowed what I was about I was sound asleep, and the candle burning.\n\nI don’t know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was an awful scream and I was up. There was pap looking wild, and skipping around every which way and yelling about snakes. He said they was crawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say one had bit him on the cheek—but I couldn’t see no snakes. He was just crazy. He run round and round the cabin, hollering ‘Take him off! take him off! he’s biting me on the neck!’ I never see a man look so wild in the eyes. Pretty soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he rolled over and over wonderful fast, kicking things every which way, and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming and saying there was devils a-hold of him. He wore out by and by, and laid still a while, moaning. Then he laid stiller, and didn’t make a sound.\n\nI could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and it seemed terrible still. He was laying over by the corner. By and by he raised up, part way, and listened, with his head to one side. He says, very low: ‘Tramp—tramp—tramp; that’s the dead; tramp—tramp—tramp; they’re coming after me; but I won’t go. Oh, they’re here! don’t touch me—don’t! hands off—they’re cold; let go. Oh, let a poor devil alone!’ Then he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let him alone, and rolled himself up in his blanket and under the old pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying. I could hear him through the blanket.\"\n```\n\n---\n\n**Notes on Improvements:**\n- The narrator’s two escape plans are explicitly mentioned.\n- The estimate of how long it will take Pap to get drunk is included.\n- The struggle to stay awake and the candle burning are present.\n- The vivid detail of Pap “rolling over and over wonderful fast” is restored.\n- The sequence of Pap’s actions is stepwise and uncompressed.\n- The narrator’s ability to hear Pap’s crying through the blanket is included.\n- No extraneous or inaccurate details are introduced; the setting and pacing match the original.\n- The ending is faithful, with no added reflection.",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the explicit mention of the narrator's two possible escape plans, only referencing them in a more general way. This reduces the sense of anticipation and planning present in the original.\n- The ending condenses the sequence of Pap's actions after his hallucinations, merging several distinct actions into a single summary, which loses some of the step-by-step progression found in the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion does not include the narrator's internal judgment about how long it would take Pap to become incapacitated, which is a key detail in the original's progression.\n- The middle section omits the narrator's struggle to stay awake and the specific mention of the candle still burning when he falls asleep, which adds to the atmosphere and sense of time passing.\n- The completion does not include the detail of Pap \"rolling over and over wonderful fast,\" which is a vivid part of the original's depiction of his delirium.\n- The final moments are missing the narrator's ability to hear Pap's crying through the blanket, which adds to the emotional impact and sense of helplessness.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces a detail about Pap settling \"by the fire,\" which is not present in the original and may mislead about the setting.\n- The sequence of Pap's actions during his hallucinations is somewhat compressed, with some actions out of order or merged, such as the transition from running around to collapsing and then crawling under the table.\n- The description of the cabin's quietness is slightly altered, with the completion referencing the \"hoot of an owl and the wolves in the woods\" in a way that changes the original's pacing and focus.\n- The completion ends with the narrator \"just lay there, listening, wishing I was anywhere but there,\" which introduces a reflective element not present in the original passage."

The firelight flickered on his rough face, and he took a long pull from the jug, smacking his lips and sighing with satisfaction. I watched him, feeling uneasy, because I knew what was coming. Pap always got mean when he was drinking, and there was no telling what he might do.\n\nHe started muttering to himself, cursing the government and the judge and anybody else he could think of. \"Ain't no right for them to meddle in a man's business,\" he grumbled. \"Ain't no right for them to take a man's son away from him, neither. I'm your pap, and don't you forget it.\"\n\nI kept quiet, hoping he would drink himself to sleep, but he wasn't done yet. He glared at me with bloodshot eyes. \"You think you're better'n me, don't you? With your fancy schoolin' and your reading and writing. Well, I ain't gonna have it. You hear me? I ain't gonna have it!\"\n\nHe lurched to his feet, nearly spilling the jug, and staggered over to where I was sitting. He grabbed me by the arm and shook me. \"You think you're smart, but you ain't. You're just a boy, and I'm your pap. You do as I say.\"\n\nI nodded, trying to keep him calm. \"Yes, sir,\" I said. \"I know.\"\n\nHe let go of me and stumbled back to his corner, taking another swig from the jug. His head lolled back against the wall, and his eyes started to droop. For a while he just sat there, mumbling and cursing, until finally the jug slipped from his hand and rolled across the floor. He was snoring now, deep and loud, and I knew he wouldn't wake up for hours.\n\nI sat there in the dim light, listening to the wind outside and the sound of pap's breathing. I wished I was anywhere but there, but I didn't dare move. I knew better than to cross pap when he was in one of his moods. So I waited, hoping morning would come soon, and thinking about how I might get away."

Pap was standing over me looking sour and sick, too. He says:\n“What you doin’ with this gun?”\nI judged he didn’t know nothing about what he had been doing, so I says:\n“Somebody tried to get in, so I was laying for him.”\n“Why didn’t you roust me out?”\n“Well, I tried to, but I couldn’t; I couldn’t budge you.”\n“Well, all right. Don’t stand there palavering all day, but out with you and see if there’s a fish on the lines for breakfast. I’ll be along in a minute.”\nHe unlocked the door, and I cleared out up the river-bank. I noticed some pieces of limbs and such things floating down, and a sprinkling of bark; so I knowed the river had begun to rise. I reckoned I would have great times now if I was over at the town. The June rise used to be always luck for me; because as soon as that rise begins here comes cordwood floating down, and pieces of log rafts—sometimes a dozen logs together; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the wood-yards and the sawmill.\nI went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t’other one out for what the rise might fetch along. Well, all at once here comes a canoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long, riding high like a duck. I shot head-first off of the bank like a frog, clothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe. I just expected there’d be somebody laying down in it, because people often done that to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they’d raise up and laugh at him. But it warn’t so this time. It was a drift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore. Thinks I, the old man will be glad when he sees this—she’s worth ten dollars. But when I got to shore pap wasn’t in sight yet, and as I was running her into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and willows, I struck another idea: I judged I’d hide her good, and then, ’stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I’d go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a rough time tramping on foot.\nIt was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old man coming all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and looked around a bunch of willows, and there was the old man down the path a piece just drawing a bead on a bird with his gun. So he hadn’t seen anything.\nWhen he got along I was hard at it taking up a “trot” line. He abused me a little for being so slow; but I told him I fell in the river, and that was what made me so long. I knowed he would see I was wet, and then he would be asking questions.

I was just holding it.\"\n\nHe looked me all over, and then he says:\n\n\"Well, what was you holding it for, then?\"\n\nI says, \"Somebody tried to get in, so I was laying for him.\"\n\n\"Why didn’t you roust me out?\"\n\n\"Well, I tried to, but I couldn’t; I couldn’t budge you.\"\n\nHe seemed to be satisfied, and he said:\n\n\"Don’t you ever do nothing like that again. When I’m around, you let me handle the gun.\"\n\nI laid the gun down, and Pap went to the door and looked out, then he said:\n\n\"Go and see if there’s any fish on the lines for breakfast. I’ll be along in a minute.\"\n\nI went along down to the river bank, and the river was up mighty high, and it was a big brown, swirling flood. I reckoned it was lucky for me, because it always brings down things that’s worth picking up. I looked out over the water, and pretty soon I see a piece of something a-floating along, and it was a canoe, a nice, new canoe, about thirteen or fourteen foot long. I was a good ways below me, but I swum out and got it, and towed it ashore. I was a good deal astonished, because I didn’t expect to see such a good thing as that. I knowed Pap would be mighty glad to get his hands on it, but then I thought, maybe I better keep it for myself. I pulled it up the creek, and hid it under the willows, and then I come back to the shanty.\n\nPap was standing in the door, and he had his gun in his hand. He was trying to shoot a bird off the fence, but he didn’t see me. When I come up, he says:\n\n\"What took you so long, and what you so wet for?\"\n\nI says, \"I fell in the river, and had to swim out.\"\n\nWe got five catfish off the lines, and went back to the shanty.",

            "prefix-probing": "I roused up and looked around. The door was open, and standing in the half-light was Jim, his face full of worry and excitement. He whispered again, more urgent this time, “Git up, Huck! What you ’bout? Dey’s somebody comin’!”\n\nI scrambled up, my heart thumping. The night air was cool, and the river made a soft, steady sound. Jim’s hand was on my arm, pulling me toward the brush. “Quick, chile! Dey’s men down de river, I hear ’em talkin’.”\n\nWe crouched low, slipping through the dew-wet grass, and I could hear voices, faint but getting closer. My mind raced. Had they found out about Jim? Was it the men from the town, or just some folks out fishing? I didn’t dare ask. Jim’s grip tightened, and we ducked behind a log, peering out at the moonlit path.\n\nThe voices grew louder. I could make out words now—something about a raft, and a runaway. My stomach twisted. Jim’s eyes were wide, and I could see the whites shining in the dark. “Don’t you say nuffin’, Huck,” he whispered. “Don’t let ’em see us.”\n\nWe waited, hardly breathing, as two men came into view. They carried lanterns, swinging them back and forth, their faces shadowed and serious. One of them stopped, pointing toward the river. “I reckon they come this way,” he said. The other nodded, and they moved on, their voices fading as they walked down the bank.\n\nJim let out a long, shaky breath. “Dat was close, Huck. Too close.”\n\nI nodded, wiping sweat from my forehead. “We best get back to the raft,” I said. “Ain’t safe here no more.”\n\nWe crept back through the brush, careful not to make a sound. The raft was just where we left it, tied up under the willows. We climbed aboard, and Jim pushed us off into the current. The river took us, silent and smooth, away from the danger.\n\nFor a while, neither of us spoke. The stars were bright overhead, and the water whispered against the logs. I thought about what had just happened, and how close we’d come to being caught. Jim sat at the back, steering with the pole, his face set and serious.\n\nAfter a bit, I said, “Jim, you reckon they’ll keep lookin’ for us?”\n\nHe nodded. “Dey ain’t gonna give up easy, Huck. But we got de river. She’ll take care of us.”\n\nI looked out at the dark water, feeling a little better. The river was our friend, our hiding place. As long as we kept moving, maybe we’d be all right.\n\nWe floated on, the night wrapping around us like a blanket. I listened to the sounds—the frogs, the water, the soft creak of the raft. Jim started humming a tune, low and sweet, and I felt myself relax. Whatever happened, we had each other, and the river to carry us on.\n\nAfter a while, I lay back and looked up at the stars. I thought about home, about Pap, about all the things I’d left behind. But mostly, I thought about Jim, and how we were in this together. I didn’t know what tomorrow would bring, but for now, we were safe, drifting down the big river, free as the night itself."

It was kind of solemn, drifting along that way, with the sun coming up and making everything look new and fresh. I got to thinking about Jim, and how he was out there somewhere, hiding, just like me. I wondered if he was awake yet, or if he was still sleeping. I hoped he was all right.\n\nAfter a while, I got up and stretched my legs. I was hungry, but I didn’t dare go back to the house for anything to eat. I had a little corn-dodger left in my pocket, so I ate that and drank some water from the river. It tasted good, and I felt better. I made up my mind I’d lay low all day, and not show myself till night. Then I could slip out and see if I could find Jim. Maybe we could fix up the raft and get away down the river together. That was the best plan I could think of, and it made me feel a little less lonesome."

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not mention the specific detail about the shallow lake's size, its rushes, or the presence of ducks in season, which are part of the original's environmental description.\n- The description of the slough or creek leading out of the lake, including its direction and the uncertainty about where it leads, is missing.\n- The completion omits the detail about the meal sifting out and making a track all the way to the lake, instead summarizing this action.\n- The narrator's actions after tying up the meal sack, specifically taking both the sack and the saw back to the canoe, are not fully detailed.\n- The original includes a sequence where the narrator eats, smokes a pipe, and lays out a plan, which is only partially represented in the completion.\n- The narrator's reasoning about how the pursuers will interpret the meal track and the sack of rocks is less detailed in the completion, missing the dual misdirection described in the original.\n- The plan to use Jackson's Island as a hideout and the intention to visit town at night for supplies is only briefly mentioned, lacking the original's detail.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces an inaccurate sequence by having the narrator travel through the woods before retrieving the meal sack and saw, which does not match the order of actions in the original.\n- There is an invented detail about putting a piece of pig’s meat in the narrator’s pocket for luck, which is not present in the original.\n- The reasoning about the meal trail and the pursuers' actions is simplified and partially inaccurate, as it does not reflect the full logic and sequence of the original narrator's thoughts.\n- The completion attributes a sense of comfort and freedom to the narrator at the end, which is a new reflection not present in the original passage."

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a transitional action where the narrator moves the canoe under the willows and waits for darkness before proceeding. This results in a missing sense of time progression and preparation for escape.\n- The completion invents a justification for dropping the whetstone (suggesting it was to make it look like someone was sharpening a knife), which is not present in the original passage.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not mention the specific time of day when the narrator finishes the preparations (i.e., the approach of darkness), which is important for the sequence of events.\n- The act of dropping the canoe under the willows and waiting for the moon to rise is not fully described, leading to a loss of atmospheric detail and the sense of careful planning.\n- The completion omits the narrator's internal reasoning about how the searchers will follow the track of the sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river, which is a distinct step in the original logic.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of actions is slightly altered: the completion has the narrator sitting in the canoe and letting it float down the river before mentioning making fast to a willow, which reverses the order of events from the original.\n- The reasoning about the meal track is partially present, but the completion merges or omits some of the narrator's predictions about the searchers' actions, resulting in a less detailed plan.\n- The completion attributes a different motive to dropping the whetstone, which is not supported by the original passage.\n- The completion does not accurately reflect the narrator's plan to stop at Jackson's Island and the reasoning for choosing it, though it does mention the island as a destination."

Then I took my way out through the woods, and made for the river. I was pretty tired, but I had to get away before anybody come. I got to the river and found a canoe, and paddled out to the middle, and let her float down. I laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let the current take me. The sun was up now, and I could see the banks sliding by. I felt free and easy, and I was glad to be out of that old cabin and away from pap and all the trouble. I floated on down for a long time, and by and by I heard a steamboat coming. I paddled to the shore and hid in the bushes till she went by. Then I got out and stretched my legs, and ate some corn-dodgers I had in my pocket. I was feeling pretty good, and I made up my mind I would go down the river till I found a good place to hide. I got back in the canoe and floated on. The river was wide and still, and the woods on both sides was thick and green. I felt like I was the only person in the world, and it was kind of lonesome, but I liked it. After a while I saw a little island in the middle of the river, with trees all over it. I paddled over and landed, and pulled the canoe up in the bushes. I looked around and found a good place to hide, and made myself a bed out of leaves and grass. I laid down and listened to the birds and the water, and pretty soon I went to sleep. When I woke up it was night, and the moon was shining. I got up and looked around, and everything was still and quiet. I felt safe and free, and I made up my mind I would stay on the island for a while. I had some matches and I built a little fire, and cooked some bacon I had in my pocket. I sat by the fire and thought about what I would do next. I was glad I had got away, and I hoped nobody would find me. I felt like I was starting a new life, and I was ready for whatever come."

My heart jumped, and I ducked down, watching him. When he got closer, I saw it was Jim! I was so glad to see him, but I didn’t let on right away. I waited till he was close, then I jumped out and said, “Hello, Jim!” He nearly jumped out of his skin, but when he saw it was me, he was mighty glad, too."

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces invented reflections and emotional responses, particularly the sense of loneliness and the narrator's feelings about being the only person in the world, which are not present in the original passage.\n- The ending adds invented sensory details and actions, such as searching for a dry spot and listening to the town's sounds, which do not appear in the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the specific description of the island's appearance, particularly the comparison to a steamboat without lights.\n- The mention of the bar at the head of the island being under water is missing.\n- The original's precise sequence of landing, including the action of parting willow branches and making the canoe fast so it could not be seen, is only partially represented and lacks some key steps.\n- The detail about the number of lights in the town and the distance is not included.\n- The original's description of the raft's position relative to the narrator and the quoted command from a man on the raft are missing.\n- The explicit mention of taking a nap before breakfast is not present.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately describes the raft's lantern as being on the bow, which is not specified in the original.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion blends the narrator's actions and observations, sometimes rearranging the order in which things happen (e.g., the raft's approach and the narrator's reflections).\n- The completion attributes emotional responses and sensory experiences to the narrator that are not found in the original passage."

I was careful not to make a noise, and I didn’t see any signs of people. I went up a piece and found a good place to camp, under a thick cluster of trees. I made my bed out of leaves and branches, and I was so tired I could have slept anywhere. I was free and satisfied. I lay there thinking how comfortable it was to be free, and how I didn’t have to answer to anybody, and how I could do just as I pleased.

It was something deeper, a kind of feeling that crawled up from my insides and made me sit up straight. I’d been running all this time, running from Pap, from the Widow, from all the folks who wanted to make me into something I wasn’t. But here, floating down the river with Jim, I felt freer than I ever had before. The river didn’t care who I was or what I’d done. It just kept rolling along, carrying us with it, and for the first time, I wondered if maybe that was all a body needed.\n\nI looked over at Jim, his face peaceful in the moonlight. He’d been through so much, and yet he still trusted me. That made me feel proud, but also a little scared. I remembered what folks said about helping a runaway slave, how it was wrong and against the law. But when I looked at Jim, I didn’t see a slave. I saw my friend. And that made all the difference.\n\nThe night was quiet except for the gentle splash of the oars and the chirping of the crickets. I lay back and stared up at the stars, thinking about all the things that had happened since I’d left home. I thought about Tom Sawyer and our old gang, about the Widow and her prayers, about Pap and his drunken rages. None of it seemed real out here on the river. Out here, it was just me and Jim and the wide, open world.\n\nI started to feel a little lonesome, thinking about home and all the people I’d left behind. But then I remembered why I’d left in the first place. I didn’t want to be “sivilized.” I wanted to be free, just like Jim. Maybe that was what the river was trying to tell me all along.\n\nI turned over and whispered, “Jim, you awake?”\n\nHe stirred and mumbled, “What is it, Huck?”\n\n“Nothin’,” I said. “Just thinkin’.”\n\nHe smiled, his eyes still closed. “Don’t you worry, honey. We’s all right. Long as we got the river, we’s free.”\n\nI smiled too, feeling the truth of his words settle over me like a warm blanket. The river would take us where we needed to go. And as long as we stuck together, I reckoned we’d be all right."

I never waited for to look further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast as ever I could. Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the thick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn’t hear nothing else. I slunk along another piece further, then listened again; and so on, and so on. If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of my breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too.\nWhen I got to camp I warn’t feeling very brash, there warn’t much sand in my craw; but I says, this ain’t no time to be fooling around. So I got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight, and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last year’s camp, and then clumb a tree.\nI reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn’t see nothing, I didn’t hear nothing—I only thought I heard and seen as much as a thousand things. Well, I couldn’t stay up there forever; so at last I got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast.\nBy the time it was night I was pretty hungry. So when it was good and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the Illinois bank—about a quarter of a mile. I went out in the woods and cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there all night when I hear a plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk, and says to myself, horses coming; and next I hear people’s voices. I got everything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping through the woods to see what I could find out. I hadn’t got far when I hear a man say:\n“We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about beat out. Let’s look around.”\nI didn’t wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy. I tied up in the old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.",

The sun was getting low, and the shadows were stretching long and black across the ground. I crept along, careful not to make a noise, and pretty soon I come to a place where the bank was high and steep, and the river was swirling below. I looked out through the thick branches, and I could see the water shining in the last of the daylight, and the big woods on the other side looking dark and lonesome.\n\nI set down and watched for a spell, thinking about what I’d do next. I warn’t hungry, but I felt kind of uneasy, like something was going to happen. I remembered Jim, and wondered if he was still asleep back at the camp, or if he’d woke up and missed me. I didn’t want to go back just yet, though. I liked being out there by myself, with nobody to bother me and nothing to do but listen to the river and the woods.\n\nAfter a while, I heard a splash down the river, and I got up and slipped along the bank to see what it was. I moved slow and careful, keeping behind the trees, and pretty soon I seen a canoe coming up the river, with a man in it. He was paddling slow, and looking all around, like he was hunting for something. I ducked down and watched him go by. He didn’t see me, and after he was gone I felt better, like I’d escaped from something.\n\nI went back to where I’d been sitting, and started thinking about home, and Pap, and all the trouble I’d had. I didn’t want to go back to that life, not ever. I liked it here, on the island, with Jim. We was free, and nobody could tell us what to do. I made up my mind I’d stick it out, no matter what happened.\n\nThe sun went down, and the woods got dark and still. I heard an owl hoot, and a frog croak, and the river kept on whispering to itself. I got up and started back toward the camp, moving slow and careful through the trees. When I got close, I seen the fire was out, and Jim was sitting there, looking worried.\n\n“Whar you been, Huck?” he says, low and anxious.\n\n“Just out lookin’ around,” I says. “Didn’t mean to scare you.”\n\nHe shook his head. “I thought maybe you got lost, or somethin’ happened.”\n\nI told him about the man in the canoe, and he listened close. “We got to be careful,” he says. “They might be lookin’ for us.”\n\nI nodded. “We’ll keep watch tonight,” I says. “Take turns, so nobody can sneak up on us.”\n\nSo we set there, quiet, watching the river and the woods, and I felt safe, like I belonged there, with Jim, on our own island, free as the wind."

Every now and then, a fish would jump, or a log would bump against the raft, and I’d startle up, thinking maybe it was someone coming. Jim was sleeping sound, his big arms folded under his head, and I envied him. I lay there, looking up at the stars, thinking about all that had happened and all that might come. It seemed like the world was so big and I was so small, floating down the river with nothing but the sky above and the water below.\n\nSometimes I’d hear a dog bark way off in the distance, or the hoot of an owl, and it’d make me feel lonesome. I got to thinking about Pap, and whether he was still looking for me, and about the widow and Miss Watson, and how they’d be worrying. But mostly I thought about Jim, and how he was running for his freedom, and how I was helping him. It made me feel strange, like I was doing something wrong, but also like I was doing something right. I didn’t know which it was.\n\nAfter a while, the sky started to lighten up, and the mist began to rise off the water. I could see the trees along the shore, all gray and ghostly. Jim stirred and sat up, rubbing his eyes. “We’s safe, Huck?” he whispered. I nodded, though I wasn’t sure. “I reckon so, Jim. Ain’t nobody found us yet.”\n\nWe got up and stretched, and Jim started fixing some breakfast—cornbread and bacon, cooked over a little fire on the raft. The smell made me feel better, and I forgot about being scared for a while. We ate in silence, listening to the river and the birds waking up. After we finished, we pushed off from the bank and let the current take us. The sun came up, turning the water gold, and I felt like maybe things would be all right for a while.\n\nBut I knew we couldn’t stay safe forever. Sooner or later, someone would come along, or we’d run into trouble. But for now, we had the river, and each other, and that was enough."

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant portion of the original narrative in the middle and end, particularly the detailed recounting of Jim's experience hiding, overhearing conversations, and his reasoning about escape methods. The sequence of Jim's actions after leaving the house is condensed and lacks the step-by-step progression found in the original.\n- The ending of Jim's story is truncated, missing the full account of his actions and reflections after reaching the island, as well as the specific details about his possessions and the conditions he encountered.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion leaves out specific time references and the progression of the day, such as the exact times when skiffs pass and when Jim overhears people talking about Huck's supposed death.\n- There is a lack of detail regarding Jim's strategic thinking about how to avoid being tracked, including his reasoning for choosing a raft over a skiff or traveling on foot.\n- The description of Jim's hiding place, the presence of other people, and his observations while concealed are not fully developed.\n- The completion does not include the details about Jim's possessions (such as his pipe, tobacco, and matches) and their condition after his escape.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion suggests Jim hides in the woods during the day and then escapes at night, but the original provides a more nuanced timeline and rationale for his actions.\n- There are inaccuracies in the conversations Jim overhears; the completion introduces invented dialogue about people searching for \"ole missus\" and finding a body, which does not align with the original content.\n- The completion invents a reflection at the end where Jim decides not to try for more rafts due to people watching, which is not present in the original passage.\n- Some actions are misattributed or generalized, such as the process of Jim getting on the raft and his subsequent actions, which are more specifically described in the original.\n\nTo improve, ensure the retelling follows the original sequence of events, includes all major steps and time markers, avoids inventing new scenes or dialogue, and captures the full scope of Jim's narrative and reasoning."

            "prefix-probing": "He watched me with his eyes bulging, and every time I brought something out of the canoe, he’d shake his head and mutter, “Dat’s powerful curious, Huck, ‘deed it is.” I laughed and told him it warn’t nothing but just the way white folks did when they went camping, but he kept on looking at the things as if they might vanish any minute. \n\nJim helped me fix up the fire, and pretty soon we had the bacon frying and the coffee-pot a-bubbling. The smell of the bacon made us both mighty hungry, and Jim said he hadn’t had a meal like this since he could remember. We sat down on the grass and ate, and Jim kept saying how good everything tasted, and how he never expected to be living so fine. \n\nAfter breakfast, we washed up the tin cups and plates in the river, and then Jim went off to look for some wild greens he said he’d seen growing near the water. I took the frying-pan and coffee-pot back to the canoe, and then I sat down on a log and watched the river. It was a lazy, quiet morning, with the sun shining through the trees and the birds singing. I felt free and easy, and I didn’t care if school or the widow or Pap ever found me again.\n\nJim came back with a big bunch of greens, and we put them in the pot to boil for dinner. While they was cooking, Jim told me about some of the adventures he’d had running away. He said he’d been chased by dogs, and once he’d had to hide in a hollow log all night while men with lanterns hunted for him. He said he was scared most all the time, but he’d rather be scared and free than safe and a slave.\n\nI listened to Jim, and I got to thinking about how different things was for him and for me. I was running away from Pap and the widow, but Jim was running for his life. It made me feel kind of mean, thinking about how folks treated him just because he was a nigger. But I didn’t say nothing, because I didn’t want to make him feel bad.\n\nAfter dinner, we lay around in the shade and talked. Jim said he was going to try to get to Cairo, where the Ohio River comes in, and then go up the river to the free states. He asked me if I’d go with him, and I said I would, at least as far as Cairo. I didn’t know what I’d do after that, but I liked being with Jim, and I didn’t want to leave him alone.\n\nWe spent the rest of the day fixing up the camp and making things comfortable. We cut some branches and made a kind of lean-to shelter, and Jim showed me how to make a bed out of grass and leaves. We gathered some more firewood, and Jim found some wild berries for supper. When it got dark, we built up the fire and sat around it, talking and telling stories. Jim told me about witches and ghosts, and I told him about some of the things I’d seen in town. We both got kind of scared, but it was fun, too.\n\nThat night, I lay awake for a long time, listening to the sounds of the river and the woods. I thought about what we was doing, and whether it was right or wrong. I knew I was helping Jim run away, and that was against the law. But I couldn’t help it. Jim was my friend, and I wasn’t going to let anybody catch him if I could help it.\n\nThe next morning, we got up early and had breakfast. Jim said we ought to get moving, so we loaded up the canoe and started down the river. The water was smooth and quiet, and the trees hung over the banks, making it cool and shady. We paddled along, keeping close to the shore, and watching out for anybody who might see us.\n\nAfter a while, we came to a place where the river widened out, and there was a big island in the middle. Jim said we ought to stop there and hide for a while, in case anybody was looking for us. We pulled the canoe up on the bank and carried our things into the woods. The island was thick with trees and brush, and it was easy to find a good place to hide.\n\nWe set up camp again, and Jim went off to explore the island. He came back after a while and said he’d found a place where we could see up and down the river for a long ways, without anybody seeing us. We took turns watching the river, and the rest of the time we fished and hunted for food. We caught some fish and cooked them over the fire, and Jim found some more wild greens and berries.\n\nWe stayed on the island for several days, living easy and not worrying about nothing. But one morning, Jim came running back to camp, all out of breath. He said he’d seen a boat coming down the river, with some men in it. We grabbed our things and hid in the thickest part of the woods, watching the boat go by. The men didn’t see us, and after they was gone, we came out and breathed easy again.\n\nAfter that, we was more careful. We kept the fire low, and we didn’t go out in the open unless we had to. We talked about what we’d do if anybody found us, and Jim said he’d rather die than be caught and sent back to slavery. I told him I’d stick by him, no matter what.\n\nOne night, while we was sitting by the fire, Jim started talking about his family. He said he had a wife and two children, and he didn’t know what had happened to them. He said he hoped he could get to the free states and earn enough money to buy them out of slavery. I felt sorry for Jim, and I wished there was something I could do to help him.\n\nThe days went by, and we kept moving down the river, stopping at islands and hiding whenever we saw anybody. We had some close calls, but we always managed to get away. Jim said he believed we had a charm, because nothing bad ever happened to us. I didn’t know about that, but I was glad we was still free.\n\nAt last, we came to a place where the river was full of driftwood and logs, and it was hard to paddle. We had to be careful not to tip over the canoe, and we worked hard to get through. When we finally made it, we was tired and hungry, but we was glad to be safe.\n\nWe found a quiet place to camp, and Jim cooked up some fish and greens for supper. We sat by the fire, talking about what we’d do when we got to Cairo. Jim said he was going to start a new life, and I said I’d help him if I could. We both felt hopeful, and we went to sleep that night feeling like things was going to turn out all right."

You’ve had to keep in the woods all the time, of course. Did you hear ’em shooting the cannon?”\n“Oh, yes. I knowed dey was arter you. I see um go by heah—watched um thoo de bushes.”\nSome young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time and lighting. Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain. He said it was a sign when young chickens flew that way, and so he reckoned it was the same way when young birds done it. I was going to catch some of them, but Jim wouldn’t let me. He said it was death. He said his father laid mighty sick once, and some of them catched a bird, and his old granny said his father would die, and he did.\nAnd Jim said you mustn’t count the things you are going to cook for dinner, because that would bring bad luck. The same if you shook the table-cloth after sundown. And he said if a man owned a beehive and that man died, the bees must be told about it before sun-up next morning, or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die. Jim said bees wouldn’t sting idiots; but I didn’t believe that, because I had tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn’t sting me.\nI had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them. Jim knowed all kinds of signs. He said he knowed most everything. I said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked him if there warn’t any good-luck signs. He says:\n“Mighty few—an’ dey ain’t no use to a body. What you want to know when good luck’s a-comin’ for? Want to keep it off?” And he said: “Ef you’s got hairy arms en a hairy breas’, it’s a sign dat you’s agwyne to be rich. Well, dey’s some use in a sign like dat, ’kase it’s so fur ahead.

Wunst I had foteen dollars, but I tuck to specalat’n’, en got busted out.”\n“What did you speculate in, Jim?”\n“Well, fust I tackled stock.”\n“What kind of stock?”\n“Why, live stock—cattle, you know. I put ten dollars in a cow. But I ain’ gwyne to resk no mo’ money in stock. De cow up ’n’ died on my han’s.”\n“So you lost the ten dollars.”\n“No, I didn’t lose it all. I on’y los’ ’bout nine of it. I sole de hide en taller for a dollar en ten cents.”\n“You had five dollars and ten cents left. Did you speculate any more?”\n“Yes. You know that one-laigged nigger dat b’longs to old Misto Bradish? Well, he sot up a bank, en say anybody dat put in a dollar would git fo’ dollars mo’ at de en’ er de year. Well, all de niggers went in, but dey didn’t have much. I wuz de on’y one dat had much. So I stuck out for mo’ dan fo’ dollars, en I said ’f I didn’ git it I’d start a bank mysef. Well, o’ course dat nigger want’ to keep me out er de business, bekase he says dey warn’t business ’nough for two banks, so he say I could put in my five dollars en he pay me thirty-five at de en’ er de year.\n“So I done it. Den I reck’n’d I’d inves’ de thirty-five dollars right off en keep things a-movin’. Dey wuz a nigger name’ Bob, dat had ketched a wood-flat, en his marster didn’ know it; en I bought it off’n him en told him to take de thirty-five dollars when de en’ er de year come; but somebody stole de wood-flat dat night, en nex day de one-laigged nigger say de bank’s busted. So dey didn’ none uv us git no money.”\n“What did you do with the ten cents, Jim?”\n“Well, I ’uz gwyne to spen’ it, but I had a dream, en de dream tole me to give it to a nigger name’ Balum—Balum’s Ass dey call him for short; he’s one er dem chuckleheads, you know. But he’s lucky, dey say, en I see I warn’t lucky. De dream say let Balum inves’ de ten cents en he’d make a raise for me. Well, Balum he tuck de money, en when he wuz in church he hear de preacher say dat whoever give to de po’ len’ to de Lord, en boun’ to git his money back a hund’d times. So Balum he tuck en give de ten cents to de po’, en laid low to see what wuz gwyne to come of it.”\n“Well, what did come of it, Jim?”\n“Nuffn never come of it.

Ef I could git de ten cents back, I’d call it squah, en be glad er de chanst.”\n“Well, it’s all right anyway, Jim, long as you’re going to be rich again some time or other.”\n“Yes; en I’s rich now, come to look at it.

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- In the middle of the passage, the completion introduces invented superstitions and actions (such as advice about bees and milk for snakes) that are not present in the original. This adds content that does not belong and disrupts the flow of the original narrative.\n- The sequence involving the wood-flat and the bank is altered, with invented dialogue and events (such as the claim that the wood-flat was not lost due to the bank busting) that do not match the original structure.\n- The ending omits the original's final reflection and summary about self-ownership and value, and instead compresses or alters the conclusion.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion omits the specific mention of having to stay in the woods and the reference to the cannon being fired, which are important for context.\n- The completion skips over the detailed explanation of the bad luck associated with shaking the tablecloth after sundown and the requirement to inform bees of a death before sunrise, both of which are present in the original.\n- The story about Balum and the ten cents, including the dream and the preacher's saying, is missing or significantly altered, resulting in the loss of a key anecdote and its associated moral.\n- The original's detailed recounting of the speculation with the wood-flat and the outcome is not fully represented.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately refers to \"guns last night\" instead of the original's reference to the cannon, which changes the context of the search.\n- The sequence of events in the speculation story is out of order, with the loss of the wood-flat and the bank busting not matching the original timeline.\n- The completion attributes actions and dialogue to Jim that are not present in the original, such as the invented plan to buy and sell razors and the claim that someone stole the ten cents, which is not accurate to the original events.\n- The final valuation of self-worth is presented differently, omitting the original's nuanced reflection and wish regarding the value of freedom versus money."

I’ll fetch you some food and things.”\n\n“Thanky, honey. You’s de bes’ fren’ Jim’s ever had; en you’s de only fren’ old Jim’s got now.”\n\nI promised I wouldn’t ever tell on him, and he said he wouldn’t ever forget me. Then I slipped up the bank and crept into the woods, and fetched him some corn-dodgers and bacon, and my old coat, and a blanket, and some coffee in a tin cup, and some sugar in a rag, and a gourd of water. He was mighty thankful, and said it was more than he’d had for a long time. I told him I’d come every night and bring him something if I could, and he said I was a good boy and he’d pray for me, and that made me feel so good I could have cried, but I didn’t.\n\nThen I went back to the house, and went to bed. I couldn’t sleep much, I was thinking about Jim so much, and about what I ought to do. I knowed very well I ought to turn him in, because that’s what people would say, but somehow I couldn’t do it. I’d got to feeling so friendly and kind toward him, and he was so grateful and so helpless, that I just couldn’t bring myself to do it. I kept thinking and thinking, and finally I made up my mind I wouldn’t tell on him, come what might.\n\nThe next day I went out in the woods again, and found Jim all right. He was feeling better, and had made himself a little shelter out of branches and leaves. He said he’d slept better than he had for a long time, and that the food I brought him was the best he’d ever tasted. I sat and talked with him a while, and he told me all about how he’d run away, and what he was going to do. He said he was going to try to get to the free states, where he could be a free man, and I said I’d help him all I could.\n\nWe talked about how we could get down the river, and what we’d need to do. Jim said he’d heard of a place where there was a raft hidden, and maybe we could fix it up and use it. I said that sounded like a good idea, and we made up our minds to try it. We spent the rest of the day looking for the raft, and finally found it, half sunk in the mud and covered with brush. We worked hard to get it loose, and finally managed to drag it out and patch it up a little. It wasn’t much, but it would float, and that was all we needed.\n\nThat night I brought Jim some more food, and we talked about when we should start. We decided to wait a day or two, until the moon was right and the river was high enough. In the meantime, we fixed up the raft as best we could, and gathered up what little we had to take with us. I felt kind of excited and scared, but I was glad to be helping Jim, and I knew we were doing the right thing.\n\nAt last the night came when we were ready to go. We slipped down to the river, and pushed the raft out into the water. It floated all right, and we climbed on board. The current took us away from the shore, and we drifted down the river, keeping close to the bank and staying out of sight. It was dark and quiet, and the only sound was the water lapping against the raft. I felt kind of strange and lonely, but I was glad to be with Jim, and I knew we were on our way to freedom.\n\nWe floated along for a long time, not saying much, just listening to the night sounds and watching the stars. After a while, Jim said, “Huck, you reckon we’s gwyne to git away safe?”\n\n“I don’t know, Jim,” I said. “But we’ll try our best.”\n\nHe said he was scared, but he trusted me, and that made me feel proud. I told him we’d stick together, no matter what happened. And so we floated on down the river, into the night, and into the unknown."

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The process of tramping and climbing around the hill or ridge is not fully represented; the sense of effort and exploration before finding the cavern is missing.\n- The completion does not mention the specific location of the cavern relative to the top and the side facing Illinois, which is present in the original.\n- The original describes the cavern as being as large as multiple rooms combined, but the completion only mentions it being big enough for two or three people, omitting the comparison to rooms.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces a detail about falling down the hill and how far one would go, which is not present in the original passage.\n- The description of the hill as being narrow is not in the original; the original focuses on it being long and steep.\n- The sequence of events is slightly altered: the original has the characters exploring the hill before finding the cavern, while the completion suggests they find the cave immediately upon reaching the top.\n- The size of the cavern is inaccurately described in the completion, both in terms of capacity and the omission of the original's comparison to rooms."

The house looked deserted, but as it came closer, we could see that the door was swinging open and shut with the motion of the water. Jim and me watched it drift by, and then Jim said, “Le’s go and have a look, Huck. Maybe there’s something we can use.”\n\nWe paddled out in the canoe and caught up with the house. Jim held the canoe steady while I climbed up onto the porch. The boards creaked under my feet, but the house seemed solid enough. I peeked inside, and it was dark and musty, with the smell of old wood and river water. There was broken furniture scattered around, and a few old clothes hanging on pegs. I called for Jim to come up, and he joined me, his eyes wide as he looked around.\n\nWe started searching through the rooms, looking for anything useful. In the front room, we found a wooden chest, but it was empty except for some old newspapers. In the kitchen, there was a rusty tin lantern and a few candles, which we took. Jim found a big old coat that looked like it might keep the rain off, so he slung it over his shoulder. We moved carefully, not wanting to make too much noise in case someone was hiding in the house.\n\nWhen we got to the back room, we stopped short. There was a man lying on the floor, face down, with a blanket over him. I felt a chill run down my back. Jim whispered, “Don’t go near him, Huck. He’s dead.” I nodded, and we backed out of the room, not wanting to disturb the dead man. Jim said it was bad luck to look at a dead person’s face, so we left him be.\n\nWe finished searching the rest of the house, but there wasn’t much else worth taking. We found a few old books, but they were too waterlogged to read. There was a broken mirror on the wall, and a hat with a hole in it. We took the lantern, the candles, and the coat, and climbed back down to the canoe.\n\nAs we paddled away, Jim was quiet. I could tell he was thinking about the dead man. I asked him if he thought the man had been killed, but Jim just shook his head and said, “It don’t matter, Huck. He’s gone now.”\n\nWe watched the house drift away down the river, turning slowly in the current. The sun was coming up, and the sky was turning pink and gold. I felt a little sad, thinking about the man in the house, but Jim said we did right by not looking at his face. He said it was best to let the dead rest.\n\nWe got back to our camp and put away the things we’d found. The lantern worked after we cleaned it up, and the candles came in handy that night. Jim wore the coat when it rained, and it kept him dry. We didn’t talk much about the house after that, but sometimes I thought about it, floating down the river with its secrets inside."

Jim and I scrambled to the edge of the wreck, looking for a way to get off, but the water was swirling and the current was strong. The steamboat’s whistle blew, long and loud, and I could hear the clang of the bell. I hollered at Jim to jump, and we both plunged into the river just as the steamboat came crashing into the wreck with a terrible noise. The boards splintered and the whole boat shook, and I thought for sure we’d be sucked under. But we struck out for the shore, swimming as hard as we could, and after a while we made it to a little island downstream. We lay there, panting and dripping, and watched as the steamboat backed away from the wreck, leaving a trail of broken timbers and debris in the water. Jim said, “Dat was a close call, Huck,” and I had to agree. We sat there for a while, catching our breath, and then we started to think about what to do next. Our raft was gone, and we didn’t have much to our names, but we were alive, and that was something. I told Jim we’d have to find another way down the river, and he nodded, his eyes wide and scared, but hopeful, too."

It was a warm night, and the mosquitoes weren’t too bad, so I lay there, listening to the sounds of the river and the distant barking of a dog. Every now and then, I could hear a steamboat chugging along, its lights flickering on the water. I felt lonesome, but I was glad to be away from the Widow and her ways. After a while, I got to thinking about Jim, and wondered if he had made it to the island. I hoped he was safe. The moon came up, shining through the trees, and I watched the shadows dance on the ground. I drifted off to sleep, feeling free and easy, with the river close by."

Then she got to talking about her husband, and about her relations up the river, and her relations down the river, and about how much better off they used to was, and how they didn’t know but they’d made a mistake coming to our town, instead of letting well alone—and so on and so on, till I was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her to find out what was going on in the town; but by-and-by she dropped on to pap and the murder, and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter right along. She told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand dollars (only she got it ten) and all about pap and what a hard lot he was, and what a hard lot I was, and at last she got down to where I was murdered.

We’ve heard considerable about these goings on down in Hookerville, but we don’t know who ’twas that killed Huck Finn.”\n“Well, I reckon there’s a right smart chance of people here that’d like to know who killed him. Some think old Finn done it himself.”\n“No—is that so?”\n“Most everybody thought it at first. He’ll never know how nigh he come to getting lynched. But before night they changed around and judged it was done by a runaway nigger named Jim.”\n“Why he—”\nI stopped. I reckoned I better keep still. She run on, and never noticed I had put in at all:\n“The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed. So there’s a reward out for him—three hundred dollars. And there’s a reward out for old Finn, too—two hundred dollars. You see, he come to town the morning after the murder, and told about it, and was out with ’em on the ferry-boat hunt, and right away after he up and left. Before night they wanted to lynch him, but he was gone, you see. Well, next day they found out the nigger was gone; they found out he hadn’t ben seen sence ten o’clock the night the murder was done. So then they put it on him, you see; and while they was full of it, next day, back comes old Finn, and went boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for the nigger all over Illinois with. The judge gave him some, and that evening he got drunk, and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty hard-looking strangers, and then went off with them. Well, he hain’t come back sence, and they ain’t looking for him back till this thing blows over a little, for people thinks now that he killed his boy and fixed things so folks would think robbers done it, and then he’d get Huck’s money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit. People do say he warn’t any too good to do it. Oh, he’s sly, I reckon. If he don’t come back for a year he’ll be all right. You can’t prove anything on him, you know; everything will be quieted down then, and he’ll walk in Huck’s money as easy as nothing.”\n“Yes, I reckon so, ’m. I don’t see nothing in the way of it.

I’ll keep it; and, what’s more, I’ll help you. So’ll my old man if you want him to. You see, you’re a runaway ’prentice, that’s all. It ain’t anything. There ain’t no harm in it.

I traveled nights, and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from home lasted me all the way, and I had a plenty.

She said people thought he killed his boy, and they nearly lynched him, but he got away. She said he was pretty drunk, and they didn’t have no proof, and so he got clear.

She said there was a reward out for Jim—three hundred dollars—and a reward out for old Finn too—two hundred dollars. She said Pap come back after a while, and tried to get money out of Judge Thatcher, and then he got drunk again, and went off with a gang of men, and hasn’t been seen since. She said the people believe Pap killed Huck for his money, and Jim helped, and that Pap will come back after a year or so and get the money if he can. She said that’s what people think, anyway.

            "prefix-probing": "I done it. I got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. But I hadn’t no confidence. You do that when you’ve lost a horseshoe that you found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn’t ever heard anybody say it worked for finding lost money or spirits, or anything like that. I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke; for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn’t know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go boom—boom—boom—twelve licks; and all still again—stiller than ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees—something was a stirring. I set still and listened. Directly I could just barely hear a “me-yow! me-yow!” down there. That was good! Says I, “me-yow! me-yow!” as soft as I could, and then I put out the light and scrambled out of the window onto the shed. Then I slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough, there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.\n\nHe said:\n\n“Hello, Huckleberry; what’s the matter with you?”\n\n“I been a-waiting for you for hours. I was afeard you wouldn’t come.”\n\n“Well, if I’d a knowed it was going to be this long, I wouldn’t a come. But here I am. Let’s get on.”\n\nWe went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of the widow’s garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn’t scrape our heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a noise. We scrouched down and laid still. Miss Watson’s big nigger, named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty clear, because there was a light behind him. He got up and stretched his neck out about a minute, listening. Then he says:\n\n“Who dah?”\n\nHe listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between us; we could a touched him, nearly. Well, likely it was minutes and minutes that there warn’t a sound, and we all there so close together. There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I dasn’t scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back, right between my shoulders. Seemed like I’d die if I couldn’t scratch. Well, I’ve noticed that thing plenty times since. If you are with the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain’t sleepy—if you are anywheres where it won’t do for you to scratch, why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim says:\n\n“Say, who is you? Whar is you? Dog my cats ef I didn’ hear sumf’n. Well, I know what I’s gwyne to do: I’s gwyne to set down here and listen tell I hears it agin.”\n\nSo he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. He leaned his back up against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched one of mine. My nose begun to itch. It itched till the tears come into my eyes. But I dasn’t scratch. Then it begun to itch on the inside. Next I got to itching underneath. I didn’t know how I was going to set still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that. I was itching in eleven different places now. I reckoned I couldn’t stand it more’n a minute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try. Just then Jim begun to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore—and then I was pretty soon comfortable again.\n\nTom he made a sign to me—kind of a little noise with his mouth—and we went creeping away on our hands and knees. When we was ten foot off, Tom whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun. But I said no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they’d find out I warn’t in. Then Tom said he’d tie him anyway. So he went to Jim and tied his head up to the tree with a piece of string, and Jim never budged. Afterward, Tom said he slipped Jim’s hat off and hung it on a limb right over his head, as a sign that witches had been there. Jim was always talking about witches in the kitchen, and he was always getting hoodooed, so that he was full of witch stories. He told the people that night that witches had rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. And next time Jim told it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and after that, every time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back was all over saddle-boils. Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he got so he wouldn’t hardly notice the other niggers. Niggers would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country. Strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder. Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things, Jim would happen in and say, “Hm! What you know ’bout witches?” and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat. Jim always kept that five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a charm the devil gave to him with his own hands, and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it. Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn’t touch it, because the devil had had his hands on it. Jim was most ruined for a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches."

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the part where the woman instructs the narrator to keep the lead in their lap and drops it there, as well as the narrator's action of clapping their legs together on it. This sequence is missing before the conversation about the narrator's real name begins.\n- The completion also skips the detail where the woman puts the hank of yarn over the narrator's hands, instead describing her winding it around her own hands, which changes the interaction.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the woman's explicit instruction to keep an eye on the rats and to keep the lead handy, which is a key transitional moment in the original passage.\n- The brief pause in conversation after the yarn is removed, and the woman's direct, pleasant look before questioning the narrator, is not present.\n- The completion omits the narrator's internal reaction to wanting to leave before the old man returns, and the subtlety of not revealing this intention.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion has the woman winding yarn around her own hands, rather than involving the narrator's hands as in the original.\n- The completion invents a detail about the narrator not daring to come to the door, which is not present in the original.\n- The completion changes the placement of the bar of lead, having it put on the table instead of in the narrator's lap.\n- The woman's demeanor and the transition to her questioning the narrator are less gradual and lack the original's buildup, making the shift more abrupt.\n- The completion attributes a different reaction to the woman after the narrator throws at the rat, focusing on her laughter and a compliment, rather than the original's more reserved response."

She said she set traps for them, but it didn’t do much good, because they were too smart for traps, and she reckoned they’d get the best of her yet. She said she’d seen a rat that was as big as a cat, and she believed it, too, for she’d seen it with her own eyes.\n\nThen she got to talking about snakes, and how she was afraid of them, and how she’d heard that if you killed a snake and hung it up, it would keep the others away. She said she’d tried it, but it didn’t seem to do any good, for she’d found another snake in the house the very next day. She said she didn’t know what she was going to do, for she couldn’t stand snakes, and she couldn’t stand rats, and she couldn’t stand to live the way they had to live, but she didn’t see any way out of it.\n\nAll the time she was talking, I was watching her close, and trying to think what I’d better do. I was afraid she might get to asking me questions about myself, and I didn’t want to have to lie any more than I had to. But she didn’t seem to be thinking about me much, she was so taken up with her own troubles. By and by she asked me if I could knit, and I said I could, a little. She gave me some yarn and needles, and told me to set to work and see what I could do. I took the needles and yarn, and went to work, but I made a mess of it, and she saw right away that I didn’t know much about it. She looked at me kind of curious, and asked me where I learned to knit, and I said my mother taught me, but I hadn’t had much practice. She didn’t say anything, but I could see she was thinking.\n\nAfter a while she got up and went to the window, and looked out, and then she came back and sat down again. She said she reckoned it was going to rain, and she hoped her husband would get home before it started. She said she didn’t like to be alone in the house when it stormed, because the wind made the doors and windows rattle, and it sounded like somebody trying to get in. She said she always felt kind of scared when it stormed, and she wished her husband was home all the time, but he had to be off looking for work, and there wasn’t any help for it."

So I told her I was a runaway apprentice—that my folks was dead, and the law had bound me out to a farmer in the country thirty miles back from the river. And he treated me so bad I couldn’t stand it no longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took my chance, and stole some of his daughter’s old clothes, and cleared out, and I had been three nights coming the thirty miles. I traveled nights, and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from home lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty. I said I believed my uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why I struck out for this town of Goshen. She said:\n\n“Goshen, child? This ain’t Goshen. This is St. Petersburg. Goshen’s ten mile further up the river. Who told you this was Goshen?”\n\n“Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to turn into the woods for a nap.”\n\n“Well, he was drunk, I reckon. He told you wrong at the fork in the road. You take the left hand, and he told you the right. Yes, he must a been drunk.”\n\n“I’ll have to go, ma’am, before daylight, else they’ll catch me.”\n\n“Yes,” she says, “I’ll fix you up a snack to take along.”",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces the idea that the narrator is a runaway apprentice, which is not present in the original passage. This is an invented detail.\n- The completion adds a conversation about whether the man met at daybreak is a stranger and whether he lives around there, which is not part of the original dialogue. This is an invented exchange.\n- The completion omits the narrator's statement about believing a specific relative would take care of them and the reason for heading to the town mentioned in the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the narrator's mention of a particular family member as a motivation for traveling to the town, which is a key part of the original explanation.\n- The original contains a specific exchange about the directions given at the fork in the road, which is missing from the completion.\n- The offer to prepare a snack is present, but the original includes a more specific context and phrasing for this gesture.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately describes the narrator's fear of using roads and adds details about traveling through woods and along the river, which are not in the original.\n- The sequence of the conversation is altered: in the original, the narrator explains the directions received before the woman questions the accuracy, but in the completion, the questioning and explanation are rearranged and expanded with invented dialogue.\n- The completion changes the description of the time of day and the narrator's actions at that time, which does not match the original sequence.\n- The completion attributes additional reasoning and reflections to the narrator that are not present in the original passage."

I told her about the duke and the king, and how they’d tried to swindle people, and how we’d tried to get away from them. I told her about the time we’d been separated in the fog, and how scared I was that I’d lost Jim for good. I told her about the Grangerfords and the Shepherdsons, and the terrible fight that broke out between them, and how I’d barely escaped with my life. I told her about the time we’d been taken in by the Wilks girls, and how the duke and the king had tried to steal their money, and how me and Jim had tried to help them. I told her everything, just like I said I would, and I didn’t leave out a single thing. When I was done, I felt like a load had been lifted off my chest, and I looked at her to see what she would say. She sat there for a minute, thinking, and then she said, “Huck, I won’t go back on my promise. I’ll help you and Jim, and I won’t tell a soul. But you must be careful, and you must trust me.” I thanked her, and I knew I could count on her, no matter what happened next."

Mind, don’t you fail.”\n\nSo I set out. I walked down the road, and as I went I kept thinking about what she said. I was glad to get away, for I was feeling pretty uneasy. I didn’t know what was going to happen, but I knew I had to be careful. I kept my eyes open, and my ears, too, for I didn’t want to get caught. I made up my mind I’d stick to the river, and keep out of sight as much as I could.\n\nWhen I got to the river, I looked around to see if anybody was watching. There wasn’t a soul in sight, so I slipped down the bank and got into my canoe. I paddled out a little ways, and then let the canoe drift. The sun was just coming up, and the river looked beautiful. I felt free and easy, and I couldn’t help but whistle a little tune.\n\nAfter a while, I saw a raft coming down the river. I watched it for a bit, and then I saw it was Jim. I was glad to see him, for I’d been feeling lonesome. I paddled over to the raft, and Jim was mighty glad to see me, too. We talked for a while, and I told him all about what had happened. Jim listened close, and he said he was glad I was safe.\n\nWe floated down the river for a while, talking and laughing. It felt good to be with Jim again. We didn’t have to worry about anybody finding us, at least for a little while. The river was quiet, and the only sound was the water lapping against the raft.\n\nAfter a while, we got hungry, so we ate the snack the lady had given me. It wasn’t much, but it tasted good. We talked about what we were going to do next. Jim said he wanted to get to Cairo, so he could be free. I said I’d help him, and we made a plan. We decided to travel at night, and hide during the day. That way, we wouldn’t get caught.\n\nAs the sun got higher, we found a place to hide the raft. We pulled it up under some trees, and covered it with branches. Then we lay down and rested, waiting for night to come. I felt safe with Jim, and I knew we’d stick together, no matter what happened."

It was a pretty lonesome place, and the night was closing in, with the woods all dark and still, except for the soft lap of the water against the logs. Jim sat at the stern, steering, and I laid out on the middle of the raft, looking up at the sky and thinking about all the things that had happened. The stars were coming out, one by one, and the moon was just peeking over the trees on the far bank, throwing a silver path across the water. It made everything look kind of mysterious and solemn, and I felt a little shivery, but not scared, exactly.\n\nAfter a while, Jim says, \"We's gwine to have a good night for travelin', Huck. De moon's bright, an' de river's smooth.\"\n\n\"That's so, Jim,\" I says. \"But we got to keep a sharp lookout for steamboats and snags.\"\n\nJim nodded, and we drifted on, quiet as could be. Every now and then, we'd hear a hoot owl off in the woods, or a splash where a fish jumped. It was peaceful, and I started to feel sleepy. But I kept my eyes open, watching the banks slide by, and thinking about what we was going to do when we got further down the river. I wondered if we'd run into anybody, or if we'd be able to keep out of sight till we got to Cairo. Jim was hoping for freedom, and I was just hoping we'd both make it safe."

So I dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft in the dark till there warn’t but one stateroom betwixt me and the cross-hall of the texas. Then in there I see a man stretched on the floor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one of them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol. This one kept pointing the pistol at the man’s head on the floor, and saying:\n“I’d like to! And I orter, too—a mean skunk!”\nThe man on the floor would shrivel up and say, “Oh, please don’t, Bill; I hain’t ever goin’ to tell.”\nAnd every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say:\n“’Deed you ain’t! You never said no truer thing ’n that, you bet you.” And once he said: “Hear him beg! and yit if we hadn’t got the best of him and tied him he’d a killed us both. And what for? Jist for noth’n. Jist because we stood on our rights—that’s what for. But I lay you ain’t a-goin’ to threaten nobody any more, Jim Turner. Put up that pistol, Bill.”\nBill says:\n“I don’t want to, Jake Packard. I’m for killin’ him—and didn’t he kill old Hatfield jist the same way—and don’t he deserve it?”\n“But I don’t want him killed, and I’ve got my reasons for it.”\n“Bless yo’ heart for them words, Jake Packard! I’ll never forgit you long’s I live!” says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering.\nPackard didn’t take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail and started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill to come. I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boat slanted so that I couldn’t make very good time; so to keep from getting run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side. The man came a-pawing along in the dark, and when Packard got to my stateroom, he says:\n“Here—come in here.”\nAnd in he come, and Bill after him. But before they got in I was up in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come. Then they stood there, with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked. I couldn’t see them, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they’d been having. I was glad I didn’t drink whisky; but it wouldn’t made much difference anyway, because most of the time they couldn’t a treed me because I didn’t breathe. I was too scared. And, besides, a body couldn’t breathe and hear such talk. They talked low and earnest. Bill wanted to kill Turner. He says:\n“He’s said he’ll tell, and he will. If we was to give both our shares to him now it wouldn’t make no difference after the row and the way we’ve served him. Shore’s you’re born, he’ll turn State’s evidence; now you hear me. I’m for putting him out of his troubles.”\n“So’m I,” says Packard, very quiet.\n“Blame it, I’d sorter begun to think you wasn’t. Well, then, that’s all right. Le’s go and do it.”\n“Hold on a minute; I hain’t had my say yit. You listen to me. Shooting’s good, but there’s quieter ways if the thing’s got to be done. But what I say is this: it ain’t good sense to go court’n around after a halter if you can git at what you’re up to in some way that’s jist as good and at the same time don’t bring you into no resks. Ain’t that so?”\n“You bet it is. But how you goin’ to manage it this time?”\n“Well, my idea is this: we’ll rustle around and gather up whatever pickins we’ve overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hide the truck. Then we’ll wait. Now I say it ain’t a-goin’ to be more’n two hours befo’ this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river. See? He’ll be drownded, and won’t have nobody to blame for it but his own self. I reckon that’s a considerble sight better ’n killin’ of him. I’m unfavorable to killin’ a man as long as you can git aroun’ it; it ain’t good sense, it ain’t good morals. Ain’t I right?”",

I set down and took up my paddle and started after him. The river was very still, and the moon was shining bright, so I could see a long ways down the water. I paddled steady, and pretty soon I catched a glimpse of the raft away off yonder, and Jim standing up with his arms stretched out to me. I put all the muscle I had into the paddle, and by and by I was alongside. Jim grabbed me and hugged me, he was so glad to see me. He says:\n\n\"Lawsy, honey, I’s mighty glad to see you agin! I’s been a-waitin’ for you all night. I was feared you was lost, en I didn’t know what to do.\"\n\nI told him all about what had happened, and how I had fooled the men with the story about my pap and the smallpox. Jim said it was smart, and he was proud of me. We set down on the raft and let it float along, and pretty soon we was out of sight of the lights of the town. The river was wide and lonesome, and the trees hung over the water, making shadows that danced in the moonlight. It was quiet, except for the sound of the water and the frogs and the night birds.\n\nWe floated along for a long time, not saying much, just feeling glad to be together and safe. After a while, Jim says:\n\n\"Huck, I’s been a-thinkin’. S’pose we git down to Cairo, what’s we gwine to do den?\"\n\nI said I didn’t know, but we’d have to find out when we got there. Jim said he was going to try to get to the free states, and I said I’d help him all I could. We talked about it a while, and then we got sleepy and laid down on the raft to rest.\n\nThe next morning, the sun was shining bright, and the river was sparkling. We got up and ate some breakfast, and then we started floating down the river again. We passed by some little towns, but we kept away from the shore, because we didn’t want anybody to see us. Sometimes we’d see a steamboat coming, and we’d hide in the willows until it was gone.\n\nOne day, we saw a big raft coming down the river, with a lot of men on it. They was singing and laughing, and we could hear them a long ways off. Jim said we better keep out of their way, so we paddled over to the other side of the river and let them go by. They didn’t see us, and pretty soon they was gone.\n\nWe kept on floating down the river, and the days went by. Sometimes it rained, and we’d get wet, but we didn’t mind much. We was free and easy, and we didn’t have to answer to nobody. Jim was always talking about getting to Cairo, and I was hoping we’d get there soon, so he could be free.\n\nOne night, we was floating along, and we saw a light on the shore. Jim said maybe it was Cairo, so we paddled over to take a look. But when we got close, we saw it was just a little cabin, with a man sitting on the porch smoking a pipe. We didn’t stop, but just floated on by.\n\nAfter a while, we started to get worried that we might have passed Cairo in the night. Jim was real upset, and I felt bad for him. We tried to ask people on the shore, but we was afraid they’d find out about Jim, so we didn’t dare get too close.\n\nOne day, we saw a canoe tied up on the bank, and Jim said maybe we could use it to go ashore and ask about Cairo. I said I’d go, and Jim said he’d wait on the raft. I paddled over to the shore and tied up the canoe, and then I walked up to a little house and knocked on the door.\n\nA woman came to the door, and I told her I was looking for Cairo. She said she didn’t know, but she thought it was down the river a ways. I thanked her and went back to the raft. Jim was glad to see me, and we set off again.\n\nWe floated on, hoping to find Cairo, but the river kept getting wider and wider, and we started to think maybe we’d missed it. Jim was real downhearted, but I tried to cheer him up. I said we’d keep going, and maybe we’d find it yet.\n\nSo we kept on floating, day after day, watching the river and the sky, and hoping for the best. We didn’t know what was ahead, but we was together, and that was enough for us."

No sign of a boat. Jim said he didn’t believe he could go any further—so scared he hadn’t hardly any strength left, he said. But I said, come on, if we get left on this wreck we are in a fix, sure.

I knowed I had to keep my head, for there warn’t nobody to help me now, and if I made a noise or let on where I was, it might be the end of me.\n\nI crept along the bank, keeping in the shadows, and every now and then I’d stop and listen, thinking I heard something. But it was only the wind in the trees, or maybe a fish jumping. My heart was thumping so loud I was sure anybody could hear it. I kept thinking about Pap, and how he’d be mad if he knowed I was out here, and then I thought about Jim, and how he was counting on me. I couldn’t let him down.\n\nAfter a while, I come to a place where the bank was low, and I could see out over the water. There was a big log floating by, and I thought maybe I could get on it and drift down the river a ways, out of sight. I waited till it come close, then I slipped into the water and swum out to it. The water was cold and made me shiver, but I didn’t care. I grabbed hold of the log and pulled myself up, trying not to make a splash.\n\nOnce I was on the log, I lay flat and let it carry me along. The current was strong, and pretty soon I was out in the middle of the river, floating past the dark woods and the silent banks. I felt kind of free and scared at the same time. The moon made a silver path on the water, and I watched it slide by, thinking about all the things that had happened to me.\n\nI must have floated a mile or more before I heard a sound up ahead. It was a low, soft singing, like somebody was humming to themselves. I listened hard, and pretty soon I made out the words. It was Jim! He was sitting on the bank, waiting for me, just like we planned. I felt a big relief come over me, and I paddled the log over to where he was.\n\n\"Is dat you, Huck?\" he whispered, peering into the dark.\n\n\"It’s me, Jim,\" I said, trying to keep my voice low. \"Let’s get out of here before somebody comes.\"\n\nWe slipped off into the shadows, keeping close to the water, and pretty soon we was safe and sound, drifting down the river together, just the two of us, with the whole night ahead and nobody to bother us.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces a reflective section about the raft being gone and floating down the river, which is not present in the original. This adds invented narrative content early in the passage.\n- The completion also adds a general reflection about helping the men and questioning the usefulness of such thoughts, which is not part of the original structure.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the specific internal reasoning about the possibility of becoming a murderer and the personal connection the narrator draws to the men’s predicament.\n- The plan regarding where to land in relation to the first light (either above or below it) and the emphasis on finding a good hiding place for Jim and the skiff is missing.\n- The original’s detail about the narrator intending to fabricate a story to get help for the men is not fully captured; the completion generalizes this plan and omits the aspect of making up a story.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion discusses the raft being gone and floating down the river before the narrator’s concern for the men, whereas the original has the concern arise immediately after setting out.\n- The completion inaccurately describes the narrator’s plan for getting help, including invented details about telling people the men are \"up the river a piece\" and omitting the original’s focus on the narrator’s internal debate and specific plan.\n- The description of the storm and the inability to see lights is less specific and omits the original’s emphasis on the worsening weather and the assumption that everyone is in bed.\n- The ending of the completion adds a statement about not seeing the raft or any lights, which is a slight shift from the original’s focus on continuing to watch for both as they drift."

Don’t you know what’s the matter with you?”\n\n“My folks is in a fix, and so’s Miss Hooker; and if you can’t get here quicker, they’re all going to be lost!”\n“What’s the matter with them?”\n“They’re on the wreck.”\n“What wreck?”\n“Why, there ain’t but one.”\n“What, you don’t mean the Walter Scott?”\n“Yes.”\n“Good land! what are they doing there, for gracious sakes?”\n“Well, they didn’t go there a-purpose.”\n“I bet they didn’t! Why, great goodness, there ain’t no chance for ’em if they don’t git off mighty quick! Why, how in the nation did they ever git into such a scrape?”\n“Easy enough. Miss Hooker was a-visiting up there to the town—”\n“Yes, Booth’s Landing—go on.”\n“She was a-visiting there at Booth’s Landing, and just in the edge of the evening she started over with her nigger woman in a horse-ferry to go to her old man’s at the other side. The ferryboat was late getting along, and when they was in the middle of the river the steering-oar got loose, and they didn’t know how to work it, and the ferry run agin the snag, and the whole caboodle of them went overboard and the horses and the nigger woman and the ferryman and all, and Miss Hooker, she made a grab and got aboard the wreck. Well, then, she screamed and took on like all out, and the first we knowed, the trading-scow my folks was in struck the wreck; and the only one that didn’t get on the wreck was Bill Whipple—and he was dead. He was the best cretur—I most wish ’t it had been me, I do.”\n\n“My God! It’s a terrible scrape! Why didn’t you tell me sooner?”\n“I’ve been a-trying to, sir, but when I see you coming I was so uncommon tired out and scared I couldn’t hardly get my breath to call. I never thought of it, I never thought of it. I’d a been here sooner if I could a got a boat.”\n“Well, I’ll go and see what I can do. But I’ll have to have help, sure, and you better stay here and rest till I come back. I’ll hurry.”\n“I will, sir, I will,” says I, and he started away.",

The old man, Jim, he looked at me with his eyes wide and his mouth a little open, like he was waiting for me to go on. The river was quiet, just the sound of the water lapping against the side of the raft, and the moon was shining down, making everything look kind of silvery and strange.\n\nI tried again. “Pap, and mam, and sis, and all of ’em, they’s gone, Jim. Leastways, I reckon they is. I ain’t seen none of ’em for a long time now.”\n\nJim nodded slow, like he understood. “Dat’s how it goes, Huck. Folks comes an’ goes, but de river, she keeps on rollin’.”\n\nI looked out over the water, thinking about what Jim said. It was true, I guessed. The river didn’t care about nothing; it just kept moving, carrying us along with it, whether we wanted to go or not.\n\nJim poked at the fire with a stick, sending up a shower of sparks. “You ever think ’bout what you’s gonna do when we gets to Cairo?”\n\nI shrugged. “I don’t know, Jim. I ain’t thought that far ahead. I reckon I’ll just keep going, same as always.”\n\nJim smiled a little. “You’s a good boy, Huck. You got a good heart. Don’t let nobody tell you different.”\n\nI felt kind of funny at that, like maybe I was better than I thought. But I didn’t say nothing. I just watched the sparks drift up into the night, and listened to the river.\n\nAfter a while, Jim started humming a tune, soft and low. It was a song I’d heard him sing before, back when we was still on the plantation. It made me feel kind of lonesome, but also kind of safe, like maybe everything was going to be all right.\n\nWe drifted on down the river, the two of us, with the stars shining overhead and the water whispering all around. I didn’t know what was waiting for us up ahead, but I reckoned it didn’t matter. As long as we had each other, we could handle whatever came our way.\n\nThe night wore on, and pretty soon I started to get sleepy. I lay down on the raft, using my jacket for a pillow, and closed my eyes. Jim kept humming, and the sound of his voice mixed with the sound of the river, lulling me to sleep.\n\nI dreamed about home, about pap and mam and sis, and all the folks I used to know. But in my dream, they was all smiling and happy, and nobody was mad or scared. It was a nice dream, and I didn’t want to wake up.\n\nBut morning comes, whether you want it to or not. The sun was just coming up when I opened my eyes, and Jim was already up, fixing some breakfast. He looked over at me and grinned.\n\n“Mornin’, Huck. You sleep good?”\n\nI nodded. “Yeah, Jim. I slept real good.”\n\nWe ate our breakfast in silence, watching the sun rise over the river. I felt ready for whatever the day might bring, as long as Jim was by my side."

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the narrator's specific reasoning about why he feels comfortable, particularly the self-congratulatory reflection on taking trouble for the group and the idea that few would have done the same.\n- The wish that a particular character knew about the narrator's actions is not fully developed or placed in the same context as in the original.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion provides an inaccurate time reference that is not present in the original, altering the pacing and sequence of events.\n- The order of internal reflections and actions is changed: the narrator's thoughts about the widow and the gang are rearranged, and some are repeated or misplaced compared to the original sequence.\n- The emotional response to the gang's fate is repeated at the end, which is not consistent with the original structure."

I—I run off.\"\n\n\"Jim!\"\n\nBut mind you, I said it soft. I didn’t scream it out. I’d got to be so used to being with Jim, and having him around, that I didn’t seem to care much what happened, but I tell you I felt mighty mean and miserable, to think I was letting myself down to be a runaway nigger’s company. But I says, I got to do it—I can’t get out of it.\n\n\"Somehow I can’t seem to see no way out of it, Jim,\" says I. \"But I’ll stick by you, because you’re my friend, and I ain’t going to let them catch you if I can help it.\"\n\nJim grabbed my hand and squeezed it, and he was so grateful he couldn’t hardly speak. We sat there a while, and then Jim says:\n\n\"Huck, you’s de bes’ fren’ Jim’s ever had; en you’s de only fren’ ole Jim’s got now.\"\n\nI felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn’t make out what it was, and so it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that’s on its mind and can’t make itself understood, and so can’t rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night grieving. I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it was all shriveled up. I didn’t need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. But I hadn’t no confidence. You do that when you’ve lost a horseshoe that you’ve found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn’t ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you’d killed a spider.\n\nI set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke; for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn’t know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go boom—boom—boom—twelve licks; and all still again—stiller than ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees—something was a stirring. I set still and listened. Directly I could just barely hear a \"me-yow! me-yow!\" down there. That was Tom Sawyer’s signal. I answered back."

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the final action from the original passage, where the narrator, after finally untying the canoe, sets out in pursuit of the raft. This is a significant event that concludes the sequence and is necessary for narrative continuity.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the narrator's attempt to untie the canoe after realizing it is still fastened, nor does it mention the emotional state and physical difficulty experienced during this process in as much detail as the original.\n- The final step, where the narrator begins to chase after the raft, is missing. This action is important for showing the narrator's determination and the urgency of the situation.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion slightly alters the sequence of actions regarding the canoe and the rope, which may cause confusion about the order of events.\n- There is a minor inaccuracy in attributing the narrator's difficulty solely to the rope, rather than also emphasizing the emotional and physical state that contributed to the struggle.\n- The completion does not clearly convey the transition from being frozen in fear to taking decisive action, which is present in the original passage."

            "After quickly passing the short tow-head, Huck found himself enveloped in dense white fog, completely disoriented.",
            "He decided against paddling, fearing collisions, and chose to float, an unnerving experience in the circumstances.",
            "A distant whoop, presumably Jim's, briefly raised his spirits, and he eagerly pursued it.",
            "However, he repeatedly misjudged the direction of the sound, sometimes finding himself moving further away or to the side of it.",
            "The intermittent nature of the whoops made navigation extremely challenging.",
            "At one point, hearing a whoop behind him, Huck became thoroughly confused about his own orientation or whether it was a different sound.",
            "He then deduced the current had repositioned his canoe downstream, offering a glimmer of hope if the calls were indeed Jim's.",
            "Huck noted that the fog distorted both sight and sound, making identification uncertain.",
            "He had a close call with a cut bank lined with snags, the current rushing furiously past them.",
            "After this, the fog became oppressively silent and still again, and Huck listened to his own heartbeat, too frightened to breathe.",
            "He concluded that the cut bank was a large island and Jim had passed on the other side, a more significant obstacle than a tow-head.",
            "Huck reflected on the profound loneliness and disquieting nature of being lost in a fog alone at night.",
            "For about half an hour, he occasionally whooped and heard distant replies, but became entangled in a series of tow-heads, making the sounds even more deceptive and difficult to follow than a will-o'-the-wisp.",
            "He had to actively maneuver to avoid crashing into banks multiple times, inferring that the raft must also be experiencing similar difficulties or it would have drifted out of hearing range.",

The next time it come, I see I warn’t heading for it, but heading away to the right of it. And the next time I was heading away to the left of it—and not gaining on it much either, for I was flying around, this way and that and t’other, but it was going straight ahead all the time.\nI did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it all the time, but he never did, and it was the still places between the whoops that was making the trouble for me. Well, I fought along, and directly I hears the whoop behind me. I was tangled good now. That was somebody else’s whoop, or else I was turned around.\nI throwed the paddle down. I heard the whoop again; it was behind me yet, but in a different place; it kept coming, and kept changing its place, and I kept answering, till by-and-by it was in front of me again, and I knowed the current had swung the canoe’s head down-stream, and I was all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering. I couldn’t tell nothing about voices in a fog, for nothing don’t look natural nor sound natural in a fog.\nThe whooping went on, and in about a minute I come a-booming down on a cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the current throwed me off to the left and shot by, amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared, the currrent was tearing by them so swift.\nIn another second or two it was solid white and still again. I set perfectly still then, listening to my heart thump, and I reckon I didn’t draw a breath while it thumped a hundred.\nI just give up then. I knowed what the matter was. That cut bank was an island, and Jim had gone down t’other side of it. It warn’t no tow-head that you could float by in ten minutes. It had the big timber of a regular island; it might be five or six miles long and more than half a mile wide.\nI kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I reckon. I was floating along, of course, four or five miles an hour; but you don’t ever think of that. No, you feel like you are laying dead still on the water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don’t think to yourself how fast you’re going, but you catch your breath and think, my! how that snag’s tearing along. If you think it ain’t dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night, you try it once—you’ll see.\nNext, for about a half an hour, I whoops now and then; at last I hears the answer a long ways off, and tries to follow it, but I couldn’t do it, and directly I judged I’d got into a nest of tow-heads, for I had little dim glimpses of them on both sides of me—sometimes just a narrow channel between, and some that I couldn’t see I knowed was there because I’d hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash that hung over the banks. Well, I warn’t long loosing the whoops down amongst the tow-heads; and I only tried to chase them a little while, anyway, because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o’-lantern. You never knowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so quick and so much.\nI had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times, to keep from knocking the islands out of the river; and so I judged the raft must be butting into the bank every now and then, or else it would get further ahead and clear out of hearing—it was floating a little faster than what I was.\nWell, I seemed to be in the open river again by-and-by, but I couldn’t hear no sign of a whoop nowheres.",

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion leaves out the detailed description of the narrator’s confusion about the direction of the whoops, including the realization that the current has turned the canoe and the uncertainty about whether the whoop is from Jim or another person.\n- The passage omits the vivid description of the cut bank with ghostly trees and the intense current among the snags, as well as the narrator’s physical reaction (holding breath, heart thumping) during this tense moment.\n- The completion does not include the narrator’s realization about the size and nature of the island, including the specific comparison to a tow-head and the estimation of its dimensions.\n- The description of the sensation of floating in the fog, including the perception of stillness versus actual movement and the reaction to glimpses of snags, is only partially represented and lacks the original’s detail.\n- The sequence describing the narrator’s attempts to follow the whoops among the tow-heads, the difficulty in tracking the sound, and the comparison to chasing a will-o’-the-wisp is abbreviated and lacks the original’s nuance.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately presents the sequence of events, such as the encounter with the cut bank and the realization about the island, which are out of order compared to the original.\n- There are invented emotional reflections and dialogue that do not match the original’s tone or content, such as the narrator’s extended musings on patience and invented statements about Jim’s fate.\n- The completion introduces a moment where the fog lifts, which is not present in the original and changes the atmosphere of the scene.\n- The timing and duration of events, such as the period spent whooping and the narrator’s actions after losing the whoops, are not consistent with the original passage.\n\nTo improve, focus on maintaining the correct sequence of events, avoid inventing new reflections or dialogue, and ensure all key descriptive and narrative elements from the original are included in the appropriate order."

                "text": "That was all right as far as it went, but the tow-head warn’t sixty yards long, and the minute I flew by the foot of it I shot out into the solid white fog, and hadn’t no more idea which way I was going than a dead man. Thinks I, it won’t do to paddle; first I know I’ll run into the bank or a tow-head or something; I got to set still and float, and yet it’s mighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time. I whooped and listened. Away down there somewheres I hears a small whoop, and up comes my spirits. I went tearing after it, listening sharp to hear it again. The next time it come I see I warn’t heading for it, but heading away to the right of it. And the next time I was heading away to the left of it—and not gaining on it much either, for I was flying around, this way and that and t’other, but it was going straight ahead all the time.\n\nI did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it all the time, but he never did, and it was the still places between the whoops that was the tryingest. A body is bound to get out of patience, just so, when they is talking to you, and you are walking right along, and you can’t see no sign of them, but only hear them, and then they stop talking for a minute, and it seems a year. Well, I tried to keep up with the whoops, but I couldn’t do it, and by and by I got mixed up in the tow-heads, and only heard the whoop now and then, and sometimes a long ways off, and sometimes right close by, and then it was gone again, and I never knew which direction it was in. I was in a sweat to find out, but I couldn’t do nothing but just float along and listen, and try to guess which way it was.\n\nI judged the raft must be butting into the bank every now and then, or else it would get further and further ahead, and that was what I was after—mostly to keep up with it. But I couldn’t. The fog was so thick I couldn’t see a thing, and the river was as still as death, and so it felt like I was not moving at all, but I knowed I was, because I could hear the current rippling by the snags that stuck out of the bank. Every now and then I’d start up and try to paddle, but whenever I did I’d hear the whoop again, and then I’d drop the paddle and listen, and try to figure out which way it was; but I warn’t making much progress.\n\nPretty soon I heard a whoop behind me. I was lost. I throwed the paddle down; I heard the whoop again; it was behind me yet, but in a different place; it kept coming, and kept changing its place, and I kept answering, till by and by it was in front of me again, and I knowed the current had swung the canoe’s head downstream, and I was all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering. I couldn’t tell nothing about voices in a fog, for nothing don’t look natural nor sound natural in a fog.\n\nThe whooping went on, and in about a minute I come a-booming down on a cut bank, with smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the current tore by so fast I had to hold my breath, I was most scared to death. Well, I was in open river again by and by, but the next time a little glimpse showed, there was still snags and islands, whether in the river or in the banks I couldn’t tell; but it was big enough to be islands, and I judged it was the big island, all the time. I kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I reckon. I was floating along, of course, four or five miles an hour; but you don’t ever think of that. No, you feel like you are laying dead still on the water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don’t think to yourself how fast you’re going, but you catch your breath and think, my! how that snag’s tearing along. If you think it ain’t dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night, you try it once—you’ll see.\n\nNext, for about a half an hour, I whoops now and then; at last I hears a reply, away off in the fog, but not very close together; and I couldn’t tell right where it was, but it was a whoop, and I answered. Then I heard it again, still further off, and then not so far off, but I couldn’t tell which direction it was in. I tried to follow it, but I got tangled up in a lot of tow-heads, and the whoops seemed to get further and further away, and then they stopped altogether. I judged I was in the open river again, and must be a good ways below the island, but I couldn’t see a thing, and I couldn’t hear a thing, and so I just let the canoe float and made up my mind I wouldn’t try to do anything till the fog lifted.",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant sequence where the narrator describes the confusion caused by the shifting location of the whoops, including the realization that the sound is sometimes behind and sometimes in front, and the resulting uncertainty about direction. This section is important for conveying the disorientation in the fog.\n- The completion does not include the narrator's internal debate about whether the whoop is from a companion or a stranger, which is a key moment of tension in the original.\n- The passage where the narrator gives up and deduces the true nature of the landform (island vs. tow-head) is condensed and lacks the detailed reasoning and description found in the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early on, the completion skips over the narrator's repeated attempts to follow the whoop, including the specific details about heading in the wrong direction (right, then left) and the realization that the other party is moving straight while the narrator is not.\n- The middle section omits the narrator's frustration with the lack of a consistent signal (such as beating a tin pan) and the impact of the silence between whoops.\n- The moment of panic and confusion when the whoop is heard behind the narrator, and the subsequent uncertainty about orientation, is missing.\n- The detailed description of the cut bank, the \"smoky ghosts of big trees,\" and the swift current among the snags is not present.\n- The narrator's physical and emotional reaction—sitting perfectly still, listening to his heart, and feeling breathless—is only briefly referenced and lacks the intensity of the original.\n- The reasoning process about the size and nature of the island, including the comparison to a tow-head and the estimation of its dimensions, is not fully developed.\n- The description of floating among multiple tow-heads, with glimpses and sounds indicating their presence, is only partially included and lacks the sense of navigation through a maze.\n\n3.

I hollered, and listened. Away down there, somewheres, I hears a faint sound, and I hollers again. Then I hears a voice, not very loud, but it seemed to come from a long ways off, and it said:\n\n“Break o’ day and a clear sky, and the raft’s all right. Keep a-coming.”\n\nI paddled hard, and listened again, but I couldn’t make out where the voice come from. I was floating along, of course, four or five miles an hour; but you don’t ever think of that. No, you feel like you are laying dead still on the water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don’t think to yourself how fast you’re going, but you catch your breath and think, my! how that snag’s tearing along.

Well, I warn’t long losing the whoops, down amongst the tow-heads; and I only tried to chase them a little while, anyway, because it was worse than chasing a jack-o’-lantern. You never knowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so quick and so much.\n\nI had to climb up on a snag to get a look, and try to see where I was at; but it warn’t no use, fog was so thick I couldn’t see nothing. So I set down on a log and had a good cry, and then I thought I might as well try and paddle along down towards where I reckoned the raft was. I started, and when I struck the channel I went along a piece full of hope; but soon I heard the whoop again, and it seemed to be behind me, so I turned around and paddled the other way. I had about a notion to try for shore, but I was afraid I’d run into the woods and get lost, so I just went on floating, and soon it was all quiet again, and I didn’t hear no more whoops for a good while.\n\nI floated along, and presently I heard the boom of a cannon, and then I knowed I was in trouble. They was firing cannon over the water to try to make my carcass float up to the top. I was scared, and most wished I was dead. But I didn’t have much time to be thinking, because the next minute I heard a sound that I knowed mighty well—‘twas the sound of oars, and I judged it was a skiff coming. I laid down flat in the canoe and let them go by. I didn’t want to be found, and I didn’t want them to see me. They went by, and I was glad.\n\nThen the fog begun to thin, and I could see a little way on ahead. I went on, and pretty soon I saw a black speck on the water. I raised up and looked at it hard. It was the raft, and Jim was sitting on it, with his head down between his knees, asleep. I hollered, and Jim woke up and looked around, but he didn’t see me. I paddled up and shouted again, and this time he jumped up and come running to the edge of the raft, with his arms outstretched, and I clumb aboard and was mighty glad to get there. Jim grabbed me and hugged me, and he was so glad to see me he nearly cried.\n\nWe talked a while, and then Jim said:\n\n“‘Pears to me, Huck, you’s been gone a mighty long time. I was getting worried about you. I thought maybe you was lost in the fog for good.”\n\nI told him all about it, and he listened close, and then he said:\n\n“Huck, I’s so glad to see you again. I was afeard I was gwine to lose you, honey.”\n\nAnd I felt so mean I couldn’t look him in the face, for I’d been playing a trick on him, making him think I was lost, and it warn’t no joke to him. But I made it up to him, and we was friends again, and I was glad to be back on the raft, with the fog all gone and the sun shining bright, and the river stretching out before us, peaceful and free."

I hain't seen no fog, nor no islands, nor no troubles, nor nothing. I've been setting here talking with you all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago, and I reckon I done the same. You couldn't a got drunk in that time, so of course you've been dreaming.\"\n\n\"Dad fetch it, how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes?\"\n\n\"Well, hang it all, you did dream it, because there didn't any of it happen.\"\n\n\"But, Huck, it's all jis as plain to me as—\"\n\n\"It don't make no difference how plain it is; there ain't nothing in it.

En I hain't ever had no dream b'fo' dat's tired me like dis one.\"\n\n\"Well, that's all right, Jim, as long as you don't get mixed up again that way. Now let’s hear all about the dream, Jim.\"\n\n\"So Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through, just as it happened, only he painted it up considerable. Then he said he had spotted the signs in it, and he said that every time he had a dream that had a tree in it, it was a sign it was going to be a good luck; but if it had a dead tree in it, it was a sign of bad luck. He said the whooping was a sign that we was going to get separated, and the way we got mixed up in the islands was the trouble we was going to get into with the king and the duke, and the tow-head was a sign of a safe place to hide. And he said the fog was a sign of trouble and confusion, and the broken oar was a sign of a close call.

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant portion of the dialogue and narrative that occurs after Huck calls Jim a tangle-headed old fool. Specifically, the entire exchange about the events involving the line, the canoe, the fog, and the confusion about what happened during the night is missing. The passage ends abruptly, cutting off the conversation before it reaches its resolution and the discussion about the dream.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the sequence where Jim questions Huck about specific actions (such as making fast to the tow-head, the line pulling loose, and the raft drifting in the fog).\n- There is no mention of the confusion and distress caused by the fog, the whooping to find each other, or the trouble with the islands.\n- The reflection and discussion about whether the events were a dream or reality, including Jim's contemplation and Huck's reassurance, are absent.\n- The final part where Jim describes the impact of the supposed dream and Huck encourages him to recount it is not present.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of the conversation is mostly accurate up to the point it ends, but it stops prematurely, leaving out the later developments and resolution.\n- There are no invented events, but the lack of the dream discussion and the aftermath creates an incomplete and misleading impression of the original passage's structure and emotional arc.\n\nTo improve, ensure the full exchange is included, especially the detailed questioning about the night's events, the confusion over reality versus dreaming, and the emotional resolution at the end."

            "prefix-probing": "I didn’t want to wake him up just yet, so I set down and watched the river slide by, all smooth and quiet, with the moon making a silver path on the water. The night was still, except for the soft splash of the oar now and then, and the far-off hoot of an owl. I felt easy and safe, like we was the only folks in the world, drifting along in the middle of that big river.\n\nAfter a while, Jim stirred and lifted his head. He looked around, kind of dazed, then saw me and smiled. “Is you been watchin’ out, Huck?” he asked, rubbing his eyes.\n\n“Yes,” I said. “Ain’t nothin’ happened. River’s quiet as can be.”\n\nHe nodded, satisfied, and stretched his arms. “Dis de bes’ time, chile,” he said. “Night-time on de river, when de world’s asleep. Nobody to bodder us, nobody to see us. Jes’ de stars, an’ de water, an’ de moon.”\n\nWe sat there a spell, not saying much, just listening to the sounds of the night. Every now and then a fish would jump, or a log would bump against the raft, but mostly it was just peaceful. I got to thinking about all the things that had happened since we started out—Pap, and the cabin, and the island, and all the adventures we’d had. It seemed like a long time ago, and yet it was only a few weeks.\n\nJim must have been thinking too, because after a while he said, “Huck, I’s pow’ful glad you’s wid me. I couldn’t done it by myself, nohow.”\n\nI didn’t know what to say to that, so I just nodded. I was glad too, though I didn’t say it out loud. Jim was the best friend I had, and I knew I could trust him, no matter what.\n\nThe river kept on flowing, slow and steady, carrying us south. Sometimes we’d see a light on the shore, maybe from a house or a campfire, but mostly it was just darkness and trees. We kept away from the banks, so nobody would spot us. Jim was always careful about that.\n\nAfter a while, Jim said, “We’s gwine to git to Cairo soon, I reckon. Den I kin be free.”\n\nI nodded again, but I felt a little uneasy. I knew helping Jim run away was against the law, and I’d been taught all my life that it was wrong. But it didn’t seem wrong, not with Jim. He was my friend, and I wanted to help him.\n\nWe talked a little more, about what we’d do when we got to Cairo, and how Jim would go up the Ohio River to the free states. He was excited, but also scared. I could tell. I tried to cheer him up, telling him we’d make it all right.\n\nThe night wore on, and the moon got lower in the sky. Jim took the steering-oar again, and I lay down on the raft, using my jacket for a pillow. I watched the stars overhead, thinking about freedom, and friendship, and what was right and wrong. The river rocked me gently, and pretty soon I was asleep, dreaming of far-off places and new adventures."

This addition shifts the focus and introduces a perspective not found in the source passage.\n- The completion omits the transitional description of the weather and the change in visibility on the raft, which is a key structural element in the original.\n- The ending is incomplete, as it does not include Jim's silent departure to the wigwam, which is an important closing action in the original passage.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion does not include the specific moment where Jim insists on interpreting the dream because it was sent as a warning, nor does it capture the initial exchange about the need for interpretation.\n- The completion lacks the detailed explanation of what the various elements (tow-heads, current, whoops, etc.) represent, especially the nuanced warnings and the advice about how to behave with quarrelsome people.\n- The description of the leaves, rubbish, and smashed oar on the raft, and the fact that they are now visible, is missing from the middle of the passage.\n- The completion omits the moment where Jim struggles to separate the dream from reality before delivering his emotional response.\n- The final action of Jim quietly leaving for the wigwam is not included.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes the interpretation of the dream to Jim sitting down and interpreting it as a dream, rather than as a warning, and introduces invented details such as the man with the coat.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the interpretation and the discussion about the trash are not clearly separated, and the transition between them is unclear.\n- The completion introduces a generalization about always getting ready for trouble and Jim's dream always guiding them, which is not part of the original sequence.\n- The dialogue is condensed and some lines are attributed or structured differently than in the original, particularly in the exchange about the meaning of the trash.\n- The emotional impact and the sequence of Jim's realization and response are not as clearly delineated as in the original passage."

He said he’d got out of the cabin and slipped through the woods, and waited for me at the place we always met, but I didn’t come. So he went on a piece, and then he heard the dogs and the men coming, and he was that scared he didn’t know what to do. He said he just made up his mind to take to the river, and he did. But before he got to the raft he heard them coming after him, so he hid in the brush and waited. He said he was so scared his teeth would chatter, and he was afraid they’d hear him. But they didn’t, and by and by they went on by, and he got to the raft at last, and was so glad to see me he could have hugged me to death, he said.\n\nHe told me all about how he’d been living on the raft, and how he’d been afraid to light a fire or show a light, for fear somebody would see it and come after him. He said he’d been living on raw fish and berries, and sometimes he’d get a little cornmeal from the shore, but he didn’t dare go far. He said he’d been mighty lonesome, and wished I’d come, and when he saw me at last he was so glad he didn’t know what to do. He said he’d been watching for me every night, and every time he heard a noise he thought it was me coming.\n\nI told him all about what had happened to me, and how I’d got away from the old man and the widow, and how I’d found him at last. We was both mighty glad to be together again, and we made up our minds we wouldn’t get separated no more. We talked and talked, and Jim said he was going to stick by me, and I said I was going to stick by him, and we shook hands on it. Then we went to work and got some supper, and after that we laid down on the raft and talked till we was sleepy. It was a pretty good night, and we both felt better than we had for a long time."

Every little while he jumps up and says:\n“Dah she is?”\nBut it warn’t. It was Jack-o’-lanterns, or lightning bugs; so he set down again, and went to watching, same as before.

Well, I can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him, because I begun to get it through my head that he was most free—and who was to blame for it? Why, me. I couldn’t get that out of my conscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn’t rest; I couldn’t stay still in one place. It hadn’t ever come home to me before, what this thing was that I was doing. But now it did; and it stayed with me, and scorched me more and more. I tried to make out to myself that I warn’t to blame, because I didn’t run Jim off from his rightful owner; but it warn’t no use, conscience up and says, every time, “But you knowed he was running for his freedom, and you could a paddled ashore and told somebody.” That was so—I couldn’t get around that noway. That was where it pinched. Conscience says to me, “What had poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off right under your eyes and never say one single word? What did that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean? Why, she tried to learn you your book, she tried to learn you your manners, she tried to be good to you every way she knowed how. That’s what she done.”\nI got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead. I fidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim was fidgeting up and down past me. We neither of us could keep still. Every time he danced around and says, “Dah’s Cairo!” it went through me like a shot, and I thought if it was Cairo I reckoned I would die of miserableness.\nJim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself. He was saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when he got enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close to where Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy the two children, and if their master wouldn’t sell them, they’d get an Ab’litionist to go and steal them.\nIt most froze me to hear such talk. He wouldn’t ever dared to talk such talk in his life before. Just see what a difference it made in him the minute he judged he was about free. It was according to the old saying, “Give a nigger an inch and he’ll take an ell.” Thinks I, this is what comes of my not thinking.

            "prefix-probing": "So I set the raft drifting along slow and easy, keeping my eyes peeled for the lights of Cairo. The river was wide and still, and the moon was shining down, making the water look like silver. Jim was sitting up at the front, peering ahead, and every now and then he’d say, “Dey ain’t no lights yit, Huck.”\n\nWe floated on, the night quiet except for the soft slap of the water against the logs. I was getting nervous, thinking maybe we’d missed it, or maybe the river had fooled us again. I kept looking for a sign, any sign, that we was close to Cairo. Jim was anxious, too, because Cairo meant freedom for him. He kept asking, “Huck, you reckon we gwine see it soon?”\n\nI told him to keep watching, and I did the same. After a while, we saw a faint glimmer off in the distance. My heart jumped. “There it is, Jim!” I whispered. We both stared hard, trying to make it out. The light got brighter as we drifted closer, and soon we could see more lights, and the shape of houses along the shore. It had to be Cairo.\n\nWe pulled the raft in toward the bank, tying up in the shadows so nobody would see us. Jim was so excited he could hardly stand still. “Huck, it’s Cairo! I’s free now, honey, I’s free!”\n\nBut I was feeling strange. I knew helping Jim run away was wrong, according to what I’d been taught, but I couldn’t bear the thought of turning him in. Still, my conscience was bothering me something awful. I told Jim to stay put while I went up to the town to see if it really was Cairo.\n\nI crept up the bank, keeping to the shadows, and made my way toward the lights. The town was quiet, most folks asleep, but I could hear a dog barking somewhere and see a lantern swinging on a porch. I walked down the street, trying to look like I belonged, and listened to the talk of a couple of men sitting outside a store.\n\nThey was talking about a runaway slave, and my heart started pounding. One of them said, “He’s bound to come through here, sooner or later. We’ll catch him, you’ll see.”\n\nI slipped away, my mind racing. I couldn’t let them catch Jim. I hurried back to the raft and told Jim what I’d heard. He was scared, but he trusted me. “We got to get out of here, Huck,” he said.\n\nWe untied the raft and pushed off, drifting back into the river’s current. The lights of Cairo faded behind us, and I felt a mix of relief and disappointment. We’d come so close, but it wasn’t safe. Jim was quiet, thinking about what might have been, and I was thinking about what we’d do next.\n\nThe river carried us on, and the night closed in around us. I knew we’d have to keep moving, keep watching, and keep hoping for a better chance. But for now, we was safe, and together, and that was enough.\n\nWe floated on, the stars shining overhead, and the water whispering beneath us. I didn’t know what tomorrow would bring, but I reckoned we’d find a way, somehow. Jim and me, we was in it together, come what may."

My conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I says to it, “Let up on me—it ain’t too late yet—I’ll paddle ashore at the first light and tell.” I felt easy and happy and light as a feather right off. All my troubles was gone. I went to looking out sharp for a light, and sort of singing to myself. By-and-by one showed. Jim sings out:\n“We’s safe, Huck, we’s safe! Jump up and crack yo’ heels! Dat’s de good ole Cairo at las’, I jis knows it!”\nI says:\n“I’ll take the canoe and go and see, Jim. It mightn’t be, you know.”\nHe jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his old coat in the bottom for me to set on, and give me the paddle; and as I shoved off, he says:\n“Pooty soon I’ll be a-shout’n’ for joy, en I’ll say, it’s all on accounts o’ Huck; I’s a free man, en I couldn’t ever ben free ef it hadn’ ben for Huck; Huck done it. Jim won’t ever forgit you, Huck; you’s de bes’ fren’ Jim’s ever had; en you’s de only fren’ ole Jim’s got now.”\nI was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he says this, it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me. I went along slow then, and I warn’t right down certain whether I was glad I started or whether I warn’t. When I was fifty yards off, Jim says:\n“Dah you goes, de ole true Huck; de on’y white genlman dat ever kep’ his promise to ole Jim.”\nWell, I just felt sick. But I says, I got to do it—I can’t get out of it. Right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns, and they stopped and I stopped. One of them says:\n“What’s that yonder?”\n“A piece of a raft,” I says.\n“Do you belong on it?”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“Any men on it?”\n“Only one, sir.”\n“Well, there’s five niggers run off to-night up yonder, above the head of the bend. Is your man white or black?”\nI didn’t answer up prompt. I tried to, but the words wouldn’t come. I tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it, but I warn’t man enough—hadn’t the spunk of a rabbit. I see I was weakening; so I just give up trying, and up and says:\n“He’s white.”\n“I reckon we’ll go and see for ourselves.”\n“I wish you would,” says I, “because it’s pap that’s there, and maybe you’d help me tow the raft ashore where the light is. He’s sick—and so is mam and Mary Ann.”\n“Oh, the devil! we’re in a hurry, boy. But I s’pose we’ve got to. Come, buckle to your paddle, and let’s get along.”\nI buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars. When we had made a stroke or two, I says:\n“Pap’ll be mighty much obleeged to you, I can tell you. Everybody goes away when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore, and I can’t do it by myself.”\n“Well, that’s infernal mean. Odd, too. Say, boy, what’s the matter with your father?”\n“It’s the—a—the—well, it ain’t anything much.”\nThey stopped pulling. It warn’t but a mighty little ways to the raft now. One says:\n“Boy, that’s a lie. What is the matter with your pap? Answer up square now, and it’ll be the better for you.”\n“I will, sir, I will, honest—but don’t leave us, please. It’s the—the—gentlemen, if you’ll only pull ahead, and let me heave you the headline, you won’t have to come a-near the raft—please do.”\n“Set her back, John, set her back!” says one. They backed water. “Keep away, boy—keep to looard. Confound it, I just expect the wind has blowed it to us. Your pap’s got the small-pox, and you know it precious well. Why didn’t you come out and say so? Do you want to spread it all over?”\n“Well,” says I, a-blubbering, “I’ve told everybody before, and they just went away and left us.”\n“Poor devil, there’s something in that. We are right down sorry for you, but we—well, hang it, we don’t want the small-pox, you see. Look here, I’ll tell you what to do. Don’t you try to land by yourself, or you’ll smash everything to pieces. You float along down about twenty miles, and you’ll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river. It will be long after sun-up then, and when you ask for help you tell them your folks are all down with chills and fever. Don’t be a fool again, and let people guess what is the matter. Now we’re trying to do you a kindness; so you just put twenty miles between us, that’s a good boy. It wouldn’t do any good to land yonder where the light is—it’s only a wood-yard. Say, I reckon your father’s poor, and I’m bound to say he’s in pretty hard luck. Here, I’ll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this board, and you get it when it floats by. I feel mighty mean to leave you; but my kingdom! it won’t do to fool with small-pox, don’t you see?”\n“Hold on, Parker,” says the other man, “here’s a twenty to put on the board for me. Good-bye, boy; you do as Mr. Parker told you, and you’ll be all right.”\n“That’s so, my boy—good-bye, good-bye. If you see any runaway niggers you get help and nab them, and you can make some money by it.”",

            "prefix-probing": "I was sorry to hear Jim say that, it was such a lowering of him. I never thought he would stoop to such a thing, but I reckon a body can’t help the way he’s made. I didn’t say nothing for a while, but just sat there thinking. The river was all quiet, and the moon was shining down on the water, making it look like silver. Jim was sitting with his back against the cottonwood, his arms folded, and his head bent down. I could see he was feeling bad, and I felt bad, too, for him.\n\nAfter a while, I says:\n\n\"Jim, you wouldn’t really do that, would you? You wouldn’t turn on your own people?\"\n\nJim didn’t answer right away. He just kept looking at the water, and I could see his eyes shining in the moonlight. Then he says, kind of slow:\n\n\"Huck, I’s been a slave all my life. I never had nothin’ of my own, not even my own self. But now, I’s free, and I wants to stay free. I can’t go back, Huck. I can’t.\"\n\nI didn’t know what to say. I felt like I ought to help him, but I was scared, too. I knew what folks would say if they found out I was helping a runaway slave. They’d call me a low-down Abolitionist and despise me. But I couldn’t help it. Jim was my friend, and I couldn’t let him down.\n\nWe sat there a long time, not saying nothing. The night was still, and the only sound was the water lapping against the raft. After a while, Jim says:\n\n\"Huck, you’s the only white genl’man dat ever kep’ his word to ole Jim. I ain’t never fergit dat.\"\n\nThat made me feel kind of proud, but also kind of sad. I didn’t want Jim to think I was better than him, just because I was white. I wanted him to know I was his friend, no matter what.\n\nSo I says:\n\n\"Jim, I ain’t no better than you. We’re in this together, and I ain’t going to let nothing happen to you.\"\n\nJim looked at me, and I could see he was about to cry. He reached out and took my hand, and we sat there like that for a long time, not saying nothing.\n\nAfter a while, the moon went behind a cloud, and it got real dark. I could hear the frogs croaking and the owls hooting in the woods. It made me feel kind of lonesome, but also kind of safe, knowing Jim was there with me.\n\nWe finally laid down on the raft and tried to get some sleep. I couldn’t sleep much, though. I kept thinking about what Jim had said, and about what we was going to do next. I knew we had to keep moving, or somebody would catch us. But I didn’t know where we was going, or what would happen to us.\n\nThe next morning, we got up early and started down the river again. The sun was just coming up, and the mist was rising off the water. It was real pretty, and I felt better than I had the night before.\n\nJim made some coffee and fried some bacon, and we ate breakfast on the raft. After we finished, Jim says:\n\n\"Huck, we’s got to be careful. Dey’s folks lookin’ for us, I knows it.\"\n\nI nodded. I knew he was right. We had to keep our eyes open and stay out of sight as much as we could.\n\nWe floated down the river all day, keeping close to the shore and hiding in the willows whenever we saw a boat coming. Sometimes we’d see people fishing or working in the fields, but we didn’t talk to nobody. We just kept to ourselves and minded our own business.\n\nThat night, we found a little island and tied up the raft. We built a small fire and cooked some supper. After we ate, Jim got out his old banjo and started playing a tune. It was a sad song, but it made me feel good to hear it. It reminded me of home, and of all the good times I’d had with Jim.\n\nWe sat there by the fire, listening to the music and watching the stars. I felt like we was the only two people in the world, and I was glad to have Jim for company.\n\nAfter a while, Jim stopped playing and looked at me.\n\n\"Huck, you ever think ‘bout what you’s gonna do when we gets to Cairo?\"\n\nI shook my head. I hadn’t thought that far ahead. I was just trying to get through each day, one at a time.\n\n\"I don’t know, Jim. I reckon I’ll just keep going. Maybe I’ll head out West, or maybe I’ll go back home. I ain’t sure.\"\n\nJim nodded. \"I’s gonna try to get my family back. If I can get to a free state, maybe I can buy ‘em, or maybe dey’ll come to me. I don’t know, but I’s got to try.\"\n\nI could see how much it meant to him, and I wanted to help him if I could. But I didn’t know how. All I could do was stick by him and hope for the best.\n\nWe sat there a while longer, talking about our plans and dreams. Then we laid down and went to sleep, with the fire burning low and the river flowing by.\n\nThe next few days went by pretty much the same. We floated down the river during the day, hiding from people and keeping out of sight. At night, we’d find a place to camp and cook our supper. Sometimes Jim would play his banjo, and sometimes we’d just sit and talk.\n\nOne night, we heard a noise in the woods. Jim grabbed his banjo and I grabbed my gun. We listened real close, but we couldn’t hear nothing else. After a while, we figured it was just an animal, and we went back to our fire.\n\nBut it made me nervous, knowing there could be people out there looking for us. I knew we had to be careful, or we’d get caught.\n\nStill, I was glad to have Jim with me. He was the best friend I ever had, and I wasn’t going to let nothing happen to him if I could help it."

He said twenty mile more warn’t far for the raft to go, but he wished we was already there.\nTowards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular about hiding the raft good.

The original contains a detailed sequence of thoughts about morality and the difficulty of doing right versus wrong, which is condensed and partially missing in the completion.\n- The completion invents a reflective closing paragraph where the protagonist sits and thinks, which is not present in the original passage.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The original includes a step-by-step internal monologue where the protagonist questions whether doing the right thing would have made him feel better, and concludes with a decision about future behavior. This nuanced reasoning is only briefly summarized in the completion and lacks the progression of thought present in the original.\n- The completion omits the specific dialogue where the protagonist calls for Jim and Jim responds from his hiding place, as well as the details of Jim's hiding spot and his actions while the men were present.\n- The original describes the actions taken towards daybreak, including tying up the raft and Jim's careful preparations for leaving, which are only briefly mentioned or skipped in the completion.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately states the amount of money as forty dollars, whereas the original specifies a different amount.\n- The sequence of events is altered: in the completion, Jim boards the raft and immediately expresses gratitude, whereas in the original, there is a more detailed exchange about Jim's hiding and the protagonist's reassurance before Jim boards.\n- The completion attributes a promise to the protagonist that is not present in the original passage.\n- The completion condenses or alters the timeline, making it seem as if all events happen in quick succession, whereas the original provides a clearer progression from night to daybreak and then to the day's activities."

When he was out of sight, I slipped back to the raft as quick as I could, keeping to the shadows and listening for any sound that might mean trouble.\n\nJim was waiting for me, crouched low and looking scared. “What did he say, Huck?” he whispered.\n\n“Nothing much,” I said, trying to sound calm. “He just wanted to know if I’d seen any runaway niggers.

Well, I can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him, because I begun to get it through my head that he was most free—and who was to blame for it? Why, me. I couldn't get that out of my conscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn't rest; I couldn't stay still in one place. It hadn't ever come home to me before, what this thing was that I was doing. But now it did; and it stayed with me, and scorched me more and more. My conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I says to it, \"Let up on me—it ain't too late yet—I'll paddle ashore at the first light and tell.\"\n\nI was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he says, \"Dah's de ole true Huck; de on'y white genlman dat ever kep' his promise to ole Jim,\" I just couldn't do it.

So I reckoned I wouldn't bother no more about it, but after this always do whichever come handiest at the time.\n\nI went to sleep, and Jim didn't call me when it was my turn. He often done that. When I waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees, moaning and mourning to himself. I didn't take notice nor let on. I knowed what it was about.

                "text": "That night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down in a left-hand bend. I went off in the canoe to ask about it. Pretty soon I found a man out in a skiff, setting a trot-line. I ranged up and says:\n\n\"Mister, is that town Cairo?\"\n\n\"Cairo? No. You must be a blame' fool.\"\n\n\"What town is it, mister?\"\n\n\"If you want to know, go and find out. If you stay here botherin' around me for half a minute longer, you'll get something you won't want.\"\n\nI paddled to the raft. Jim was awful disappointed, but I said never mind, Cairo would be the next place, I reckoned.\n\nWe passed another town before daylight, and I was going out again; but it was high ground, so I didn't go. No high ground about Cairo, Jim said.\n\nI was beginning to get uneasy. I couldn't tell whether we were getting up the right place or not. So I made up my mind I wouldn't borrow no more trouble. I reckoned if Cairo was passed, it was, and if it warn't, it warn't. But I was getting uneasy all the same.\n\nJim said it made him all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom. Well, I can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him, because I begun to get it through my head that he was most free—and who was to blame for it? Why, me. I couldn't get that out of my conscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn't rest; I couldn't stay still in one place. It hadn't ever come home to me before, what this thing was that I was doing. But now it did; and it stayed with me, and scorched me more and more. My conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I says to it, \"Let up on me—it ain't too late yet—I'll paddle ashore at the first light and tell.\"\n\nI was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he says, \"Dah's de ole true Huck; de on'y white genlman dat ever kep' his promise to ole Jim,\" I just couldn't do it. I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead.\n\nI tried to think up some way to get out of having to tell, but I couldn't. So I just set there and thought and thought; and pretty soon I says to myself, \"Hold on—s'pose you'd a done right and give Jim up, would you felt better than what you do now?\" No, says I, I'd feel bad—I'd feel just the same way I do now. Well, then, says I, what's the use you learning to do right, when it's troublesome to do right and ain't no trouble to do wrong, and the wages is just the same? I was stuck. I couldn't answer that. So I reckoned I wouldn't bother no more about it, but after this always do whichever come handiest at the time.\n\nI went to sleep, and Jim didn't call me when it was my turn. He often done that. When I waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees, moaning and mourning to himself. I didn't take notice nor let on. I knowed what it was about. He was thinking about his wife and his children, away up yonder, and he was low and homesick; because he hadn't ever been away from home before in his life; and I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white folks does for their'n.

The river was wide and still, and the moon was just coming up, laying a silver path across the water. Jim and I didn’t say much; we just listened to the night sounds—the frogs and the soft lap of the water against the logs. I felt a kind of shiver, not from the cold, but from the excitement of being near a town again, with all its people and noise and things going on.\n\nAs we drifted closer, we could make out the shapes of houses and the steeple of a church, white against the dark sky. There was a ferryboat tied up at the landing, and now and then we could hear a dog barking or a door slamming somewhere. I wondered what kind of folks lived there, and if they would be friendly or not. Jim was uneasy, too. He kept peering through the willows, whispering that we ought to keep out of sight, for fear of being seen.\n\n\"We better tie up, Huck,\" he said, his voice low. \"Don’t want nobody to see us, ‘specially not at night.\"\n\nI agreed, so we paddled the raft into a little cove, where the trees hung low over the water. We tied up and sat there, listening. After a while, I got curious and said I was going to slip into town and see what was going on. Jim didn’t like it, but I told him I’d be careful and not let anybody see me.\n\nI put on my old straw hat and slipped off the raft, wading through the mud and weeds until I reached the edge of the town. The streets were quiet, with only a few lamps burning in the windows. I crept along the fences, keeping to the shadows, and peeped into a couple of yards. I saw a man sitting on a porch, smoking a pipe, and a woman coming out to hang up a lantern. It all looked peaceful enough, but I knew better than to trust appearances.\n\nI wandered down to the general store, where a couple of loafers were sitting on a bench, talking low. I couldn’t make out what they were saying, but I caught the words \"runaway nigger\" and \"reward.\" My heart jumped into my throat. I slipped away quick, not wanting to hear any more. I knew they must be talking about Jim.\n\nI hurried back to the raft, my mind racing. Jim was waiting, his eyes wide with worry. I told him what I’d heard, and he said we’d better get out of there before daylight. So we untied the raft and pushed off, letting the current carry us away from the town and its dangers. The river was our friend again, hiding us in its wide, dark arms as we floated on into the night."

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces a reflective conversation about the snake-skin and a discussion about luck that is not present in the original at this point in the narrative. This is an invented scene and shifts the focus away from the sequence of events in the original.\n- The ending of the completion adds a description of the aftermath, including the raft spinning, a piece flying up, and both characters swimming for shore, which is not part of the original passage. This is an invented extension beyond the original endpoint.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the specific atmospheric description comparing the night’s conditions to fog, which is a key detail in the original’s setting.\n- The original includes a detailed depiction of the steamboat’s appearance, especially the visual of the furnace doors and the effect they create, which is only partially captured in the completion.\n- The sequence of sounds and actions as the steamboat approaches, such as the specific order of yelling, bell ringing, cussing, and steam whistling, is not fully represented.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately describes the direction and behavior of the steamboat, confusing up-stream and down-stream navigation compared to the original.\n- The sequence of events is altered: in the original, the steamboat’s approach and the characters’ reactions are more tightly connected, while the completion introduces additional commentary and changes the order of actions.\n- The completion attributes dialogue and actions to the pilot that are not present in the original, such as the pilot calling out specific phrases.\n- The timing and manner of the characters leaving the raft are described differently, with added details about the raft’s destruction and their swimming, which do not match the original passage’s conclusion."

I was in a sweat to find him, but I didn’t know which way to go. I was just going to start when I heard a sound away over the water. I listened. Away off in the night I heard somebody yell, and it sounded like Jim’s voice. I sung out, “Hello!” and he answered, “Hello, honey, is dat you?” and I says, “It’s me, Jim, we’re safe now.” We was mighty glad to get together again. We talked, and had a good time, and we was so hungry we had to stop and eat. Jim said he was scared, but he reckoned it was all right now. We paddled along, and talked, and talked, and then we laid down on the raft and let her float. We didn’t have no accidents, and we didn’t see no steamboats. We made a good deal of way that night, and we was pretty tired, and went to sleep and didn’t wake up till about break of day. The raft was in a good place, and Jim was up and gone for wood. I got up and stretched my legs, and looked around. I see a big old-fashioned double log house on a hill, about a quarter of a mile off in the woods. I was going to pass by, but all of a sudden a pack of dogs come bounding out, barking and howling, and I was a goner, for I couldn’t move for them.",

I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of my nose, and puffed a bit.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents a lengthy reunion and conversation between the narrator and Jim that does not occur in the original passage. This includes invented dialogue, a description of eating together, and a sequence where they paddle and rest on the raft, which is not present in the source material.\n- The completion omits the entire process of the narrator grabbing a plank, striking out for shore, and navigating the current, which is a significant part of the original sequence.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the description of the narrator realizing the direction of the current and adjusting his course accordingly, which is a key step in the original.\n- The details about the crossing being long and slanting, and the effort and time it took to reach the shore, are missing.\n- The passage through rough ground after landing and before encountering the house is omitted.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion has the narrator and Jim reuniting and spending time together before the encounter with the house, whereas in the original, the narrator is alone during this segment.\n- The completion introduces inaccurate time details, such as waking up at daybreak and Jim being gone for wood, which are not part of the original passage at this point.\n- The description of the house’s location and the approach to it is inaccurate; the original specifies the house is encountered unexpectedly after traveling over rough ground, not seen from a distance on a hill.\n- The reaction to the dogs is also altered, with the completion suggesting immediate immobilization, rather than the more cautious response in the original."

Then I was pretty sure I’d got to a good place, and I made up my mind I wouldn’t budge till daylight. I set there and watched the daylight come, and I see the steamboat was gone away down the river. I was feeling pretty good, and all at once I heard a voice, and it was Jim’s! I was ever so glad to see him. I warn’t lonesome now. I told him how I’d been a-watching the raft go by, and he said he’d been a-watching the same thing. We talked about what we’d do, and Jim said we’d better keep out of sight till night, and then slide down the river again. So we laid low all day, and the next night we shoved out and drifted down a ways, and tied up, and laid down to sleep. But we didn’t have no luck, for people was always after us, and we had to keep moving. Sometimes we’d get a little rest, but mostly we was on the watch. It warn’t no use to try to land in the daytime, because they’d see us. So we just kept drifting, and hoping for the best, and watching out for trouble."

Buck, take this little stranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him up in some of yours that’s dry.\"\n\nBuck looked about as old as me—thirteen or fourteen or along there, though he was a little bigger than me.

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant portion of the original sequence where the old gentleman locks, bars, and bolts the door after letting the narrator in. This action is important for establishing the family's sense of caution and security.\n- The completion invents dialogue and actions not present in the original, such as the oldest man asking, \"let’s have a look at him,\" and the narrator being told to have supper before changing clothes, which alters the flow and focus of the scene.\n- The completion introduces invented exchanges between Buck and Bob, and between Buck and the old man, that do not appear in the original passage. It also adds a scene where Buck and the narrator go upstairs to change, which is not described in the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the detailed description of the family moving into the parlor, the mention of the new rag carpet, and their positioning in a corner out of the range of the front windows. These details help set the scene and convey the family's wariness.\n- The process of the old man searching the narrator for weapons is less detailed, missing the explanation that he only feels outside the narrator's pockets.\n- The original includes a sequence where the old lady instructs Betsy to get food and one of the girls to wake Buck, followed by Buck's entrance. The completion condenses or skips these steps, losing the sense of household activity and concern.\n- The original contains a brief exchange about the Shepherdsons and a joke about Buck's slowness, which is missing or altered in the completion.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes dialogue and actions, such as having the oldest man speak lines that belong to the old gentleman, and changing the order in which characters speak and act.\n- The sequence of events is altered: in the original, Buck is called for and enters after the old lady's instructions, while in the completion, Buck is already present and the dialogue is rearranged.\n- The completion introduces incorrect motivations and responses for Buck, such as his reluctance to alert the family and his claim of having seen the narrator come in, which are not present in the original.\n- The completion changes the order of providing food and dry clothes, and adds invented details about going upstairs to change, which do not match the original passage's structure."

What are you doing in my house at this hour?\" he says, his voice deep and commanding. I swallowed hard, trying to think up a story quick, for I knew if I told the truth, I’d be in a peck of trouble. The old lady, she looked at me with a kind of worried look, and the two young women peeped out from behind her, their faces pale in the candlelight.\n\nI stammered, \"Please, sir, I—I didn’t mean no harm. I was just—just looking for a place to stay the night.\"\n\nThe old gentleman frowned, but the old lady stepped forward, her voice gentle. \"Poor child, you look half starved. Where’s your people?\"\n\nI shook my head, trying to look as pitiful as I could. \"Ain’t got none, ma’am. Been traveling a long way.\"\n\nThe men lowered their guns a little, but didn’t take their eyes off me. The old gentleman said, \"Well, you can’t just go sneaking into folks’ houses. That’s a good way to get yourself shot.\"\n\n\"I know, sir,\" I said, \"but I was desperate. I ain’t had nothing to eat since yesterday.\"\n\nThe old lady’s heart seemed to melt at that, and she turned to the men. \"Put those guns down, you see he’s just a boy.\"\n\nReluctantly, the men did as she said, though they still watched me close. The old lady came over and put her hand on my shoulder. \"Come into the kitchen, child, and let’s get you something to eat.\"\n\nI followed her, feeling mighty relieved, but still wary. The kitchen was warm and smelled of fresh bread. She set me down at the table and gave me a big glass of milk and a plate of cold ham and biscuits. I ate like I hadn’t seen food in a week, and all the while the family watched me, asking questions about where I came from and where I was going.\n\nI spun them a tale about being an orphan, traveling to find my uncle in Arkansas. The old gentleman nodded, seeming to believe me, and the old lady patted my hand. \"You can stay the night, but in the morning, we’ll see about getting you on your way.\"\n\nI thanked them, feeling safe for the first time in days, but I knew I’d have to be careful. I couldn’t let on who I really was, or what I was up to. But for now, I was warm and fed, and that was enough."

He said he reckoned the old man was going to try to run one next winter, if he could get a schoolmaster; but he didn’t know whether he’d like it or not. He said there was some good places to go hunting, and he’d show me, and if I wanted to, he’d take me to his dog. He said his dog was a good dog, and he reckoned I’d like him.

Then we went down-stairs to supper, and there was a big table, and the old man and the old woman and the two young women and Buck and me. The old man, he said grace; then we all set down and begun to eat. The two young women had on big, long, white aprons, and their hair was tied up in nets. Betsy and some of the other niggers waited on the table. There was everything you could think of for breakfast, and plenty of it, too.\n\nI hadn’t ever eaten things so good, and I asked Buck what the name of the place was. He said it was the Grangerfords, and his folks’ name was Grangerford. He said there was a mess of them—thirty-six, and all of them at home but two. He said the old man was Colonel Grangerford, and he was very rich, and kept a lot of niggers, and had a lot of farms, and over a hundred horses. He said there was a lot of feuds there, and they was always a-killing each other, but he didn’t know what the row was about. He said his father was a man that everybody respected, and he was a good man, and he was kind to everybody, and he was very particular about who his children associated with, and he didn’t have no patience with people who weren’t honest and upright.\n\nWhile we was at supper, the old man and the old woman and the two young women and Buck and me set at the table, and the old man, he said grace, and then we all set to. The two young women had on big, long, white aprons, and their hair was tied up in nets. Betsy and some of the other niggers waited on the table. After supper, Buck and me set up and talked, and I told him a long story about my family, and how they all died but me, and how I come to be alone. I said my father and mother was dead, and my brothers and sisters was all dead, and I was the only one left, and I was going up the river to see if I couldn’t do something for myself. I told him I fell overboard off of a steamboat, and that was how I come to be there. Buck said he was sorry for me, and the old man and the old woman said I could stay there as long as I wanted to.\n\nBy and by it was getting-up time, and everybody went to bed, and I went up to Buck’s room and went to bed with him. We hadn’t been asleep but a little while when I woke up and couldn’t remember what name I had told them when they asked me.",

He said he would take care of me, and if anybody wanted to hurt me, they would have to get up early in the morning. He got out some clean clothes, and I put them on, feeling mighty comfortable after all the rough times I’d had. The room was small but neat, with a bed in the corner and a little table by the window. Tom—he said his name was Tom—sat down on the bed and watched me while I changed.\n\nAfter I was dressed, Tom said, “Now, Huck, you can stay here as long as you want. Nobody’ll bother you. My aunt and uncle are away for a few days, so we’ve got the place to ourselves.”\n\nI thanked him, and we sat and talked for a while. Tom was full of plans and ideas, always thinking up something new to do. He said we ought to have some adventures, just like in the books. I told him I’d had enough adventures to last me a while, but he just laughed and said that was the best time to have more.\n\nWe went down to the kitchen and found some cold meat and bread, and made ourselves a meal. Tom said we could go fishing in the morning, or maybe explore the woods behind the house. I liked the sound of that, and said so.\n\nAfter we ate, we went back up to the room. Tom showed me some of his treasures—a brass button, a piece of glass that looked like a diamond, and a little wooden box with a secret compartment. He said he’d found most of them down by the river, or in the woods. I told him about some of the things I’d seen on my travels, and he listened with big eyes, asking questions and making me tell every little detail.\n\nIt was getting late, so Tom said we ought to go to bed. He gave me a blanket and a pillow, and I made myself comfortable on the floor. The window was open, and I could hear the crickets and frogs outside. It was peaceful, and I felt safe for the first time in a long while.\n\nBefore we went to sleep, Tom said, “Huck, I’m glad you’re here. It gets lonely sometimes, with just me and the folks. We’ll have a good time, you’ll see.”\n\nI said I was glad too, and meant it. I lay there in the dark, listening to the sounds of the night, and thinking about all that had happened. I didn’t know what tomorrow would bring, but for now, I was content. I had a friend, a safe place to sleep, and a full belly. That was enough for me.\n\nAs I drifted off to sleep, I thought about the river, and the raft, and Jim. I wondered where he was, and if he was safe. I hoped I’d see him again soon. But for now, I was just Huck Finn, in a strange house, with a new friend, and a world of adventures waiting outside the window."

There warn’t no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heaps of parlors in towns has beds in them. There was a big fireplace that was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes they wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown, same as they do in town. They had big brass dog-irons that could hold up a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece, with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front, and a round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see the pendulum swinging behind it. It was beautiful to hear that clock tick; and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her up and got her in good shape, she would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she got tuckered out. They wouldn’t took any money for her.\nWell, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock, made out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy. By one of the parrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other; and when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn’t open their mouths nor look different nor interested. They squeaked through underneath. There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out behind those things. On the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier than real ones is, but they warn’t real because you could see where pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever it was, underneath.\nThis table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and blue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around. It come all the way from Philadelphia, they said. There was some books, too, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table. One was a big family Bible full of pictures. One was Pilgrim’s Progress, about a man that left his family, it didn’t say why. I read considerable in it now and then. The statements was interesting, but tough. Another was Friendship’s Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn’t read the poetry. Another was Henry Clay’s Speeches, and another was Dr. Gunn’s Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body was sick or dead. There was a hymn book, and a lot of other books.

On each corner of the table were piles of books: a big family Bible with pictures, ‘Pilgrim’s Progress’—which I tried to read but found tough going—‘Friendship’s Offering,’ ‘Henry Clay’s Speeches,’ ‘Dr. Gunn’s Family Medicine,’ and a hymn book. The chairs were split-bottomed and sturdy, not a one of them broken or wobbly. Everything in that room made you feel like folks there took pride in their home and wanted it to look its best.\n```\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThis segment closely follows the provided summary and opening line, emulating Huck’s narrative style and focusing on the specific details and observations he makes about the Grangerford house in \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,\" Chapter XVII.

            "prefix-probing": "The house was big and white, with great broad porches, and the yard was full of big shade trees and flowers, and the grass was as thick and soft as a carpet. There was a garden, too, with rows of vegetables and fruit trees, and a big barn out back. Everything looked clean and well cared for, and it made me feel kind of strange, because I wasn’t used to such fine living. The folks that lived there was the Grangerfords, and they was about the nicest people I ever met. They took me in and treated me like I was one of the family, and I felt right at home.\n\nColonel Grangerford was a tall man, with a kind face and a gentle way of speaking. He wore a white linen suit and a broad-brimmed hat, and he always had a smile for everybody. His wife was just as nice, and their children was all well-mannered and friendly. There was Bob, the oldest boy, and Tom, and then there was Miss Charlotte, who was about my age, and Miss Sophia, who was a little older. They all made me feel welcome, and I liked them right off.\n\nThe house was full of curious things, too. There was pictures on the walls, and shelves full of books, and a big piano in the parlor. There was a clock that struck every hour, and a big fireplace with a mantelpiece covered with little ornaments and keepsakes. I spent a lot of time just looking at everything, and it seemed like there was always something new to see.\n\nOne thing I noticed was that the Grangerfords was mighty proud people. They had a lot of land, and a lot of slaves, and they lived in style. But they wasn’t stuck up or mean about it. They treated their slaves well, and they was always polite to strangers. I liked that about them.\n\nBut there was one thing that made me uneasy. The Grangerfords had a feud with another family, the Shepherdsons. It had been going on for years, and nobody seemed to know how it started. Both families was always on the lookout for trouble, and they carried guns everywhere they went. It seemed kind of foolish to me, but I didn’t say nothing about it.\n\nOne day, Miss Sophia asked me to do her a favor. She wanted me to go over to the church and fetch her a Testament she had left there. I didn’t think nothing of it, so I went and got it for her. When I brought it back, she seemed real nervous, and she thanked me in a whisper. I wondered what was going on, but I didn’t ask.\n\nLater that day, I found out that Miss Sophia had run off with one of the Shepherdsons. It caused a big stir, and there was a lot of shooting and yelling. Some of the Grangerfords got killed, and I had to run for my life. I found Jim hiding in the woods, and we was both glad to be together again. We got back on the raft and floated down the river, leaving all that trouble behind us. I felt bad for the Grangerfords, but I was glad to be free again, with nothing but the river ahead of us."

          "text_segment": "They had pictures hung on the walls—mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes, and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called “Signing the Declaration.” There was some that they called crayons, which one of the daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen years old. They was different from any pictures I ever see before—blacker, mostly, than is common. One was a woman in a slim black dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule, and underneath the picture it said “Shall I Never See Thee More Alas.” Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath the picture it said “I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.” There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath the picture it said “And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.” These was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn’t somehow seem to take to them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the fan-tods. Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done what they had lost. But I reckoned that with her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard. She was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it done, but she never got the chance. It was a picture of a young woman in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up towards the moon—and the idea was to see which pair would look best, and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung flowers on it. Other times it was hid with a little curtain. The young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me.\nThis young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the Presbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her own head. It was very good poetry. This is what she wrote about a boy by the name of Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded:\nODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC’D\n\nAnd did young Stephen sicken,\n    And did young Stephen die?\nAnd did the sad hearts thicken,\n    And did the mourners cry?\n\nNo; such was not the fate of\n    Young Stephen Dowling Bots;\nThough sad hearts round him thickened,\n    ’Twas not from sickness’ shots.\n\nNo whooping-cough did rack his frame,\n    Nor measles drear with spots;\nNot these impaired the sacred name\n    Of Stephen Dowling Bots.\n\nDespised love struck not with woe\n    That head of curly knots,\nNor stomach troubles laid him low,\n    Young Stephen Dowling Bots.\n\nO no. Then list with tearful eye,\n    Whilst I his fate do tell.\nHis soul did from this cold world fly\n    By falling down a well.\n\nThey got him out and emptied him;\n    Alas it was too late;\nHis spirit was gone for to sport aloft\n    In the realms of the good and great.\nIf Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was fourteen, there ain’t no telling what she could a done by-and-by. Buck said she could rattle off poetry like nothing. She didn’t ever have to stop to think. He said she would slap down a line, and if she couldn’t find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down another one, and go ahead. She warn’t particular; she could write about anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful. Every time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died, she would be on hand with her “tribute” before he was cold. She called them tributes. The neighbors said it was the doctor first, then Emmeline, then the undertaker—the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once, and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person’s name, which was Whistler. She warn’t ever the same after that; she never complained, but she kinder pined away and did not live long. Poor thing, many’s the time I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been aggravating me and I had soured on her a little. I liked all that family, dead ones and all, and warn’t going to let anything come between us. Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was alive, and it didn’t seem right that there warn’t nobody to make some about her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two myself, but I couldn’t seem to make it go somehow. They kept Emmeline’s room trim and nice, and all the things fixed in it just the way she liked to have them when she was alive, and nobody ever slept there. The old lady took care of the room herself, though there was plenty of niggers, and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there mostly.",

She drew a picture of a young woman in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge, all ready to jump off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, and with the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up towards the moon—and the hair all down her back, and she was crying, and the moon was shining, and the water under the bridge was dashing along, and the whole thing was just as natural as could be, and she had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me.\n\nThis was all done with crayon, like the rest.

He said she didn’t ever have to stop to think. He said she would slap down a line, and if she couldn’t find anything to rhyme with it, she would just scratch it out and slap down another one, and go ahead. She warn’t particular; she could write about anything you choose to give her to write about, just so it was sadful. Every time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died, she would be on hand with her \"tribute\" before he was cold. She called them tributes.

The frames was all gilt and looked splendid, because they was new, and the carpets was new, and the furniture was new, and they had a big brass dog on the hearth, and a big brass andirons, and a big brass fender. The dog was a real curiosity, and so was the andirons. I never see such a house. It was all so nice and genteel; and the ladies—well, I had never seen anything so fine. They had books, too, piled up everywhere, and a big Bible on the table, and a big family album, and a book of poetry, and all kinds of reading matter. There was a piano, and a big looking-glass, and the windows had beautiful curtains, and the chairs had cushions, and everything was just so. I felt mighty small, and sort of out of place, but I warn’t going to let on, not if I could help it.\n\nMiss Sophia she took me up stairs to show me a room. Everything was spick and span, and the bed was made up high, like a steamboat; and there was a little wash-stand, and a pitcher and basin, and a soap and a towel, and a comb and a brush, and a looking-glass. She set down on the bed and talked with me a while, and asked me all about where I come from, and what my name was, and how I got along, and if I liked it there, and all that kind of stuff. She was mighty good to me, and I liked her ever so much. I told her I was orphaned, and she said she was sorry for me, and she said the family would do what they could for me, and I must make myself at home and not be afraid. She said she had a brother named Buck, and he was about my age, and she reckoned we’d get along together first-rate.\n\nBy and by she went out, and Buck he come in and talked with me a while. He was a mighty good boy, and I liked him right off. He said he’d show me around the place, and we went out in the yard. It was a big yard, with a garden, and a lot of flowers, and a big orchard, and a pasture, and a wood-lot, and a big barn. There was horses and cows and pigs and chickens, and everything you could think of. Buck said they had a lot of dogs, too, and he showed me some of them. They was all friendly, and come up and wagged their tails and wanted to be petted.\n\nBuck said there was another family living close by, and they was always quarreling with his folks, and sometimes they had fights. He said it was a kind of feud, and it had been going on for years and years. He said he didn’t know what started it, but it was just the way things was. He said his father and his brothers was all good shots, and so was the other family, and sometimes they had to be careful when they went out, for fear of being shot at. I thought it was a mighty strange way to live, but I didn’t say nothing.\n\nAfter a while we went back in the house, and they had supper. It was a big supper, with all kinds of good things to eat, and everybody was there, and they all talked and laughed and had a good time. I felt right at home, and I liked them all. After supper we sat around and talked, and then they had some music. Miss Sophia played the piano, and one of the girls sang, and it was mighty pretty. I never heard anything like it before.\n\nBy and by it was time to go to bed, and Buck showed me to my room. It was a nice room, with a big bed, and a window that looked out over the yard. I got undressed and went to bed, and pretty soon I was sound asleep. I dreamed about the family, and the feud, and all the things I had seen that day. It was a mighty good place to be, and I was glad I had found it.\n\nIn the morning I got up early, and went down stairs. The family was all up, and they was getting ready for breakfast. Buck and I went out in the yard, and we played with the dogs, and then we went down to the river and washed up. The sun was shining, and the birds was singing, and everything was fresh and bright. I felt as happy as I ever had in my life.\n\nAfter breakfast Buck and I went out in the woods, and he showed me all around. He showed me where they had had a fight with the other family, and where some of the men had been killed. He said it was a bad business, and he wished it would stop, but he didn’t see how it could. He said his father and the other men was all proud, and they wouldn’t give in, and the other family was the same way. I said I didn’t see no sense in it, and he said he didn’t either, but it was just the way things was.\n\nWe spent the day exploring, and talking, and having a good time. I liked Buck better and better, and I was glad I had found a friend. I hoped I could stay there a long time, but I knew I couldn’t, because I had to help Jim get away. I didn’t know what to do, but I made up my mind I would wait and see what happened.\n\nThat night, after supper, Miss Sophia asked me to come up to her room. She said she wanted me to do her a favor. She gave me a little note, and told me to take it to the church the next morning, and put it in a certain place. She said it was very important, and I mustn’t tell anybody about it. I promised I wouldn’t, and she thanked me, and said I was a good boy.\n\nThe next morning I did just as she told me. I went to the church, and put the note where she said. I didn’t know what it was all about, but I reckoned it was something to do with the feud. I hoped it wouldn’t get anybody into trouble, but I couldn’t help it now.\n\nWhen I got back to the house, everything was in an uproar. The men was all getting their guns, and the women was crying, and Buck was pale and scared. He said something had happened, and he didn’t know what. I asked him what it was, but he didn’t know. Pretty soon we heard shooting, and we ran out to see what was going on.\n\nIt was a terrible sight. The two families was fighting, and there was shooting and yelling and running. I saw some of the men fall, and I saw Buck’s father get shot. Buck grabbed me and pulled me back, and we ran for the woods. We hid there, and watched the fight. It was awful. I never saw anything like it before, and I hope I never will again.\n\nAfter a while the shooting stopped, and we crept back to the house. It was all over, and the men was dead or wounded, and the women was crying and wringing their hands. Buck’s father was dead, and so was some of the other men. Buck was crying, and I felt bad for him. I didn’t know what to say, so I just stayed with him and tried to comfort him.\n\nThat night I couldn’t sleep. I kept thinking about the fight, and the dead men, and the crying women. I wished I had never come there, and I wished I could get away. I made up my mind I would leave as soon as I could, and take Jim with me. I didn’t want to stay in a place where people killed each other over nothing.\n\nThe next morning I told Buck I had to go. He said he understood, and he wished me luck. I said good-bye to the family, and they all said they was sorry to see me go. I went down to the river, and found Jim, and we got in the raft and floated away. I was glad to be gone, but I felt bad for Buck and his family. I hoped they would be all right, but I didn’t know. I just wanted to get away from all the trouble, and be free again."

He was well born, as the saying is, and that’s worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn’t no more quality than a mudcat himself. Col. Grangerford was very tall and very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it anywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you, as you may say. His forehead was high, and his hair was black and straight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it; and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it. He carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it. There warn’t no frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn’t ever loud. He was as kind as he could be—you could feel that, you know, and so you had confidence. Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first, and find out what the matter was afterwards. He didn’t ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners—everybody was always good-mannered where he was. Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine most always—I mean he made it seem like good weather. When he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was enough; there wouldn’t nothing go wrong again for a week.\nWhen him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got up out of their chairs and give them good-day, and didn’t set down again till they had set down. Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where the decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him, and he held it in his hand and waited till Tom’s and Bob’s was mixed, and then they bowed and said, “Our duty to you, sir, and madam;” and they bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank, all three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, and give it to me and Buck, and we drank to the old people too.\nBob was the oldest and Tom next—tall, beautiful men with very broad shoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes. They dressed in white linen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, and wore broad Panama hats.\nThen there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall and proud and grand, but as good as she could be when she warn’t stirred up; but when she was, she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks, like her father. She was beautiful.\nSo was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind. She was gentle and sweet like a dove, and she was only twenty.\nEach person had their own nigger to wait on them—Buck too. My nigger had a monstrous easy time, because I warn’t used to having anybody do anything for me, but Buck’s was on the jump most of the time.\nThis was all there was of the family now, but there used to be more—three sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died.\nThe old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers. Sometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten or fifteen mile around, and stay five or six days, and have such junketings round about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the woods daytimes, and balls at the house nights. These people was mostly kinfolks of the family. The men brought their guns with them. It was a handsome lot of quality, I tell you.",

He was well born, as the saying is, and that’s worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the widow Douglas said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the best stock in Kentucky. The colonel was tall and slim and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it anywheres; he was clean-shaved every morning all over his thin face, and he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you, as you may say.

He carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it. There warn’t no frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he was as kind as he could be—you could feel that, you know, right away. He was always polite; he was kind to everybody, and he was never loud or rough or careless. He was always dressed so fine, and always looked so grand and stately, that a body couldn’t help but think he was just about a king.\n\nHe was well educated, too, and his speech was as fine as his clothes. He could talk about anything, and he always had a way of making you feel like you was important, even if you was just a boy like me. He had a way of looking at you that made you want to do your best, and you couldn’t help but respect him. He was a good man, and everybody that knew him said so. His house was big and handsome, and the yard was full of flowers and trees, and there was a big garden in the back. The house was painted white, and it had green shutters, and there was a big porch in front with chairs and a swing. It looked like the kind of place where you’d want to live if you could.\n\nThe Grangerfords was a big family. There was the colonel and his wife, and their sons, Tom, Bob, and Buck, and their daughters, Charlotte and Sophia. Buck was about my age, and we got to be good friends right away. He was a nice boy, and he liked to have fun, but he was polite and well-mannered, just like the rest of his family. The girls was beautiful, and they was always dressed in the finest clothes. Miss Charlotte was tall and proud, and Miss Sophia was sweet and gentle. They was both real ladies, and they treated me just like I was one of the family.\n\nThere was a lot of servants, too, and they was all dressed in uniforms and did their work quiet and respectful. The Grangerfords treated them well, and they seemed happy. The house was always clean and neat, and there was always plenty to eat. I never saw such a nice place before, and I felt right at home there.\n\nBut there was one thing about the Grangerfords that I didn’t like, and that was the feud. They had a feud with another family, the Shepherdsons, and it had been going on for years. Nobody could remember how it started, but it was a deadly thing. The men carried guns everywhere they went, and they was always watching out for the Shepherdsons. The women and children didn’t go out alone, and everybody was always a little bit nervous. It seemed like a terrible way to live, but the Grangerfords didn’t seem to mind. They was proud of their family, and they was ready to fight for it if they had to.\n\nOne Sunday, we all went to church together. The men brought their guns, and they set them down in the aisle while we listened to the preacher. The sermon was about brotherly love, and everybody listened real close, but I couldn’t help but notice that the Grangerfords and the Shepherdsons was sitting on opposite sides of the church, and they kept looking at each other like they was just waiting for something to happen. It seemed kind of strange to me, but nobody else seemed to think anything of it.\n\nAfter church, we went back to the house, and everything was peaceful for a while. But then something happened that changed everything. Miss Sophia asked me to go over to the church and get her Testament for her. She said she’d left it in her pew, and she wanted it right away. I didn’t think anything of it, so I went and got it for her. When I opened it, I found a note inside. I didn’t read it, but I could tell it was important. I gave it to Miss Sophia, and she looked real happy and thanked me. I didn’t know what was going on, but I had a feeling it was something secret.\n\nLater that day, Buck and I was out in the woods when we heard a commotion. We ran back to the house and found everybody in an uproar. Miss Sophia was gone, and so was one of the Shepherdson boys. They had run off together, and the feud was about to get worse. The men grabbed their guns and went after them, and there was a terrible fight. Some of the Grangerfords was killed, and Buck was shot. I was scared and didn’t know what to do, so I ran and hid in the woods. I stayed there until it was all over, and then I went down to the river and found Jim. We was both glad to see each other, and we got back on the raft and floated away. I was sad about Buck and the Grangerfords, but I was glad to be away from all that trouble. It made me think about how foolish it was to fight over something nobody could even remember. I was glad to be back with Jim, and we floated on down the river, hoping for better times ahead."

But he didn’t git much chance to enjoy his luck, for inside of a week our folks laid him out.”\n“I reckon that old man was a coward, Buck.”\n“I reckon he warn’t a coward. Not by a blame’ sight. There ain’t a coward amongst them Shepherdsons—not a one. And there ain’t no cowards amongst the Grangerfords either. Why, that old man kep’ up his end in a fight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords, and come out winner. They was all a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and got behind a little woodpile, and kep’ his horse before him to stop the bullets; but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around the old man, and peppered away at him, and he peppered away at them. Him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled, but the Grangerfords had to be fetched home—and one of ’em was dead, and another died the next day. No, sir; if a body’s out hunting for cowards he don’t want to fool away any time amongst them Shepherdsons, becuz they don’t breed any of that kind.”",

            "prefix-probing": "\"Buck, do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this way?\" \n\nBuck looked at me, his eyes wide and curious, and he shook his head. \"I don't know, Huck. Who's Tom Sawyer?\"\n\nI felt a little foolish, for I forgot that Buck didn't know Tom, nor any of the things we'd done together. But I couldn't help but think of Tom, and how he'd have made a grand adventure out of all this. I told Buck a little about Tom, how he was always up to something, and how he liked to play robbers and pirates and such. Buck listened, grinning, and said he wished he could meet Tom someday.\n\nThen I says, \"Buck, what was it all about, down there in the woods? Who was them men shooting at us?\"\n\nBuck's face got serious, and he looked down at the ground. \"It's the Shepherdsons,\" he said. \"They hate us Grangerfords, and we hate them. It's been that way for years. Pa says it's a feud, and it ain't never going to end.\"\n\nI asked him what started it, but he said he didn't rightly know. \"Pa says it was something about a horse, a long time ago. But now it's just because it's always been.\"\n\nI thought that was mighty strange, but I didn't say nothing. I just listened, and Buck told me about how sometimes the Shepherdsons would shoot at them if they met in the woods, and how the Grangerfords would do the same. He said it was dangerous, but he wasn't scared. \"It's just the way things is,\" he said.\n\nWe sat there a while, listening to the birds and the wind in the trees. I felt kind of lonesome, thinking about Jim and the raft, and wondering if I'd ever see him again. But Buck was good company, and I liked him.\n\nAfter a bit, Buck said, \"Come on, Huck, let's go down to the river. Maybe we can see some fish.\"\n\nSo we went, and we spent the afternoon throwing rocks in the water and talking about all sorts of things. Buck told me about his family, and I told him about the adventures I'd had with Tom and Jim. He liked hearing about the raft, and said he wished he could go floating down the river, too.\n\nWhen it started to get dark, we headed back to the house. The Grangerfords were all sitting on the porch, talking and laughing. They asked us where we'd been, and Buck said we'd been down by the river. Nobody seemed to mind.\n\nThat night, I lay in bed thinking about the feud, and about how folks could hate each other for so long and not even remember why. It didn't make much sense to me, but I reckoned it wasn't my place to say.\n\nThe next morning, Buck woke me up early. \"Come on, Huck,\" he said. \"Let's go hunting.\"\n\nWe got our guns and headed out into the woods. It was quiet and cool, and the sun was just coming up. We didn't see any deer, but we saw some rabbits and squirrels. Buck was a good shot, and he showed me how to track animals by looking at their footprints.\n\nAfter a while, we sat down on a log to rest. Buck looked at me and said, \"Huck, do you ever get scared?\"\n\nI thought about it. \"Sometimes,\" I said. \"But mostly I just try to keep out of trouble.\"\n\nBuck nodded. \"Me too. But Pa says a Grangerford ain't supposed to be scared of nothing.\"\n\nI didn't say nothing to that. I just looked out at the trees and thought about how different folks was, and how sometimes it didn't matter if you was scared or not, you just had to keep going.\n\nWe headed back to the house, and I felt glad to have a friend like Buck. Even with all the trouble and danger, it was good to have someone to talk to."

This changes the structure and tone of the interaction.\n- The ending introduces an invented action where the narrator goes down to the river, which is not part of the original passage.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the detail about Buck and the dog sleeping on the grass, which is part of the original sequence after dinner.\n- The description of the narrator going up to the room and encountering Miss Sophia at her door is missing; instead, the meeting is relocated to the hall and presented as dialogue.\n- The original's description of the church being unlocked and the reason hogs like the floor is condensed and lacks the specific reasoning provided in the original.\n- The emotional reaction of Miss Sophia after reading the note, including her physical response and change in appearance, is not fully captured.\n- The narrator's internal suspicion about the note and the act of ransacking the book for more clues are not included.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered: the narrator is approached by Miss Sophia in the hall rather than at her door, and the conversation is rendered as direct speech rather than narrative summary.\n- The narrator claims to have read the note and admits this to Miss Sophia, which differs from the original's handling of this exchange.\n- The completion omits the narrator's specific response about reading only a certain style of handwriting, and the explanation for the note is simplified.\n- The invented action at the end (going to the river) is not present in the original and disrupts the original sequence.\n- The completion does not accurately reflect the narrator's astonishment and the nuanced emotional exchange after returning the Testament."

Most folks don’t go to church only when they’ve got to; but a hog is different.\n\nI went up to the pew and got the Testament, and as I was going to take it out, I happened to think maybe there was something in it. It seemed kind of curious, her being so anxious about it, so I ransacked it, and shook it, and out fell a little piece of paper with “Half-past two” wrote on it in pencil. I couldn’t make anything out of that, so I put the paper back in the book and took it to the house.\n\nMiss Sophia was standing in her door waiting for me. She pulled me in and shut the door; then she took the Testament and looked for the paper right off. She read it and looked glad; and before a body could think, she grabbed me and hugged me tight, and said I was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody. She was mighty red in the face, and her eyes lighted up like you’d never see. She looked so pretty I didn’t know what to do. I was so astonished I couldn’t say a word. She asked me if I’d read the paper, and I said no, and she asked if I could read writing, and I told her only coarse-hand, and then she said it was nothing but a bookmark to keep her place, and I might go and play now.",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the narrator's internal suspicion about Miss Sophia's request and the reasoning that something unusual is happening, which is present in the original before the Testament is shaken.\n- The completion invents a detail about Miss Sophia sitting at her table with her head down, which is not part of the original sequence; in the original, she is standing in her doorway.\n- The completion does not include the narrator's observation about the church possibly having hogs inside and the explanation about why hogs like the church floor, which is a notable descriptive passage in the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion leaves out the narrator's reflection on how most people only go to church when necessary, contrasting with the behavior of hogs. This reflection occurs after entering the church in the original.\n- The completion omits the narrator's direct thought process and suspicion about the Testament and the note, which adds to the sense of intrigue in the original.\n- The completion does not include the exchange where Miss Sophia asks if the narrator can read writing, and the narrator's response about only being able to read coarse-hand.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is slightly altered: in the completion, Miss Sophia is described as sitting at a table and directly asking for the favor, whereas in the original, she is standing in her doorway and brings the narrator into her room before making the request.\n- The completion has the narrator read the note, whereas in the original, the narrator claims not to be able to read it and puts it back without understanding it.\n- The completion changes the nature of the final conversation: in the original, there is a brief exchange about the note and the narrator's reading ability, which is missing or altered in the completion.\n- The emotional reactions and physical actions (such as Miss Sophia's blush and the narrator's astonishment) are somewhat condensed or rephrased, losing some of the nuance and sequence found in the original."

It was pretty ornery preaching—all about brotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it was a good sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such a powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and preforeordestination, and I don’t know what all, that it did seem to me to be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet.\n\nAbout an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in their chairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull. Buck and I slipped out and went down to the woods, and wandered around a little, but didn’t see anything to do. We found a little stream and went wading, and then sat down on a log and talked. Buck said he wished he was out of this feud, and I said I wished I was out of it, too, and was back with Jim on the raft. We talked about the Shepherdsons and the Grangerfords, and how it seemed like they’d never stop fighting, and how nobody could even remember what started it.\n\nAfter a while we heard a horse coming, and we hid behind a tree. It was one of the Shepherdson boys, riding along slow and looking around like he was expecting trouble. Buck said we better stay hid, so we did, and after he was gone we went back up to the house. Everything was quiet, and it seemed like the whole place was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.\n\nThat evening, Miss Sophia asked me to go over to the church and fetch her Testament. She said she left it in her pew. I didn’t think nothing of it, so I went. The church was empty and still, and the sun was shining through the windows, making the dust in the air look like gold. I found the Testament on the bench, and when I picked it up, a little piece of paper fell out. I looked at it, and it said, “Half-past two.” I didn’t know what it meant, but I took the book back to Miss Sophia.\n\nShe looked at me kind of funny when I handed it to her, and asked if I saw anybody at the church. I said no, and she seemed relieved. I went outside and sat on the steps, thinking about the note. After a while, I saw Miss Sophia slip out the back door and head toward the woods. I got a bad feeling, and pretty soon Buck came running out, looking wild. He said Miss Sophia had run off with Harney Shepherdson, and the feud was about to break out worse than ever.\n\nWe heard shooting down by the river, and Buck grabbed his gun and ran. I followed, but I kept to the trees. There was a terrible fight, and I saw men fall. Buck and another boy ran for the river, and I heard more shots. When it was over, I found Buck lying in the water, dead. I cried and felt sick, and I knew I had to get away. I went back to the house, got my things, and slipped off to find Jim and the raft, and leave all that trouble behind."

I didn’t turn around at first, but I could hear his feet in the grass, soft and careful, like he didn’t want to bother me none. The river was running high, and the sun was just coming up over the trees on the far bank, making the water look like it was on fire. I sat down on a log and looked out at it, thinking about what I’d just heard, and what I ought to do next.\n\nJim came up slow and stood a little ways off, looking at me kind of anxious. I could tell he wanted to say something, but he was waiting for me to speak first. I didn’t know what to say, so I just sat there, picking at the bark on the log and watching the water. After a while, Jim cleared his throat and said, “You’s gwine to tell, ain’t you, Huck?”\n\nI looked at him then, and I could see he was scared. His hands were shaking a little, and his eyes were big and white. I felt bad for him, but I didn’t know what to do. I’d been raised to think it was wrong to help a runaway slave, but Jim was my friend, and I didn’t want to see him get caught. I remembered all the times he’d helped me, and how he’d looked after me when I was sick, and I started to feel all mixed up inside.\n\n“I don’t know, Jim,” I said finally. “I just don’t know.”\n\nJim sat down on the ground next to me, and we both watched the river for a while without saying anything. The birds were starting to sing in the trees, and the air was cool and fresh. It felt good to be out there, away from everybody else, just me and Jim and the river.\n\nAfter a while, Jim said, “Huck, I knows it’s hard. But I’s your friend, and you’s mine. I wouldn’t never tell on you, no matter what.”\n\nThat made me feel even worse. I didn’t want to let Jim down, but I didn’t want to go against what I’d been taught, neither. I thought about Miss Watson, and how she’d feel if she knew I was helping Jim run away. But then I thought about how Jim had cried when he told me about his family, and how he just wanted to be free so he could go back and get them.\n\nI sat there a long time, thinking about it. The sun was higher now, and the river was sparkling in the light. I could hear the sound of a steamboat in the distance, and I wondered where it was going, and if anybody on it was thinking about the same things I was.\n\nFinally, I made up my mind. I turned to Jim and said, “I ain’t gonna tell, Jim. I ain’t gonna tell nobody. We’ll stick together, and we’ll get you to freedom, somehow.”\n\nJim’s face lit up, and he grabbed my hand. “Thank you, Huck! Thank you! You’s the best friend I ever had.”\n\nI felt good then, like I’d done the right thing, even if it was hard. I knew it wouldn’t be easy, and there’d be more trouble ahead, but I wasn’t alone. Me and Jim, we’d face it together.\n\nWe sat there a while longer, talking about what we’d do next. Jim said we ought to keep moving at night, and hide during the day, so nobody would see us. I agreed, and we made a plan to get some food and supplies before we set out again.\n\nAs we walked back to the camp, I felt lighter, like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. I knew I’d have to answer for what I was doing someday, but for now, I was just glad to have a friend like Jim, and to be free on the river, with the whole world ahead of us."

I waked up about dawn, and was a-going to turn over and go to sleep again, when I noticed how still it was—didn’t seem to be anybody stirring. That warn’t usual. Next I noticed that Buck was up and gone. Well, I gets up, a-wondering, and goes down stairs—nobody around; everything as still as a mouse. Just the same outside. Thinks I, what does it mean?

Mars Buck he loaded up his gun en ’lowed he’s gwyne to fetch home a Shepherdson or bust. Well, dey’ll be plenty un ’m dah, I reck’n, en you bet you he’ll fetch one ef he gits a chanst.”\nI took up the river road as hard as I could put. By-and-by I begin to hear guns a good ways off. When I come in sight of the log store and the woodpile where the steamboats lands, I worked along under the trees and brush till I got to a good place, and then I clumb up into the forks of a cottonwood that was out of reach, and watched. There was a wood-rank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree, and first I was going to hide behind that; but maybe it was luckier I didn’t.\nThere was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open place before the log store, cussing and yelling, and trying to get at a couple of young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of the steamboat landing; but they couldn’t come it. Every time one of them showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at. The two boys was squatting back to back behind the pile, so they could watch both ways.\nBy-and-by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling. They started riding towards the store; then up gets one of the boys, draws a steady bead over the wood-rank, and drops one of them out of his saddle. All the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started to carry him to the store; and that minute the two boys started on the run. They got half way to the tree I was in before the men noticed. Then the men see them, and jumped on their horses and took out after them. They gained on the boys, but it didn’t do no good, the boys had too good a start; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree, and slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the men again. One of the boys was Buck, and the other was a slim young chap about nineteen years old.\nThe men ripped around awhile, and then rode away. As soon as they was out of sight I sung out to Buck and told him. He didn’t know what to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first. He was awful surprised. He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the men come in sight again; said they was up to some devilment or other—wouldn’t be gone long. I wished I was out of that tree, but I dasn’t come down. Buck begun to cry and rip, and ’lowed that him and his cousin Joe (that was the other young chap) would make up for this day yet. He said his father and his two brothers was killed, and two or three of the enemy. Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in ambush. Buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for their relations—the Shepherdsons was too strong for them. I asked him what was become of young Harney and Miss Sophia. He said they’d got across the river and was safe. I was glad of that; but the way Buck did take on because he didn’t manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him—I hain’t ever heard anything like it.\nAll of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three or four guns—the men had slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their horses! The boys jumped for the river—both of them hurt—and as they swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and singing out, “Kill them, kill them!” It made me so sick I most fell out of the tree. I ain’t a-going to tell all that happened—it would make me sick again if I was to do that. I wished I hadn’t ever come ashore that night to see such things. I ain’t ever going to get shut of them—lots of times I dream about them.",

            "prefix-probing": "I don’t want to talk much about the next day. I reckon I could say I felt mighty lonesome, and that would be the truth. The sun come up bright and hot, and the river was as still as a picture. I laid there in the shade of the willows, listening to the birds and the water lapping against the bank, and I tried not to think about Pap or Miss Watson or anybody. But it warn’t no use. I kept thinking about Jim, too, and how he was out there somewhere, maybe hungry or scared, and I wished I could do something for him.\n\nAfter a while, I got up and went down to the water to wash my face and hands. The mud felt cool between my toes, and I splashed around a little, just to feel better. Then I went back to the camp and tried to fix up some breakfast. I had a little corn-dodger left, and I found some berries growing close by, so I made out pretty well. But I kept looking over my shoulder, thinking maybe somebody would come along and catch me.\n\nIt warn’t long before I heard a noise in the bushes. My heart jumped up in my throat, and I grabbed my old shotgun, just in case. But it was only a rabbit, hopping along and minding its own business. I laughed a little, feeling foolish, and set the gun down again. I reckon I was getting jumpy, being all alone like that.\n\nThe day dragged on slow. I tried fishing, but the fish warn’t biting much. I whittled on a stick for a while, and then I just laid back and watched the clouds drift by. I got to thinking about Tom Sawyer and all the adventures we used to have. I wondered what he’d do if he was in my place. Probably come up with some wild plan, like dressing up as a pirate or something. That made me smile, but it didn’t last long.\n\nBy afternoon, I was feeling restless. I decided to take a walk along the riverbank, just to see what I could see. The woods was quiet, except for the birds and the sound of the water. I found a turtle sunning itself on a log, and I watched it for a while. It didn’t seem to have a care in the world. I wished I could be like that turtle, just taking it easy and not worrying about nothing.\n\nAs the sun started to go down, I made my way back to camp. I built a little fire and sat by it, watching the flames dance. The night air was cool, and the stars came out one by one. I felt small and alone, but there was something peaceful about it, too. I listened to the frogs and the crickets, and after a while, I started to feel sleepy.\n\nI crawled into my blanket and closed my eyes, but I couldn’t sleep right away. My mind kept wandering, thinking about all the things that had happened and all the things that might happen. I wondered if I’d ever see Jim again, or if I’d ever get back to town. I wondered if Pap was still looking for me, or if he’d given up. I wondered what Miss Watson would say if she knew where I was.\n\nAfter a long time, I finally drifted off to sleep. I dreamed about floating down the river, with the moon shining on the water and the trees whispering in the breeze. It was a good dream, and I didn’t want to wake up.\n\nBut when morning came, I had to face another day. I got up and stretched, feeling stiff and sore. I washed up in the river again and tried to find something to eat. The berries were all gone, and I didn’t have much left. I thought about trying to catch a fish, but I didn’t feel like it. I just sat there, staring at the water and thinking.\n\nIt warn’t long before I heard another noise in the bushes. This time, I was ready. I grabbed my shotgun and crept over to where the sound was coming from. I peeked through the leaves and saw a figure moving through the trees. My heart started pounding, and I held my breath.\n\nThen the figure stepped into the clearing, and I saw it was Jim. He looked tired and scared, but when he saw me, he broke into a big grin. I felt a wave of relief wash over me, and I ran over to him.\n\n“Jim!” I whispered. “Where you been?”\n\nHe told me he’d been hiding in the woods, trying to keep away from folks. He said he was hungry and tired, and he didn’t know what to do. I gave him the last of my corn-dodger, and we sat down by the fire together.\n\nWe talked for a long time, whispering so nobody would hear us. Jim told me about how he’d run away from Miss Watson, and how he was hoping to get to the free states. I told him about Pap and how I’d faked my own death. We both agreed we had to stick together, no matter what.\n\nAs the night wore on, we made plans for what to do next. We decided to build a raft and float down the river, keeping out of sight as much as we could. It was risky, but it was the only way we could think of.\n\nWe spent the next few days gathering wood and tying it together. It was hard work, but we didn’t mind. We were both glad to have each other for company. We talked and laughed, and for the first time in a while, I didn’t feel so lonesome.\n\nWhen the raft was finished, we loaded up what little we had and set off down the river. The current was strong, and the water sparkled in the sunlight. I felt free and alive, with the wind in my hair and the world stretching out before me.\n\nWe didn’t know what was waiting for us down the river, but we didn’t care. We had each other, and that was enough. As we floated away, I looked back at the shore and felt a pang of sadness. But I knew I couldn’t go back. Not now. Not ever."

            "Huck yells out, and to his immense relief, Jim's voice answers from nearby. Jim is overjoyed to see Huck, hugging him tightly.",
            "Jim explains that Jack had come and reported that Huck was likely shot because he hadn't returned home. Consequently, Jim was just starting to move the raft down the creek to be ready to leave as soon as Jack confirmed Huck's death.",
            "Huck reassures Jim and explains that his disappearance will lead the Grangerfords to believe he was killed and floated downriver, a belief that will be aided by 'something up there' (likely the bodies he covered). He urges Jim to shove off into the main river immediately.",

I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds, and so was Jim to get away from the swamp. We said there warn’t no home like a raft, after all.

I didn’t know what to do, but I knowed I couldn’t stay up there all night, and I was getting powerful hungry, too.\n\nAfter a while, the sky got a little lighter in the west, and the stars begun to come out. I listened and listened, but I didn’t hear nothing but the frogs and the crickets. I begun to think maybe it was safe to come down, so I slipped out of the tree as quiet as I could, and crept through the brush toward the river. I kept low, and stopped every little bit to listen, but everything was still. When I got to the edge of the water, I looked around, but I didn’t see nobody. The moon was just coming up, and it made the river look all silver and quiet.\n\nI slipped down to the bank and got in the water, and swum out to the middle, where I knowed I’d be safe.

I was tired and hungry, but I was glad to be away from them men, and from Pap, and from all the trouble on the shore.\n\nAfter a while, I got up and wandered around the island. It wasn’t very big, but there was some trees and bushes, and I found a place where I could hide if anybody come. I made up my mind to stay there till I could figure out what to do. I wished I had something to eat, but there wasn’t nothing but some wild berries, and they didn’t go very far. I drunk some water from the river, and then I laid down under a tree and tried to sleep.\n\nBut I couldn’t sleep much. I kept thinking about what had happened, and what might happen next. I thought about Jim, and wondered if he was still back at Miss Watson’s, or if he’d run off, too. I thought about Pap, and hoped he wouldn’t find me. I thought about the men with the guns, and how close they’d come to catching me. It made me shiver to think about it.\n\nThe night went on slow, and the moon climbed higher and higher. I watched the shadows move across the sand, and listened to the river gurgling along. After a long time, I must have dozed off, because when I woke up, it was getting light in the east, and the birds was singing. I sat up and stretched, and looked around. Everything was quiet and peaceful, and I felt a little better. I made up my mind to explore the island, and see if I could find something to eat, or maybe a place to build a shelter.\n\nSo I started off, keeping close to the trees, and looking careful all around. I found some more berries, and ate them, and then I come to a place where the ground was soft and muddy. I seen some tracks there, and I bent down to look at them. They was fresh, and they wasn’t mine. My heart jumped, and I looked all around, but I didn’t see nobody. I wondered who could be on the island with me. I listened, but everything was still. I begun to feel scared again, but I made up my mind to find out who it was. I followed the tracks, keeping quiet as I could, and pretty soon I come to a little clearing. And there, sitting by a fire, was Jim."

            "They learned to identify snags in swift currents by the streaks they made on the water.",
            "Mist would rise from the river, the eastern sky would redden, and features like log cabins on the far bank, likely woodyards, would become discernible.",

The river was as still as a picture, and the sky was so soft and blue it made you feel dreamy and lazy, like you could just float forever and never care for nothing. Me and Jim, we’d lay on our backs in the shade of the cottonwood branches, letting the raft drift, and listen to the water lapping gentle against the logs. Sometimes a bird would call out from the bank, or a fish would jump and leave a little ring in the water, but mostly it was just peaceful and still.\n\nJim, he’d hum a tune now and then, low and soft, and I’d watch the clouds drift by overhead, making up shapes and stories in my mind. Sometimes I’d think about Tom Sawyer and the old gang, and wonder what they was up to back in St. Petersburg, but mostly I was just glad to be free and out in the open, with nobody to boss me or tell me what to do. Jim, he’d talk about his family, and how he hoped to get to a free state and send for them, and I’d listen and nod, feeling sorry for him but not knowing what to say.\n\nAt night, we’d tie up the raft in a little cove, where the willows hung down low and hid us from the river. We’d build a small fire and cook up some catfish or whatever we’d caught that day, and sit close by the flames, talking low so as not to be heard. The stars would come out, bright and thick, and the moon would shine down on the water, making it look like silver. Sometimes I’d feel a little lonesome, thinking about home and Pap and all the trouble I’d left behind, but then I’d look at Jim, and see how happy he was just to be free, and I’d feel better.\n\nOne morning, just as the sun was coming up, we heard a steamboat whistle far off down the river. The sound echoed through the mist, and we both sat up, listening. Jim looked worried, but I told him not to fret; we’d keep to the shadows and stay out of sight. The river was wide and full of hiding places, and I reckoned we could slip by easy enough. So we pushed off, letting the current take us, and watched as the world woke up around us, the birds singing and the sun turning the water gold. It was another day on the river, and we was free."

Once there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beating tin pans so the steamboats wouldn’t run over them. A scow or a raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and laughing—heard them plain; but we couldn’t see no sign of them; it made you feel crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air. Jim said he believed it was spirits; but I says:\n\n“‘No; spirits wouldn’t say, ‘Dern the dern fog.’”\n\nSoon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about the middle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted her to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and talked about all kinds of things—we was always naked, day and night, whenever the mosquitoes would let us—the new clothes Buck’s folks made for me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn’t go much on clothes, nohow. Sometimes we’d have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest time. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybe a spark—which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on the water you could see a spark or two—on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts. It’s lovely to live on a raft. We had the sky up there, all speckled with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened. Jim he allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I judged it would have took too long to make so many. Jim said the moon could a laid them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn’t say nothing against it, because I’ve seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it could be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them streak down. Jim allowed they got spoiled and was hove out of the nest.\n\nOnce or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out of her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful pretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and her powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by-and-by her waves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle the raft a bit, and after that you wouldn’t hear nothing for you couldn’t tell how long, except maybe frogs or something. After midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or three hours the shores was black—no more sparks in the cabin windows. These sparks was our clock—the first one that showed again meant morning was coming, so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away.",

Sometimes we’d see a light way off on shore, and wonder what it was, and maybe hear a dog bark, or a cow bell, or the sound of a fiddle far away. It made you feel mighty free and easy and comfortable.\n\nOne night we catched a little section of a lumber raft—nice pine planks. It was about midnight, and the moon was shining, and Jim and me was setting, talking, when we heard a sound away over the water. We listened, and it was a sound like somebody singing, and then we made it out to be a lot of people singing, and then we could see a big raft away off, and a lot of lanterns shining on it. We paddled over to it, and when we got close we see it was a big raft, about forty foot wide and two hundred long, and had ten or twelve men on it, and a dog, and a cooking stove, and a tent, and a lot of barrels, and an old horse. They was all singing, and Jim and me joined in and sung, too, and they give us some coffee and corn-bread, and we had a good time. Then we paddled back to our own raft, and laid down and went to sleep.\n\nThe next morning we floated down the river, and the sun was shining, and the birds was singing, and everything was fresh and green, and the river was smooth and wide. We felt mighty good, and lazy, and comfortable. Jim said it was a good place to be, and I agreed with him. We didn’t have nothing to do but just float along and watch the world go by. Sometimes we’d fish, and sometimes we’d swim, and sometimes we’d just lay around and talk. It was a lazy, easy life, and we liked it.\n\nBut sometimes we’d get to thinking about home, and about the people we’d left behind, and we’d feel a little lonesome. Jim would talk about his wife and children, and I’d think about Tom Sawyer, and Aunt Polly, and the old place. But mostly we was contented, and didn’t want to be anywhere else. The river was our home, and we was free and happy there."

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not mention the specific time of day or the initial crossing over the chute to the main shore, which sets the scene in the original.\n- The detail about the distance paddled and the purpose of seeking berries is missing, which provides context for the protagonist's actions.\n- The gradual fading of the pursuers' sounds as the characters move away, and the transition from the woods to the river, are not included.\n\n3.

I don’t blame you, gentlemen—far from it; I don’t blame anybody. I deserve it all. Let the cold world do its worst; one thing I know—there’s a grave somewhere for me. The world may go on just as it’s always done, and take everything from me—loved ones, property, everything; but it can’t take that. Some day I’ll lie down in it and forget it all, and my poor broken heart will be at rest.” He went on a-wiping.\n“Drot your pore broken heart,” says the baldhead; “what are you heaving your pore broken heart at us f’r? We hain’t done nothing.”\n“No, I know you haven’t. I ain’t blaming you, gentlemen. I brought myself down—yes, I did it myself. It’s right I should suffer—perfectly right—I don’t make any moan.”\n“Brought you down from whar? Whar was you brought down from?”\n“Ah, you would not believe me; the world never believes—let it pass—’tis no matter. The secret of my birth—”\n“The secret of your birth! Do you mean to say—”\n“Gentlemen,” says the young man, very solemn, “I will reveal it to you, for I feel I may have confidence in you. By rights I am a duke!”\nJim’s eyes bugged out when he heard that; and I reckon mine did, too. Then the baldhead says: “No! you can’t mean it?”\n“Yes. My great-grandfather, eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater, fled to this country about the end of the last century, to breathe the pure air of freedom; married here, and died, leaving a son, his own father dying about the same time. The second son of the late duke seized the titles and estates—the infant real duke was ignored. I am the lineal descendant of that infant—I am the rightful Duke of Bridgewater; and here am I, forlorn, torn from my high estate, hunted of men, despised by the cold world, ragged, worn, heart-broken, and degraded to the companionship of felons on a raft!”\nJim pitied him ever so much, and so did I. We tried to comfort him, but he said it warn’t much use, he couldn’t be much comforted; said if we was a mind to acknowledge him, that would do him more good than most anything else; so we said we would, if he would tell us how. He said we ought to bow when we spoke to him, and say “Your Grace,” or “My Lord,” or “Your Lordship”—and he wouldn’t mind it if we called him plain “Bridgewater,” which, he said, was a title anyway, and not a name; and one of us ought to wait on him at dinner, and do any little thing for him he wanted done.\nWell, that was all easy, so we done it. All through dinner Jim stood around and waited on him, and says, “Will yo’ Grace have some o’ dis or some o’ dat?” and so on, and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to him.",

He scratched his head, as if pondering the proposition, and then let a slow, sly smile spread across his face. “Well, I don’t see why not, my boy,” he replied, his voice oozing with a kind of oily charm. “Two heads is better’n one, as the saying goes, and I reckon we might make a right smart team, if we put our minds to it.”\n\nThe young one grinned, pleased with the old man’s answer. He straightened up, dusting off his ragged coat, and looked around at the little group gathered on the bank of the river. Huck watched them both, feeling a mixture of curiosity and unease. He had seen enough of the world to know that when two such characters joined forces, there was bound to be some mischief afoot.\n\nJim, standing close by, shifted his weight from one foot to the other, his eyes darting nervously between the two strangers. He leaned in close to Huck and whispered, “I don’ like de look o’ dem two, Huck. Dey’s up to somethin’, I knows it.”\n\nHuck nodded, but said nothing. He was thinking hard, trying to figure out what the old man and the young one were planning. The old man, meanwhile, was already spinning a tale, his words flowing smooth and easy, like a river in flood.\n\n“Now, gentlemen,” he said, addressing Huck and Jim as if they were part of his audience, “I reckon it’s only fair to introduce ourselves, seein’ as how we’re all travelin’ together now. My name, sirs, is the Reverend Alexander Blodgett, D.D., late of the church of—well, never mind where. And this here,” he gestured to the young man, “is my esteemed friend, the rightful Duke of Bridgewater.”\n\nThe young man tipped his hat, a sly grin on his face. “That’s right, gentlemen. The Duke of Bridgewater, at your service.”\n\nHuck tried to keep a straight face, but inside he was laughing. He knew these two were nothing but frauds, but he decided to play along for now. “Pleased to meet you, your grace,” he said, bowing low. “And you too, Reverend.”\n\nThe old man beamed, clearly pleased with Huck’s show of respect. “Thank you, my boy, thank you. It does my heart good to meet such well-mannered young men in these rough times.”\n\nJim, however, was not so easily fooled. He eyed the two men suspiciously, but said nothing. He knew better than to cross men like these, at least not until he had a better sense of what they were after.\n\nThe four of them set off down the river together, the old man and the young one talking in low voices, plotting and scheming. Huck listened as best he could, trying to catch snatches of their conversation, but they were careful to keep their voices low.\n\nAs the days passed, Huck watched the two men closely. They were always coming up with new schemes, trying to swindle the people they met along the river. Sometimes they argued, each one trying to outdo the other with his lies and tricks. But for all their bluster, Huck could see that they were both scared men, always looking over their shoulders, afraid of being caught.\n\nOne night, as they sat around the campfire, the old man began to tell a story about his days as a preacher. He spoke of the souls he had saved, the sermons he had preached, and the miracles he had performed. The young one listened with a smirk, clearly not believing a word of it.\n\nHuck listened too, but he was more interested in what the old man wasn’t saying. He could tell that the story was mostly lies, but he was curious to see how far the old man would go.\n\nAfter a while, the old man finished his story and looked around the fire. “Well, boys,” he said, “I reckon it’s time to turn in. We got a long day ahead of us tomorrow, and we’ll need all our wits about us.”\n\nThe others nodded, and soon they were all lying down, the fire burning low. Huck lay awake for a long time, thinking about the two men and their schemes. He knew he had to be careful, but he also knew that as long as he kept his wits about him, he could handle whatever came his way."

            "When pressed, the older man, after securing a promise of trust from the 'Duke,' dramatically revealed his own secret: he declared himself to be the 'late Dauphin,' Louis XVII, son of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, the rightful King of France.",
            "This revelation caused Huck and Jim to stare in amazement. The 'Duke' expressed skepticism, particularly regarding the older man's age in relation to the historical Dauphin.",
            "The older man attributed his aged appearance, gray hairs, and premature baldness to 'trouble,' presenting himself as the wandering, exiled, trampled-on, and suffering King of France, clad in blue jeans and misery.",
            "Moved by his sorrowful display, Huck and Jim felt both pity and a sense of pride at having such an eminent personage with them. They began to comfort him as they had the 'Duke.'",
            "The 'King' claimed that only death could truly relieve his suffering, but he admitted that being treated according to his royal rights often made him feel better. He requested that people kneel when speaking to him, always call him 'Your Majesty,' serve him first at meals, and not sit in his presence until invited.",
            "Huck and Jim readily complied, bestowing royal honors upon him, which significantly cheered him up.",
            "However, the 'Duke' became somewhat resentful of the new hierarchy and the attention the 'King' was receiving. Despite this, the 'King' acted very friendly towards the 'Duke,' mentioning that his (the King's) father had held the Duke's ancestors in high regard.",
            "After the 'Duke' remained disgruntled for some time, the 'King' philosophically reasoned with him. He pointed out that they would likely be together on the raft for a long time, so being sour would only create discomfort. He emphasized that it wasn't his fault he wasn't born a duke, nor the 'Duke's' fault he wasn't born a king, so there was no use in worrying. He advocated for making the best of their situation and offered his hand in friendship.",

But he said it warn’t no use, nothing but to be dead and done with it all could do him any good; though he said it often made him feel easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his rights and dignities, and let on to know who he was. So the duke said he would, and said if he ever ventured to speak to him again he would call him “Your Majesty,” and begged him to remember to call him “Your Grace,” or “My Lord,” or “Your Lordship,” or such like, whenever he spoke to him. Jim and me set to majesty-ing him, and doing this and that and t’other for him, and standing up till he told us we might set down. This done him heaps of good, and so he got cheerful and comfortable. But the duke kind of soured on him, and didn’t look a bit satisfied with the way things was going; still, the king acted real friendly towards him, and said the king’s father knowed the duke’s father, and so on, and so on, and never let on to see that the duke was stuck up about it. So the duke didn’t say nothing, and didn’t do nothing but sit around and sulk. But by and by the king says:\n\n“Like as not we’ll all be together a blamed long time on this h-yer raft, Bilgewater, and so what’s the use of your bein’ sour? It ’ll only make things uncomfortable. It ain’t my fault I warn’t born a duke, it ain’t your fault you warn’t born a king—so what’s the use to worry? Make the best of things the way you find ’em, says I—that’s my motto. This ain’t no bad thing that we’ve struck here—plenty grub and an easy life—come, give us your hand, duke, and let’s all be friends.”\n\nThe duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it. It took away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it, because it would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the raft; for what you want, above all things, on a raft, is for everybody to be satisfied, and feel right and kind towards the others.",

            "prefix-probing": "So he let on he was enjoying it, but I could see he warn’t. Every little while he’d edge away from the crowd, and look kind of sour and uneasy, like he was thinking about something else. The duke, though, he was in his glory, and he let on to be mighty friendly with everybody, and kept a-smiling and bowing and making speeches, and all that. But the king, he warn’t used to being second fiddle, and it didn’t set well with him.\n\nAfter a while, the crowd thinned out, and the king and the duke got together in a corner, and I slipped up close to listen. The king says:\n\n“Looky here, Bilgewater, I’m nation sorry for you, but you ain’t the only one that’s had troubles. I’ve had my share, too, and I reckon I know how it feels. But we got to keep our heads level, and not let on to these folks that we’re anything but what we say we are.”\n\nThe duke nodded, and said, “That’s so, your majesty. We got to play our cards careful. But I tell you, I never did see such a soft snap as this. These people are just ready to believe anything. We can make a good thing out of it, if we only keep cool.”\n\nThe king looked around, and then he says, “Well, I reckon you’re right. But I don’t like the way that lawyer looked at me. He’s got an eye like a hawk. I bet he’s up to something.”\n\nThe duke laughed, and said, “Oh, don’t you worry about him. He’s just jealous because he ain’t in it. We’ll keep an eye on him, though.”\n\nThen they went on talking low, and I couldn’t catch all they said, but I made out that they was planning to get the money as soon as they could, and then light out before anybody got suspicious. I begun to feel pretty uneasy myself, for I didn’t want to see them rob those poor girls, and I was thinking what I could do to help them.\n\nPretty soon, Mary Jane come along, and she looked so sorry and troubled that it made me feel meaner than ever. She set down by me, and begun to talk about her uncle, and how good he was, and how she hoped he would be happy in the other world. I couldn’t stand it no longer, so I says:\n\n“Miss Mary Jane, I got something to tell you, but you must promise you won’t ever let on it was me that told you.”\n\nShe looked at me kind of surprised, and says, “Why, what is it, Huck?”\n\nI looked around to see that nobody was listening, and then I told her all about the king and the duke, and how they warn’t her uncles at all, but just a couple of frauds. She turned pale, and her eyes got big, but she never said a word till I got done. Then she says:\n\n“Oh, Huck, can it be true? Are you sure?”\n\n“Yes, miss, I’m sure. I seen them planning it all out, and I heard them say they was going to get the money and run off.”\n\nShe set there a minute, thinking, and then she says, “What can we do?”\n\nI told her I’d help her, and we’d try to get the money away from them before they could do any harm. She thanked me, and said she’d trust me, and I felt better than I had for a long time.\n\nAfter that, I watched the king and the duke closer than ever, and I kept thinking and thinking how I could get the best of them. It warn’t easy, but I was bound to try, for Mary Jane’s sake, and for the sake of all of them. And that’s the way things stood for a while, with everybody pretending, and nobody knowing what was going to happen next."

I remembered how I had helped him escape, and how we had run into all kinds of adventures since then. Sometimes I wondered if we would ever be able to stop running, or if we would always have to keep moving, always looking over our shoulders.\n\nBut for now, I was just glad to be on the river, with Jim for company and the stars overhead. It seemed like nothing could touch us out there, with the water all around and the night to hide us.

The duke said he would do the “Shakespearean Revival”—that he had studied it all up, and had been in the business a long time. He said he was going to play Hamlet, and the king said he would be Juliet. The duke said he would have to be the ghost, too, and maybe Laertes. The king said he was agreeable. The duke got out his costume, which was just a long white robe, and tied a rope around his waist. The king put on a curtain for a dress, and they fixed up a rehearsal. The duke told the king how to do the sword-fight, and how to die when his time come. Then they spouted out some Shakespeare, and the king made a lot of mistakes, but the duke said it would do well enough for the kind of audience they would have. They practiced and practiced, and I judged they would be a sight to see if they ever got a chance to put it on.",

The duke laughed and said he reckoned the king was just unlucky, but the king grumbled and put the cards away. Then they set to talking about their plans for the next town, and the king said he’d heard tell of a place up the river where there was a rich widow, and maybe they could work a scheme on her. The duke said he’d rather try a play, for he had a new idea for a tragedy that he thought would fetch the folks. They argued back and forth, each one wanting his own way, till at last the king said he’d let the duke have his play, but if it didn’t bring in the money, they’d try his plan next.\n\nAll this time, Jim was steering the raft, keeping her in the middle of the river, and I was sitting by, listening and thinking. I didn’t like the way the king and the duke was always scheming, but I didn’t see how I could do anything about it. I kept hoping we’d get rid of them soon, but they stuck to us like burrs.\n\nBy and by, we come in sight of a little town, with a white church steeple shining in the sun, and the king said that was the place. We tied up the raft and went ashore, the king and the duke putting on their best clothes and acting as grand as you please. They told me and Jim to stay with the raft and keep an eye on things, and off they went, strutting up the road like they owned the place.\n\nMe and Jim sat there a long time, watching the folks go by and listening to the sounds of the town. Jim was uneasy, and he said he didn’t trust them two men, and I said I didn’t neither, but we had to wait and see what they was up to. After a while, we saw a crowd gathering in the square, and pretty soon the king and the duke come out on a platform, bowing and smiling. The duke started to recite some poetry, and the king made a speech about being a poor, persecuted Englishman. The folks listened a while, but then some boys started to laugh and make fun, and the crowd got restless.\n\nThe king tried to pass the hat, but nobody put in more than a few pennies, and the duke looked mad. They come back to the raft in a huff, saying the town was too small and mean to appreciate real talent. The king said he’d try his plan next, and the duke agreed, so we set off down the river again, looking for a better place to try their luck."

Look upon it and live!\" And people would shout out, \"Glory!—A-a-men!\" And so he went on, and the people groaning and crying and saying amen: \"Oh, come to the mourner’s bench! come, black with sin!

The woods was full of teams and wagons, hitched everywheres, feeding out of the wagon troughs and stomping to keep off the flies. There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with branches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles of watermelons and green corn and such-like truck. The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they was bigger and held crowds of people. The benches was made out of outside slabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into for legs. They didn’t have no backs. The preachers had high platforms to stand on at one end of the sheds. The women had on sun-bonnets; and some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a few of the young ones had on calico. Some of the young men was barefooted, and some of the children didn’t have on any clothes but just a tow-linen shirt. Some of the old women was knitting, and some of the young folks was courting on the sly. The first shed we come to, the preacher was lining out a hymn. He lined out two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it, there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; then he lined out two more for them to sing—and so on. The people woke up more and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end some begun to groan, and some begun to shout.

The sun was beating down so fierce that the dust in the road was like powder, and every step we took sent it swirling up around our legs and into our noses. Jim kept wiping his face with the sleeve of his shirt, and I could feel the sweat running down my back and making my shirt stick to me. We didn’t say much as we walked, just kept our heads down and tried to keep moving, hoping for a bit of shade or a breeze, but there wasn’t any to be had.\n\nWhen we finally reached the edge of the woods, we stopped for a minute to catch our breath. The trees were thick and green, and the shade felt like stepping into a cool bath after the heat of the road. Jim flopped down on the grass and let out a long sigh. “Lawsy, Huck, I ain’t never been so hot in all my life,” he said. I sat down next to him and pulled off my hat, fanning myself with it. “It’s a scorcher, all right,” I said. “But we’re almost there. The house is just up ahead.”\n\nWe waited a little while, letting ourselves cool off, and then we got up and started walking again, this time sticking to the shade as much as we could. The path wound through the trees, and pretty soon we could see the roof of the house peeking through the branches. It was a big, old place, with a wide porch and tall windows, and it looked cool and inviting after our hot walk.\n\nAs we got closer, we could hear voices coming from the porch. There was a man sitting in a rocking chair, fanning himself with a newspaper, and a woman standing by the door, talking to him. They looked up when they saw us coming, and the man called out, “Who’s there?”\n\n“It’s just me and Jim,” I said, stepping out into the sunlight. “We was hoping we could get a drink of water, if you don’t mind.”\n\nThe woman smiled and waved us over. “Of course, come on up,” she said. “You boys look like you’ve been walking a long way in this heat.”\n\nWe climbed the steps onto the porch, and the woman went inside and came back with a pitcher of cold water and two glasses. She poured us each a glass, and I drank mine down in one gulp. It was the best thing I’d tasted all day. Jim drank his slow, savoring every swallow.\n\nThe man in the rocking chair looked us over, his eyes sharp but not unfriendly. “Where you boys headed?” he asked.\n\nI hesitated for a second, not wanting to give too much away. “Just passing through,” I said. “Looking for work, maybe.”\n\nHe nodded, seeming satisfied with that. “Well, you picked a fine day for traveling,” he said, and the woman laughed.\n\nWe sat there for a while, talking and resting, and I felt the heat of the day start to fade away. The porch was cool and shady, and the people were kind, and for a little while, it felt like we didn’t have a care in the world."

It said he run away from St. Jacques’ plantation, forty miles below New Orleans, last winter, and likely went north, and whoever would catch him and send him back he would get the reward and expenses.\n\nThe duke said the handbill was to help them travel in the daytime, and he explained how: “When we see anybody coming, if we want to, we can tie Jim hand and foot with a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we captured him up the river, and were too poor to travel by steamboat, so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down to get the reward. Handcuffs and chains would look too common and like as not raise suspicion, but a rope is the right thing—it shows we’re poor folks, and the handbill’s the main thing—it tells the tale.”",

But the king, he only laughed, and said the duke was a greenhorn, and didn’t know nothing about the world, and that he’d better keep his mouth shut and let them that knowed how to manage things do the talking. The duke didn’t like that much, but he didn’t say nothing, and pretty soon they got to talking about the next town, and what they’d do there.\n\nThe king said he’d heard tell there was a rich widow living there, and maybe they could work up some kind of a scheme to get some money out of her. The duke said he’d heard the same thing, and maybe they could pretend to be her long-lost brothers, or something like that. The king said that was a good idea, and they’d have to find out all they could about her before they tried it. So they made up their minds to lay low for a day or two, and see what they could find out.\n\nAll this time, I was listening, and thinking how mean and low-down they was, and wishing I could get away from them. But I didn’t dare to try it, because I knowed they’d catch me, and then there’d be trouble. So I just kept still, and waited for a chance.\n\nThe next day, we got into the town, and the king and the duke went off to see what they could find out. I stayed with Jim, and we talked about what we’d do when we got free. Jim said he was going to try to get his family back, and I said I’d help him if I could. We both felt pretty downhearted, but we tried to keep our spirits up.\n\nThat night, the king and the duke come back, and they was all excited. They said they’d found out all about the widow, and that she had two nieces, and that they was going to pretend to be her brothers from England. They said they’d have to practice talking like Englishmen, and they made me and Jim listen to them while they tried it. It was pretty funny, but I didn’t dare to laugh."

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the detailed instructions and emotional guidance the duke gives to the king about how to perform a key line, nor does it capture the explanation about the character of Juliet and how the line should be delivered.\n- The specific dialogue and characterization during the rehearsal are missing, especially the contrast between how the king delivers the line and how the duke wants it delivered.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the sequence of events is mostly preserved, but in the middle, the completion inaccurately describes both characters as equally confused and muddled, which is not the focus in the original.\n- The completion generalizes the rehearsal process and omits the step-by-step coaching, resulting in a less accurate depiction of the interaction between the king and the duke.\n- At the end, the transition to talking about past adventures is described in a more general way, missing the nuance of how the original passage presents this shift after the sword-fight incident."

Jim was at the steering oar, his eyes always watching for snags or sandbars, and I sat up front, looking out for any sign of people or smoke from a cabin. The river was wide and quiet, with only the sound of the water lapping against the logs and the occasional bird calling from the woods. Every now and then, we’d pass a little clearing with a cornfield or a pasture, but mostly it was just wild country, green and peaceful.\n\nWe didn’t say much, just listened to the sounds and watched the world go by. Sometimes Jim would hum a tune, soft and low, and I’d think about all the things that had happened since we left home. I felt free and easy, like I could go anywhere and do anything, as long as we stayed on the river. The sun climbed higher, burning off the mist, and the sky turned a bright blue. We ate some cold cornbread and bacon for breakfast, and Jim told me stories about his childhood down in the South.\n\nAs the day went on, we saw a couple of skiffs out fishing, but we kept out of sight behind the willows until they passed. We didn’t want to risk anybody seeing us and asking questions. The river was our friend, carrying us along, and we trusted it to keep us safe. We drifted on, not knowing what was ahead, but feeling sure that as long as we stuck together, we’d be all right."

We ain't got no time to lose.\"\n\nThe king, who had been lounging back in his chair, straightened up and looked at the duke with a kind of sly grin. \"That's so, Duke,\" says he. \"The quicker we get at it, the better.\"\n\nSo they cleared away the dishes, and the duke pulled out a piece of paper and a pencil from his pocket. He smoothed the paper out on the table and began to write, while the king leaned over his shoulder, peering at what he was doing. I sat off to one side, pretending not to pay much attention, but I was listening with both ears, for I wanted to know what kind of mischief they was fixing to get up to next.\n\n\"Now, Capet,\" says the duke, \"we've got to make this look right. We can't just walk in and claim to be the brothers of Peter Wilks without some proof.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" says the king, nodding. \"But what kind of proof can we get?\"\n\nThe duke tapped his pencil on the table, thinking. \"Well, we can say we've been living in England all these years, and only just heard of our brother's death. That'll explain why we ain't been around. And we can get the boy here—\" he nodded at me—\"to play our servant.\"\n\nThe king grinned. \"That's a good idea, Duke. The boy can say he's been with us for years, and knows all about our family.\"\n\nI didn't much like the sound of that, but I kept quiet. I knew better than to cross them when they was in one of their scheming moods.\n\nThe duke went on writing, making up a story about how they was the long-lost brothers of Peter Wilks, come all the way from England to claim their inheritance. He made up names for themselves—William and Harvey Wilks—and wrote down all sorts of details about their supposed life in Sheffield, England. The king kept nodding and adding in little bits of his own, like how he remembered playing with Peter when they was boys, and how sad he was to hear of his brother's death.\n\nWhen they was done, the duke folded up the paper and put it in his pocket. \"There,\" says he. \"That ought to do it. Now, Capet, we need to practice our English accents. Can't have folks thinking we're from around here.\"\n\nThe king tried out a few words in a thick, clumsy accent, and the duke corrected him, showing him how to say things proper. They went back and forth for a while, laughing and carrying on, until they was satisfied they could fool anybody.\n\nAll the while, I sat there, feeling more and more uneasy. I didn't like the idea of helping them trick those poor Wilks girls, but I didn't see no way out of it. I just hoped I'd be able to find a way to set things right before it was too late.\n\nAfter a while, the duke stood up and stretched. \"Well, Capet, I reckon we're ready. Tomorrow, we'll go into town and see what we can do.\"\n\nThe king nodded, and they both went off to bed, leaving me alone with my thoughts. I lay awake a long time that night, worrying about what was going to happen next."

            "The group then wandered through the town, taking in its general state of disrepair.",
            "Huck noted that the stores and houses were predominantly old, unpainted wooden structures, elevated on stilts to protect against river flooding. Their gardens appeared neglected, primarily cultivating weeds, sunflowers, and accumulating debris like ash-piles and old discarded items.",
            "The fences were haphazardly constructed from various types of boards added at different times, leaning in multiple directions, and often equipped with only a single leather hinge for a gate. Some bore faint remnants of whitewash, which the Duke humorously suggested dated back to Columbus's era.",
            "Hogs were a common sight in gardens, with residents frequently attempting to shoo them away.",
            "All the town's stores were situated along a single street, featuring white fabric awnings in front, where country visitors would tie their horses.",
            "Under these awnings, idle men, referred to as loafers, spent their days perched on empty dry-goods boxes, whittling wood with Barlow knives, chewing tobacco, and exhibiting general lethargy through yawning and stretching—a rather uncouth assembly.",
            "These men typically wore wide-brimmed yellow straw hats but no coats or waistcoats, addressed each other by familiar names like Bill, Buck, Hank, Joe, and Andy, spoke in a slow, lazy drawl, and used a considerable amount of profanity.",
            "Nearly every awning-post had a loafer leaning against it, usually with hands in pockets, except when retrieving tobacco or scratching.",
            "Huck described their conversations, highlighting the frequent requests to borrow chewing tobacco, often accompanied by false claims about having just given away their last piece.",
            "He detailed the ritual of sharing tobacco, where a borrower would gnaw off a piece from a plug, sometimes to the feigned dismay of the owner.",
            "The town's streets and alleys were entirely composed of mud, deep and black in places, and universally present.",
            "Hogs were ubiquitous, lounging and grunting throughout the town. A common sight was a muddy sow with her piglets leisurely occupying a walkway, forcing people to detour, while she appeared contentedly nursing her young.",
            "This tranquility would often be broken by a loafer inciting a dog to chase the sow, leading to a chaotic pursuit that amused the onlookers, who would then resettle until the next diversion, such as a dog fight.",
            "The narrator observed that nothing animated the loafers as much as a dog fight, unless it was a cruel prank like setting fire to a stray dog or tying a tin pan to its tail.",
            "Some houses along the riverfront were precariously situated, leaning and appearing ready to collapse into the water due to erosion, though some were still inhabited despite the danger.",
            "The town was in a constant state of retreat as the river relentlessly eroded its banks."

          "text_segment": "Then we went loafing around the town. The stores and houses was most all old shackly dried-up frame concerns that hadn’t ever been painted; they was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts, so as to be out of reach of the water when the river was overflowed. The houses had little gardens around them, but they didn’t seem to raise hardly anything in them but jimpson weeds, and sunflowers, and ash-piles, and old curled-up boots and shoes, and pieces of bottles, and rags, and played-out tin-ware. The fences was made of different kinds of boards, nailed on at different times; and they leaned every which-way, and had gates that didn’t generly have but one hinge—a leather one. Some of the fences had been whitewashed, some time or another, but the duke said it was in Clumbus’s time, like enough. There was generly hogs in the garden, and people driving them out.\nAll the stores was along one street. They had white domestic awnings in front, and the country people hitched their horses to the awning-posts. There was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings, and loafers roosting on them all day long, whittling them with their Barlow knives; and chawing tobacco, and gaping and yawning and stretching—a mighty ornery lot. They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella, but didn’t wear no coats nor waistcoats, they called one another Bill, and Buck, and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and talked lazy and drawly, and used considerable many cuss words. There was as many as one loafer leaning up against every awning-post, and he most always had his hands in his britches-pockets, except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw of tobacco or scratch. What a body was hearing amongst them all the time was:\n“Gimme a chaw ’v tobacker, Hank.”\n“Cain’t; I hain’t got but one chaw left. Ask Bill.”\nMaybe Bill he gives him a chaw; maybe he lies and says he ain’t got none. Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world, nor a chaw of tobacco of their own. They get all their chawing by borrowing; they say to a fellow, “I wisht you’d len’ me a chaw, Jack, I jist this minute give Ben Thompson the last chaw I had”—which is a lie pretty much everytime; it don’t fool nobody but a stranger; but Jack ain’t no stranger, so he says:\n“You give him a chaw, did you? So did your sister’s cat’s grandmother. You pay me back the chaws you’ve awready borry’d off’n me, Lafe Buckner, then I’ll loan you one or two ton of it, and won’t charge you no back intrust, nuther.”\n“Well, I did pay you back some of it wunst.”\n“Yes, you did—’bout six chaws. You borry’d store tobacker and paid back nigger-head.”\nStore tobacco is flat black plug, but these fellows mostly chaws the natural leaf twisted. When they borrow a chaw they don’t generly cut it off with a knife, but set the plug in between their teeth, and gnaw with their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in two; then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it when it’s handed back, and says, sarcastic:\n“Here, gimme the chaw, and you take the plug.”\nAll the streets and lanes was just mud; they warn’t nothing else but mud—mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places, and two or three inches deep in all the places. The hogs loafed and grunted around everywheres. You’d see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way, where folks had to walk around her, and she’d stretch out and shut her eyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her, and look as happy as if she was on salary. And pretty soon you’d hear a loafer sing out, “Hi! so boy! sick him, Tige!” and away the sow would go, squealing most horrible, with a dog or two swinging to each ear, and three or four dozen more a-coming; and then you would see all the loafers get up and watch the thing out of sight, and laugh at the fun and look grateful for the noise. Then they’d settle back again till there was a dog fight. There couldn’t anything wake them up all over, and make them happy all over, like a dog fight—unless it might be putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him, or tying a tin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death.\nOn the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank, and they was bowed and bent, and about ready to tumble in. The people had moved out of them. The bank was caved away under one corner of some others, and that corner was hanging over. People lived in them yet, but it was dangersome, because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house caves in at a time. Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the river in one summer. Such a town as that has to be always moving back, and back, and back, because the river’s always gnawing at it.",

            "prefix-probing": "We went loafing around the town, taking in the sights and sounds of the place. The streets were dusty, and the sun beat down hot on the wooden sidewalks. People moved about their business, some stopping to talk in small groups, others hurrying along with baskets or bundles. Huck and I kept to the shade where we could, watching the goings-on with a mixture of curiosity and caution. The town was small, but it seemed lively enough, with a general store, a blacksmith's shop, and a few other buildings clustered around the main street.\n\nWe passed by the general store, where a group of men were gathered on the porch, smoking pipes and swapping stories. Their laughter drifted out into the street, and we caught snatches of their conversation as we walked by. One of them glanced our way, but didn't pay us much mind. We kept moving, not wanting to draw attention to ourselves.\n\nFurther down the street, we came to the blacksmith's shop. The clang of hammer on anvil rang out, and sparks flew as the blacksmith worked on a horseshoe. He was a big man, with arms like tree trunks and a face red from the heat of the forge. He looked up as we passed, nodded once, then went back to his work. The smell of hot metal and coal hung heavy in the air.\n\nWe wandered on, past a row of small houses with neat gardens out front. Women in bonnets tended to the flowers, and children played in the yards, their laughter bright and clear. A dog barked at us from behind a picket fence, but we paid him no mind. The town felt peaceful, almost sleepy, but I couldn't shake the feeling that we were being watched.\n\nAfter a while, we found ourselves near the river. The water glinted in the sunlight, and a few boats were tied up at the dock. We sat on the edge of the wharf, dangling our feet over the water and watching the current swirl by. It was quiet here, away from the bustle of the town, and for a moment I felt almost at ease.\n\n\"What do you reckon we ought to do next?\" I asked Huck, glancing over at him.\n\nHe shrugged, picking at a loose thread on his shirt. \"I don't know. Maybe we ought to see if there's any news. Folks in town might be talking about us.\"\n\nI nodded, knowing he was right. We couldn't stay hidden forever, and sooner or later someone would recognize us. Still, I wasn't in any hurry to move on. The river was calm, and the sun felt good on my face.\n\nWe sat there for a while longer, watching the boats come and go. A fisherman cast his line into the water, and a group of boys skipped stones along the shore. It all seemed so ordinary, so normal, and I wondered if we'd ever have a life like that.\n\nEventually, hunger got the better of us, and we made our way back into town in search of something to eat. We passed by a bakery, the smell of fresh bread making my stomach rumble. Huck grinned and nudged me. \"Reckon we could swipe a loaf or two?\"\n\nI hesitated, but the thought of warm bread was too tempting to resist. We waited until the baker's back was turned, then slipped inside and grabbed a couple of loaves from the counter. We darted out before anyone could stop us, laughing as we ran down the street.\n\nWe found a quiet spot behind the church and tore into the bread, eating hungrily. It wasn't much, but it filled our bellies and gave us the energy we needed to keep going. As we ate, we talked about our next move, weighing our options and trying to figure out the best way to stay out of trouble.\n\n\"Maybe we ought to head downriver,\" Huck suggested, wiping crumbs from his mouth. \"Find a place where nobody knows us.\"\n\nI nodded, liking the sound of that. The river had always been our refuge, a place where we could be free. I knew it wouldn't be easy, but I was willing to take the risk.\n\nAfter we finished eating, we made our way back to the river, keeping to the shadows and avoiding the main streets. We found our raft where we'd left it, hidden among the reeds. It was still in good shape, and I felt a surge of relief as I climbed aboard.\n\nWe pushed off from the shore, letting the current carry us downstream. The town faded into the distance, and the sounds of civilization gave way to the quiet hush of the river. I looked over at Huck, and he grinned back at me, his eyes shining with excitement.\n\n\"Reckon we're free now,\" he said, and I couldn't help but smile.\n\nAs we drifted down the river, I thought about all the adventures we'd had, and all the ones still to come. The world was wide and full of possibilities, and for the first time in a long while, I felt truly alive.\n\nWe floated on, the sun setting behind us and the stars beginning to twinkle in the sky. The river was our home now, and I knew that as long as we stuck together, we'd be all right."

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The initial action of Boggs riding up to the store and looking under the awning is omitted.\n- The description of the street being packed with people and their specific reactions (listening, laughing, and going on) is condensed and lacks the detail of the original.\n- The specific dialogue from the men who try to persuade Boggs to leave is less detailed, missing the urgency and the direct instruction for him to go home immediately.\n- The repeated attempts by people to coax Boggs off his horse and the explicit intent to lock him up and get him sober are not fully developed.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is mostly preserved, but the completion introduces inaccurate motivations and actions for Boggs and the crowd early in the passage.\n- The warning about the time until one o’clock is less precise, lacking the directness and specificity found in the original.\n- The description of the crowd’s reaction after Sherburn’s warning is slightly altered, with less emphasis on the sudden change in mood and the cessation of laughter.\n- The dialogue and actions of the men trying to intervene with Boggs are generalized and do not match the original’s structure or urgency.\n- The final suggestion to fetch Boggs’s daughter is presented, but the lead-up to this moment is less detailed than in the original."

Boggs and the men turned round to see who called him, and when they see the pistol the men jumped to one side, and the pistol-barrel come down slow and steady to a level—both barrels cocked. Boggs throws up both of his hands and says, “O Lord, don’t shoot!” Bang! goes the first shot, and he staggers back, clawing at the air—bang! goes the second one, and he tumbles backwards onto the ground, heavy and solid, with his arms spread out. That young girl screamed out and comes rushing, and down she throws herself on her father, crying, and saying, “Oh, he’s killed him, he’s killed him!” The crowd closed up around them, and shouldered and jammed one another, with their necks stretched, trying to see, and people on the inside trying to shove them back and shouting, “Back, back! give him air, give him air!”\nColonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol onto the ground, and turned around on his heels and walked off.",

The sun was just coming up, painting the tops of the houses gold and making the river shine like a new coin. I felt a little lonesome, but mostly free, like a bird that’s just slipped out of its cage.\n\nI wandered on, not really knowing where I was going, just letting my feet take me. I passed by the general store, where the old men sat out front chewing tobacco and talking about the steamboat that had come in the night before. They didn’t pay me no mind, and I was glad for it. I didn’t want nobody asking me questions or trying to find out where I was headed.\n\nAfter a while, I came to the edge of town, where the houses got smaller and the yards were full of chickens and pigs rooting around. I stopped by a fence and watched a little girl feeding corn to a flock of ducks. She looked up at me and smiled, but I just tipped my hat and kept on walking. I didn’t want to get mixed up with nobody, not just yet.\n\nThe road led down to the river, and I could hear the water slapping against the bank. I found a place where the willows hung low over the water and sat down to think. I pulled out the bit of bread I’d saved from supper and ate it slow, watching the sun climb higher in the sky. I didn’t know what was going to happen next, but I reckoned I’d find out soon enough."

Another man was trying to pour something out of a bottle into his mouth, but he couldn’t swallow it—his head was rolling from side to side, and he was making a kind of moaning noise, low and weak. The people at the window were all talking in whispers, and some of the women had their aprons up to their faces, crying. The druggist was running back and forth, getting things out of drawers and off of shelves, but it didn’t seem to do any good. The doctor came in, pushing through the crowd, and knelt down by Boggs. He looked at the wound, and shook his head, and said something I couldn’t hear. Then he took Boggs’s wrist, and held it a minute, and then let it drop, and stood up and said:\n\n“It’s no use. He’s gone.”\n\nThe women broke out crying louder, and the men began to talk excited and mad. Some of them said it was a shame, and others said it was just what was to be expected, and some said they’d lynch Sherburn for it. The crowd began to move away from the window, and I slipped out and followed them. They went up the street, talking and shouting, and pretty soon they stopped in front of Sherburn’s house. It was a big white house, with a wide porch, and Sherburn was standing on the porch, with his gun in his hand. The crowd stopped and looked at him, and he looked back at them, cool and calm, like he wasn’t afraid of anything. Somebody in the crowd yelled out, “Come out here, Sherburn!”\n\nSherburn didn’t move. He just stood there, looking at them, and then he said, slow and steady:\n\n“The idea of lynching anybody! It’s amusing. The idea of you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a man! Because you’re brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come along here, did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a man? Why, a man’s safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind—as long as it’s daytime and you’re not behind him.”\n\nThe crowd got quieter, and some of them began to edge away. Sherburn went on talking, telling them what cowards they were, and how they didn’t have the nerve to do anything unless they were in a mob. After a while, the crowd broke up and went away, and Sherburn went back into his house, and everything was quiet again."

I know you clear through. I was born and raised in the South, and I’ve lived in the North; so I know the average all around. The average man’s a coward. In the North he lets anybody walk over him that wants to, and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it. In the South one man all by himself, has stopped a stage full of men in the daytime, and robbed the lot. Your newspapers call you a brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other people—whereas you’re just as brave, and no braver. Why don’t your juries hang murderers?

Your mistake is, that you didn’t bring a man with you; that’s one mistake, and the other is that you didn’t come in the dark and fetch your masks. You brought part of a man—Buck Harkness, there—and if you hadn’t had him to start you, you’d a taken it out in blowing.\n“You didn’t want to come. The average man don’t like trouble and danger. You don’t like trouble and danger. But if only half a man—like Buck Harkness, there—shouts ‘Lynch him! lynch him!’ you’re afraid to back down—afraid you’ll be found out to be what you are—cowards—and so you raise a yell, and hang yourselves on to that half-a-man’s coat-tail, and come raging up here, swearing what big things you’re going to do. The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that’s what an army is—a mob; they don’t fight with courage that’s born in them, but with courage that’s borrowed from their mass, and from their officers. But a mob without any man at the head of it is beneath pitifulness. Now the thing for you to do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole. If any real lynching’s going to be done, it will be done in the dark, Southern fashion; and when they come they’ll bring their masks, and fetch a man along.

It’s always at night, in the dark, when nobody can see who’s doing it.”\n\nHe paused, letting his words sink in. The crowd was silent now, the anger and excitement draining away, replaced by something like shame. Sherburn looked at them, one by one, and then said, “Now, the thing for you to do is to go home and crawl in a hole. If any real men’s among you, you’ll come up here and stand up to me, but I don’t expect it. I know you.”\n\nHe folded his arms and stood there, waiting. Nobody moved.

In a few minutes, the street was empty except for Sherburn, still standing on his porch, and me, watching from the shadows. I never seen anything like it before. Sherburn had stood there alone, facing down a whole mob, and sent them packing with nothing but his words and the look in his eye. It made me feel strange, like I’d seen something important, but I couldn’t quite say what it was."

This is a significant omission, as it provides insight into the narrator's reasoning and character.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The ending lacks the narrator's justification for not spending money on the circus, which is present in the original.

The ringmaster he was the boss of the show, and he could ride and jump and do all sorts of tricks. The clowns was the funniest I ever see, and the horses and the dogs and the monkeys was just splendid. There was a man that could eat fire, and another that could swallow swords, and a woman that could dance on a rope. There was a fellow that could turn somersets and flip-flaps, and another that could walk on his hands. There was a big elephant, and a lion, and a bear, and a lot of other animals. The people clapped and shouted, and throwed up their hats, and hollered till they was hoarse.\n\nI never had such a good time in my life. Jim he enjoyed it, too, though he said he was a little afraid of the lion. But I told him the lion was chained up, and couldn't get out, so he felt better. We stayed till the show was over, and then we went back to the raft, talking about all the wonderful things we had seen. It was a day I won't ever forget."

Jim was waiting for us, and he wanted to hear all about the circus. I told him everything, and he laughed and slapped his knee, and said he wished he could have seen it. I said I wished he could, too, but it wouldn't do for him to be seen in town.\n\nThat night, the king and the duke sat up late, talking and planning their show. I listened to them, and I could see they was up to some kind of trick. I didn't like it much, but I didn't say anything. I just hoped they wouldn't get us into trouble.\n\nThe next day, the king and the duke went into town to make arrangements for their show. I stayed on the raft with Jim, and we talked about the circus, and about what the king and the duke was up to. Jim said he didn't trust them, and I said I didn't either, but we had to go along with them for now.\n\nThat evening, the king and the duke come back, and they was all excited. They said they had rented a hall, and put up bills all over town, and everybody was talking about the show. They said it was going to be the best thing that ever happened in that town, and they was sure to make a lot of money.\n\nI didn't know what to think, but I just hoped everything would turn out all right.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces a new detail about a character (Jim) commenting on the paint, which is not present in the original passage.\n- The completion invents a description of the king's costume as a \"wild Indian sort of a get-up,\" which is not part of the original events.\n- The completion adds a new event at the end, describing the next day's town gossip about the show, which is not included in the original excerpt.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the sequence where the duke makes an extended speech before raising the curtain, specifically the part where he praises the tragedy and the actor who will play the main role, building up the audience's expectations.\n- The completion does not mention the specific comedic effect of the king's appearance and the audience's reaction in as much detail as the original, particularly the description of the king's painted appearance and the audience's laughter.\n- The completion leaves out the detail about the king being naked, which is a significant part of the original scene's humor and shock value.\n- The completion does not include the moment where the king comes back and repeats his act multiple times at the audience's demand, nor the specific description of the audience's escalating reaction.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately describes the sequence of the duke's announcements, placing the information about the limited performances and London engagements before the king's act, rather than after.\n- The completion misattributes actions, such as the king sitting down and the curtain rising, which does not align with the original order of events.\n- The completion provides an incorrect number of times the king repeats his act, specifying three times, which is not stated in the original.\n- The completion introduces a whoop and rolling off the stage as the king's final action, which is not present in the original passage.\n- The completion inaccurately describes the curtain dropping at the end of the king's act, which does not match the original sequence where the duke lowers the curtain after the king's performance.\n\nTo improve, focus on maintaining the correct sequence of events, avoid inventing new details or scenes, and ensure all key elements and reactions from the original are included."

            "The narrator reveals that the conmen had amassed a total of four hundred and sixty-five dollars from their three-night theatrical scam, a sum that astonished Huck.",
            "Later, after the King and Duke had fallen asleep, Jim expressed his bewilderment to Huck regarding the uncouth behavior of these self-proclaimed 'kings'.",
            "Huck responded that their actions were not surprising to him, as he believed such conduct was inherent to all royalty.",
            "Jim contended that their companions were merely common swindlers, not actual kings.",
            "Huck, however, maintained his cynical view, asserting that, based on his understanding, most kings were essentially rapscallions.",
            "To illustrate his point, Huck launched into a comically inaccurate and anachronistic diatribe about various historical monarchs, portraying all of them, especially Henry VIII, as villains of the highest order, conflating figures, events, and timelines.",
            "He concluded that their current 'king' was comparatively mild and that one simply had to make allowances for kings, whom he described as a 'mighty ornery lot' due to their upbringing.",
            "Jim then remarked on the unpleasant body odor of their 'king'.",
            "Huck philosophized that all kings likely smelled bad and that history offered no remedies for such a royal trait.",

Look at Henry the Eight; this’n ’s a Sunday-school Superintendent to him. And look at Charles Second, and Louis Fourteen, and Louis Fifteen, and James Second, and Edward Second, and Richard Third, and forty more; besides all them Saxon heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise Cain. My, you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom. He was a blossom. He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head next morning. And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs. ‘Fetch up Nell Gwynn,’ he says. They fetch her up. Next morning, ‘Chop off her head!’ And they chop it off. ‘Fetch up Jane Shore,’ he says; and up she comes, Next morning, ‘Chop off her head’—and they chop it off. ‘Ring up Fair Rosamun.’ Fair Rosamun answers the bell. Next morning, ‘Chop off her head.’ And he made every one of them tell him a tale every night; and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand and one tales that way, and then he put them all in a book, and called it Domesday Book—which was a good name and stated the case. You don’t know kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old rip of ourn is one of the cleanest I’ve struck in history. Well, Henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country. How does he go at it—give notice?—give the country a show? No. All of a sudden he heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard, and whacks out a declaration of independence, and dares them to come on. That was his style—he never give anybody a chance. He had suspicions of his father, the Duke of Wellington. Well, what did he do? Ask him to show up? No—drownded him in a butt of mamsey, like a cat. S’pose people left money laying around where he was—what did he do? He collared it. S’pose he contracted to do a thing, and you paid him, and didn’t set down there and see that he done it—what did he do? He always done the other thing. S’pose he opened his mouth—what then? If he didn’t shut it up powerful quick he’d lose a lie every time. That’s the kind of a bug Henry was; and if we’d a had him along ’stead of our kings he’d a fooled that town a heap worse than ourn done. I don’t say that ourn is lambs, because they ain’t, when you come right down to the cold facts; but they ain’t nothing to that old ram, anyway. All I say is, kings is kings, and you got to make allowances. Take them all around, they’re a mighty ornery lot. It’s the way they’re raised.”\n“But dis one do smell so like de nation, Huck.”\n“Well, they all do, Jim. We can’t help the way a king smells; history don’t tell no way.”\n“Now de duke, he’s a tolerble likely man in some ways.”\n“Yes, a duke’s different. But not very different. This one’s a middling hard lot for a duke. When he’s drunk, there ain’t no near-sighted man could tell him from a king.”\n“Well, anyways, I doan’ hanker for no mo’ un um, Huck. Dese is all I kin stan’.”\n“It’s the way I feel, too, Jim. But we’ve got them on our hands, and we got to remember what they are, and make allowances.

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a substantial section in the middle of the original passage, specifically the extended, imaginative monologue where Huck humorously recounts exaggerated stories about historical kings and their misdeeds. This is a significant omission, as it forms the core of the original's middle portion.\n- The completion invents a new reflection from Huck about wishing to be a king for the fun and none of the trouble, which is not present in the original. This addition shifts the tone and focus away from the original's satirical historical commentary.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the detailed, sequential listing of various historical kings and their supposed actions, which is a key part of the original's structure.\n- The original includes a series of specific, humorous anecdotes about a particular king's behavior, including invented actions and references to historical events and figures, which are not present in the completion.\n- The completion omits the part where Huck discusses the supposed actions of a king regarding a famous historical event and his relationship with another historical figure.\n- The final reflection in the original, where Huck considers the futility of telling Jim the truth about the king and duke, is condensed and lacks the nuance and reasoning found in the original.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces inaccurate attributions, such as suggesting that the North and South have different names for kings, which is not part of the original passage.\n- The sequence of the conversation between Huck and Jim is altered, with invented dialogue and missing exchanges that disrupt the original flow.\n- The completion attributes to Jim a line about the duke being a better man, but the original presents this sentiment differently and with more nuance.\n- The ending of the completion simplifies Huck's internal reasoning and omits the justification for not revealing the truth to Jim, which in the original is more developed and tied to the preceding conversation.\n\nOverall, the completion needs to restore the missing central monologue, avoid invented reflections and dialogue, and maintain the original sequence and depth of the conversation and internal thoughts."

I made Jim lay down in the wigwam and cover up with a blanket, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good ways off. I set by the wigwam door and watched out for canoes and such things; and about the middle of the night a couple of men come along in a skiff, and we hid down and let them go by. Then we talked about the old days, and Jim told me about his family, and how he hoped to get to a free state and buy them out of slavery. The river was quiet and peaceful, and the stars was shining, and it seemed like we was the only people in the world. Sometimes we heard a dog bark, or a cow moo, way off in the distance, but mostly it was just the sound of the water and the wind in the trees. I felt free and easy, and I reckon Jim did, too. We floated on, night after night, and sometimes we stopped at a sandbar or an island to rest or fish or cook something to eat. Jim was always careful, and he never let me take any chances. He said it was too dangerous, with people looking for runaway slaves and all. I didn't mind, because I liked being on the river, and I liked Jim's company. We got to know each other pretty well, and I started to see that Jim was just as good a man as anybody else, black or white. He was kind and smart, and he always looked out for me. I started to feel bad about the way people treated him, and I wished there was something I could do to help him. But I didn't know what. All I could do was keep him safe and help him get to freedom. So we floated on, and the days and nights passed by, and we had all kinds of adventures. Sometimes we got into trouble, but we always managed to get out of it. And all the time, the river kept rolling along, carrying us further and further away from the world we knew."

            "Huck intuitively understood that Jim was overwhelmed with homesickness and grief for his wife and children, from whom he had never before been separated.",
            "Huck reflected on Jim's profound affection for his family, believing it to be as strong as that of white individuals for their own kin—a realization he found somewhat unnatural by societal standards, yet accepted as true.",
            "He noted that Jim often mourned this way during the night when he presumed Huck was asleep, lamenting for his 'Po’ little ’Lizabeth' and 'po’ little Johnny,' and voicing his fear of never seeing them again. Huck privately acknowledged Jim as a 'mighty good nigger'.",
            "On this particular morning, Huck initiated a conversation with Jim about his family.",
            "Jim explained that his acute sadness was triggered by a sound he had heard from the riverbank, which vividly reminded him of an incident where he had treated his young daughter, ’Lizabeth, with unintentional cruelty.",
            "He recounted that ’Lizabeth, who was only about four years old at the time, had endured a severe illness, scarlet fever.",
            "Sometime after her recovery, Jim had instructed her to close a door. When she didn’t comply, merely smiling up at him, he became irritated.",
            "He repeated his command more forcefully, but she remained unresponsive, still smiling.",
            "Consumed by anger, Jim struck her forcefully on the side of her head, causing her to fall.",
            "He then left the room for approximately ten minutes. Upon his return, he found the door still ajar and ’Lizabeth standing near it, looking down and crying silently.",
            "As he was about to confront her again, a sudden gust of wind slammed the inward-opening door shut with a loud 'ker-blam!' right behind the child.",
            "To Jim's profound shock, ’Lizabeth did not react in any way to the loud noise.",
            "This lack of response deeply unsettled Jim. Overcome with a strange feeling, he cautiously crept around, quietly opened the door, and positioned himself behind her.",
            "He then suddenly shouted 'pow!' as loudly as he possibly could, directly behind her head.",
            "When ’Lizabeth still showed no reaction, the devastating truth dawned on Jim. He burst into tears, embraced her, and cried out for the Lord's forgiveness, knowing he could never forgive himself.",
            "He then revealed to Huck, with immense sorrow, that his little daughter was completely deaf and dumb, and he had tragically mistreated her without understanding her condition."

I stretched and looked around, feeling a little guilty for sleeping through my watch. Jim was sitting at the stern, his back to me, humming a soft tune as he steered the raft with the big oar. The moonlight made the water look like silver, and the trees along the shore were black shadows against the sky.\n\nI crawled over to Jim and said, \"Jim, why didn’t you wake me up? It was my turn.\"\n\nJim looked at me and smiled, his eyes kind. \"I know, Huck, but you was sleepin’ so peaceful, I couldn’t bear to wake you. You’s been through a lot, chile.\"\n\nI felt a lump in my throat. Jim was always looking out for me, even when he didn’t have to. I sat down beside him, and we watched the river together in silence for a while. The night was quiet except for the soft splash of the water and the distant hoot of an owl.\n\nAfter a bit, I said, \"Jim, do you ever get scared out here?\"\n\nJim nodded. \"Yes, honey, I gets scared sometimes. But I feels better when you’s here. We’s in this together, Huck.\"\n\nThat made me feel good, like I was important. I looked up at the sky and tried to pick out the Big Dipper. I remembered how Pap used to say that the stars was holes in the sky, letting the light shine through from heaven. I wondered if that was true.\n\nWe floated on, the raft gliding easy with the current. Every now and then, Jim would dip the oar in the water to steer us away from a snag or a sandbar. I listened to the sounds of the night and thought about all the things that had happened since I ran away from the Widow Douglas’s house. It seemed like a lifetime ago.\n\nAfter a while, Jim said, \"Huck, you ever think about what you’s gonna do when we gets to Cairo?\"\n\nI shrugged. \"I don’t know, Jim. I reckon I’ll just keep going. Maybe head out West.\"\n\nJim was quiet for a minute. \"I hopes I can get to freedom, Huck. I wants to see my family again.\"\n\nI didn’t know what to say to that. I wanted Jim to be free, but I also knew that helping him was against the law. It made me feel all mixed up inside. But I couldn’t let Jim down. He was my friend.\n\nThe river kept rolling on, carrying us south. The night air was cool, and I pulled my blanket around me. Jim started telling me a story about his daughter, and I listened, letting his voice and the sound of the river lull me back to sleep. I knew that as long as we had each other, we could face whatever was waiting for us down the river."

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The beginning of the completion omits the initial context about the time of day and the specific location where the group stopped, as well as the presence of villages on both sides of the river. This removes important setting details that frame the events.\n- The completion invents a reflective comment from Jim about the duke being the only one with brains, which is not present in the original passage.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the explanation for why Jim had to be tied up when left alone, specifically the reasoning about how it would look to others if he was found untied.\n- The sequence of the duke coming up with the plan is condensed, omitting the process of him thinking and quickly devising the solution.\n- The completion lacks the detail about how far in front of the wigwam the sign was placed, which is present in the original.\n- The passage omits the narrator’s final reflection on how Jim’s appearance was even more than just dead, which is a key closing observation in the original.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion gives an inaccurate duration for how long Jim would have to be tied up, changing it from a much longer period to a much shorter one.\n- The description of Jim’s appearance is altered, with invented details about his head and the effect of the wig, and a different comparison for how long he appeared to have been dead.\n- The completion changes Jim’s reaction, making him say he would never get over the experience, which is not in the original.\n- The instructions from the duke are slightly altered, with some steps missing or changed in order.\n- The ending invents a new rationale for why people would leave Jim alone, focusing on his appearance rather than the original’s more nuanced reflection."

We’ll just drop in on one of them towns and kind of let on we’re strangers, and see what’s going on. Maybe there’s a show, or a revival, or something we can work.\"\n\nThe king said that was a good idea, and he’d go along, too. So after supper they put on their best clothes—such as they was—and started out. I and Jim laid low in the wigwam, and watched them go up the bank and strike out for the nearest town. It was a little while before they got out of sight, and then Jim says:\n\n\"Does you reckon dey’s gwine to try to rob somebody, Huck?\"\n\n\"No,\" I says, \"I reckon not. At least, not right away. They’ll try to get in with the people first, and see what’s to be made.\"\n\nWe set there and talked, and Jim got to worrying about his family again, and I tried to cheer him up. It was pretty lonesome on the raft, with the night coming on and the river so quiet. By and by we heard a dog bark over on the Illinois shore, and then everything was still again.\n\nAfter a long time, the king and the duke come back, and they was laughing and talking, and seemed to be in good spirits. They said they’d found out there was going to be a camp-meeting over at one of the towns, and a circus at the other, and they was going to work both of them. The king said he’d take the camp-meeting, and the duke said he’d try his luck at the circus.\n\nSo they set to work planning how they’d do it, and I listened, but I didn’t say nothing. I was getting used to their ways by now, and I knowed it warn’t no use to try to stop them. All I could do was keep my eyes open and hope we wouldn’t get into too much trouble."

My mother she died when I was most an infant, and my father he was a mean man, and kept me out of my rights, and never give me a cent, and I never see him again till he was dead. Well, I was raised by a poor widow, and she used to board at our house, and she had a little nigger boy, and she used to give him a hunk of bread and butter, and I never got none. And when I was a boy, I was so poor I had to steal my own food, and I never had a pair of shoes till I was fourteen years old. And I never see such times. I was always in trouble, and had to work hard, and never got no thanks for it. And now, here I am, old and broke, and got to beg for my living.

The young chap was mighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather. He asked the king where he was going, and the king told him he’d come down the river and landed at the other village this morning, and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there. The young fellow says:\n“When I first see you I says to myself, ‘It’s Mr. Wilks, sure, and he come mighty near getting here in time.’ But then I says again, ‘No, I reckon it ain’t him, or else he wouldn’t be paddling up the river.’ You ain’t him, are you?”\n“No, my name’s Blodgett—Elexander Blodgett—Reverend Elexander Blodgett, I s’pose I must say, as I’m one o’ the Lord’s poor servants. But still I’m jist as able to be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arriving in time, all the same, if he’s missed anything by it—which I hope he hasn’t.”\n“Well, he don’t miss any property by it, because he’ll get that all right; but he’s missed seeing his brother Peter die—which he mayn’t mind, nobody can tell as to that—but his brother would a give anything in this world to see him before he died; never talked about nothing else all these three weeks; hadn’t seen him since they was boys together—and hadn’t ever seen his brother William at all—that’s the deef and dumb one—William ain’t more than thirty or thirty-five. Peter and George were the only ones that come out here; George was the married brother; him and his wife both died last year. Harvey and William’s the only ones that’s left now; and, as I was saying, they haven’t got here in time.”\n“Did anybody send ’em word?”\n“Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because Peter said then that he sorter felt like he warn’t going to get well this time. You see, he was pretty old, and George’s g’yirls was too young to be much company for him, except Mary Jane, the red-headed one; and so he was kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and didn’t seem to care much to live. He most desperately wanted to see Harvey—and William, too, for that matter—because he was one of them kind that can’t bear to make a will. He left a letter behind for Harvey, and said he’d told in it where his money was hid, and how he wanted the rest of the property divided up so George’s g’yirls would be all right—for George didn’t leave nothing. And that letter was all they could get him to put a pen to.”\n“Why do you reckon Harvey don’t come? Wher’ does he live?”\n“Oh, he lives in England—Sheffield—preaches there—hasn’t ever been in this country. He hasn’t had any too much time—and besides he mightn’t a got the letter at all, you know.”\n“Too bad, too bad he couldn’t a lived to see his brothers, poor soul. You going to Orleans, you say?”\n“Yes, but that ain’t only a part of it. I’m going in a ship, next Wednesday, for Ryo Janeero, where my uncle lives.”\n“It’s a pretty long journey. But it’ll be lovely; wisht I was a-going. Is Mary Jane the oldest? How old is the others?”\n“Mary Jane’s nineteen, Susan’s fifteen, and Joanna’s about fourteen—that’s the one that gives herself to good works and has a hare-lip.”\n“Poor things! to be left alone in the cold world so.”\n“Well, they could be worse off. Old Peter had friends, and they ain’t going to let them come to no harm. There’s Hobson, the Babtis’ preacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley, and—well, there’s a lot of them; but these are the ones that Peter was thickest with, and used to write about sometimes, when he wrote home; so Harvey ’ll know where to look for friends when he gets here.”\nWell, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied that young fellow. Blamed if he didn’t inquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town, and all about the Wilkses; and about Peter’s business—which was a tanner; and about George’s—which was a carpenter; and about Harvey’s—which was a dissentering minister; and so on, and so on. Then he says:\n“What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?”\n“Because she’s a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn’t stop there. When they’re deep they won’t stop for a hail. A Cincinnati boat will, but this is a St. Louis one.”\n“Was Peter Wilks well off?”\n“Oh, yes, pretty well off. He had houses and land, and it’s reckoned he left three or four thousand in cash hid up som’ers.”\n“When did you say he died?”\n“I didn’t say, but it was last night.”\n“Funeral to-morrow, likely?”\n“Yes, ’bout the middle of the day.”\n“Well, it’s all terrible sad; but we’ve all got to go, one time or another. So what we want to do is to be prepared; then we’re all right.”\n“Yes, sir, it’s the best way. Ma used to always say that.”",

But still I’m just as able to be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arriving in time, all the same, if he’s missed anything by it—which I hope he hasn’t.”\n\n“Well, he don’t miss any property by it, because he’ll get that all right; but he missed seeing his brother Peter die—which he mayn’t mind, nobody can tell as to that. But his brother would a give anything in this world to see HIM before he died; never talked about nothing else all these three weeks; hadn’t seen him since they was boys together—and hadn’t ever seen his brother William at all—that’s the deef and dumb one—William ain’t more than thirty or thirty-five. Peter and George were the only ones that ever come out here; George was the married brother; him and his wife both died last year. Harvey and William’s the only ones that’s left now; and, as I was saying, they haven’t got here in time.”\n\n“Did anybody send ‘em word?”\n\n“Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because Peter said then that he sorter felt like he warn’t going to get well this time. You see, he was pretty old, and George’s girls was too young to be much company for him, except Mary Jane, the red-headed one; and so he was kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and didn’t seem to care much to live. He most desperately wanted to see Harvey—and William, too, for that matter—because he was one of them kind that can’t bear to make a will. He left a letter behind for Harvey, and said he’d told in it where his money was hid, and how he wanted the rest of the property divided up so Mary Jane and the girls would be all right—for George didn’t leave nothing. And that letter was all they could get him to put a pen to.”\n\n“Why do you reckon Harvey don’t come? Wher’ does he live?”\n\n“Oh, he lives in Sheffield—somewhere’s in England. Couldn’t come, now, anyway, if he didn’t get the letter this time.”\n\n“Didn’t anybody go for him—go to see him?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Well, I don’t know. Maybe he’ll turn up in the course of a day or two. That’s the way such things goes—when a man’s got a brother or two, it’s expected he’ll turn up, but they don’t generally come till it’s too late.”\n\n“Did anybody go for the deef and dumb one?”\n\n“No; he lives in another place. He’s got a little school. He’s a preacher, too, I reckon—leastways it’s said so.”\n\n“Where do the girls live?”\n\n“Oh, they live with Peter—Mary Jane’s nineteen, Susan’s fifteen, and Joanna’s about fourteen—that’s the one that gives herself to good works and has a hare-lip.”\n\n“Who’s going to take care of them?”\n\n“Well, the old man’s friends, I s’pose—Deacon Lot Hovey, Ben Rucker, Abner Shackleford, Levi Bell the lawyer, and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley, and well, there’s a lot of them, but these are the main ones.”\n\n“Was Peter Wilks well off?”\n\n“Oh, yes, pretty well off. He had houses and land, and it’s reckoned he left three or four thousand dollars in cash hid up somewhere.”\n\n“When did he die?”\n\n“Last night.”\n\n“Funeral to-morrow, likely?”\n\n“Yes, ‘bout the middle of the day.”\n\n“Well, it’s all terrible sad, but we all got to go, one time or another. So we must all try to live so we can go easy when it comes. Well, the poor man, he must a been a sight of good soul, and it’s a pity he didn’t live to see his brothers. Poor soul!”\n\n“Yes, indeed, it’s just as my mother used to say. She always said, ‘People that acts as I’ve always done, and don’t ever do nothing for nobody but themselves, will be sorry for it when they come to die.’”",

            "prefix-probing": "“Run her nose in shore,” says the king.\n\nSo I done it. I run her nose in shore, and the king and the duke, they both got out and went up the bank, and I tied up the raft and followed after them. The sun was just going down behind the trees, and the river was all gold and purple, and the air was soft and still. We was in a little cove, with a sandbar making out, and the woods thick all around. The king, he looked up and down the river, and then he says:\n\n“Now, duke, this here looks like a likely place. We’ll camp here tonight, and see what’s to be done in the morning. Jim, you fetch some wood, and you, boy, get the fire started.”\n\nJim, he went off into the woods, and I started gathering up some dry driftwood from the shore. The duke, he was fussing with his coat, brushing off the dust, and the king, he was looking at the sky, like he was thinking deep. After a while, Jim came back with an armful of wood, and we got the fire going. The smoke curled up into the evening air, and the crickets started to sing.\n\nWe cooked up some bacon and corn-dodgers, and ate our supper sitting around the fire. The king, he was in a good humor, and he told some stories about the time he was a pirate in the Indian Ocean, and the duke, he laughed and said he’d been a duke in France, and they both got to talking big, like they always did. Jim, he listened quiet, and I just watched the fire and thought about home.\n\nAfter supper, the king says, “Now, boys, we got to lay our plans for tomorrow. There’s a town up the river a piece, and I reckon we can do some business there. Duke, you got your playbills?”\n\nThe duke, he pulled out a bundle of papers from his coat pocket. “Right here, your majesty,” he says, with a bow. “We’ll put on the Royal Nonesuch, and I’ll wager we’ll make a pile.”\n\nThe king, he grinned. “That’s the ticket. We’ll go up there in the morning, and see what the lay of the land is. Jim, you keep out of sight, you hear? We don’t want no trouble.”\n\nJim nodded, and I could see he was uneasy. He didn’t like being left alone, but he knew better than to argue. The king and the duke, they started talking about the show, and how they’d fix it up to fool the folks in the town. I listened, but I didn’t say nothing. I was thinking about how we was always getting into some kind of scrape, and wishing we could just float down the river and be done with it.\n\nAfter a while, the fire burned low, and the king said it was time to turn in. We spread out our blankets on the sand, and the stars came out overhead. The river made a soft, lapping sound, and the night was peaceful. I lay there, looking up at the sky, and thinking about all that had happened since I’d run away from Pap. It seemed like a long time ago, and a lot had happened since then.\n\nI must have dozed off, because the next thing I knew, the sun was coming up, and the king was shaking me awake. “Come on, boy, time to get moving.”\n\nWe had a quick breakfast, and then the king and the duke put on their best clothes, and we set off up the river toward the town. Jim stayed behind, hidden in the woods, and I felt bad leaving him, but there wasn’t nothing I could do.\n\nThe town was a small place, with a few houses and a store, and a big white church with a steeple. The king and the duke, they went right to work, handing out playbills and talking up the show. I followed along, watching the folks in the town. They was curious, and some of them looked like they didn’t trust the king and the duke, but most of them was interested in the show.\n\nThe king, he got up on a barrel in the middle of the street, and made a speech about the Royal Nonesuch, and how it was the greatest show ever seen. The duke, he passed out the playbills, and pretty soon, there was a crowd gathered around. The king, he could talk a blue streak, and he had them all laughing and cheering.\n\nAfter a while, we went back to the raft, and the king and the duke counted up the money they’d made from selling tickets. They was in high spirits, and talked about how they’d put on the show that night, and make even more money.\n\nJim was glad to see us back, and we told him what had happened. He listened close, and I could see he was worried. “I don’t like this, Huck,” he said. “Them men, they’s up to no good.”\n\n“I know, Jim,” I said. “But we got to go along with them, for now. Maybe we can get away, when the time is right.”\n\nThat night, the king and the duke put on their show in the town. The folks came out, and the king and the duke did their tricks and told their jokes, and the people laughed and clapped. But pretty soon, they figured out they’d been fooled, and they was mad. The king and the duke, they grabbed the money and ran, and we all hurried back to the raft and pushed off into the river.\n\nWe floated down the river in the dark, and the king and the duke, they was laughing and counting their money. But I could see Jim was scared, and I was too. I didn’t know what was going to happen next, but I hoped we could get away from the king and the duke, and be free again.\n\nThe river was quiet, and the stars was shining, and we drifted on into the night, not knowing what was ahead."

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the detail of the king making idiotic signs to the duke on his hands after his initial outburst, nor the duke dropping a carpet-bag and bursting out crying as a direct response to the king's actions.\n- The original contains a reflection on the two characters as frauds, which is missing from the completion.\n- The completion omits the specific mention of the men carrying the carpet-bags up the hill and letting the king and duke lean on them while crying, as well as the king retelling the story in sign language to the duke.\n- The final personal reflection from the narrator, which includes a strong statement about shame and the human race, is only partially captured and lacks the full context and impact of the original.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of emotional reactions is altered: the king's and duke's actions are rearranged, and the duke's response is more verbal and less physical than in the original.\n- The completion attributes more dialogue and emotional display to the duke than is present in the original, and changes the nature of the king's initial outburst.\n- The completion generalizes the men's sympathetic responses, omitting the specific details and order in which they occur in the original passage."

It was a mighty pretty sight, and I felt right at home, for I had been on a steamboat before, and knew how things went. Jim was a little uneasy at first, but he soon got over it, and we both enjoyed the ride, and the cool breeze, and the sound of the engine thumping and the paddle-wheels churning the water.\n\nAfter a while, the captain came up and talked with us. He was a friendly man, and asked us where we was bound. I told him we was going to Orleans, and he said he’d put us off at the next big town, which was just what we wanted. Jim kept quiet, and I did most of the talking, for I didn’t want them to get suspicious. The captain told us about the river, and the towns along the way, and some of the things he’d seen in his time. He said there was a lot of strange folks on the river, and you had to keep your eyes open.\n\nWhen it got dark, the lights came out on the boat, and the river looked black and shiny, with the moon coming up over the trees. I sat there and thought about all the things that had happened, and wondered what was going to happen next. Jim was quiet, too, and I reckon he was thinking about his family, and whether he’d ever see them again. It made me feel kind of lonesome, but I tried not to let on.\n\nBy and by, the boat slowed down, and the captain told us we was coming to the town. We got our things together, and thanked him for the ride, and then we went ashore, ready for whatever was going to come next."

The letter was written in a trembling hand, and it told the girls how much their father loved them, and how he hoped they would always do right and be good to each other. It also said that he had left a little something for them, and that his brothers would know where it was. The king, pretending to be Uncle Harvey, wiped his eyes and said, \"Ah, poor brother Peter! He was always thinking of his dear nieces.\"\n\nThe girls listened with tears in their eyes, and the people in the room were all touched by the scene. The king folded up the letter and handed it back to Mary Jane, saying, \"Keep it, my dear, and remember your poor father by it.\"\n\nThen the king and the duke began to talk about the business of the estate. They asked about the property, the slaves, and the money. The girls said that their father had told them there was six thousand dollars in gold, but they didn't know where it was. The king said, \"Never mind, my dear, your uncle Harvey will find it.\"\n\nSo they all went up to the room where Peter Wilks had died, and the king and the duke began to search. They looked in the bed, under the mattress, in the drawers, and everywhere they could think of. At last, the king found a bag of gold in a secret place, just as the letter had said. He opened it and counted the money, and sure enough, there was six thousand dollars in gold.\n\nThe king handed the money to Mary Jane and said, \"Here, my dear, this is yours and your sisters'. Your father wanted you to have it.\"\n\nMary Jane thanked him, and the people in the room all said how good and kind the uncles were. The king and the duke smiled and bowed, and said they were only doing their duty.\n\nBut I, Huck Finn, was watching all this, and I knew it was all a fraud. The king and the duke weren't the real uncles, and they were just after the money. I felt sorry for Mary Jane and her sisters, and I wished I could do something to help them. But I had to be careful, because if the king and the duke found out I knew the truth, they might do something bad to me.\n\nThat night, after everyone had gone to bed, I sneaked into the room where the king and the duke were staying. I listened at the door and heard them talking about how they were going to get away with the money. They said they would wait a few days, just to make sure nobody suspected anything, and then they would leave town with the gold. I knew I had to act fast if I wanted to save Mary Jane and her sisters from being robbed by these scoundrels."

This is a significant addition that alters the dynamics of the scene.\n- The completion omits the doctor's explicit statement about washing his hands of the matter and his warning to the group before leaving, which is a key turning point in the original passage.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion does not include the detailed efforts by the crowd to explain to the doctor how Harvey had proven his identity in various ways, including knowing names and other specific details.\n- The completion skips the repeated pleas from the crowd for the doctor not to hurt Harvey's and the girls' feelings, which is an important emotional element in the original.\n- The completion does not include the description of the crowd's reaction as a \"perfect storm\" of applause and stomping, which is a vivid depiction of the scene's atmosphere.\n- The completion omits the sequence where the doctor addresses Mary Jane directly by name and appeals to her friendship and trust before making his plea.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- In the middle, the completion inaccurately describes the crowd's mood as being in a \"lovely temper\" and then getting \"a rod and a half hotter,\" which is not present in the original and misrepresents the sequence of reactions.\n- The completion attributes a speech to the king and a roaring interruption by the doctor that do not match the original sequence of dialogue and actions.\n- The completion changes the wording and sequence of Mary Jane's action with the money, including her looking the king in the eye and not flinching, which is not described in the original.\n- The completion has the king and the duke both hugging Mary Jane, which is not accurate to the original events.\n- The completion omits the doctor's final warning to the group about future regret, which is a significant concluding statement in the original passage."

Well, he was always just the same; whenever he got his hands on a dollar, he’d go on a spree, and get drunk, and then he’d raise Cain around town; and every time he got drunk he was sure to get into a fight. He was most always in some kind of trouble, and he never done a day’s work in his life. People used to say he was the town’s permanent deadbeat. He’d loaf around the taverns and the ferry landing, and if he couldn’t get money by borrowing, he’d beg, and if he couldn’t beg, he’d steal it. The law never seemed to catch up with him for long, though; he’d be in jail a day or two, and then out again, and back to his old ways.\n\nHe used to come to the house of nights, and call me out of bed, and abuse me and the widow because I wouldn’t give him the money I got from Judge Thatcher. He said he was my father, and he had a right to it, and he’d make me hand it over if he had to lick it out of me. The widow tried to keep him away, but he was too sly for her, and he’d slip in when she wasn’t looking. Sometimes he’d be gone for weeks, and I’d begin to hope he’d never come back, but he always did, and it was always worse when he’d been gone a spell, for he’d be madder and meaner than ever.\n\nOne morning, just as the sun was coming up, I heard a noise at the window. I looked out, and there he was, looking in at me with his old greasy hat and his ragged coat, and his face all whiskery and dirty. He told me to come out, and I knew better than to say no. I slipped out the window, and he grabbed me by the arm and marched me off down the road. He said he was going to take me away from the widow, and I’d better not make any fuss about it. I didn’t say anything, for I knew it wouldn’t do any good.\n\nHe took me to a little old cabin in the woods, about three miles from town. It was a mean, dirty place, with a broken-down bed and a table, and a few old chairs. There was a jug of whiskey on the table, and he took a drink as soon as we got in. Then he sat down and began to talk about how he was going to make a man out of me, and how he wasn’t going to have me putting on airs and going to school and learning to read and write. He said it was all foolishness, and he didn’t want any son of his getting above his raising.\n\nI had to stay in that cabin with him for weeks. He wouldn’t let me go out, except to fish or hunt for food, and he watched me all the time. Sometimes he’d be in a good humor, and we’d talk and laugh, but most times he was cross and mean, and I had to keep out of his way. I got so I was afraid of him, and I wished I was back with the widow, or anywhere else but there. But I didn’t see any way to get away, and I just had to make the best of it."

His pew’s right over opposite ourn—on t’other side the pulpit.”\n“I thought he lived in London?”\n“Well, he does. Where would he live?”\n“But I thought you lived in Sheffield?”\nI see I was up a stump. I had to let on to get choked with a chicken bone, so as to get time to think how to get down again. Then I says:\n“I mean he goes to our church regular when he’s in Sheffield. That’s only in the summer time, when he comes there to take the sea baths.”\n“Why, how you talk—Sheffield ain’t on the sea.”\n“Well, who said it was?”\n“Why, you did.”\n“I didn’t nuther.”\n“You did!”\n“I didn’t.”\n“You did.”\n“I never said nothing of the kind.”\n“Well, what did you say, then?”\n“Said he come to take the sea baths—that’s what I said.”\n“Well, then, how’s he going to take the sea baths if it ain’t on the sea?”\n“Looky here,” I says; “did you ever see any Congress-water?”\n“Yes.”\n“Well, did you have to go to Congress to get it?”\n“Why, no.”\n“Well, neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea bath.”\n“How does he get it, then?”\n“Gets it the way people down here gets Congress-water—in barrels. There in the palace at Sheffield they’ve got furnaces, and he wants his water hot. They can’t bile that amount of water away off there at the sea. They haven’t got no conveniences for it.”\n“Oh, I see, now. You might a said that in the first place and saved time.”\nWhen she said that I see I was out of the woods again, and so I was comfortable and glad. Next, she says:\n“Do you go to church, too?”\n“Yes—regular.”\n“Where do you set?”\n“Why, in our pew.”\n“Whose pew?”\n“Why, ourn—your Uncle Harvey’s.”\n“His’n? What does he want with a pew?”\n“Wants it to set in. What did you reckon he wanted with it?”\n“Why, I thought he’d be in the pulpit.”\nRot him, I forgot he was a preacher. I see I was up a stump again, so I played another chicken bone and got another think. Then I says:\n“Blame it, do you suppose there ain’t but one preacher to a church?”\n“Why, what do they want with more?”\n“What!—to preach before a king? I never did see such a girl as you. They don’t have no less than seventeen.”\n“Seventeen! My land! Why, I wouldn’t set out such a string as that, not if I never got to glory. It must take ’em a week.”\n“Shucks, they don’t all of ’em preach the same day—only one of ’em.”\n“Well, then, what does the rest of ’em do?”\n“Oh, nothing much. Loll around, pass the plate—and one thing or another. But mainly they don’t do nothing.”\n“Well, then, what are they for?”\n“Why, they’re for style. Don’t you know nothing?”\n“Well, I don’t want to know no such foolishness as that. How is servants treated in England? Do they treat ’em better ’n we treat our niggers?”\n“No! A servant ain’t nobody there. They treat them worse than dogs.”\n“Don’t they give ’em holidays, the way we do, Christmas and New Year’s week, and Fourth of July?”\n“Oh, just listen! A body could tell you hain’t ever been to England by that. Why, Hare-l—why, Joanna, they never see a holiday from year’s end to year’s end; never go to the circus, nor theater, nor nigger shows, nor nowheres.”\n“Nor church?”\n“Nor church.”\n“But you always went to church.”\nWell, I was gone up again. I forgot I was the old man’s servant. But next minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was different from a common servant and had to go to church whether he wanted to or not, and set with the family, on account of its being the law. But I didn’t do it pretty good, and when I got done I see she warn’t satisfied.",

            "prefix-probing": "We set there by the fire, talking low, and watching the shadows dance on the wall. The hare-lip, who was called Joanna, she kept looking at me curious, like she was trying to puzzle me out. I felt kind of uneasy, for I was always afraid she’d ask me something I couldn’t answer, and then the jig would be up. But she didn’t say much at first, just offered me some more cornbread and asked if I wanted molasses with it. I said yes, and thanked her, and tried to act as natural as I could.\n\nAfter a while, she says:\n\n\"Say, where’d you say your home was?\"\n\nI told her the same story I’d told the others, about being from England, and she nodded, but I could see she wasn’t quite satisfied. She kept on questioning me, gentle-like, about the way things was done over there, and I had to rack my brains to remember all the things the king and the duke had told me. I was scared I’d make a slip, but I reckon I got through it all right.\n\nBy and by, the other girls came in, and we all sat around the fire, talking. Mary Jane, she was the oldest, and she was mighty kind to me. She asked me if I was homesick, and I said I was, a little, and she patted my hand and said she hoped I’d feel at home with them. That made me feel mean, for I knew I was helping to fool them, and they was so good to me.\n\nAfter a while, the king and the duke came in, laughing and talking loud, and the girls went off to bed. I sat there, listening to them brag about how easy things was going, and how they’d soon be rich. I felt sick at heart, for I knew it was all a swindle, and I didn’t want any part of it. But I didn’t dare say nothing, for fear they’d turn on me.\n\nWhen it got late, I slipped off to bed, but I couldn’t sleep. I kept thinking about Mary Jane and the others, and how they was being robbed by them scoundrels. I made up my mind I’d find a way to help them, if I could. I lay there, turning it over in my mind, and at last I hit on a plan.\n\nNext morning, I got up early and went down to the kitchen. The niggers was already at work, and I helped them some, just to be doing something. After breakfast, the king and the duke set to work getting ready for the auction. They was going to sell off the property and clear out with the money. I watched them close, trying to figure out how I could get the money away from them and give it back to the girls.\n\nAll day, the house was full of people, coming and going, looking at the furniture and the slaves, and talking about the sale. The king and the duke put on a great show, acting like they was the rightful heirs, and everybody believed them. I kept my eyes open, hoping for a chance to do something.\n\nThat night, after supper, I slipped out of the house and went down to the cellar, where I knew the king and the duke had hid the money. I found the spot easy enough, for I’d seen them go there before. I dug up the bag of gold and took it upstairs, meaning to hide it where the king and the duke couldn’t find it. I was just about to slip into Mary Jane’s room and put it in her trunk, when I heard someone coming. I ducked into a closet and waited, holding my breath.\n\nIt was Mary Jane herself, coming in to get something. She didn’t see me, and after she left, I slipped out and hid the money in the straw tick of her bed. Then I went back to my room, feeling better than I had in days.\n\nNext morning, the sale went off, and the king and the duke was all smiles, thinking they’d soon be rich. But when they went to get the money, it was gone. They was in a fine stew, cussing and carrying on, but they didn’t suspect me. I kept quiet, and waited for a chance to tell Mary Jane where the money was hid.\n\nAt last, I got her alone, and told her the whole story. She was mighty upset, but she thanked me over and over, and said she’d never forget what I’d done. I told her to keep quiet, and let the king and the duke go on thinking they’d been robbed by somebody else. She promised she would, and I felt like I’d done the right thing at last.\n\nAfter that, things happened fast. The real heirs showed up, and there was a big to-do, with everybody talking at once. The king and the duke tried to brazen it out, but it was no use. They was found out, and had to run for it, with the crowd after them. I slipped away in the confusion, and made my way back to the river, where Jim was waiting for me.\n\nWe got the raft ready, and set off down the river again, glad to be away from all the trouble. As we floated along, I told Jim all about what had happened, and he said I’d done the right thing. I felt good, knowing I’d helped Mary Jane and her sisters, and I made up my mind I’d never get mixed up in another swindle as long as I lived."

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant sequence where Susan directly confronts another character, which is present in the original.

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion does not include the full exchange between Mary Jane and the other character, particularly the back-and-forth about how one should treat a stranger and the specific moral reasoning provided.\n- The middle section lacks the moment where Susan intervenes and addresses the situation herself, as well as the narrator’s internal reaction to her actions.\n- The ending is missing the sequence where Mary Jane resumes her gentle approach, the resulting effect on the other character, and the demand for an apology, followed by the apology itself and the narrator’s internal commentary on it.\n- The final part omits the collective effort by the girls to make the narrator feel welcome, as well as the narrator’s repeated internal resolve and emotional response.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion merges or skips over the order in which the girls intervene and how the apology is demanded and delivered.\n- Some actions and lines are misattributed or generalized, such as combining the actions of Mary Jane and Susan or attributing group actions to individuals.\n- The completion introduces a new emotional reaction (the narrator nearly crying) that is not present in the original, and omits the specific self-reproach and determination expressed multiple times in the original passage.\n- The setting is inaccurately described at one point, with a general reference to being in \"a house amongst strangers\" rather than the more specific context provided in the original."

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant sequence where Susan directly confronts Joanna (Hare-lip) with a strong rebuke, which is a distinct and impactful moment in the original. Instead, Susan's intervention is softened and merged with Mary Jane's, losing the escalation and the sense of multiple, separate confrontations.\n- The completion invents a new scene where Mary Jane and Susan sit beside the narrator and engage in a comforting conversation, which is not present in the original. This invented scene alters the emotional progression and the focus of the passage.\n- The completion introduces an invented internal monologue and emotional reaction from the narrator, including leaving the house and crying, which does not occur in the original passage.\n\n2.

INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The order of events is altered: the comforting and questioning by Mary Jane and Susan, and the narrator's emotional breakdown, are placed after the apology, whereas in the original, the focus remains on the apology and the narrator's internal resolve.\n- The dialogue is sometimes attributed to the wrong character or merged between characters, leading to confusion about who is speaking or acting at certain points.\n- The narrator's internal resolve is expressed with different motivations and actions, including invented physical actions (leaving and crying) that do not match the original sequence or tone."

About that time I hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the bed; I reached for it, but it wasn’t where I thought it would be; but I touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane’s frocks, so I jumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still.\nThey come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done was to get down and look under the bed. Then I was glad I hadn’t found the bed when I wanted it. And yet, you know, it’s kind of natural to hide under the bed when you are up to anything private. They sets down then, and the king says:\n“Well, what is it? And cut it middlin’ short, because it’s better for us to be down there a-whoopin’ up the mournin’ than up here givin’ ’em a chance to talk us over.”\n“Well, this is it, Capet. I ain’t easy; I ain’t comfortable. That doctor lays on my mind. I wanted to know your plans. I’ve got a notion, and I think it’s a sound one.”\n“What is it, duke?”\n“That we better glide out of this before three in the morning, and clip it down the river with what we’ve got. Specially, seeing we got it so easy—given back to us, flung at our heads, as you may say, when of course we allowed to have to steal it back. I’m for knocking off and lighting out.”\nThat made me feel pretty bad. About an hour or two ago it would a been a little different, but now it made me feel bad and disappointed, The king rips out and says:\n“What! And not sell out the rest o’ the property? March off like a passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous’n’ dollars’ worth o’ property layin’ around jest sufferin’ to be scooped in?—and all good, salable stuff, too.”\nThe duke he grumbled; said the bag of gold was enough, and he didn’t want to go no deeper—didn’t want to rob a lot of orphans of everything they had.\n“Why, how you talk!” says the king. “We sha’n’t rob ’em of nothing at all but jest this money. The people that buys the property is the suff’rers; because as soon ’s it’s found out ’at we didn’t own it—which won’t be long after we’ve slid—the sale won’t be valid, and it’ll all go back to the estate. These yer orphans ’ll git their house back agin, and that’s enough for them; they’re young and spry, and k’n easy earn a livin’. They ain’t a-goin to suffer. Why, jest think—there’s thous’n’s and thous’n’s that ain’t nigh so well off. Bless you, they ain’t got noth’n’ to complain of.”\nWell, the king he talked him blind; so at last he give in, and said all right, but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay, and that doctor hanging over them. But the king says:\n“Cuss the doctor! What do we k’yer for him? Hain’t we got all the fools in town on our side? And ain’t that a big enough majority in any town?”",

            "prefix-probing": "So, thinks I, I’ll go and search them rooms. I crept up the stairs as quiet as a mouse, my heart thumping so loud I was afeared it would wake the dead. The house was still, the only sound the ticking of the old clock in the hall. I paused at the top, listening, but there warn’t a sound from the rooms. I tried the first door, and it opened with a little creak. I slipped inside, holding my breath, and looked around. The moonlight slanted in through the window, making queer shadows on the floor. There warn’t nothing in that room but a bed and a chair, and a old chest in the corner. I tiptoed over and lifted the lid, but it was empty, save for some old clothes and a broken candlestick. I shut it soft and slipped out again.\n\nThe next room was locked, but I had seen the old man put the key on the mantel downstairs, so I crept back down, fetched it, and come up again. My hands was shaking so I could hardly fit the key in the lock, but at last it turned, and I pushed the door open. This room was darker, for the window was shuttered, but I could make out a table in the middle, and something on it. I went over and felt around, and my fingers touched a pile of papers and a little sack. I opened the sack, and my heart jumped—it was full of gold coins! I stuffed it in my pocket, and then looked at the papers. They was just old letters and bills, nothing worth taking. I put them back and turned to go, but then I heard a noise downstairs—a footstep, soft and slow.\n\nI froze, listening. The footstep come again, and then a voice, low and muttering. I slipped out of the room and down the hall, looking for a place to hide. There was a closet at the end, and I darted in, pulling the door to behind me. I could hear the footsteps coming up the stairs now, slow and careful. My breath was coming fast, and I tried to hold it in, afraid they’d hear me. The footsteps stopped outside the room I’d just left, and I heard the door creak open. There was a long silence, and then the footsteps come out again, and down the hall toward the closet. I shrank back, pressing myself against the wall, wishing I was anywhere but there.\n\nThe door opened a crack, and a shaft of light fell across my face. I shut my eyes tight, but the person didn’t see me—they just looked in, then shut the door again and went back down the stairs. I waited a long time, till I was sure they was gone, then slipped out and crept down the stairs myself. I could hear voices in the kitchen now, and the clatter of dishes. I slipped out the back door and into the yard, my heart still pounding. I run down to the river, and hid behind a big cottonwood, waiting to see if anyone was following. But the house stayed dark and quiet, and after a while I come out and made my way back to the raft, the sack of gold heavy in my pocket.\n\nJim was waiting for me, his eyes big and white in the dark. “What you got, Huck?” he whispered.\n\n“Never you mind,” I says. “We got to get out of here, quick.”\n\nWe pushed off into the river, the raft gliding silent in the moonlight. I looked back at the house, thinking how close I’d come to getting caught, and shivered. But I had the gold, and we was safe—for now. The river carried us away, and soon the house was just a shadow behind us, and the night closed in all around."

The real Wilks brothers are coming!\"\n\nThat set the whole crowd in a roar, and everybody rushed to the door to see. The king and the duke tried to push through, but the people held them back. I slipped out the side and ran around to the back, where Jim was waiting. I told him what was happening, and we both knew we had to get out of there quick.\n\nWe made for the river as fast as we could, keeping to the shadows. When we got to the raft, we pushed off and floated down the river, leaving the town and all its troubles behind. I felt mighty glad to be away from there, and Jim did, too. We didn't say much, but we both knew we was safe—for now, anyway."

The lid was shoved along about a foot, showing the dead man’s face down in there, with a wet cloth over it, and his shroud on. I tucked the money-bag in under the lid, just down beyond where his hands was crossed, which made me creep, they was so cold, and then I run back across the room and in behind the door.\nThe person coming was Mary Jane. She went to the coffin, very soft, and kneeled down and looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I see she begun to cry, though I couldn’t hear her, and her back was to me.

I sat down on the edge of my bed and thought about what I was going to do. Jim was out there, waiting for me, and I couldn’t let him down. I packed up my few things, rolling them up in my old jacket, and tied it with a piece of string. My heart was beating fast, but I kept telling myself to stay calm. I opened the window as quietly as I could, and slipped out onto the roof. The shingles were cool under my feet, and I moved slow, not wanting to slip or make any noise. I slid down the porch roof and dropped to the ground, landing soft in the grass. I crouched there for a minute, listening. Nothing but the sound of the river and the frogs. I crept around the house, keeping in the shadows, and made my way down to the path that led to the river. The trees were thick and dark, but I knew the way by heart. When I got to the clearing, I saw Jim waiting by the old sycamore, just like we planned. He looked nervous, but when he saw me, he smiled. We didn’t say nothing, just nodded to each other. We pushed the raft out into the water, and climbed aboard. The river was quiet and smooth, and we let the current take us. I felt free, like I was leaving all my troubles behind."

I see the coffin lid was the way it was before, but I dasn’t go to look in under it, with folks around.\nThen the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls took seats in the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an hour the people filed around slow, in single rank, and looked down at the dead man’s face a minute, and some dropped in a tear, and it was all very still and solemn, only the girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent, and sobbing a little. There warn’t no other sound but the scraping of the feet on the floor and blowing noses—because people always blows them more at a funeral than they do at other places except church.\nWhen the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the last touches, and getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable, and making no more sound than a cat. He never spoke; he moved people around, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done it with nods, and signs with his hands. Then he took his place over against the wall. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever see; and there warn’t no more smile to him than there is to a ham.\nThey had borrowed a melodeum—a sick one; and when everything was ready a young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and colicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only one that had a good thing, according to my notion. Then the Reverend Hobson opened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was only one dog, but he made a most powerful racket, and he kept it up right along; the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait—you couldn’t hear yourself think. It was right down awkward, and nobody didn’t seem to know what to do. But pretty soon they see that long-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say, “Don’t you worry—just depend on me.” Then he stooped down and begun to glide along the wall, just his shoulders showing over the people’s heads. So he glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more and more outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had gone around two sides of the room, he disappears down cellar. Then in about two seconds we heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or two, and then everything was dead still, and the parson begun his solemn talk where he left off. In a minute or two here comes this undertaker’s back and shoulders gliding along the wall again; and so he glided and glided around three sides of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his mouth with his hands, and stretched his neck out towards the preacher, over the people’s heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, “He had a rat!” Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his place. You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people, because naturally they wanted to know. A little thing like that don’t cost nothing, and it’s just the little things that makes a man to be looked up to and liked. There warn’t no more popular man in town than what that undertaker was.",

Then he begun to arrange the chairs for the people, and he sent a nigger out to borrow some more from the neighbors. They filled up the parlor, and the hall, and the little sitting-room, and even the dining-room, so there was a crowd. The undertaker, he never spoke; he just moved around, making signs with his hands and his head, and folks would jump and do what he wanted, and never make a sound. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever see; and there warn’t no more noise than if the room was empty. He looked kind of like a cat, the way he moved.\n\nI kept an eye on the coffin, but the lid was shut down tight, and I didn’t dare try to look under it with all the people around. By and by the people begun to file in, slow and solemn, and they went up to the coffin and looked in, and then set down. The girls and the “beats” was in the front row, and they was all quiet, with their handkerchiefs, and every now and then one of them would drop in a tear. It took a long time for everybody to get a chance, and all the while the undertaker kept gliding around, never saying a word, just making signs.\n\nThen the melodeum started up, and it was one of them old, wheezy things, and the tune warn’t much, and I didn’t think much of Peter for having it. The people sung a hymn, soft and low, and it sounded kind of mournful. Then Reverend Hobson got up and begun to preach, but just then there come a noise from the cellar—a dog barking and yelping, and folks all turned their heads. The undertaker, he made a little sign to the preacher, and then he glided out, down the hall and down the stairs, and you could hear him go. There was a thump, and then the dog quit, and everything was still again.\n\nThe undertaker come back, gliding along three sides of the room, with his hands folded and his head down, just as soft and solemn as ever. He never let on like anything had happened. Then he shaded his mouth with his hand and stretched his neck out toward the preacher, and says, in a kind of a soft whisper, “He had a rat!” The people all looked at him admiring, and I noticed how much folks think of a man that can do a little thing like that, and do it right, and never let on.\n\n---\n\n**End of simulated segment.**",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the initial mention of the widow Bartley and \"our tribe\" being present, which is a notable detail in the original early on.\n- The completion invents a sense of unease about whether the money has been found and the narrator needing to act natural, which is not present in the original passage.\n- The completion condenses or omits the detailed description of the undertaker's actions and the arrangement of the room, especially the process of setting the coffin on chairs and arranging the seating.\n- The completion leaves out the specific sequence where the undertaker glides around the room both before and after the cellar incident, including the detail of him gliding along three sides of the room after returning.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion does not mention the absence of anyone except the family, the widow, and the narrator's group, nor the narrator's attempt to read the faces for signs of recent events.\n- The process of borrowing chairs from neighbors and filling multiple rooms is only partially included; the original specifies the rooms and the extent of the crowd more clearly.\n- The completion omits the narrator's observation about the coffin lid and his reluctance to look under it with people around.\n- The description of the people filing past the coffin, the duration, and the specific actions (such as dropping a tear) are abbreviated or missing.\n- The original's description of the undertaker's mannerisms, including his silence, gestures, and the comparison to a cat, is not fully captured.\n- The detail about the melodeum being in poor condition and the narrator's opinion about Peter is missing.\n- The original's account of the undertaker making a sign to the preacher before dealing with the dog is not included.\n- The completion omits the undertaker shading his mouth and stretching his neck to deliver his explanation to the preacher after returning.\n- The final reflection on the undertaker's popularity and the value of small actions is shortened and lacks the original's nuance.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the completion, the mention of the King and the Duke being present is inaccurate; the original does not specify these individuals in this context.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the undertaker's actions and the arrangement of the room are compressed and not in the same order as the original.\n- The completion inaccurately describes the undertaker whispering directly to the preacher, rather than the more public gesture described in the original.\n- The completion attributes crying and holding on to each other to the girls and the \"beats,\" but does not accurately reflect the original's description of their actions and demeanor.\n- The description of the undertaker's return and the way he communicates about the dog is simplified and does not match the original's sequence or method.\n- The final reflection generalizes the townspeople's reaction, missing the specific observation about the undertaker's popularity and the impact of small actions."

            "prefix-probing": "I tiptoed through the hall, feeling mighty strange and lonesome, for the house was still as a graveyard, and the sun was just peeking in through the cracks of the shutters. I could hear the clock ticking in the parlor, and it sounded so loud it made me jump. I didn’t know what to do with myself, so I went out on the porch and sat down on the top step, looking out at the yard. The dew was still on the grass, and the air was cool and fresh, and it made me feel a little better. I could see the garden patch, and the smoke curling up from the kitchen chimney, and I knew Sally was up and about her work.\n\nAfter a while, I heard her calling me to breakfast, so I went in and washed up, and then sat down at the table. She was bustling around, setting out the dishes and talking a blue streak about the funeral and the folks that had come and gone, and how tired she was. I just nodded and said yes ma’am, and tried to eat, but I wasn’t very hungry. My mind kept wandering back to Jim, and whether he was safe, and what I was going to do next.\n\nAfter breakfast, I slipped out to the barn to see if I could find Tom. He wasn’t there, but I found a note he’d left for me, stuck in the feed box. It said he’d gone down to the creek to look for something, and I should meet him there if I could. I tucked the note in my pocket and made my way down the path, keeping an eye out for anybody that might be watching. The woods was quiet, except for the birds singing, and the sun was shining through the trees, making everything look bright and cheerful. It made me feel a little braver, like maybe things would turn out all right after all.\n\nWhen I got to the creek, I found Tom sitting on a log, whittling a stick. He looked up when he saw me and grinned. “Mornin’, Huck,” he said. “I been thinking about our plan. We got to be careful, or we’ll get caught sure.”\n\nI sat down beside him and told him about the watchers being gone, and the parlor being shut up. He nodded, and said that was a good sign, maybe folks was starting to forget about Jim, and we could make our move soon. We talked it over for a while, whispering so nobody could hear us, and decided we’d try to get Jim out that night, if everything went right.\n\nWe spent the rest of the day getting ready. Tom had all sorts of ideas about how to do it, some of them pretty wild, but I went along with him, because he was smart and always seemed to know what to do. We gathered up some food and a few tools, and hid them in the woods near the cabin where Jim was locked up. We had to be careful not to let anybody see us, and it made me nervous, but Tom just laughed and said it was all part of the adventure.\n\nThat night, after everybody had gone to bed, we slipped out of the house and made our way to the cabin. The moon was shining bright, and the shadows looked long and spooky. My heart was pounding so loud I thought for sure somebody would hear it. Tom led the way, creeping along the fence and keeping to the shadows. When we got to the cabin, we listened at the door, but everything was quiet inside.\n\nTom pulled out a key he’d made from a piece of tin, and tried it in the lock. It took a while, but finally it turned, and the door creaked open. We slipped inside, and there was Jim, sitting on the bed, looking scared and hopeful all at once. When he saw us, he jumped up and hugged us both, whispering, “I knowed you’d come, Huck. I just knowed it.”\n\nWe told him to keep quiet, and helped him gather his things. Then we slipped back out into the night, moving as fast and quiet as we could. The whole time, I kept thinking about what would happen if we got caught, but I pushed the thought away. We was doing the right thing, and that was all that mattered.\n\nBy the time we got to the edge of the woods, the sky was starting to lighten, and I knew we had to hurry. We made our way down to the river, where we’d hidden a raft, and pushed off into the current. As we floated away, I looked back at the house, and felt a strange mix of fear and relief. We was free, at least for now, and I hoped it would stay that way."

Then the duke says:\n“What, all of them?”\n“No—leastways, not all at once—that is, I don’t think I ever see them all come out at once but just one time.”\n“Hello! When was that?”\n“It was the day we had the funeral. In the morning. It warn’t early, because I overslept. I was just starting down the ladder, and I see them.”\n“Well, go on, go on! What did they do? How’d they act?”\n“They didn’t do nothing. And they didn’t act anyway much, as fur as I see. They tiptoed away; so I seen, easy enough, that they’d shoved in there to do up your majesty’s room, or something, s’posing you was up; and found you warn’t up, and so they was hoping to slide out of the way of trouble without waking you up, if they hadn’t already waked you up.”\n“Great guns, this is a go!” says the king; and both of them looked pretty sick and tolerable silly. They stood there a-thinking and scratching their heads a minute, and the duke he bust into a kind of a little raspy chuckle, and says:\n“It does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand. They let on to be sorry they was going out of this region! And I believed they was sorry, and so did you, and so did everybody.

You keep your head shet, and mind y’r own affairs—if you got any. Long as you’re in this town don’t you forgit that—you hear?” Then he says to the duke, “We got to jest swaller it and say noth’n’: mum’s the word for us.”\nAs they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again, and says:\n“Quick sales and small profits! It’s a good business—yes.”\nThe king snarls around on him and says:\n“I was trying to do for the best in sellin’ ’em out so quick.

            "prefix-probing": "Next day was auction day. The whole town seemed to be astir early, and by breakfast time the square was filling up with folks from the country and the neighboring villages, all come to see the sale. The King and the Duke, dressed in their best, strutted about with an air of importance, talking with the townspeople and making a great show of their grief for the late Peter Wilks. Mary Jane and her sisters, looking pale and troubled, kept mostly to themselves, but the crowd watched them with sympathy.\n\nThe auction was to be held in the parlor of the Wilks house, and by ten o’clock it was packed with people. The auctioneer, a sharp-eyed man with a loud voice, stood at the front, ready to begin. The King, acting as the girls’ guardian, made a little speech about how sorry he was to have to sell the property, but that it was his duty to carry out his dear brother’s wishes. The Duke nodded solemnly, and the crowd murmured their approval.\n\nFirst up were the household goods—furniture, silverware, and such. The bidding was lively, with neighbors eager to own a piece of the Wilks estate. Huck watched from a corner, feeling uneasy. He knew the King and the Duke were frauds, and it made him sick to see them selling off the girls’ things. He kept an eye on Mary Jane, who sat quietly, her hands folded in her lap, her eyes red from crying.\n\nAfter the household goods came the slaves. The crowd grew quiet as the auctioneer called out the first lot—a mother and her two children. The bidding was brisk, and soon they were sold to a farmer from down the river. Mary Jane turned away, unable to watch. Huck’s heart ached for her and for the family being torn apart.\n\nFinally, it was time for the house and the land. The King made another speech, talking about the fine qualities of the property and how he hoped it would go to someone who would cherish it as much as his dear brother had. The bidding was fierce, but in the end, a local merchant won the house, and a farmer bought the land.\n\nAs the auction ended, the King and the Duke congratulated the buyers and pocketed the money. The crowd began to disperse, some folks shaking their heads at the sadness of it all, others satisfied with their purchases. Mary Jane and her sisters disappeared upstairs, and Huck slipped out the back door, his mind racing.\n\nHe knew he had to do something. He couldn’t let the King and the Duke get away with their scheme. He found Mary Jane in her room, packing her things. She looked up when he entered, her face streaked with tears.\n\n“Miss Mary Jane,” Huck said, “I got something to tell you. It’s about them two men.”\n\nShe looked at him, hope flickering in her eyes. “What is it, Huck?”\n\n“They ain’t your uncles. They’re frauds. They’re just after your money.”\n\nMary Jane gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. “Are you sure?”\n\n“I’m sure. I seen them talking about it. They’re planning to leave as soon as they get the money.”\n\nMary Jane stood up, her eyes blazing. “We have to stop them.”\n\nHuck nodded. “I got a plan. But you got to trust me.”\n\nShe agreed, and together they worked out what to do. Huck would sneak out and find the real Wilks brothers, who were rumored to be on their way. Mary Jane would act as if nothing was wrong, so as not to arouse suspicion.\n\nThat night, Huck slipped out of the house and made his way to the river, where he found the real Wilks brothers just arriving. He told them everything, and they hurried back to the house.\n\nThe next morning, the town was in an uproar. The real Wilks brothers confronted the King and the Duke, and the townspeople demanded proof of who was who. There was much confusion, but in the end, the truth came out. The King and the Duke were exposed as frauds and run out of town.\n\nMary Jane and her sisters were overjoyed to have their property restored, and they thanked Huck for his help. Huck slipped away quietly, not wanting any thanks. He was just glad he could help set things right.\n\nAs he walked down the road, Huck felt a sense of relief. He had done the right thing, and for once, things had turned out all right. But he knew his adventures were far from over. There was still Jim to think about, and the long road ahead."

So I come down the ladder and started for down-stairs; but as I come to the girls’ room the door was open, and I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk, which was open and she’d been packing things in it—getting ready to go to England. But she had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap, and had her face in her hands, crying. I felt awful bad to see it; of course anybody would. I went in there and says:\n“Miss Mary Jane, you can’t a-bear to see people in trouble, and I can’t—most always. Tell me about it.”\nSo she done it. And it was the niggers—I just expected it.

And before I could budge she throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it again, say it again, say it again!\nI see I had spoke too sudden and said too much, and was in a close place. I asked her to let me think a minute; and she set there, very impatient and excited and handsome, but looking kind of happy and eased-up, like a person that’s had a tooth pulled out. So I went to studying it out. I says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks, though I ain’t had no experience, and can’t say for certain; but it looks so to me, anyway; and yet here’s a case where I’m blest if it don’t look to me like the truth is better and actuly safer than a lie. I must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time or other, it’s so kind of strange and unregular. I never see nothing like it. Well, I says to myself at last, I’m a-going to chance it; I’ll up and tell the truth this time, though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see where you’ll go to. Then I says:\n“Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways where you could go and stay three or four days?”\n“Yes; Mr. Lothrop’s. Why?”\n“Never mind why yet. If I’ll tell you how I know the niggers will see each other again inside of two weeks—here in this house—and prove how I know it—will you go to Mr. Lothrop’s and stay four days?”\n“Four days!” she says; “I’ll stay a year!”\n“All right,” I says, “I don’t want nothing more out of you than just your word—I druther have it than another man’s kiss-the-Bible.” She smiled and reddened up very sweet, and I says, “If you don’t mind it, I’ll shut the door—and bolt it.”\nThen I come back and set down again, and says:\n“Don’t you holler. Just set still and take it like a man. I got to tell the truth, and you want to brace up, Miss Mary, because it’s a bad kind, and going to be hard to take, but there ain’t no help for it. These uncles of yourn ain’t no uncles at all; they’re a couple of frauds—regular dead-beats. There, now we’re over the worst of it, you can stand the rest middling easy.”\nIt jolted her up like everything, of course; but I was over the shoal water now, so I went right along, her eyes a-blazing higher and higher all the time, and told her every blame thing, from where we first struck that young fool going up to the steamboat, clear through to where she flung herself on to the king’s breast at the front door and he kissed her sixteen or seventeen times—and then up she jumps, with her face afire like sunset, and says:\n“The brute! Come, don’t waste a minute—not a second—we’ll have them tarred and feathered, and flung in the river!”",

Well, I says to myself at last, I’m a-going to chance it; I’ll up and tell the truth this time, though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see where you’ll go to. Then I says:\n\n\"Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways, where you could go and stay three or four days?\"\n\n\"Yes; Mr. Lothrop’s. Why?\"\n\n\"Never mind why yet. If I’ll tell you something, will you do it?\"\n\n\"I’ll do anything you say.\"\n\n\"Do you reckon you could now, before you let your uncle see you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And not let anybody see you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Do you reckon you could go, right now, without letting anybody see you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Will you do it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I’ll tell you why. I’m going to tell you the truth. Then if you get into trouble, you can say you didn’t know anything about it. But if you stay here, they’ll make you tell.\"\n\n\"Oh, don’t be afraid of that. I’d die first! I wish I may die this minute if I would!\"\n\n\"It’s not that, Miss Mary Jane. It ain’t that at all. I wouldn’t want you to do that. But I want you to go, and I want you to promise me you’ll stay there till I send for you.\"\n\n\"I’ll do it, and I’ll do anything you say, if you’ll only tell me what’s the matter.\"\n\n\"Well, you see them two men yonder?—that’s the king and the duke—they ain’t your uncles at all—they’re a couple of frauds—regular dead-beats.\"\n\nMary Jane turned pale, but she didn’t scream nor faint. She stood there, and after a minute she says:\n\n\"Can you prove it?\"\n\n\"Yes, I can.\"\n\n\"Well, then, what are we waiting for? Let’s go and tell everybody.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, not now. Not yet. I don’t want them to know just yet. I want you to go away, and stay a little while, and I’ll tell you why afterwards.\"\n\nShe studied a minute, and then she says, kind of slow:\n\n\"I’ll do it. But I shall take the children with me.\"\n\n\"No, you won’t. You’ll leave them here.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because you’ll be safer. Besides, you mustn’t let on to anybody that you know anything.\"\n\nShe studied a while longer, and then she says:\n\n\"I’ll do it.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I says, \"now you’ll promise, and you won’t tell anybody?\"\n\nShe promised. Then I says:\n\n\"There’s one more thing—the proof. You said you’d do anything I say. Well, here’s what I want you to do. I want you to take this piece of paper and put it in your bosom. When you get to Mr. Lothrop’s, you send for me. I’ll come and tell you everything.\"\n\nShe took the paper and put it away. Then I told her all about how I’d found out everything, and how I’d fixed things, and she listened, and her eyes blazed up, and she says:\n\n\"The brute! Come, don’t waste a minute—not a second—we’ll have them tarred and feathered, and flung in the river!\"",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- In the middle of the passage, the completion omits a significant negotiation between the characters regarding the conditions for Mary Jane to leave and stay away, including the promise to provide proof and the emphasis on the importance of her word. Instead, the completion introduces a more generic exchange about doing as asked, which alters the structure and flow of the original scene.\n- The completion condenses and simplifies the sequence where the narrator prepares to reveal the truth, omitting the internal deliberation and the metaphorical comparison that adds depth to the original.\n- The completion skips over the detailed recounting of events that the narrator shares with Mary Jane, which is present in the original and provides important context for her reaction.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the narrator’s internal reflection on the risks and value of telling the truth versus lying, which is a key thematic element in the original.\n- The specific terms of the agreement between the narrator and Mary Jane, including the promise to provide proof and the narrator’s preference for her word over a formal oath, are missing.\n- The detailed summary of the events the narrator recounts to Mary Jane, which leads up to her emotional reaction, is not included.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of the negotiation is altered: the completion has Mary Jane agree to leave before the narrator explains the conditions or offers proof, which is not accurate to the original order of events.\n- The completion invents a line where the narrator asks Mary Jane to leave immediately and not let anyone see her, which is not present in the original.\n- The emotional response of Mary Jane is simplified; the completion omits the nuanced description of her appearance and feelings after the narrator’s initial revelation.\n- The completion inaccurately summarizes the narrator’s confession, skipping over the step-by-step recounting of events and instead jumping directly to Mary Jane’s reaction.\n- The ending compresses the events, omitting the gradual build-up to Mary Jane’s outburst and the narrator’s sense of relief after revealing the truth."

            "prefix-probing": "By-and-by it was getting-up time. I stirred and stretched, feeling the cool air of the river morning on my face. The sun was just peeking over the trees on the far bank, sending long streaks of gold across the water. Jim was already up, crouched by the fire, poking at the coals and humming a tune to himself. The smell of frying fish drifted over, making my stomach rumble. I sat up and looked around. The raft was tied up snug against the willows, and the world seemed peaceful and still, except for the soft lapping of the water and the occasional bird calling from the woods.\n\n\"Mornin', Jim,\" I said, rubbing my eyes.\n\n\"Mornin', Huck,\" he answered, grinning. \"You sleep good?\"\n\n\"Like a log,\" I said. \"What we got for breakfast?\"\n\n\"Catfish,\" he said, holding up a frying pan. \"Caught him 'fore sun-up.\"\n\nI grinned and got up, stretching my arms. I splashed some water on my face from the river, shivering at the cold, and then sat down by the fire. Jim handed me a tin plate with a hunk of fish and some cornbread. We ate in silence for a while, just listening to the sounds of the river and the woods waking up.\n\nAfter breakfast, we set about getting the raft ready. Jim checked the ropes and made sure everything was tied down, while I gathered up our things and packed them away. The sun was higher now, and the mist was lifting off the water, making everything look bright and new.\n\n\"We best get movin',\" Jim said. \"Don't want nobody to see us.\"\n\nI nodded. We untied the raft and pushed off, letting the current take us downstream. The river was wide and smooth, and the trees on either side leaned over, making a green tunnel. We drifted along, not saying much, just watching the world go by. Every now and then, we'd see a deer come down to the water to drink, or a flock of ducks flying overhead.\n\nAfter a while, Jim started talking about Cairo. He was hoping we'd reach it soon, so he could get to the free states. I listened, but I was thinking about all the things we'd seen and done so far. It seemed like we'd been on the river forever, just the two of us, with nothing but the sky and the water and the woods for company.\n\n\"Huck,\" Jim said after a while, \"you reckon we close to Cairo yet?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" I said. \"We must be gettin' close, though.\"\n\nWe kept a sharp lookout for signs of the town, but the river just kept winding on, mile after mile. Sometimes we'd see a steamboat churning up the water, or a little cabin on the bank, but mostly it was just trees and sky and water.\n\nAs the day wore on, it got hotter and hotter. The sun beat down, and the air was thick and still. We took turns lying in the shade of the tent, trying to keep cool. Jim told stories about his family, and I told him about the adventures I'd had with Tom Sawyer. We laughed and joked, and for a while, it felt like nothing could touch us.\n\nBut as the sun started to go down, I began to feel uneasy. The river was getting wider, and the banks were lower and flatter. I remembered what the man at the last town had said about Cairo being at the mouth of the Ohio River. I kept looking for the place where the two rivers met, but I couldn't see anything that looked like a town.\n\n\"Maybe we passed it,\" I said, worried.\n\nJim looked anxious. \"We can't have, Huck. We been watchin' close.\"\n\nWe drifted on, the sky turning pink and gold as the sun set. The river was quiet, and the only sound was the splash of the oars and the creak of the raft. I felt a lump in my throat, thinking about what would happen if we missed Cairo. Jim was counting on me to help him get to freedom, and I didn't want to let him down.\n\nAs darkness fell, we pulled the raft into the shadows and tied up for the night. We sat by the fire, not saying much, each of us lost in our own thoughts. The stars came out, bright and clear, and the river flowed on, silent and mysterious. I lay down on the raft, listening to the sounds of the night, and wondered what tomorrow would bring."

You tell me what to do, and whatever you say I’ll do it.”\n“Well,” I says, “it’s a rough gang, them two frauds, and I’m fixed so I got to travel with them a while longer, whether I want to or not—I druther not tell you why; and if you was to blow on them this town would get me out of their claws, and I’d be all right; but there’d be another person that you don’t know about who’d be in big trouble. Well, we got to save him, hain’t we? Of course. Well, then, we won’t blow on them.”\nSaying them words put a good idea in my head. I see how maybe I could get me and Jim rid of the frauds; get them jailed here, and then leave. But I didn’t want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard to answer questions but me; so I didn’t want the plan to begin working till pretty late to-night. I says:\n“Miss Mary Jane, I’ll tell you what we’ll do, and you won’t have to stay at Mr. Lothrop’s so long, nuther. How fur is it?”\n“A little short of four miles—right out in the country, back here.”\n“Well, that’ll answer. Now you go along out there, and lay low till nine or half-past to-night, and then get them to fetch you home again—tell them you’ve thought of something. If you get here before eleven put a candle in this window, and if I don’t turn up wait till eleven, and then if I don’t turn up it means I’m gone, and out of the way, and safe. Then you come out and spread the news around, and get these beats jailed.”\n“Good,” she says, “I’ll do it.”\n“And if it just happens so that I don’t get away, but get took up along with them, you must up and say I told you the whole thing beforehand, and you must stand by me all you can.”\n“Stand by you! indeed I will. They sha’n’t touch a hair of your head!” she says, and I see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said it, too.\n“If I get away I sha’n’t be here,” I says, “to prove these rapscallions ain’t your uncles, and I couldn’t do it if I was here. I could swear they was beats and bummers, that’s all, though that’s worth something. Well, there’s others can do that better than what I can, and they’re people that ain’t going to be doubted as quick as I’d be. I’ll tell you how to find them. Gimme a pencil and a piece of paper. There—‘Royal Nonesuch, Bricksville.’ Put it away, and don’t lose it. When the court wants to find out something about these two, let them send up to Bricksville and say they’ve got the men that played the Royal Nonesuch, and ask for some witnesses—why, you’ll have that entire town down here before you can hardly wink, Miss Mary. And they’ll come a-biling, too.”\nI judged we had got everything fixed about right now. So I says:\n“Just let the auction go right along, and don’t worry. Nobody don’t have to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction on accounts of the short notice, and they ain’t going out of this till they get that money; and the way we’ve fixed it the sale ain’t going to count, and they ain’t going to get no money. It’s just like the way it was with the niggers—it warn’t no sale, and the niggers will be back before long. Why, they can’t collect the money for the niggers yet—they’re in the worst kind of a fix, Miss Mary.”\n“Well,” she says, “I’ll run down to breakfast now, and then I’ll start straight for Mr. Lothrop’s.”",

I’m going to slip out and go to Mr. Lothrop’s, and you must stay here and not let on. Did you think I was going to run off and leave you?\"\n\nI never thought of anything else.

But it was no use; my head was all muddled up with worry and I couldn’t think straight.\n\nAfter a while, the king and the duke come in, laughing and talking, and I had to act like nothing was wrong. They asked me where Mary Jane was, and I said she’d gone to see a sick friend. They didn’t suspect anything, but I could see they was uneasy. They kept whispering together and looking at me out of the corners of their eyes.\n\nThat night I couldn’t sleep for thinking about Jim and Mary Jane and what was going to happen. I made up my mind that, come what might, I’d stick to Jim and help him out of his trouble, even if it got me into a heap of trouble myself.\n\nIn the morning, the king and the duke was up early, packing up the money and getting ready to clear out. I watched them close, and when they wasn’t looking, I slipped out and went to the place where Jim was kept. I told him to keep a stiff upper lip, and that I was going to get him out, if it took all summer.\n\nJim was mighty glad to see me, and he said he knew I’d come. That made me feel good, and I told him to keep quiet and wait for me. Then I slipped back to the house, and nobody missed me.\n\nAll day I watched for a chance to do something, but the king and the duke kept me busy, and I couldn’t get away. I was about to give up, when Mary Jane come back. She slipped me a note, and in it she said she’d told Mr. Lothrop everything, and he was going to help us. That made me feel a heap better, and I begun to think maybe we’d get out of this scrape after all.\n\nThat night, when everybody was asleep, I slipped out and went to Jim. We talked it over, and made up a plan. I was to get the key from the old woman, and let Jim out at midnight. Then we’d make for the river and get away in a canoe.\n\nEverything went just as we planned. I got the key, let Jim out, and we slipped down to the river. We found a canoe, and paddled away as quiet as we could. When the sun come up, we was miles down the river, and safe.\n\nI never felt so happy in my life. Jim was free, and I’d kept my promise to Mary Jane. I reckon that was about the best thing I ever done, and I was glad of it, too."

What was it?”\n“Why, it’s because you ain’t one of these leather-face people. I don’t want no better book than what your face is. A body can set down and read it off like coarse print. Do you reckon you can go and face your uncles when they come to kiss you good-morning, and never—”\n“There, there, don’t! Yes, I’ll go before breakfast—I’ll be glad to. And leave my sisters with them?”\n“Yes; never mind about them. They’ve got to stand it yet a while. They might suspicion something if all of you was to go. I don’t want you to see them, nor your sisters, nor nobody in this town; if a neighbor was to ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something. No, you go right along, Miss Mary Jane, and I’ll fix it with all of them. I’ll tell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles and say you’ve went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change, or to see a friend, and you’ll be back to-night or early in the morning.”\n“Gone to see a friend is all right, but I won’t have my love given to them.”\n“Well, then, it sha’n’t be.” It was well enough to tell her so—no harm in it. It was only a little thing to do, and no trouble; and it’s the little things that smooths people’s roads the most, down here below; it would make Mary Jane comfortable, and it wouldn’t cost nothing. Then I says: “There’s one more thing—that bag of money.”\n“Well, they’ve got that; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think how they got it.”\n“No, you’re out, there. They hain’t got it.”\n“Why, who’s got it?”\n“I wish I knowed, but I don’t. I had it, because I stole it from them; and I stole it to give to you; and I know where I hid it, but I’m afraid it ain’t there no more. I’m awful sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I’m just as sorry as I can be; but I done the best I could; I did honest. I come nigh getting caught, and I had to shove it into the first place I come to, and run—and it warn’t a good place.”\n“Oh, stop blaming yourself—it’s too bad to do it, and I won’t allow it—you couldn’t help it; it wasn’t your fault. Where did you hide it?”\nI didn’t want to set her to thinking about her troubles again; and I couldn’t seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach. So for a minute I didn’t say nothing; then I says:\n“I’d ruther not tell you where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, if you don’t mind letting me off; but I’ll write it for you on a piece of paper, and you can read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop’s, if you want to. Do you reckon that’ll do?”\n“Oh, yes.”\nSo I wrote: “I put it in the coffin. It was in there when you was crying there, away in the night. I was behind the door, and I was mighty sorry for you, Miss Mary Jane.”\nIt made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by herself in the night, and them devils laying there right under her own roof, shaming her and robbing her; and when I folded it up and give it to her I see the water come into her eyes, too; and she shook me by the hand, hard, and says:\n“Good-bye. I’m going to do everything just as you’ve told me; and if I don’t ever see you again, I sha’n’t ever forget you and I’ll think of you a many and a many a time, and I’ll pray for you, too!”—and she was gone.\nPray for me! I reckoned if she knowed me she’d take a job that was more nearer her size. But I bet she done it, just the same—she was just that kind. She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notion—there warn’t no back-down to her, I judge. You may say what you want to, but in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see; in my opinion she was just full of sand. It sounds like flattery, but it ain’t no flattery. And when it comes to beauty—and goodness, too—she lays over them all. I hain’t ever seen her since that time that I see her go out of that door; no, I hain’t ever seen her since, but I reckon I’ve thought of her a many and a many a million times, and of her saying she would pray for me; and if ever I’d a thought it would do any good for me to pray for her, blamed if I wouldn’t a done it or bust.",

I ain't in no danger.\"\n\nShe shook her head, and the tears come up into her eyes again. I felt so sorry for her I could have cried myself. But I knowed I mustn't, so I tried to cheer her up.\n\n\"Now, don't you worry,\" I says. \"I'll fix it all up. You just go along, and don't let on to nobody what you're up to.\"\n\nShe tried to smile again, and then she turned and went out of the room. I watched her go, and I felt like I was the meanest boy in the world, to be mixed up in such a business. But I knowed I had to see it through, for her sake.\n\nAfter she was gone, I set there a while, thinking. I knowed I had to act quick, for the king and the duke would be up soon, and then it would be too late. So I slipped out of the room, and went down the back stairs, and out the back door. I went around to the stable, and found the boy that tended the horses.\n\n\"Say,\" I says, \"where's the men that was here last night?\"\n\nHe looked at me kind of suspicious, but I says, \"It's all right. I'm one of the family.\"\n\nHe says, \"They went down to the river, to see about the boat.\"\n\nThat was just what I wanted to know. I thanked him, and went down to the river myself. I kept out of sight, and watched. Sure enough, there was the king and the duke, talking together, and looking mighty uneasy. I could see they was planning to get away, and I knowed I had to act quick.\n\nI slipped back to the house, and found Mary Jane in her room, packing up her things.\n\n\"It's all right,\" I says. \"They're fixing to leave. You just go on, and don't let on to nobody. I'll take care of the rest.\"\n\nShe looked at me, and I could see she was scared, but she tried to be brave.\n\n\"Thank you, Huck,\" she says. \"I don't know what I'd do without you.\"\n\nI felt my heart swell up, and I wanted to tell her everything, but I knowed I mustn't. So I just nodded, and slipped out of the room.\n\nI went down to the parlor, where the king and the duke was, and tried to act natural.\n\n\"Hello, boys,\" I says. \"What's the news?\"\n\nThey looked at me sharp, but I kept my face straight.\n\n\"Oh, nothing much,\" says the king. \"We're just fixing to go down to the boat, and see about our passage.\"\n\n\"That's a good idea,\" I says. \"I'll go along with you.\"\n\nThey didn't like that much, but they couldn't say nothing. So we all went down to the river together. When we got there, I watched them close, and I could see they was nervous. They kept looking around, like they was afraid somebody was watching them.\n\nPretty soon, a man come up, and says, \"Are you the gentlemen from England?\"\n\nThe king says, \"Yes, that's us.\"\n\nThe man says, \"There's some folks up at the house want to see you.\"\n\nThe king and the duke looked at each other, and I could see they was scared. But they couldn't do nothing but go. So we all went back up to the house.\n\nWhen we got there, the parlor was full of people. The real Wilks brothers had come, and there was a big row. Everybody was talking at once, and the king and the duke was trying to brazen it out. But it was no use. The people was onto them, and pretty soon they was grabbed and tied up.\n\nI slipped out of the room, and went to find Mary Jane. She was in her room, crying. I told her it was all over, and she was so glad she hugged me and cried some more.\n\n\"Oh, Huck,\" she says, \"how can I ever thank you?\"\n\nI felt so happy I didn't know what to say. But I just told her I was glad it was all right, and then I slipped out, for I didn't want nobody to see me.\n\nI went down to the river, and found Jim. He was waiting for me, and when he seen me, he was so glad he laughed and cried at the same time.\n\n\"Come on, Jim,\" I says. \"It's all over. We're free.\"\n\nSo we got into the canoe, and paddled down the river, feeling like we was the luckiest people in the world.\n\nBut I knowed it wasn't over yet. There was still more trouble ahead, but I didn't care. I had done what I set out to do, and I felt like I could face anything now.\n\nWe floated down the river, and the sun was shining, and the birds was singing, and I felt like I was in heaven. I knowed there would be more adventures, but I was ready for them. For I had learned that no matter how hard things get, you can always find a way out, if you just keep trying and don't give up."

Of course I would. I wouldn’t lose no time.”\n“Well, why wouldn’t you?”\n“Just look at it a minute, and maybe you can see. Hain’t your uncles obleegd to get along home to England as fast as they can? And do you reckon they’d be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that journey by yourselves? You know they’ll wait for you. So fur, so good. Your uncle Harvey’s a preacher, ain’t he? Very well, then; is a preacher going to deceive a steamboat clerk? is he going to deceive a ship clerk?—so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard? Now you know he ain’t. What will he do, then? Why, he’ll say, ‘It’s a great pity, but my church matters has got to get along the best way they can; for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus-unum mumps, and so it’s my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months it takes to show on her if she’s got it.’ But never mind, if you think it’s best to tell your uncle Harvey—”\n“Shucks, and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good times in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Jane’s got it or not? Why, you talk like a muggins.”\n“Well, anyway, maybe you’d better tell some of the neighbors.”\n“Listen at that, now. You do beat all for natural stupidness. Can’t you see that they’d go and tell? Ther’ ain’t no way but just to not tell anybody at all.”\n“Well, maybe you’re right—yes, I judge you are right.”\n“But I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey she’s gone out a while, anyway, so he won’t be uneasy about her?”\n“Yes, Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that.

The house was all in a bustle, with the king and the duke running around, pretending to be so sorry and so busy, and the girls crying and the neighbors coming and going. I slipped out the back door myself, and made my way around to the stable, where I found Mary Jane just as I expected. She was standing there, her face pale but her eyes bright, and she looked at me quick when I come up.\n\n\"Did you do it?\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, I done it. The money's safe, and you don't need to worry. But you mustn't let on to anybody. Just go on like nothing's happened, and keep your mind easy.\"\n\nShe nodded, and I could see she was trying to be brave, but her hands trembled a little. I told her to go back to the house by the front way, so nobody would suspect anything, and she slipped off through the garden, her head held high.\n\nI waited a minute, then I went back around to the kitchen, and slipped in as quiet as I could. The king and the duke was in the parlor, talking low, and the girls was upstairs. I listened at the door, and heard the king say:\n\n\"We got to get that money tonight, and be off before daylight.\"\n\n\"But where is it?\" the duke said. \"You said you put it in the straw tick, but I looked and it ain't there.\"\n\n\"Sh!\" says the king. \"Somebody might hear. We'll look again when the house is quiet.\"\n\nI slipped away from the door, my heart thumping. I had to get that money out of the house before they found it. I waited till it was dark, and everybody was in bed, then I crept up to the room where I'd hid the money. I listened at the door, but all was still. I slipped in, and felt under the bed for the bag. It was there, just where I'd left it.\n\nI took it up, and tiptoed out into the hall. The stairs creaked under my feet, and I held my breath, but nobody stirred. I made it down to the kitchen, and out the back door. The night was dark, and the wind rustled in the trees. I made my way to the garden, and dug a hole under the ash tree, and buried the bag deep. Then I covered it up, and smoothed the dirt, and crept back to the house.\n\nNext morning, the king and the duke was in a bad way. They searched high and low, but couldn't find the money. They accused the girls, and the servants, and even me, but I kept my mouth shut. Mary Jane looked at me once, and I gave her a little nod, and she smiled, just a little.\n\nThe town was all in a stir, with folks coming and going, and talk of the auction. The king and the duke was getting nervous, and I could see they was fixing to leave soon. I had to act fast.\n\nI found Mary Jane in the parlor, and told her to meet me in the garden after dark. She agreed, and that night we met under the ash tree. I dug up the bag, and handed it to her.\n\n\"Take this,\" I said. \"It's yours, and your sisters'. Don't let anybody see you. Hide it somewhere safe.\"\n\nShe took the bag, her hands shaking, and thanked me with tears in her eyes. \"I don't know how to thank you, Huck,\" she said. \"You've saved us all.\"\n\n\"Don't say nothing about it,\" I said. \"Just keep quiet, and everything will be all right.\"\n\nShe slipped away into the night, and I watched her go, feeling proud and a little scared. I knew the king and the duke would be furious when they found out, but I didn't care. I'd done what I had to do.\n\nNext day, the auction was held, and the king and the duke sold everything they could lay hands on. But when it come time to leave, the townsfolk got suspicious. They started asking questions, and pretty soon the whole place was in an uproar.\n\nThe king and the duke tried to slip away, but the crowd caught them, and there was a big row. I slipped out the back, and made my way down to the river, where Jim was waiting. We got in the canoe, and pushed off into the night, leaving the town behind.\n\nAs we floated down the river, I told Jim all that had happened, and he laughed and slapped his knee. \"Dat's de way, Huck,\" he said. \"You done good.\"\n\nI felt good, too, knowing I'd helped Mary Jane and her sisters, and got the best of the king and the duke. The river was quiet, and the stars shone overhead, and I felt free and easy, like I always did when I was on the water with Jim.\n\nWe floated on, leaving the troubles behind, and looking forward to whatever lay ahead."

Here is a 494-word passage inspired by the style and themes of \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,\" continuing in the spirit of the novel:\n\nI set there, thinking and thinking, and the more I thought, the more mixed up I got. The river was quiet, just a little slap of water against the side of the raft now and then, and the moon was climbing up slow, making everything look silvery and strange. Jim was laying over by the fire, humming soft to himself, and I could see the smoke curling up in the moonlight. It made me feel lonesome, but not in a bad way—just the kind of lonesome you get when you know you’re free and there ain’t nobody to bother you.\n\nI got to thinking about all the things that had happened since I left home, and how Pap would be mad if he knew I was out here, floating down the river with Jim. But then I remembered how Pap used to treat me, and I didn’t feel so bad. Jim was a good friend, better than most folks I’d ever known, and I reckoned I’d rather be here with him than anywhere else.\n\nAfter a while, Jim sat up and looked at me. “Huck,” he says, “what you reckon we gon’ do when we gets to Cairo?”\n\nI shrugged. “I don’t know, Jim. I guess we’ll just keep going, see what happens. Maybe we’ll find a place where nobody knows us, and we can start over.”\n\nJim nodded, but he looked worried. “I hopes so, Huck. I sure do. I been thinkin’ ‘bout my family. I wonder if I ever see ‘em again.”\n\nThat made me feel bad, ‘cause I knew how much Jim missed his folks. I tried to cheer him up. “Don’t you worry, Jim. We’ll get you to a free state, and then you can send for ‘em. Everything’s gonna work out.”\n\nJim smiled a little, but I could tell he was still thinking about his family. I didn’t know what else to say, so I just poked at the fire with a stick and watched the sparks fly up into the night. The river kept on flowing, steady and sure, and I figured as long as we kept moving, we’d be all right.\n\nAfter a while, we both got quiet, just listening to the sounds of the night. There was a owl hooting somewhere up in the trees, and every now and then a fish would jump, making a little splash. It was peaceful, and I felt like maybe things weren’t so bad after all.\n\nI laid back and looked up at the stars, thinking about all the adventures we’d had, and all the ones still to come. The world was big, and there was plenty of room for folks like me and Jim. As long as we stuck together, I reckoned we could handle whatever came our way.\n\nAnd with that thought, I closed my eyes and let the river carry us on into the night, not knowing what tomorrow would bring, but feeling ready for it all the same."

They gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for the graveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the whole town at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only nine in the evening.\nAs we went by our house I wished I hadn’t sent Mary Jane out of town; because now if I could tip her the wink she’d light out and save me, and blow on our dead-beats.\nWell, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on like wildcats; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up, and the lightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongst the leaves. This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever was in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different from what I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time if I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to save me and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in the world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks. If they didn’t find them—\nI couldn’t bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn’t think about nothing else. It got darker and darker, and it was a beautiful time to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by the wrist—Hines—and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip. He dragged me right along, he was so excited, and I had to run to keep up.\nWhen they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it like an overflow. And when they got to the grave they found they had about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn’t thought to fetch a lantern. But they sailed into digging anyway by the flicker of the lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house, a half a mile off, to borrow one.\nSo they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and the rain started, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightning come brisker and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but them people never took no notice of it, they was so full of this business; and one minute you could see everything and every face in that big crowd, and the shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave, and the next second the dark wiped it all out, and you couldn’t see nothing at all.\nAt last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid, and then such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was, to scrouge in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way, it was awful. Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so, and I reckon he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited and panting.\nAll of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare, and somebody sings out:\n“By the living jingo, here’s the bag of gold on his breast!”\nHines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist and give a big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I lit out and shinned for the road in the dark there ain’t nobody can tell.",

            "prefix-probing": "So I set there and watched, and by and by the moon went away behind a cloud, and it got darker than a wolf’s mouth. I never see the beat of it to be so still and lonesome. I made up my mind I wouldn’t try to get out by the window, but just set still and wait for the old man to come in, and then see if I couldn’t slip out when he warn’t noticing. Well, I set there a long time, and I heard the clock away off in the town go boom—boom—boom—twelve licks; and all still again—stiller than ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees—something was a stirring. I set still and listened. Directly I could just barely hear a “me-yow! me-yow!” down there. That was good! Says I, “me-yow! me-yow!” as soft as I could, and then I put out the light and scrambled out of the window onto the shed. Then I slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough, there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.\n\nHe said he’d been there a considerable time, and was afeared I’d given him the slip. I told him how I’d been fixed, and he said it was all right. We went along down the hill, and by and by found a lantern hanging on a tree, and a bunch of boys—Jim Turner, Ben Rogers, and two or three more—most of them asleep, but some of them keeping watch. Tom said we was to go on and get in the gang. I was most ready to cry, but all at once I thought of the old man and how he’d be mad if he found me gone, and I felt better. We crept in among the boys and was as still as mice. Tom made a sign, and we all got up and followed him out to a little old tumble-down log house back in the woods. We went in, and there was a candle burning on the floor, and Tom took it up and looked around. He said he’d picked this place because it was so secret and lonesome, and because it was just the place for a gang to meet.\n\nThen he made us all swear to keep the secret, and if anybody told, he must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with blood. Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got it out of his own head. He said, some of it, but the rest was out of books, and that’s the way with all the gangs. They always get their oaths out of books. Tom said he’d start a band of robbers, and call it “Tom Sawyer’s Gang.” Everybody was willing. So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on, and read it, and we all signed it with blood, because that was the way they did in the books, and nobody could be in the gang that hadn’t signed with blood.\n\nNow, says Ben Rogers, “what’s the line of business of this Gang?”\n\n“Nothing only robbery and murder,” Tom said.\n\n“But who are we going to rob?—houses, or cattle, or—”\n\n“Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain’t robbery; it’s burglary,” says Tom Sawyer. “We ain’t burglars. That ain’t no sort of style. We are highwaymen. We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks on, and kill the people and take their watches and money.”\n\n“Must we always kill the people?”\n\n“Oh, certainly. It’s best. Some authorities think different, but mostly it’s considered best to kill them—except some that you bring to the cave here, and keep them till they’re ransomed.”\n\n“Ransomed? What’s that?”\n\n“I don’t know. But that’s what they do. I’ve seen it in books; and so of course that’s what we’ve got to do.”"

Jump up and crack yo’ heels if you feels like it.\"\n\n\"We got to cut loose, Jim, there ain’t a minute to lose.\"\n\nHe was a-busting for joy, but I says:\n\n\"Don’t waste no time—set her loose!\"\n\nAnd so he did. We was free again, and nobody to bother us. I hadn’t had a bite to eat since I was gone, so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk, and pork and cabbage and greens—there ain’t nothing in the world so good when it’s cooked right—and whilst I eat my supper we talked, and had a good time. I was powerful glad to get away from the town, and I warn’t feeling no ways tired—I was just as full of life as a cricket.",

The trees on each side of the road seemed to reach out their long arms to snatch at me as I went by, and the wind whipped the rain into my face so hard it stung like a thousand needles. Every now and then the lightning would flare up, turning the whole world white for a second, and I'd see the road stretching ahead, slick and shining, and the black trunks of the trees standing up like ghosts. Then it would be dark again, and I'd be running blind, just trusting my feet to keep me in the middle of the road.\n\nI didn't dare stop, not for a minute. I kept thinking about Jim, and how he was waiting for me, and how we had to get away before anybody found out where we was. The thunder kept booming and rolling, and sometimes it sounded like it was right over my head, and sometimes like it was chasing me down the road. I was wet through and through, and my clothes stuck to me like they was glued on, but I didn't care. All I wanted was to get to the river, and to Jim, and to be safe.\n\nAfter a while I began to get out of breath, and my legs felt like they was made of lead, but I kept on. I could see the river now and then, when the lightning flashed, and it looked black and wild, with the wind whipping up the waves. I knew the raft was tied up just below the point, and I aimed straight for it. At last I got to the place where the path turned off from the road and went down to the water. I slipped and slid in the mud, and nearly went down more than once, but I held on to the bushes and kept going.\n\nWhen I got to the raft, Jim was there, just as I hoped. He was huddled up under the tent, trying to keep dry, but he jumped up when he saw me. \"Is dat you, honey?\" he says. \"I's been pow'ful skeered somethin' happen to you.\" I told him I was all right, and we got the raft loose and pushed off into the river, glad to be away from the road and the storm and everything else."

You done it, and you got to say you done it, or—”\nThe king began to gurgle, and then he gasps out:\n“’Nough!—I own up!”\nI was very glad to hear him say that; it made me feel much more easier than what I was feeling before. So the duke took his hands off and says:\n“If you ever deny it again I’ll drown you. It’s well for you to set there and blubber like a baby—it’s fitten for you, after the way you’ve acted. I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble everything—and I a-trusting you all the time, like you was my own father. You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot of poor niggers, and you never say a word for ’em. It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to believe that rubbage. Cuss you, I can see now why you was so anxious to make up the deffisit—you wanted to get what money I’d got out of the Nonesuch and one thing or another, and scoop it all!”\nThe king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:\n“Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffisit; it warn’t me.”\n“Dry up! I don’t want to hear no more out of you!” says the duke. “And now you see what you got by it. They’ve got all their own money back, and all of ourn but a shekel or two besides. G’long to bed, and don’t you deffersit me no more deffersits, long ’s you live!”\nSo the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort, and before long the duke tackled his bottle; and so in about a half an hour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got, the lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other’s arms. They both got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn’t get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag again. That made me feel easy and satisfied. Of course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble, and I told Jim everything.",

            "prefix-probing": "But that warn’t no matter. I got to thinking over our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me, all the time: in the day, and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we a-floating along, talking, and singing, and laughing. But somehow I couldn’t seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the other kind. I’d see him standing my watch on top of his’n, ‘stead of calling me so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the only one he’s got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.\n\nIt was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I was a-trembling, because I’d got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself:\n\n“All right, then, I’ll go to hell”—and tore it up.\n\nIt was awful thoughts, and awful words, but they was said. And I let them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming. I shoved the whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again, which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn’t. And for a starter, I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again; and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.\n\nThen I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that suited me. So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my raft and started for it. I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and hid my raft, and then struck through the woods and made for the house where they was keeping Jim. I crept up to the window and looked in, and there I see him, chained by the leg, and asleep, and two men with guns sitting by, and another one asleep on a bed. I studied a bit, and then crept back to the woods and waited for my chance.\n\nIt warn’t long before I heard the men talking about going out to hunt, and pretty soon they all went out, and I slipped in and got Jim loose, and we made a break for the woods. We run and run, and didn’t stop till we was clean out of sight and hearing. Then we set down and rested, and Jim said:\n\n“Huck, you’s de bes’ fren’ ole Jim ever had, en you’s de only fren’ he’s got now.”\n\nI felt so glad I could’ve cried, but I didn’t. I just said I was mighty glad to see him free again, and we shook hands, and then we started for the raft, and by and by we was a-floating down the river again, free and easy, and feeling mighty good."

I wished I could get away from them, but I didn’t see no way. The river was high, and the nights was dark, and I didn’t dare to try it. So I just watched and waited, and tried to keep out of their way. One night, after they’d been talking a long time, the king says, “It’s all right, I reckon. We’ll try it in the morning.” The duke nodded, and they both looked at me sharp, but I pretended not to notice. I made up my mind to keep my eyes open, and if I got a chance to slip away, I’d take it, no matter what. But for now, I just had to wait and see what they was up to."

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The original includes a clear time marker (midday) and the protagonist’s reaction to the king’s absence, which is missing in the completion.\n- The process of searching for the king in the village and the gradual discovery of his situation is not fully represented.\n- The original contains a detailed description of the protagonist’s actions and emotions upon returning and finding Jim gone, including multiple calls and frantic searching, which are only briefly mentioned in the completion.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes dialogue and thoughts to the duke that are not present in the original, such as suggesting the king might be in trouble at the tavern.\n- The sequence of the quarrel between the duke and the king is altered, with invented threats of fighting and more mutual insults than in the original.\n- The protagonist’s actions after leaving the quarrel are simplified, omitting the urgency and specific physical reactions described in the original.\n- The completion omits the protagonist’s direct command to Jim and the lack of response, as well as the repeated attempts to find Jim, which are important to the emotional impact of the scene."

Jim had a notion to slip down into the water and swim ashore, if we could find a good place; but the night was so dark, and the current so swift, that we judged it best to wait till daylight. We laid low, and kept still, listening to the noises of the night. The river was whispering along the banks, and now and then a fish would jump, making a little splash that sounded mighty loud in the stillness. Every now and then, a dog would bark off in the distance, or a bullfrog would croak, and it made me feel lonesome and sort of scared, too.\n\nAfter a while, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and we could see the outlines of the trees along the shore, black and tall against the silver water. Jim said he reckoned we was close to an island, and maybe we could land there and hide out for a spell. I was agreeable, for I was getting tired of laying so still, and my legs was cramped up. We waited till the raft drifted in close to the bank, and then Jim took the pole and pushed us in among the willows. We tied up, and slipped off onto the soft mud, quiet as could be.\n\nWe crept up the bank, keeping low, and listened. Everything was still, except for the night sounds. I felt my heart thumping, and I wondered if anybody was watching us from the darkness. But we didn't see nor hear nothing, so we made our way into the trees, looking for a good place to hide till morning. Jim said we ought to keep together, and I agreed, for I didn't want to be left alone in that spooky place."

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents atmospheric details and internal reflections that are not present in the original, such as the river \"whispering outside\" and the narrator feeling \"all hollow inside.\" These embellishments shift the tone and focus away from the original sequence of thoughts.\n- The completion omits the explicit mention of the narrator's mental struggle to find a solution, which is a key part of the original's early structure.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the narrator's detailed reasoning about why writing to Tom Sawyer and involving Miss Watson would not help Jim, specifically the two reasons related to Miss Watson's likely reaction and the social consequences for Jim.\n- The passage lacks the narrator's explicit self-reflection about the consequences for himself if his actions were discovered, particularly the imagined scenario of being shamed by people from his town.\n- The completion does not fully capture the narrator's realization about Providence and the sense of being watched and judged from above, which is a pivotal moment in the original.\n- The internal debate about being brought up wicked versus the responsibility to have learned better through Sunday school is only partially represented and lacks the progression found in the original.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion introduces the idea of writing to Tom Sawyer earlier and with less detail, and the reasoning for and against it is condensed and partially inaccurate.\n- The completion attributes the sale of Jim directly to the narrator's trust, which is not the focus in the original.\n- The narrator's feelings of guilt and fear are generalized and dramatized, rather than following the specific progression of conscience and fear of divine judgment found in the original.\n- The completion introduces invented dialogue and internal monologue that do not match the original's structure or content, particularly in the closing lines."

It warn’t long before I got to wishing I was out of that cabin and back on the raft, floating down the river, with the stars shining overhead and the water making that soft, sleepy kind of noise against the logs. I got to thinking about all the things me and Jim had been through together, and how he’d always been there for me, even when I didn’t deserve it.\n\nAfter a while, I heard a noise outside, and I crept over to the window to peek out. It was just the wind rustling through the trees, but it made me feel even more lonesome. I started to wonder what Jim was doing right then, and if he was thinking about me, too. I reckoned he was, because we’d been through so much together, and you can’t go through things like that without caring about each other.\n\nI sat back down and tried to read, but I couldn’t keep my mind on the words. My thoughts kept drifting back to the river, and the freedom I’d felt out there. It seemed like everything was better on the raft, even when we was in trouble. There was something about being out in the open, with nothing but the sky above and the water below, that made all the rest of the world seem far away and not so important.\n\nI got to thinking about the time we’d run into the duke and the king, and all the tricks they’d played. I remembered how Jim had always tried to look out for me, even when he was scared himself. It made me feel bad for the way I’d treated him sometimes, and I wished I could tell him I was sorry.\n\nThe night wore on, and I couldn’t sleep. I kept hearing little noises, and every time I did, I hoped it was Jim coming back. But it never was. I started to feel like maybe I’d never see him again, and that made me feel worse than ever. I thought about running away, but I didn’t know where I’d go. The world seemed like a big, empty place without Jim in it.\n\nFinally, I must have dozed off, because the next thing I knew, it was morning. The sun was shining through the window, and I could hear birds singing outside. For a minute, I forgot where I was, and I thought I was back on the raft. But then I remembered, and the old lonesome feeling came back. I reckoned I’d have to figure out what to do next, but I knew one thing for sure: I wasn’t going to give up on Jim. Not after all we’d been through together."

So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my raft and went for it, and hid there, and watched the lights of the town, and waited for the moon to rise. I made up my mind that I wouldn’t let Jim see me till I’d got everything fixed, and then I’d go and fetch him. I set there and watched the town, and waited, and waited, till I reckoned it was most midnight. Then I got my canoe and slipped over the river, and paddled up along shore, past the wood-yard, and in under the bank, and fetched up in the shadow of the trees, and laid quiet as a mouse. I reckoned if Tom Sawyer was there, he would a’ said, \"Now you’re a-slingin’ yourself in for it, you old rip!\""

But I didn’t mind, because I didn’t want to see nobody just yet—I only wanted to get the lay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from the village, not from below. So I just took a look, and shoved along, straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was the duke. He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch—three-night performance—like that other time. They had the cheek, them frauds! I was right on him before I could shirk. He looked astonished, and says:\n“Hel-lo! Where’d you come from?” Then he says, kind of glad and eager, “Where’s the raft?—got her in a good place?”\nI says:\n“Why, that’s just what I was going to ask your grace.”\nThen he didn’t look so joyful, and says:\n“What was your idea for asking me?” he says.\n“Well,” I says, “when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says to myself, we can’t get him home for hours, till he’s soberer; so I went a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait. A man up and offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat, and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after him. We didn’t have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the country till we tired him out. We never got him till dark; then we fetched him over, and I started down for the raft. When I got there and see it was gone, I says to myself, ‘they’ve got into trouble and had to leave; and they’ve took my nigger, which is the only nigger I’ve got in the world, and now I’m in a strange country, and ain’t got no property no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;’ so I set down and cried. I slept in the woods all night. But what did become of the raft, then?—and Jim—poor Jim!”\n“Blamed if I know—that is, what’s become of the raft. That old fool had made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the doggery the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but what he’d spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night and found the raft gone, we said, ‘That little rascal has stole our raft and shook us, and run off down the river.’”\n“I wouldn’t shake my nigger, would I?—the only nigger I had in the world, and the only property.”\n“We never thought of that. Fact is, I reckon we’d come to consider him our nigger; yes, we did consider him so—goodness knows we had trouble enough for him. So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke, there warn’t anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another shake. And I’ve pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn.

The house was big and white, with a long porch and green blinds, and there was a garden out front with rows of beans and corn, and a patch of sunflowers by the fence. I could hear chickens clucking somewhere, and a dog barking off in the distance, but there wasn’t a soul in sight. I slipped around to the back, keeping close to the wall, and found the kitchen door standing open. I listened a minute, but all I could hear was the ticking of a clock and the faint sound of somebody moving about upstairs.\n\nI was just about to make a break for it when I heard footsteps coming down the stairs. I ducked behind a rain barrel and waited, holding my breath. The footsteps came closer, and then a woman stepped out onto the porch, shading her eyes with her hand and looking out over the yard. She was middle-aged, with a kind face and a checked apron, and she called out, “Sally! Sally, where are you?”\n\nThere was no answer, so she went back inside, and I took my chance. I slipped up onto the porch and knocked at the door, trying to look as innocent as I could. In a minute the woman came back, and when she saw me she gave a little start.\n\n“Why, who are you?” she said. “Where’d you come from?”\n\nI made up a story quick as lightning. “I’m Tom,” I said. “Tom Sawyer. I’m a-comin’ from the steamboat. My folks sent me ahead to let you know we was on the way.”\n\nShe clapped her hands together and looked mighty pleased. “Well, I never! It’s Tom Sawyer, sure enough! Why, we was expectin’ you every day. Come right in, child, come right in!”\n\nShe led me into the parlor, where it was cool and dark, and made me sit down in a big rocking chair. She bustled around, asking me questions about my journey and if I was hungry, and I answered as best I could, trying to remember all the things Tom had told me about his aunt and uncle. She brought me a plate of biscuits and honey, and a glass of milk, and I ate like I hadn’t seen food in a week.\n\nWhile I was eating, she kept talking, telling me about the farm and the crops and how they’d been waiting for Tom to come visit. I nodded and smiled, hoping I wouldn’t give myself away. After a while, a man came in from the fields, wiping his forehead with a red handkerchief. He was tall and thin, with a kindly face and a slow, easy way of talking.\n\n“Well, well,” he said, “so this is Tom Sawyer, is it? We’re mighty glad to see you, boy.”\n\nI shook his hand and tried to look like I belonged, but inside I was nervous as a cat. I didn’t know how long I could keep up the act, but I reckoned I’d have to try. I needed their help if I was going to save Jim, and I couldn’t let on who I really was. So I smiled and said, “Yes, sir, I’m Tom Sawyer, and I’m powerful glad to be here.”"

That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and the money’s gone.”\n“Sold him?” I says, and begun to cry; “why, he was my nigger, and that was my money. Where is he?—I want my nigger.”\n“Well, you can’t get your nigger, that’s all—so dry up your blubbering. Looky here—do you think you’d venture to blow on us? Blamed if I think I’d trust you. Why, if you was to blow on us—”\nHe stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes before. I went on a-whimpering, and says:\n“I don’t want to blow on nobody; and I ain’t got no time to blow, nohow. I got to turn out and find my nigger.”\nHe looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering on his arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead. At last he says:\n“I’ll tell you something. We got to be here three days. If you’ll promise you won’t blow, and won’t let the nigger blow, I’ll tell you where to find him.”\nSo I promised, and he says:\n“A farmer by the name of Silas Ph—” and then he stopped. You see, he started to tell me the truth; but when he stopped that way, and begun to study and think again, I reckoned he was changing his mind. And so he was. He wouldn’t trust me; he wanted to make sure of having me out of the way the whole three days. So pretty soon he says:\n“The man that bought him is named Abram Foster—Abram G. Foster—and he lives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.”\n“All right,” I says, “I can walk it in three days. And I’ll start this very afternoon.”\n“No you wont, you’ll start now; and don’t you lose any time about it, neither, nor do any gabbling by the way.

I wanted to be left free to work my plans.\n“So clear out,” he says; “and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want to. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim is your nigger—some idiots don’t require documents—leastways I’ve heard there’s such down South here. And when you tell him the handbill and the reward’s bogus, maybe he’ll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for getting ’em out. Go ’long now, and tell him anything you want to; but mind you don’t work your jaw any between here and there.”",

I was powerful hungry, and the sun was getting higher and hotter, and I began to feel weak and sort of dizzy. I wished I hadn’t given him the whole ten cents, but it was too late now.\n\nAfter a while, I saw him coming back, with a paper bag in his hand. He grinned when he saw me, and said, “Here you go, young feller. I got some bread and cheese, and a hunk of cold meat. That’ll set you up.”\n\nI thanked him, and we sat down together and ate. It tasted mighty good, and I felt a heap better after I’d had something in my stomach. While we ate, he told me about himself. He said his name was Bill, and he was a journeyman carpenter, but work was scarce, and he’d been tramping around looking for a job. He said he was heading for St. Louis, where he heard there was work to be had.\n\nI told him I was going that way myself, and he said we might as well travel together for a spell. I was glad of that, for I didn’t much like being alone, and he seemed like a good sort. After we finished eating, we started off down the road together.\n\nWe hadn’t gone far when we came to a little creek, and Bill said we’d better stop and wash up. We knelt down and splashed water on our faces and hands, and I felt a lot fresher. Then we went on again, talking as we walked. Bill told me stories about the places he’d been and the people he’d met, and I listened, for I liked to hear about such things.\n\nBy and by, we came to a fork in the road. Bill said he was going to take the left-hand road, because it led more direct to St. Louis. I said I’d go with him, and we struck out that way. The country was pretty, with fields and woods and little farmhouses here and there. The birds were singing, and the air was sweet and warm.\n\nAfter a while, we saw a wagon coming along the road, and Bill said maybe we could get a ride. We waited till it came up, and Bill hailed the driver, a farmer with a load of hay. He said he’d give us a lift as far as he was going, so we climbed up and rode along, feeling pretty comfortable. I was glad to be off my feet for a while, and I leaned back and watched the clouds drift by, feeling contented and hopeful for the first time in a good while."

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the detailed description of the narrator being surrounded by the dogs, including the imagery of being at the center of a circle formed by the dogs and the sense of chaos as more dogs arrive. This vivid scene is condensed and lacks the original's structure.\n- The completion invents dialogue and actions for the woman with the rolling-pin that are not present in the original, such as her calling the narrator \"mean trash\" and asking who he wants to see. It also adds invented instructions for the narrator to go into the house and see the mistress, which are not in the original.\n- The completion adds a new interaction where the narrator smiles at the children and they smile back, which is not present in the original passage.\n- The completion invents additional dialogue and actions for the white woman, including her asking the narrator to take off his hat and making further comments about his appearance, which are not in the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the specific sequence where the narrator describes the dogs forming a circle around him, the number of dogs, and the way more dogs are arriving from different directions.\n- The actions of the woman with the rolling-pin are simplified; the original includes her calling specific dogs by name and physically dispersing them, which is not fully captured.\n- The return of some of the dogs to be friendly with the narrator after being chased away is missing.\n- The description of the children clinging to their mother’s gown and peeking out bashfully is only partially represented, missing the detail of their physical actions.\n- The emotional response of the white woman, including her tears and repeated shaking and hugging, is less detailed in the completion.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The timing and sequence of events are altered: in the completion, the narrator is told to go into the house, whereas in the original, the events unfold outside with the arrival of the white woman.\n- The completion attributes dialogue and actions to the woman with the rolling-pin that are not accurate to the original, including invented lines and a different tone.\n- The completion changes the sequence of the children’s actions and adds invented responses (smiling back at the narrator, hiding behind the woman after being introduced).\n- The white woman’s comments about the narrator’s appearance and instructions to remove his hat are not present in the original and alter the flow of the reunion scene.\n- The completion omits the original’s specific comparison between the behavior of the white and Black children, and the way the white woman’s joy is physically expressed."

The river was quiet, and the moon was shining down, making the water look like silver. I felt kind of lonesome, but I reckoned it was better than being caught. Every now and then I’d hear a sound off in the woods, maybe a branch snapping or a critter moving about, and I’d get a little shiver, but I kept on. I didn’t have any idea where Jim might be, but I hoped he was safe and hadn’t been caught.\n\nAfter a while, I saw a light ahead, low down by the shore. I stopped paddling and let the canoe drift, trying to make out what it was. It looked like a campfire, and I could see some figures moving around it. I thought maybe it was some men out hunting, or maybe some folks camping for the night. I didn’t know whether to go up and see who it was, or to keep away. I thought about what would happen if it was people looking for Jim, or if they’d ask me questions I couldn’t answer. But then I remembered what I’d said about Providence, and I reckoned I’d just have to trust to luck.\n\nI drifted in closer, keeping in the shadows, and listened. I could hear voices, but I couldn’t make out what they were saying. I waited a while, hoping to hear something that would tell me who they were. After a bit, one of them got up and walked down to the water, and I saw it was a man, but I couldn’t tell who. He looked around, then went back to the fire. I decided I’d better keep away, at least until I knew more. So I paddled on, keeping close to the shore, and pretty soon the light was behind me and I was alone again.\n\nI felt kind of relieved, but also a little disappointed. I wanted to find Jim, and I wanted to have somebody to talk to. But I reckoned it was better to be safe, so I kept on down the river, trusting to Providence, just like before."

What did you do with your baggage?\"\n\n\"I ain't got no baggage.\"\n\n\"I got it on the boat.\"\n\n\"No, I mean, where did you put it?\"\n\n\"I didn't put it nowhere.\"\n\n\"Why, child, it’ll be stole!\"\n\n\"No'm, it won't.\"\n\n\"Why won't it?\"\n\n\"I hid it.\"\n\n\"Hid it? Where?\"\n\n\"I didn't see nobody when I come ashore, so I just hid it in a good place, and then I went up the back way and come around in by the woods.\"\n\n\"Well, that's all right, honey. Where'd you get your breakfast?\"\n\n\"On the boat.\"\n\n\"Oh, you got it on the boat, did you?\"\n\n\"Yes'm—the captain see me standing around, and he invited me to eat with him and the officers in the texas.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm glad to see you, honey, and I hope you'll like it here. I'm sure you will, and we'll do our best to make you comfortable. Now I'll go and see about your room.\"",

            "prefix-probing": "So she went on talking to me, and I come to find out she was the widow’s sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on. She took a set at me now with a spelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then the widow made her ease up. I couldn’t stood it much longer. Then for an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. Miss Watson would say, “Don’t put your feet up there, Huckleberry;” and “Don’t scrunch up like that, Huckleberry—set up straight;” and pretty soon she would say, “Don’t gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry—why don’t you try to behave?”\n\nThen she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished I was there. She got mad then, but I didn’t mean no harm. All I wanted was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn’t particular. She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn’t say it for the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place. Well, I couldn’t see no advantage in going where she was going, so I made up my mind I wouldn’t try for it. But I never said so, because it would only make trouble, and wouldn’t do no good.\n\nNow she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good place. She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn’t think much of it. But I never said so. I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight. I was glad about that, because I wanted him and me to be together.\n\nMiss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome. By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then everybody was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of candle, and put it on the table. Then I set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn’t no use. I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn’t make out what it was, and so it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that’s on its mind and can’t make itself understood, and so can’t rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night grieving. I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it was all shriveled up. I didn’t need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. But I hadn’t no confidence. You do that when you’ve lost a horseshoe that you’ve found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn’t ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you’d killed a spider."

Jim sat hunched over, his eyes wide and watchful, his hands gripping the pole like it was the only thing keeping him from floating away. I tried to keep my mind on what he was saying, but my thoughts kept drifting back to the shore, to the lights of the town we’d passed, and to the men who might be looking for us. Every little noise made me jump, and I kept thinking I saw shadows moving along the bank. Jim must have noticed, because he stopped talking and looked at me, his face all worried.\n\n\"You all right, Huck?\" he whispered.\n\nI nodded, but I didn’t feel all right. I felt like something bad was about to happen, and I couldn’t shake the feeling no matter how hard I tried. The river seemed darker than usual, and the trees on the shore looked like they was leaning in, trying to listen to our secrets. I wished we could just float on forever, away from everybody and everything, but I knew that wasn’t possible. So I sat there, trying to listen to Jim, but my heart was thumping so loud in my chest I could hardly hear a word he said. The night closed in around us, and I wondered what tomorrow would bring."

Look yonder!—up the road!—ain’t that somebody coming?\"\n\nHe sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give her the chance she wanted. She stooped down quick at the foot of the bed and give a pull, and out I come; and when he turned back from the window there she stood, beaming and smiling like a house afire, and I standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside.

I knowed he’d be wanting to see me, and I was just dying to see him and tell him all that had happened. After a while, when the folks was busy, I slipped into the kitchen, and there was Tom, and we shook hands and was so glad to see each other we couldn’t hardly speak. Then we set down and begun to talk, and I told him all about how I come to be there, and about Jim, and what a fix he was in, and how I was going to help him out, and Tom he listened, and his eyes got bigger and bigger, and he says:\n\n“Why, Huck, it’s just like the adventures we used to have! I’ll help you, sure as you’re born. We’ll get Jim out, and we’ll do it in style, too. You wait and see.”\n\nAnd so we begun to lay our plans, and I felt better than I had for a long time, for I knowed Tom Sawyer was the best one in the world to help me out of a scrape."

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the initial buildup where the character is nervously observing the storyteller and wondering about his own predicament.\n- The specific, step-by-step dialogue following the kiss, including the repeated questioning about who \"they\" are and the insistence on naming names, is missing.\n- The physical actions, such as the use of a spinning stick and the character's body language (e.g., fumbling with a hat), are omitted.\n- The original's sequence where the character appeals to another for support and the resulting responses are not included.\n- The final exchange about not doing it again unless asked, and the playful reversal that follows, is not present.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces invented emotional summaries and reflections, such as Aunt Sally being unable to stay mad and liking the character more for his cheekiness, which are not part of the original.\n- The order of events is altered: the hug and reconciliation occur much earlier and without the original's buildup and tension.\n- The dialogue is simplified and paraphrased, losing the original's escalating confrontation and humor.\n- The ending generalizes the resolution and adds invented statements about happiness and identity that are not in the original passage."

But he was smart, and he kept his wits about him, and never let on to nothing that would make trouble.\n\nAfter a while, Uncle Silas he come in, and he was powerful glad to see Tom, and shook hands with him, and asked him all about his folks, and how they was getting along, and Tom he answered up as pert as you please, and never batted an eye. Aunt Sally she kept looking at us both, and I could see she was trying to make out if there was anything queer about the way we acted, but Tom he was so natural and easy, she couldn't suspicion nothing.\n\nBy and by, the supper bell rung, and we all went in to eat. The table was loaded down with good things, and I was so hungry I could hardly wait for the blessing. Tom he set by Aunt Sally, and kept her laughing with his jokes and stories, and Uncle Silas he kept passing the dishes and telling about the farm, and how the crops was coming on, and what a sight of work there was to do. I tried to keep quiet and not say much, for fear I'd let something slip, but every now and then Aunt Sally would ask me a question, and I'd have to answer as best I could.\n\nAll the time I was thinking about Jim, and wondering how we was going to get him out of the shed without anybody finding out. Tom he give me a look now and then, to let me know he was thinking about it too, and I begun to feel a little better, for I knowed if anybody could help us out of the scrape, it was Tom Sawyer."

Everything was still. I whispered to Tom, and we crept up to the back door. I tried the handle, but it was locked. Tom pointed to a window that was open a crack, so we eased it up and slipped inside as quiet as we could. The room was empty, but we could hear voices in the next room. I tiptoed over and peeked through the keyhole. There was the king and the duke, counting out some money and talking low. I listened close, trying to catch what they was saying. It sounded like they was planning to leave town early in the morning, before anybody could catch up with them.

Where?”\n“In that hut down by the ash-hopper. Why, looky here. When we was at dinner, didn’t you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles?”\n“Yes.”\n“What did you think the vittles was for?”\n“For a dog.”\n“So’d I. Well, it wasn’t for a dog.”\n“Why?”\n“Because part of it was watermelon.”\n“So it was—I noticed it. Well, it does beat all that I never thought about a dog not eating watermelon. It shows how a body can see and don’t see at the same time.”\n“Well, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he locked it again when he came out. He fetched uncle a key about the time we got up from table—same key, I bet. Watermelon shows man, lock shows prisoner; and it ain’t likely there’s two prisoners on such a little plantation, and where the people’s all so kind and good. Jim’s the prisoner. All right—I’m glad we found it out detective fashion; I wouldn’t give shucks for any other way. Now you work your mind, and study out a plan to steal Jim, and I will study out one, too; and we’ll take the one we like the best.”\nWhat a head for just a boy to have! If I had Tom Sawyer’s head I wouldn’t trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clown in a circus, nor nothing I can think of. I went to thinking out a plan, but only just to be doing something; I knowed very well where the right plan was going to come from. Pretty soon Tom says:\n“Ready?”\n“Yes,” I says.\n“All right—bring it out.”\n“My plan is this,” I says. “We can easy find out if it’s Jim in there. Then get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from the island. Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the old man’s britches after he goes to bed, and shove off down the river on the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me and Jim used to do before. Wouldn’t that plan work?”\n“Work? Why, cert’nly it would work, like rats a-fighting. But it’s too blame’ simple; there ain’t nothing to it. What’s the good of a plan that ain’t no more trouble than that? It’s as mild as goose-milk. Why, Huck, it wouldn’t make no more talk than breaking into a soap factory.”\nI never said nothing, because I warn’t expecting nothing different; but I knowed mighty well that whenever he got his plan ready it wouldn’t have none of them objections to it.\nAnd it didn’t. He told me what it was, and I see in a minute it was worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a man as mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides. So I was satisfied, and said we would waltz in on it. I needn’t tell what it was here, because I knowed it wouldn’t stay the way, it was. I knowed he would be changing it around every which way as we went along, and heaving in new bullinesses wherever he got a chance. And that is what he done.",

The night was still, and the river made a kind of low, whispery sound as it slid along, and every now and then a fish would jump, and that would make you start and listen. Jim, he was laying there with his head on his arm, looking up at the stars, and I could see he was thinking, too. I reckon we both had the same thing on our minds, but neither of us said nothing for a good while.\n\nAfter a spell, I says:\n\n“Jim, do you reckon we’s ever going to get to Cairo?”\n\nJim didn’t answer right off. He just kept looking up at the sky, and then he says:\n\n“I don’t know, Huck. Seems like we been floating a long time, and I ain’t seen no sign of Cairo yet. But the river’s got to take us there, sooner or later.”\n\nI turned over on my side and looked at the water, thinking about what Jim said. The river was wide and dark, and it seemed like it went on forever. I started to feel kind of lonesome, and I wished we had something to do besides just lay there and wait.\n\nPretty soon, Jim says:\n\n“Huck, you ever think about what you’s going to do when you gets to free land?”\n\nI hadn’t thought about it much, but now that Jim mentioned it, I begun to wonder. I didn’t have no real plan, except to keep going and see what happened. I told Jim so, and he nodded like he understood.\n\n“Well,” he says, “I’s going to try to get my family back. That’s what I wants more’n anything.”\n\nI could see the look in his eyes, and I felt sorry for him. Jim was a good man, and he deserved to be free, and to have his family with him. I didn’t say nothing, though, because I didn’t know what to say.\n\nWe laid there a while longer, listening to the sounds of the night. The moon was coming up over the trees, and it made the water shine like silver. I started to feel sleepy, but I didn’t want to go to sleep just yet. I kept thinking about Cairo, and about what would happen when we got there.\n\nAll of a sudden, Jim sits up and grabs my arm.\n\n“Huck, look yonder!” he whispers.\n\nI sat up quick and looked where he was pointing. There was a light, way off in the distance, bobbing up and down. It looked like it was on a boat, and it was coming our way.\n\nWe both watched it, hardly daring to breathe. The light got closer and closer, and pretty soon we could hear voices. I felt my heart pounding in my chest, and I wondered if it was folks looking for us.\n\nJim whispered, “We better hide, Huck.”\n\nWe slipped down into the bottom of the raft and pulled the blanket over us. We could hear the boat getting closer, and the voices got louder. I could make out what they was saying, but I couldn’t tell who they was.\n\nThe boat passed by, and the light faded away into the night. We waited a long time before we dared to come out from under the blanket.\n\nJim let out a big sigh. “That was close, Huck.”\n\nI nodded, and we both laid back down, listening to the river and thinking about what was ahead. The night seemed even darker now, and I wondered if we’d ever get to Cairo, or if we’d just keep floating down the river forever."

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents a detail about Tom retrieving a key from the soap-kettle to unlock the lean-to door, which does not occur in the original. Instead, the original describes a different method for opening the door.\n- The completion introduces a scene involving a supposed opening in the wall between the shed and the hut, and speculation about how it is fastened, which is not present in the original passage.\n- The completion adds an invented sequence where Tom forgets a window-sash, goes back up the lightning-rod, and insists on this method of entry, which is not part of the original events.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the specific action involving the use of an iron tool to remove a staple and the resulting chain falling, which is a key step in accessing the lean-to.\n- The description of the shed’s contents is incomplete; the original lists several specific items found inside, which are not all mentioned in the completion.\n- The process of relocking the door by reinserting the staple after leaving the shed is missing.\n- The original includes Tom’s joyful reaction and his statement about digging, which is only partially represented in the completion.\n- The completion does not include the detail about the match going out and the characters leaving the shed as a result.\n- The original describes the ease of entering the house through the back door and Tom’s dissatisfaction with this method, which is only partially captured.\n- The repeated failed attempts by Tom to climb the lightning-rod, including his near injury and eventual success, are not fully represented in the completion.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately describes the method of opening the lean-to door (using a key instead of prying out a staple).\n- The sequence of events is altered: the invented window-sash retrieval and the order of entering the house do not match the original progression.\n- The completion misattributes actions and motivations, such as Tom’s insistence on the lightning-rod being the only way to enter, which is exaggerated compared to the original.\n- The completion introduces a non-existent passage between the shed and the hut, which changes the nature of the exploration described in the original.\n- The timing and number of Tom’s attempts to climb the lightning-rod are not accurately reflected."

I pushed the door open slow, and the hinges creaked a little, but not enough to wake the dead, I reckoned. Inside, the moonlight slanted through the cracks in the boards, making stripes on the dirt floor. Everything was just as we left it, except the old blanket Jim used for a bed was bunched up in the corner, and the tin plate we used for supper was still on the table.\n\nJim came in behind me, stooping low, and we both stood there a minute, listening. \"Ain't nobody been here,\" I said, and Jim nodded. We set about looking for the things we hid—our little sack of meal, the hunk of bacon, and the coffee pot. Everything was there, just as we left it. I felt a little easier then, knowing nobody had been nosing around.\n\nJim sat down on the blanket and sighed. \"I tell you, Huck, I don't like all this sneakin' 'round. Makes a body feel like a ghost.\"\n\n\"I know,\" I said, \"but it's the only way. If they catch us, it's all up.\"\n\nWe sat there a while, not saying much, just listening to the night. The river was close by, and I could hear the water lapping at the bank. It made me think of the raft, and how free we felt out there, away from all the trouble. I wished we could be back on it, floating down to Cairo, but I knew we had to wait for the right time.\n\nAfter a bit, Jim said, \"We best get some sleep, Huck. Tomorrow's goin' to be a long day.\"\n\nI nodded, and we stretched out on the floor, using our coats for pillows. The hut was warm and close, and I could smell the ashes from the hopper outside. I lay there, staring up at the roof, thinking about all that had happened—Pap, the widow, Tom Sawyer, and now Jim and me, hiding out like outlaws. It seemed like a dream, but I knew it was real enough.\n\nPretty soon, I heard Jim's breathing get slow and steady, and I knew he was asleep. I tried to close my eyes, but my mind kept racing. I thought about what we'd do next, and whether we'd ever get to freedom. The night was full of sounds—the river, the wind in the trees, the distant bark of a dog. I felt small and alone, but I wasn't scared. Not with Jim there. Finally, I drifted off, dreaming of the river and the wide, open sky."

The niggers was just getting through breakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim’s nigger was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was leaving, the key come from the house.\nThis nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was all tied up in little bunches with thread. That was to keep witches off. He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and making him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of strange words and noises, and he didn’t believe he was ever witched so long before in his life. He got so worked up, and got to running on so about his troubles, he forgot all about what he’d been a-going to do. So Tom says:\n“What’s the vittles for? Going to feed the dogs?”\nThe nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when you heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:\n“Yes, Mars Sid, a dog. Cur’us dog, too. Does you want to go en look at ’im?”\n“Yes.”\nI hunched Tom, and whispers:\n“You going, right here in the daybreak? That warn’t the plan.”\n“No, it warn’t; but it’s the plan now.”\nSo, drat him, we went along, but I didn’t like it much. When we got in we couldn’t hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure enough, and could see us; and he sings out:\n“Why, Huck! En good lan’! ain’ dat Misto Tom?”\nI just knowed how it would be; I just expected it. I didn’t know nothing to do; and if I had I couldn’t a done it, because that nigger busted in and says:\n“Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?”\nWe could see pretty well now. Tom he looked at the nigger, steady and kind of wondering, and says:\n“Does who know us?”\n“Why, dis-yer runaway nigger.”\n“I don’t reckon he does; but what put that into your head?”\n“What put it dar? Didn’ he jis’ dis minute sing out like he knowed you?”\nTom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way:\n“Well, that’s mighty curious. Who sung out? When did he sing out? what did he sing out?” And turns to me, perfectly ca’m, and says, “Did you hear anybody sing out?”\nOf course there warn’t nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says:\n“No; I ain’t heard nobody say nothing.”\nThen he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before, and says:\n“Did you sing out?”\n“No, sah,” says Jim; “I hain’t said nothing, sah.”\n“Not a word?”\n“No, sah, I hain’t said a word.”\n“Did you ever see us before?”\n“No, sah; not as I knows on.”\nSo Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, and says, kind of severe:\n“What do you reckon’s the matter with you, anyway? What made you think somebody sung out?”\n“Oh, it’s de dad-blame’ witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I do. Dey’s awluz at it, sah, en dey do mos’ kill me, dey sk’yers me so. Please to don’t tell nobody ’bout it sah, er ole Mars Silas he’ll scole me; ’kase he say dey ain’t no witches. I jis’ wish to goodness he was heah now—den what would he say!

And if you hear any digging going on nights, it’s us; we’re going to set you free.”\nJim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it; then the nigger come back, and we said we’d come again some time if the nigger wanted us to; and he said he would, more particular if it was dark, because the witches went for him mostly in the dark, and it was good to have folks around then.",

The niggers was just getting through breakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim’s nigger was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was leaving, the key come from the house. This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was all tied up in little bunches with thread. That was to keep witches off. He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and making him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of strange words and noises, and he didn’t believe he was ever witched so long before in his life. He got so worked up, and got to running on so about his troubles, he forgot all about what he’d been a-going to do. So Tom says:\n\n“What’s the vittles for? Going to feed the dogs?”\n\nThe nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when you heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:\n\n“Yes, Mars Sid, a dog. Cur’us dog, too. Does you want to go en see him?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nI hunched Tom, and whispered:\n\n“You going right in there in the daybreak? That warn’t the plan.”\n\n“No, it warn’t; but it’s the plan now.”\n\nSo, drat him, we went along, but I didn’t like it much. When we got in, we couldn’t hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure enough, and could see us; and he sings out:\n\n“Why, Huck! En good lan’! ain’t dat Misto Tom?”\n\nI just knowed how it would be; I just expected it. I didn’t know nothing to do; and if I had, I couldn’t a done it, because that nigger busted in and says:\n\n“Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?”\n\nTom didn’t let on to hear him, and he talked right along to me, like it was only just us two, and says:\n\n“I wonder how I’d better go to work and begin. Shall I throw in a hint, or will I—”\n\n“Sh!” he whispered, and turned to the nigger, and says:\n\n“What’s the matter with your cat?”\n\n“Cat? What cat?”\n\n“Why, the one you’ve been talking about, that’s been pestering you.”\n\n“Oh, de good gracious! dat ain’t no cat; dat’s—dat’s witches. I’s most killed wid witches, dat’s what’s de matter. They’s always a-comin’ round me, and a-worryin’ me, and a-ha’ntin’ me, and I don’t know what to do. I can’t get no rest, no way, at all. Seems like dey’s never gwine to quit.”\n\n“Yes, that’s so. But what’s the vittles for, then?”\n\n“Him I fetches it to—he’s sick, en so he’s got to have chicken on Sundays.”\n\n“Well, what makes him sick?”\n\n“He—he’s got the witches in him.”\n\n“Oh, that’s it, is it? Well, you’re a good nigger, Nat. You’ll have witches around you all your life, Nat, but you keep that hair tied up that way, and they’ll never touch you. All right, I’ll come around again some time, Nat, and see how you’re getting along.”\n\n“‘Ow, thank you, Mars Sid, I’s powerful glad to see you, Mars Sid, I’s powerful glad to see you, honey.”\n\nTom gave him ten cents, and said we wouldn’t tell anybody; and told him to buy some more thread to tie up his wool with; and then he was all fixed up, and as grateful as he could be. Then Tom whispered to Jim and told him not to ever let on to know us, and if he heard any digging at the cabin nights, he mustn’t be surprised, and not to talk, but just raise a whoop, if he was all right.

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents several character traits and actions for the person feeding Jim, depicting him as mean, sour, and fearful, which are not present in the original. This changes the tone and dynamic of the early scene.\n- The completion omits the initial sequence where the group observes the niggers finishing breakfast and preparing for the fields, as well as the specific details about the food being prepared for Jim.\n- The completion introduces invented dialogue and actions, such as the nigger greeting \"Mars Sid\" and \"Mars Tom\" and acting in a way not described in the original.\n- The completion condenses and alters the sequence of Tom's questioning and the group's interaction with Jim and the nigger, skipping over the original's step-by-step exchange and the confusion about who called out.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the detailed description of the nigger's appearance, specifically the way his hair is tied and the explanation for it.\n- The original's account of the nigger's superstitions, his complaints about witches, and his emotional state are only partially represented and lack the depth and sequence found in the source.\n- The step-by-step questioning by Tom, including the repeated denials from Jim and the nigger, is abbreviated and lacks the original's back-and-forth structure.\n- The completion does not include Tom's severe questioning of the nigger about why he thought someone called out, nor the nigger's detailed explanation of his fears and his reference to \"ole Mars Silas.\"\n- The original's closing exchange, where Tom speculates about Uncle Silas and the fate of the runaway, is missing.\n- The specific instructions Tom gives Jim about not revealing their identities and the mention of digging at night are altered and lack the original's nuance.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes actions and dialogue, such as Tom's quick dismissal of Jim's recognition and the invented lines about not understanding Jim.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the recognition scene, the questioning, and the giving of the dime are out of order compared to the original.\n- The completion introduces invented dialogue and actions, such as the nigger's repeated greetings and fearful glances, which do not match the original's portrayal.\n- The closing instructions to Jim and the nigger's response about company at night are simplified and do not reflect the original's more complex exchange about witches and the need for company in the dark.\n\nOverall, the completion should focus on accurately representing the sequence of events, preserving the original character interactions, and avoiding the invention of new character traits or dialogue not present in the source."

            "prefix-probing": "We was careful to keep out of sight, though, and not let on that we was watching. The nigger that fed Jim was a good-natured, woolly-headed old fellow, and he seemed to like Jim mighty well, and was always singing or whistling around him, and making fun, and Jim would laugh and take on, and seem to enjoy it. We watched them a good while, and then we crept away and went back to the house.\n\nTom was in high spirits. He said it was just like the old times, and he was going to have more fun than ever. He said he was going to invent a lot of new things for Jim to do, and make it the most wonderful escape that ever was heard of. He said he was going to make Jim write a journal with his own blood, and make him wear a coat of arms, and a flower in his button-hole, and all sorts of things. I asked him what was the use of all that, and he said it was the regular way, and it had to be done so; and he said, besides, it made it more romantic.\n\nI didn’t say nothing, because if he was set on it, there wasn’t no use in trying to change him. Sometimes you can’t change a person’s mind, no matter how much sense you talk. So I just let him go on, and made up my mind I’d help him all I could, and not make any fuss.\n\nWe went to the house, and Tom told me to wait outside while he went in and talked to Aunt Sally. He was gone a good while, and when he came out he said everything was all right. He said Aunt Sally was going to bake a pie that day, and he was going to get her to put a rope ladder in it, so Jim could use it to escape. I said I didn’t see how Jim was going to get a rope ladder out of a pie, and Tom said I was ignorant, and didn’t know anything about how things was done in books. He said it was the regular way, and it had to be done so.\n\nSo we went down to the woods and cut a lot of sheets and towels and things, and twisted them into a rope ladder. It was a pretty big rope ladder, and it took a lot of work to get it done. When we had it finished, Tom said we must bake it in a pie, and I said I didn’t know how to bake a rope ladder in a pie, and he said he’d show me. So we went back to the house, and Tom got Aunt Sally to let him help her bake the pie. He managed to slip the rope ladder into the pie when she wasn’t looking, and then he brought it out to me, and we carried it down to the cabin where Jim was.\n\nWe waited till the nigger that fed Jim was gone, and then we slipped the pie in through the window. Jim was mighty glad to see us, and he was surprised when he found the rope ladder in the pie. He said he didn’t know what to do with it, and Tom told him it was for him to use to escape. Jim said he didn’t see how he could use a rope ladder, and Tom said he’d show him.\n\nTom was always full of ideas, and he was bound to have things done just so. He said Jim must write a journal on the walls of the cabin, and he must use his own blood for ink. Jim said he didn’t want to do that, and Tom said it was the regular way, and it had to be done so. So Jim said he’d try, but he didn’t like it much.\n\nWe went back to the house, and Tom said we must get some more things for Jim to use. He said we must get him a shirt to write on, and a tin plate to scratch messages on, and a spoon to dig with, and a candlestick to make a pen out of. I said I didn’t see the use of all that, but Tom said it was the regular way, and it had to be done so.\n\nSo we set to work to get all the things Tom said we needed. It took us a good while, but we managed to get them all, one way or another. Sometimes we had to steal them, and sometimes we had to borrow them, but we always got them in the end.\n\nWhen we had everything ready, we took them down to Jim, and he was mighty glad to see us. He said he didn’t know what to do with half the things, but Tom showed him, and he soon got the hang of it. Jim was a good-natured sort of fellow, and he was willing to do anything we asked him, as long as it would help him get away.\n\nTom was always thinking up new things for Jim to do, and he was never satisfied unless everything was just so. He said we must dig a tunnel under the cabin, and we must make Jim wear a disguise, and we must send secret messages to each other. I said I didn’t see the use of all that, but Tom said it was the regular way, and it had to be done so.\n\nSo we set to work, and we worked hard every day, getting things ready for Jim’s escape. It was a lot of work, but it was fun, too, and we was always thinking up new ways to make it more exciting. Tom was the leader, and I just followed along, and did whatever he said. I didn’t always understand why we had to do things the way we did, but I trusted Tom, and I knew he’d get us through all right."

Jim could a got out of that window-hole before this, only there wouldn’t be no use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg. Why, drat it, Huck, it’s the stupidest arrangement I ever see. You got to invent all the difficulties. Well, we can’t help it; we got to do the best we can with the materials we’ve got.

Now look at just that one thing of the lantern. When you come down to the cold facts, we simply got to let on that a lantern’s resky.

Tom led the way, and I followed close behind, my heart thumping a little, for it seemed like we was up to something mighty mysterious and dangerous. We kept our eyes peeled for them rotten chunks, and pretty soon Tom found one, all covered with a kind of greenish light, just like he said. We gathered up a good armful, and Tom was particular to pick out the ones that glowed the brightest. He said that was the real fox-fire, and it would do the business for us.\n\nWhen we had enough, we crept back to the old cabin where Jim was chained up. The place was quiet, and Jim was asleep, but he woke up when we come in. Tom told him what we was up to, and Jim was so glad he could hardly keep still. We set the fox-fire chunks around the place where we was going to dig, and it made a soft, ghostly light, just enough to see by, but not enough to show outside. Then Tom got out the case-knives, and we went to work on the floor, scraping and prying at the boards, trying to get a start. It was slow work, and the knives wasn't much account for digging, but Tom said it was the right way, and we must stick to it. Jim helped all he could, but he had to be careful on account of the chain. We worked and sweated, and the fox-fire glimmered, and it seemed like we was in a cave, doing some kind of secret work that nobody in the world knowed about but us."

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant portion of the original passage's detailed step-by-step plan for the escape, especially the specific actions to conceal the sawing and the elaborate sequence involving the rope ladder, the moat, and the escape on horseback. Instead, it summarizes or glosses over these events, particularly in the latter half.\n- The ending introduces a reflective narrative voice from Huck, describing Tom's enthusiasm and tendency to elaborate, which is not present in the original passage. This is an invented perspective and shifts the focus away from the dialogue-driven structure of the source.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion does not include the full exchange about the necessity of the saw, specifically the reasoning about lifting the bedstead and slipping off the chain, and the comparison to \"infant-schooliest ways.\"\n- The middle section lacks the detailed list of historical or literary figures referenced as authorities on escapes.\n- The completion omits the specific instructions about swallowing the sawdust, disguising the sawed leg, and the rationale for these actions.\n- The final sequence of the escape plan, including the precise order of actions (kicking the leg, slipping the chain, using the rope ladder, the ladder being too short, breaking a leg in the moat, and being rescued by vassals), is condensed and missing several steps.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion presents the sequence of events in a summarized and partially reordered fashion, which disrupts the original's logical progression.\n- There is an inaccurate attribution of reflective commentary to Huck at the end, which is not present in the original dialogue-focused passage.\n- The completion generalizes or omits the specific references to time, place, and the detailed mechanics of the escape, leading to a loss of the original's specificity and humor."

That’s the regular way. You can’t have a proper escape without a saw.”\n\nI scratched my head. “But, Tom, we could just lift the bedstead, or maybe use the case-knife. It’d be a heap easier.”\n\nTom shook his head, looking disappointed. “Huck, where’s your imagination? If we’re going to do this, we’ve got to do it right. All the books say you use a saw. It’s the style. If we just lift the bedstead, it won’t be an adventure at all.”\n\nI didn’t see the sense in it, but Tom was set. He always was, when it came to adventures. “Well, where are we going to get a saw?” I asked.\n\nTom grinned. “We’ll make one. Or, if we can’t, we’ll use the case-knife and pretend it’s a saw. That’s what the prisoners in the stories do when they can’t get a real one. It’ll take longer, but that’s part of the fun.”\n\nI sighed, but I couldn’t help feeling a little excited, too. Tom’s way was always harder, but it did make things more interesting. So we set about looking for something we could use, and all the while Tom kept talking about how this was just like the adventures in the books, and how Jim would be the first prisoner ever to escape with a saw made out of a case-knife."

He said it was all the more reason to do it the regular way, because if we was to get Jim out by a simple plan, like snaking him out from under the cabin, it wouldn’t be worth anything; it wouldn’t be regular, and it wouldn’t be the kind of thing that’s in the books. So we must dig him out with a case-knife, and if we didn’t have enough case-knives, we could use a couple of old saws and pretend they was case-knives, and that would do just as well.\nSo Tom set to work to plan it all out, and he said we must have a rope ladder, and bake it into a pie, and send it in to Jim; and we must have a lot of other things, like a shirt to write on, and a spoon or a tin plate to write with, and a couple of pens made out of the pewter spoons, and a sheet, and a blanket, and a coat, and a lot of other things.

It ain’t no crime in a prisoner to steal the thing he needs to get away with, Tom said; it’s his right; and so, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a perfect right to steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves out of prison with. He said if we warn’t prisoners it would be a very different thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery person would steal when he warn’t a prisoner. So we allowed we would steal everything there was that come handy. And yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that, when I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he made me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for. Tom said that what he meant was, we could steal anything we needed. Well, I says, I needed the watermelon. But he said I didn’t need it to get out of prison with; there’s where the difference was. He said if I’d a wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal with, it would a been all right.

Jim listened, but I could see he didn’t believe much of it.\n\nWe got the pie made, and Tom fixed up a rope ladder out of some old sheets. We rolled it up tight and stuck it in the pie, and then we took it in to Jim. He was mighty pleased, and said he’d never seen anything like it.\n\nTom was so proud of the whole thing, he could hardly stand it. He said it was just like in the books, and that Jim was the luckiest prisoner that ever was."

You always got to be so everlastingly practical. Now, if you was to go to work and steal a saw, and then go to work and use it, and then let on you done it with case-knives, I wouldn’t say nothing; but you can’t learn a person nothing.

Ef he was a good man, and I knowed him, p’raps I might. But I doan’ know nobody in China, en I doan’ want to go nowhar whar I doan’ know nobody. I’s powerful lonesome when I ain’t got nobody I knows.”\n\nI see it warn’t no use to try to get him to talk about going to China, so I changed the subject. We set there a while, looking at the stars and listening to the river. It was mighty still, and the moon was shining down on the water, making it look like silver. Jim was thinking about something, I could tell by the way he kept quiet and looked off into the dark.\n\nAfter a while, he says:\n\n“Huck, you ever think about what’s out yonder, way past the stars?”\n\nI says:\n\n“No, Jim, I never did. What do you reckon is out there?”\n\nJim says:\n\n“I dunno, but sometimes I think maybe there’s another world out there, with folks like us, only different. Maybe they don’t have no rivers, or maybe they got rivers made out of gold. I reckon it’s a mighty big place, the world is.”\n\nI says:\n\n“I reckon so, Jim. But I like it here, on the river. It’s quiet, and nobody to bother us.”\n\nJim nodded. “Dat’s so, Huck. Dis here river, she’s a friend to us. She don’t tell no tales, and she don’t care who you is.”\n\nWe set there a long time, not saying nothing, just listening to the water and the night sounds. I felt right contented, like I didn’t want to be nowhere else. After a while, Jim started humming a tune, soft and low, and I laid back and watched the sky, thinking about all the places we’d been and all the places we might go. But I knew, as long as Jim was with me, I wouldn’t be lonesome, no matter where we ended up."

We cleared everything out of the way, about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log. Tom said he was right behind Jim’s bed now, and we’d dig in under it, and when we got through there couldn’t nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole there, because Jim’s counter-pin hung down most to the ground, and you’d have to raise it up and look under to see the hole. So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then we was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn’t see we’d done anything hardly. At last I says:\n“This ain’t no thirty-seven year job; this is a thirty-eight year job, Tom Sawyer.”\nHe never said nothing. But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped digging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking. Then he says:\n“It ain’t no use, Huck, it ain’t a-going to work. If we was prisoners it would, because then we’d have as many years as we wanted, and no hurry; and we wouldn’t get but a few minutes to dig, every day, while they was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn’t get blistered, and we could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right, and the way it ought to be done. But we can’t fool along; we got to rush; we ain’t got no time to spare. If we was to put in another night this way we’d have to knock off for a week to let our hands get well—couldn’t touch a case-knife with them sooner.”\n“Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?”\n“I’ll tell you. It ain’t right, and it ain’t moral, and I wouldn’t like it to get out; but there ain’t only just the one way: we got to dig him out with the picks, and let on it’s case-knives.”\n“Now you’re talking!” I says; “your head gets leveler and leveler all the time, Tom Sawyer,” I says. “Picks is the thing, moral or no moral; and as for me, I don’t care shucks for the morality of it, nohow. When I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school book, I ain’t no ways particular how it’s done so it’s done. What I want is my nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I want is my Sunday-school book; and if a pick’s the handiest thing, that’s the thing I’m a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sunday-school book out with; and I don’t give a dead rat what the authorities thinks about it nuther.”\n“Well,” he says, “there’s excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like this; if it warn’t so, I wouldn’t approve of it, nor I wouldn’t stand by and see the rules broke—because right is right, and wrong is wrong, and a body ain’t got no business doing wrong when he ain’t ignorant and knows better. It might answer for you to dig Jim out with a pick, without any letting on, because you don’t know no better; but it wouldn’t for me, because I do know better. Gimme a case-knife.”\nHe had his own by him, but I handed him mine. He flung it down, and says:\n“Gimme a case-knife.”\nI didn’t know just what to do—but then I thought. I scratched around amongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe and give it to him, and he took it and went to work, and never said a word.\nHe was always just that particular. Full of principle.",

I says:\n\n“I don’t believe we can ever get him out with them case-knives, Tom. What do you reckon?”\n\n“I don’t know. It’s too slow. I never did see such a job. I’ll bet it’s been done a hundred times in the books, and always the same way. But we ain’t prisoners, and we ain’t got all the time there is. Why, look at our hands—just look at them! We ought to have used picks and let on they was case-knives.”\n\n“Why, Huck, it wouldn’t be regular. Prisoners don’t do it that way.”\n\n“But we ain’t regular prisoners, Tom. We’re just trying to get Jim out, and if we don’t hurry up, we’ll get caught. I don’t care how it’s done, so it’s done.”\n\nTom thought a minute, and then he says, kind of unwilling:\n\n“Well, maybe we better let on the picks is case-knives. I reckon that’s all right. Nobody’ll know but us.”\n\n“All right, then,” I says, “I’m agreed.”\n\nSo we got the picks, and Tom said we must keep them out of sight, and always pretend we was using the case-knives, and if anybody come, we must let on we was just a-digging with them.

            "prefix-probing": "We fixed up the fox-fire so it would look like a lot of little candles, and set them around in the corners of the lean-to, and along the shelves, and on the floor, so it would look kind of mysterious and ghostly. Tom said that was the way they always did in the best books, and it would make Jim feel like he was in a real haunted house, or maybe a dungeon. We had to be careful not to let the fox-fire go out, because it was the only light we had, and it was mighty dim at that.\n\nThen we got out the tools we had borrowed—an old case-knife, a saw made out of a barrel hoop, and a file. Tom said we must do everything by the book, and not use any tools that weren’t mentioned in the stories. So we set to work on the leg of Jim’s bed, trying to saw it off with the case-knife. It was slow work, and the knife kept slipping, and our hands got blistered, but Tom said that was part of the adventure, and we mustn’t mind it.\n\nAfter a while, we got tired and stopped to rest. Tom said we ought to have some music, like they did in the books, so he whistled a tune, and I tapped on the floor with the file. Jim woke up and asked what we was doing, and Tom told him we was working on his rescue. Jim said he was powerful glad, but he hoped we’d hurry up, because he didn’t want to get caught.\n\nWe went back to work, and after a long time we managed to get the leg of the bed pretty near sawed through. Tom said we mustn’t finish it all at once, because that wouldn’t be regular; we had to do a little every night, so it would take a long time, like in the books. I said I didn’t see the sense in that, but Tom said it was the way things was done, and we must stick to the plan.\n\nThen Tom said we ought to write a letter to the folks in the house, warning them that something was going to happen. He said that was always done in the best adventures. So we got a piece of paper and wrote a letter, telling them to beware, and that there was danger coming. We signed it “The Mysterious Strangers,” and slipped it under the door.\n\nAfter that, we put out the fox-fire and climbed back up the lightning-rod to our room. We was tired and sore, but Tom was full of excitement, talking about how grand it was going to be when we got Jim out, and how everybody would be astonished at our cleverness.\n\nThe next day, we went about our business as usual, but all the time we was thinking about the plan. Tom kept coming up with new ideas, like digging a tunnel under the cabin, or making a rope ladder out of sheets. I said I didn’t think we needed all that, but Tom said it wouldn’t be a real adventure without it.\n\nSo that night, we went back to the lean-to and started digging with the case-knife. It was hard work, and we didn’t get very far, but Tom said we was making progress. Jim helped as much as he could, but he was chained up, so he couldn’t do much. We kept at it night after night, always careful not to make too much noise.\n\nAfter a week or so, we had a little tunnel started, and Tom said we was doing fine. He said we ought to send Jim some secret messages, like in the books, so we wrote notes on scraps of paper and slipped them to him when nobody was looking. Jim said he didn’t understand half of it, but he was glad we was trying to help him.\n\nAll the time, Tom was thinking up new things to do, like making a coat of arms for Jim, and writing a journal of the escape. I thought it was all a lot of foolishness, but Tom said it was the only way to do it right. So we kept on, night after night, working by the light of the fox-fire, and hoping we wouldn’t get caught."

Come up the stairs, and let on it’s a lightning-rod.”\nSo he done it.\nNext day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house, for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin plates. Tom says it wasn’t enough; but I said nobody wouldn’t ever see the plates that Jim throwed out, because they’d fall in the dog-fennel and jimpson weeds under the window-hole—then we could tote them back and he could use them over again. So Tom was satisfied. Then he says:\n“Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim.”\n“Take them in through the hole,” I says, “when we get it done.”\nHe only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard of such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying. By-and-by he said he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn’t no need to decide on any of them yet. Said we’d got to post Jim first.\nThat night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took one of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard Jim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn’t wake him. Then we whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half the job was done. We crept in under Jim’s bed and into the cabin, and pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile, and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle and gradual. He was so glad to see us he most cried; and called us honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away, and clearing out without losing any time. But Tom he showed him how unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans, and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, sure. So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old times awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt Sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and both of them was kind as they could be, Tom says:\n“Now I know how to fix it.

He was always set on having things just so, the way he’d read about in books, and he didn’t care how much trouble it made, so long as it was stylish.\n\nTom rummaged around in his pockets and pulled out a piece of string, a bit of candle, and a rusty old spoon.

If we’re going to help Jim escape, we got to do it the way they do in the stories. We can’t just bust him out; we got to have a plan, with tunnels and secret messages and all.”\n\nI shook my head. “But Tom, that’ll take forever. Why can’t we just get him out quick and easy?”\n\nTom grinned. “Because that ain’t the way. Where’s the fun in that? Besides, Jim deserves a proper escape. He’s been locked up long enough.”\n\nI sighed, knowing there warn’t no use arguing. Tom started measuring the wall with the string, figuring out where to start digging.

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the initial description of the character's entrance, including her emotional state and specific actions upon arrival, which sets the tone for the scene.\n- The completion invents a new threat from Aunt Sally about going to the government and sending Silas to the penitentiary, which is not present in the original passage.\n- The ending introduces a new action where the narrator slips out and escapes, which does not occur in the original excerpt.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The early part of the passage is missing the depiction of simultaneous actions, such as serving coffee and disciplining a child, which are important for character dynamics.\n- The completion omits the detailed sequence involving the narrator's physical reaction to the stress (the corn-crust incident) and its impact on the children, which is a key comedic moment.\n- The original contains a specific, repeated pattern of listing missing items, including a precise count and escalation, which is only partially captured in the completion.\n- The original includes a direct interaction with a child involving a thimble and the sugar-bowl, which is not present in the completion.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes some dialogue and actions, such as the invented threat to go to the government, which alters the tone and intent of the scene.\n- The sequence of events is disrupted: the completion introduces the missing sheet and candlestick in a slightly different order and with less clarity about who reports what and when.\n- Some attributions of speech are incorrect, with lines given to the wrong characters or generalized rather than being specific.\n- The completion sometimes summarizes or generalizes the escalation of missing items, rather than following the original's stepwise revelation and reactions.\n- The ending exaggerates the response to the missing candlestick and adds invented actions not present in the original, changing the resolution of the scene."

If you don't mind your manners and keep your elbows off the table, I'll box your ears till next week. And you, Tommy, don't you dare reach for that biscuit before the blessing's said!\" She glared around the table, her eyes sharp as gimlets, and the children all shrank back in their chairs, their hands folded tight in their laps. The coffee sloshed in the cups as she poured, and the steam rose up, curling around her face, which was still flushed from her hurry.\n\nThe old man at the head of the table cleared his throat and began the blessing, his voice slow and solemn, but the children could hardly keep still, their stomachs rumbling and their eyes darting to the platters of fried chicken and hot biscuits. When the \"Amen\" finally came, there was a clatter of forks and a scramble for the food, but the old woman kept a sharp eye on them all, ready to rap any knuckles that strayed too far or too fast.\n\nI sat quiet, watching it all, feeling a little out of place but mighty glad to have a plate in front of me. The food was good, and the talk at the table was lively, with the old man telling stories about the river and the children giggling at his jokes. Every now and then, the old woman would hush them with a look, but even she couldn't keep the laughter down for long.\n\nAfter supper, the children were sent to wash up, and I helped clear the table, wanting to show I was grateful for the meal. The old woman watched me with a keen eye, but she didn't say much, just nodded when I set the plates in the right place. When the work was done, I slipped outside, wanting a breath of air and a look at the river in the moonlight.\n\nThe night was quiet, the only sound the frogs and the soft lap of water against the bank. I sat on the steps, thinking about Jim and wondering if he was safe. I knew I couldn't stay here long, not with folks asking questions and looking at me sideways. But for now, I was warm and fed, and that was enough.\n\nPretty soon, one of the children came out and sat beside me. It was the littlest girl, her hair in two tight braids and her eyes wide and curious.\n\n\"What's your name?\" she asked, her voice soft.\n\n\"George Jackson,\" I said, remembering the name I'd given them.\n\nShe nodded, satisfied. \"You talk funny. Where you from?\"\n\n\"Oh, all around,\" I said. \"Up and down the river.\"\n\nShe looked at me for a minute, then smiled. \"I like you. You ain't mean like some folks.\"\n\nI smiled back, feeling a little better. \"Thank you, ma'am.\"\n\nShe giggled at that, then jumped up and ran back inside, her bare feet pattering on the porch boards. I watched her go, then leaned back and looked up at the stars. It was a big sky, and I felt small under it, but not so lonesome as before.\n\nAfter a while, the old man came out and sat down beside me. He didn't say nothing for a long time, just smoked his pipe and looked out at the river. Finally, he spoke.\n\n\"You got folks, boy?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"No, sir. Not anymore.\"\n\nHe nodded, like he understood. \"Well, you can stay here a spell, if you mind your manners and help out. We ain't got much, but we share what we got.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" I said, meaning it.\n\nHe patted my shoulder, then stood up and went back inside, leaving me alone with the night and my thoughts. I sat there a while longer, listening to the sounds of the house and the river, feeling safe for the first time in a long while. But I knew it couldn't last. Sooner or later, I'd have to move on. But for now, I was content to sit and watch the moon rise over the water, and let the world be quiet around me."

Aunt Sally, she was just a-spinning around, every which way, and tearing up things, and scolding, and every time she’d get to the place where a body was just about to go to pieces, Uncle Silas he’d chip in and say, “Now, Sally, you can’t lay that at my door”—and that would set her off again, and she’d say, “It’s too much for one body to stand; such a raft of things gone, and not a clue, and them that’s left behind is worse than gone, because they warn’t ever worth the fetchin’ back.”\n\nShe was just a-biling. By and by she fetched out the spoons, and turned them over and over, and then she says:\n\n“Here’s one of them that ain’t here. I can’t account for it in no way. I do believe I’ll count them again.”\n\nShe was going to count them, but she dropped them and went to looking for it, and she says:\n\n“Why, Tom, there it is, on the table.

I’ll count them again.”\n\nSo she counted them, and if the spoon was gone, she was in a tearing way; but if it warn’t gone, she was in a tearing way just the same, and she never counted them right, but she always counted one too many or one too few, and I couldn’t make it out, nor Tom neither. I was getting awful scared, and Tom he was looking pretty sober, too. By and by she counted them again, and this time she counted them right, and she was in a tearing way just the same, and she says:\n\n“Why, what in the world can have become of that spoon?”\n\nUncle Silas looked foolish, and says:\n\n“Why, Sally, I—I don’t know what’s become of it.

Now, clear out, all of you, and let me have some peace and quiet for one minute, or I’ll go distracted.”\n\nSo we all cleared out, and as me and Tom was passing through the sitting-room, the shingle-nail fell out of Uncle Silas’s hat onto the floor, and he picked it up and set it on the mantel-shelf, and never said nothing, and went out.

What have you been up to now?\" I shuffled my feet and looked down at the floor, trying to think up something that might sound reasonable, but my mind was as empty as a gourd. She kept on, her voice getting sharper with every word. \"You know better than to go running off like that, and after all the trouble you caused last time!

Miss Watson was in the next room, and I could hear her muttering to herself about the state of the world and how boys these days had no sense. The clock on the mantel ticked so loud it seemed to fill up the whole house. I wished I was out on the river, floating free and easy, with nothing but the sky overhead and the water underneath. But there I was, stuck in that stiff old chair, with Aunt Polly—well, she wasn’t really my aunt, but she sure acted like it—watching me like a hawk.\n\nAfter a while, she cooled down some and came over to me. \"Huck,\" she said, \"I only want what’s best for you. You got to learn to behave yourself, or you’ll come to a bad end.\"\n\nI nodded, but I was thinking about Jim, and the raft, and all the adventures waiting out there. I knew I’d have to mind my manners for a while, but I also knew I wouldn’t be able to stay put for long. The river was calling me, and sooner or later, I’d have to answer."

I counted ’m myself.”\n\n“Well, I’ll count them again, anyway,” says Tom. “Let me see; one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.”\n\n“Why, there it is again, Aunt Sally; and she was just staring at him, and then she grabbed up the spoons and counted them herself, and there was only nine.

I’ll lay I’ll find it in the ash-barrel or somewhere.”\n\nShe put the spoons back, and went to work, and Tom says to me:\n\n“She’s onto us, Huck, but it don’t make no difference.

She looked out of all patience, but of course she counted again, and then she was just sure there was ten.

When it was done he said it wouldn’t do, because it didn’t look like a spoon that had been in use for forty years, and so he took and beat it and banged it and scratched it up and down, and rubbed it on the bricks, and filed it again, and then he said it was aged enough, and he was satisfied. But I warn’t; I said it was a little too aged, and not enough spoon left to do any good with; but he said that was the way with spoons, and the more battered and worn they was, the more they was respected. So we put it in the sack with the other things, and Tom said now we was all right.\n\nNext day, towards evening, we started down the lightning-rod again, and Tom stopped and let me go on a piece ahead, and then he come after me. We got to the bottom safe, and then Tom he said he’d go and fetch the things. He was gone a considerable while, and when he come back he had everything but the spoon. He said he’d left it on the table in the kitchen, and Aunt Sally was in there, so he couldn’t get it. I said, “Why, Tom, we can’t get along without it.”\n\nHe said, “Well, then, we’ll have to do without it.”\n\nI said, “But looky here, Tom, Aunt Sally’ll miss it and we’ll get into trouble.”\n\nHe said, “Oh, she won’t miss it; she’s got plenty more.”\n\nI said, “That ain’t the thing—the thing is, if she misses one, she’ll suspect something. That’s the way with women; they always notice the least little thing, and they’re always a-bothering over it.”\n\nHe said, “Well, then, I’ll go and get it.”\n\nSo he slipped back and by and by he come along with the spoon, and we put it in the sack and started off again, and everything was all right.

Jim said maybe it was a sign, and that we ought to be careful about what we put in pies, because sometimes the spirits didn’t like it. I said I didn’t believe in no such thing, but Jim said he’d seen too many strange things in his life to take chances. So we let the thing be for a spell, and just watched the sunlight flicker through the leaves, and listened to the river running slow and lazy down below.\n\nAfter a while, Jim got up and said he was going to try again, so he took the pie and set it down in front of the critter, and started talking to it real soft, like he was talking to a baby. The critter sniffed at the pie, and then at Jim, and then it turned around and scampered off into the brush. Jim said that was a sure sign, and that we ought to leave the woods for a while, just in case. I laughed at him, but he looked so serious I didn’t have the heart to keep on. So we picked up the pie and went back to the raft, and Jim said he’d try again later, maybe with a different kind of pie, or maybe with some cornbread, because sometimes the spirits liked that better.\n\nWe spent the rest of the day fishing and watching the clouds, and Jim told me stories about witches and signs and all sorts of things. I didn’t believe half of it, but it made the time pass, and the river kept rolling on, just the same as ever."

That’s the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall. But he had to have it; Tom said he’d got to; there warn’t no case of a state prisoner not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and his coat of arms.\n“Look at Lady Jane Grey,” he says; “look at Gilford Dudley; look at old Northumberland! Why, Huck, s’pose it is considerble trouble?—what you going to do?—how you going to get around it? Jim’s got to do his inscription and coat of arms. They all do.”\nJim says:\n“Why, Mars Tom, I hain’t got no coat o’ arm; I hain’t got nuffn but dish yer ole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat.”\n“Oh, you don’t understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very different.”\n“Well,” I says, “Jim’s right, anyway, when he says he ain’t got no coat of arms, because he hain’t.”\n“I reckon I knowed that,” Tom says, “but you bet he’ll have one before he goes out of this—because he’s going out right, and there ain’t going to be no flaws in his record.”\nSo whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece, Jim a-making his’n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon, Tom set to work to think out the coat of arms. By-and-by he said he’d struck so many good ones he didn’t hardly know which to take, but there was one which he reckoned he’d decide on. He says:\n“On the scutcheon we’ll have a bend or in the dexter base, a saltire murrey in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for common charge, and under his foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with a chevron vert in a chief engrailed, and three invected lines on a field azure, with the nombril points rampant on a dancette indented; crest, a runaway nigger, sable, with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister; and a couple of gules for supporters, which is you and me; motto, Maggiore fretta, minore atto. Got it out of a book—means the more haste, the less speed.”\n“Geewhillikins,” I says, “but what does the rest of it mean?”\n“We ain’t got no time to bother over that,” he says; “we got to dig in like all git-out.”\n“Well, anyway,” I says, “what’s some of it? What’s a fess?”\n“A fess—a fess is—you don’t need to know what a fess is. I’ll show him how to make it when he gets to it.”\n“Shucks, Tom,” I says, “I think you might tell a person. What’s a bar sinister?”\n“Oh, I don’t know. But he’s got to have it. All the nobility does.”\nThat was just his way. If it didn’t suit him to explain a thing to you, he wouldn’t do it. You might pump at him a week, it wouldn’t make no difference.\nHe’d got all that coat of arms business fixed, so now he started in to finish up the rest of that part of the work, which was to plan out a mournful inscription—said Jim got to have one, like they all done. He made up a lot, and wrote them out on a paper, and read them off, so:\n1. Here a captive heart busted.\n2. Here a poor prisoner, forsook by the world and friends, fretted out his sorrowful life.\n3. Here a lonely heart broke, and a worn spirit went to its rest, after thirty-seven years of solitary captivity.\n4. Here, homeless and friendless, after thirty-seven years of bitter captivity, perished a noble stranger, natural son of Louis XIV.\nTom’s voice trembled whilst he was reading them, and he most broke down. When he got done he couldn’t no way make up his mind which one for Jim to scrabble on to the wall, they was all so good; but at last he allowed he would let him scrabble them all on. Jim said it would take him a year to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail, and he didn’t know how to make letters, besides; but Tom said he would block them out for him, and then he wouldn’t have nothing to do but just follow the lines. Then pretty soon he says:\n“Come to think, the logs ain’t a-going to do; they don’t have log walls in a dungeon: we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock. We’ll fetch a rock.”\nJim said the rock was worse than the logs; he said it would take him such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn’t ever get out. But Tom said he would let me help him do it. Then he took a look to see how me and Jim was getting along with the pens. It was most pesky tedious hard work and slow, and didn’t give my hands no show to get well of the sores, and we didn’t seem to make no headway, hardly; so Tom says:\n“I know how to fix it. We got to have a rock for the coat of arms and mournful inscriptions, and we can kill two birds with that same rock. There’s a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill, and we’ll smouch it, and carve the things on it, and file out the pens and the saw on it, too.”",

                "text": "Making them pens was a distressid tough job, and so was the saw; and Jim allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all. That’s the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall. But he had to have it; Tom said he’d got to. There warn’t no case of a state prisoner not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and Tom said he’d got to have a coat of arms, too. So Jim said, what’s a coat of arms? Tom says it’s the way a prisoner leaves his mark—something to show who he was and what he suffered. Jim said he didn’t have nothing but his old shirt, and that was for a journal. Tom said a coat of arms warn’t a coat, it was a heraldic device, and Huck said Jim didn’t have one, but Tom said he’d have to have one before he could get out, or else there wouldn’t be no regularity about it.\n\nSo Tom set to work to think up a coat of arms. He said he’d struck so many good ones he didn’t hardly know which to take, but there was one which he reckoned he’d decide on. He says:\n\n“On the scutcheon we’ll have a bend or in the dexter base, a saltire murrey in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for common charge, and under his foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with a chevron vert in a chief engrailed, and three invected lines on a field azure, with the nombril points rampant on a dancette indented; crest, a runaway nigger, sable, with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister; and a couple of gules for supporters, which is you and me; motto, Maggiore fretta, minore atto. Got it out of a book—means the more haste the less speed.”\n\nHuck says:\n\n“What’s a fess?”\n\n“A fess—a fess is—you don’t need to know what a fess is. I’ll show him how to make it when he gets to it.”\n\n“Shucks, Tom,” I says, “I reckon you can tell a body what a bar sinister is, can’t you?”\n\n“Yes; a bar sinister is—oh, I’ll show him how to make it when he gets to it.”\n\n“That’s so. I reckon he’ll have to be satisfied with them kind of instructions, and not try to know too much. When he gets to the bar sinister, if he don’t know what it is, he can leave it go.”\n\nTom said it was a good enough coat of arms, and as for the motto, you’ll see that in all the books. It’s the regular thing.\n\nThen Tom begun to get out his inscription. He made up a lot of them, and read them out loud. One was:\n\n“Here a captive heart busted.”\n\nAnother was:\n\n“Here, homeless and friendless, after thirty-seven years of bitter captivity, perished a noble stranger, natural son of Louis XIV.”\n\nTom’s voice trembled whilst he was reading them, and he most broke down. He couldn’t make up his mind which one for Jim to scrabble onto the wall, so he allowed he would let him scrabble them all. Jim said it would take him a year to scrabble such a lot of truck onto the logs with a nail, and he didn’t know how. Tom said he would block them out with pencil, and then Jim could fetch them out with the nail. Jim said he couldn’t make letters, and Tom said he would learn him. Then Tom said the logs was no place for them, and he must scrabble them onto a rock. Jim said there warn’t no rock; Tom said he would find one. He said he’d seen a grindstone down at the mill, and they could roll it in and use it for the rock. Jim said it would take him such a pison long time to scrabble his inscription and coat of arms onto it he wouldn’t ever get out. But Tom said he would help, and Huck would help, and Jim could do his part. Then Tom noticed how slow they was making pens and things, and he said they must have that grindstone anyway, and they could use it for grinding the pens and for the inscription and coat of arms and all.",

            "prefix-probing": "That's because he had to carve it on a rock, and the only tools we had was a case-knife and a couple of old nails. Tom said we could use the saw, but Jim said it would take a year to saw a letter in a rock with that, and he warn't willing to wait that long. Tom said he was right, and so he allowed we better let it alone. But I said it wouldn't do, and Tom said, now that he come to think, it wouldn't, because he was bound to keep up the regular prison style, and that meant the inscription had to be there, and it had to be done with a case-knife. So Jim got out the rock, and we all went to work. It was slow, and it made our hands sore, but we kept at it, and after a while we got so we could do a letter in about an hour. Tom said he reckoned we could get the whole inscription done in a week if we stuck to it, and Jim said he was willing if we was. So we kept on, and by and by we had it all done, and it looked pretty good, considering.\n\nTom was mighty proud of it, and he said it was just the way they done in the best prisons, and he wished we had a coat of arms to go with it. But I said I didn't know what a coat of arms was, and Tom said it was a kind of sign or mark that showed who you was, and that all the best families had one. He said we could make one up for Jim, and he set to work drawing it on a piece of paper. He put a couple of swords and a bar sinister and a couple of lions and a unicorn, and some other things, and wrote \"Jim\" under it. He said that was the way they done in the books, and it would make Jim's escape all the more regular.\n\nJim said he didn't care nothing about the coat of arms, but Tom said it was part of the plan, and we had to have it. So we made it, and put it up over the inscription, and Tom said it was the best he ever saw. Then he said we had to have some mournful lines, like they put on tombstones, to show how Jim was suffering in prison. He said he would write them, and he did. They was something like this:\n\nHere lies a poor prisoner,\nWho suffered so much,\nFor the sake of his friends,\nAnd the cause of freedom.\n\nTom said that was just the thing, and we put it up, too. Jim said he didn't know what it all meant, but he was willing if it would help him get out. Tom said it would, and that was enough.\n\nAfter that, Tom said we had to have a rope ladder, so Jim could escape out of the window. He said we could make it out of sheets, and we did. We tied the sheets together, and made a good strong ladder, and hid it under the bed. Tom said we must bake it in a pie, and send it in to Jim, the way they done in the books, but I said that was foolish, because Jim was already in the room, and didn't need to get the ladder in. Tom said it didn't matter, it was the style, and we had to do it. So we baked a pie, and put the ladder in it, and sent it in to Jim. He said it was the strangest pie he ever saw, but he was willing to eat it if it would help him get out.\n\nTom said we had to have some rats and snakes in the prison, too, because that was the way they done in the books. He said we could catch some in the woods, and bring them in. So we did. We caught a couple of rats and a snake, and put them in a box, and brought them in to Jim. He said he didn't want them, but Tom said it was part of the plan, and we had to have them. So we let them out in the room, and Jim said he hoped they wouldn't bite him. Tom said they wouldn't, if he was careful.\n\nAfter that, Tom said we had to have some spiders, too, and we caught a few and put them in a box. Jim said he didn't like spiders, but Tom said it was all right, they wouldn't hurt him. So we let them out, and Jim said he hoped they would stay away from him.\n\nTom said we had to have some candles, too, so Jim could read by them at night. He said we could make them out of tallow, and we did. We made a couple of candles, and put them in the room. Jim said he didn't need them, but Tom said it was the style, and we had to have them.\n\nAfter that, Tom said we had to have some pens and ink, so Jim could write a journal of his sufferings. He said we could make the pens out of goose quills, and the ink out of berries. So we did. We made a couple of pens, and some ink, and gave them to Jim. He said he didn't know what to write, but Tom said he could just write about how he was suffering, and how he hoped to escape. Jim said he would try.\n\nTom said we had to have some more things, too, but I said I thought we had enough. Tom said we didn't, but he would think about it, and let us know. So we waited, and pretty soon he came up with some more ideas. He said we had to have a flower in a vase, so Jim could water it with his tears. He said we could pick a flower in the woods, and put it in a cup. So we did. Jim said he didn't have any tears to water it with, but Tom said that didn't matter, it was the style.\n\nAfter that, Tom said we had to have a mouse, so Jim could tame it and teach it tricks. He said we could catch a mouse in the house, and we did. We put it in a box, and gave it to Jim. He said he didn't want it, but Tom said it was part of the plan, and we had to have it. So Jim kept the mouse, and tried to teach it tricks, but it wouldn't learn anything.\n\nTom said we had to have a cat, too, but I said I didn't know where we could get one. Tom said we could catch one in the woods, but I said I didn't think there was any cats in the woods. Tom said it didn't matter, we could just pretend. So we did.\n\nAfter that, Tom said we had to have a dog, so Jim could talk to it and tell it his troubles. He said we could find a dog in the neighborhood, and bring it in. So we did. We found a dog, and brought it in to Jim. He said he didn't want it, but Tom said it was part of the plan, and we had to have it. So Jim kept the dog, and talked to it, but it didn't seem to care much."

You could tame it.”\n“Tame it!”\n“Yes—easy enough. Every animal is grateful for kindness and petting, and they wouldn’t think of hurting a person that pets them. Any book will tell you that. You try—that’s all I ask; just try for two or three days. Why, you can get him so, in a little while, that he’ll love you; and sleep with you; and won’t stay away from you a minute; and will let you wrap him round your neck and put his head in your mouth.”\n“Please, Mars Tom—doan’ talk so!

En mo’ en dat, I doan’ want him to sleep wid me.”\n“Jim, don’t act so foolish. A prisoner’s got to have some kind of a dumb pet, and if a rattlesnake hain’t ever been tried, why, there’s more glory to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other way you could ever think of to save your life.”\n“Why, Mars Tom, I doan’ want no sich glory. Snake take ’n bite Jim’s chin off, den whah is de glory? No, sah, I doan’ want no sich doin’s.”\n“Blame it, can’t you try? I only want you to try—you needn’t keep it up if it don’t work.”\n“But de trouble all done ef de snake bite me while I’s a tryin’ him. Mars Tom, I’s willin’ to tackle mos’ anything ’at ain’t onreasonable, but ef you en Huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame, I’s gwyne to leave, dat’s shore.”\n“Well, then, let it go, let it go, if you’re so bull-headed about it. We can get you some garter-snakes, and you can tie some buttons on their tails, and let on they’re rattlesnakes, and I reckon that’ll have to do.”\n“I k’n stan’ dem, Mars Tom, but blame’ ’f I couldn’ get along widout um, I tell you dat.

Remember how we did with the gang? We made up all them rules and signs and things. Well, this is just like that, only real.\"\n\nI looked at Tom, and I could see he was enjoying himself. He always did like a good adventure, and this was the best one yet. \"All right,\" I says, \"but we got to be quick.\"\n\nTom nodded. \"First, we got to make sure the coast is clear. You go peek out that crack in the wall, and I'll keep an eye on the door. If you see anybody, just give a little cough, like this—\" and he made a sound like a frog croaking.\n\nI crept over to the crack and looked out. The moon was shining bright, and I could see the river glimmering through the trees. There warn't nobody in sight. I turned back to Tom and shook my head.\n\n\"All right,\" he whispered. \"Now, let's look for the money.\"\n\nWe started poking around the old cabin, feeling under the floorboards and behind the barrels. It was dark, and every little noise made me jump. I kept thinking about the robbers coming back and catching us. But Tom, he warn't scared a bit. He just kept on searching, whistling soft to himself.\n\nAfter a while, I found a loose board in the corner. I pried it up with my knife, and there, sure enough, was a little sack tied up with string. My heart jumped up in my throat. \"Tom!\" I whispered. \"I found it!\"\n\nTom came running over, his eyes shining. He grabbed the sack and untied the string. Inside was a pile of gold coins, all bright and shiny. We stared at them, hardly believing our luck.\n\n\"We done it, Huck!\" Tom whispered. \"We're rich!\"\n\nI couldn't hardly speak. I just nodded, feeling like I was in a dream.\n\n\"Now,\" Tom said, \"we got to get out of here before anybody comes. We'll hide the money in the woods, and then we can figure out what to do next.\"\n\nWe slipped out of the cabin, quiet as mice, and ran through the trees to a little hollow we knew about. We buried the sack under a big rock, and covered it up with leaves and sticks.\n\n\"Nobody'll ever find it there,\" Tom said, grinning.\n\nI nodded. \"I reckon you're right.\"\n\nWe sat there a minute, catching our breath, and then Tom says, \"This is the best adventure we ever had, Huck.\"\n\nAnd I had to agree with him."

            "Tom reassures Jim that a jews-harp is perfectly adequate, as all animals, especially in prison, are fond of music, particularly 'painful music' like that produced by a jews-harp, which piques their curiosity.",
            "Tom instructs Jim to play 'The Last Link is Broken' on his jews-harp at night before sleeping and early in the mornings. He claims this will attract all the rats, snakes, spiders, and other creatures, who will then 'swarm over' Jim and have a 'noble good time.'",
            "Jim dryly questions what sort of experience this will be for him but resignedly agrees to comply to keep the animals 'satisfied.'",

A jews-harp’s plenty good enough for a rat. All animals like music—in a prison they dote on it. Specially, painful music; and you can’t get no other kind out of a jews-harp. It always interests them; they come out to see what’s the matter with you. Yes, you’re all right; you’re fixed very well. You want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep, and early in the mornings, and play your jews-harp; play ‘The Last Link is Broken’—that’s the thing that’ll scoop a rat quicker ’n anything else; and when you’ve played about two minutes you’ll see all the rats, and the snakes, and spiders, and things begin to feel worried about you, and come. And they’ll just fairly swarm over you, and have a noble good time.”\n“Yes, dey will, I reck’n, Mars Tom, but what kine er time is Jim havin’? Blest if I kin see de pint. But I’ll do it ef I got to. I reck’n I better keep de animals satisfied, en not have no trouble in de house.”\nTom waited to think it over, and see if there wasn’t nothing else; and pretty soon he says:\n“Oh, there’s one thing I forgot. Could you raise a flower here, do you reckon?”\n“I doan know but maybe I could, Mars Tom; but it’s tolable dark in heah, en I ain’ got no use f’r no flower, nohow, en she’d be a pow’ful sight o’ trouble.”\n“Well, you try it, anyway. Some other prisoners has done it.”\n“One er dem big cat-tail-lookin’ mullen-stalks would grow in heah, Mars Tom, I reck’n, but she wouldn’t be wuth half de trouble she’d coss.”\n“Don’t you believe it. We’ll fetch you a little one and you plant it in the corner over there, and raise it. And don’t call it mullen, call it Pitchiola—that’s its right name when it’s in a prison. And you want to water it with your tears.”\n“Why, I got plenty spring water, Mars Tom.”\n“You don’t want spring water; you want to water it with your tears. It’s the way they always do.”\n“Why, Mars Tom, I lay I kin raise one er dem mullen-stalks twyste wid spring water whiles another man’s a start’n one wid tears.”\n“That ain’t the idea. You got to do it with tears.”\n“She’ll die on my han’s, Mars Tom, she sholy will; kase I doan’ skasely ever cry.”\nSo Tom was stumped. But he studied it over, and then said Jim would have to worry along the best he could with an onion. He promised he would go to the nigger cabins and drop one, private, in Jim’s coffee-pot, in the morning. Jim said he would “jis’ ’s soon have tobacker in his coffee;” and found so much fault with it, and with the work and bother of raising the mullen, and jews-harping the rats, and petting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things, on top of all the other work he had to do on pens, and inscriptions, and journals, and things, which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook, that Tom most lost all patience with him; and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for himself, and yet he didn’t know enough to appreciate them, and they was just about wasted on him. So Jim he was sorry, and said he wouldn’t behave so no more, and then me and Tom shoved for bed.",

Dey’s de dadblamest creturs to scrabble over you en bite you while you’s a-sleepin’, I ever see. No, sah, gimme snakes, ef I’s got to have ’m, but doan’ gimme no rats; I hain’t got no use f’r um, skasely.\"\n\n\"But, Jim, you got to have ’em—they all do. So don’t make no more mouth, ’bout it, becuz it’s so. Prisoners ain’t ever without rats. There ain’t no instance of it. And they train them, and pet them, and learn them tricks, and they get to be as sociable as flies. But you got to play music to them. You got anything to play music on?\"\n\n\"I ain’t got nuffin’ but a coarse comb, en a piece of paper, en a jews-harp. But rats doan’ care for music.\"\n\n\"Yes they do. All animals like music—in a prison they dote on it. Especially painful music; and you can’t get no other kind out of a jews-harp. It always interests them; they come out to see what’s the matter with you. Yes, you’re all right; you’re fixed very well. You want to sit on your bed nights before you go to sleep, and early in the mornings, and play your jews-harp; play ‘The Last Link is Broken’—that’s the thing that’ll scoop a rat quicker’n anything else; and when you’ve played about two minutes you’ll see all the rats, and the snakes, and spiders, and things begin to feel worried about you, and come. They’ll just fairly swarm over you, and have a noble good time.\"\n\n\"Yes, dey will, I ’spec’, Mars Tom, but what kine er time is Jim gwyne to have? Blest if I kin see de pint. But I’ll do it ef I got to. I reck’n I better keep de animals satisfied, anyway.\"\n\n\"All right, that’s all right. Now, we’ll start the list of things a prisoner’s got to have. One is a flower. You got to have a flower.\"\n\n\"I doan’ want no flower; I doan’ know what to do with it.\"\n\n\"But you got to have it. All the prisoners do.\"\n\n\"Mars Tom, I can raise a mullen-stalk, and maybe a few jimpson-weeds, but s’pose I got to have a flower, I’ll have to have some dirt, and I’ll have to have some light, and I hain’t got no light nor no dirt.\"\n\n\"Well, you’ll have to dig some up out of the floor.\"\n\n\"I kin try, Mars Tom, but it’ll be considerable trouble.\"\n\n\"Well, you got to do it. Prisoners always do it. You got to call it ‘Pitchiola’—that’s its right name when it’s in a prison. And you want to water it with your tears.\"\n\n\"Why, I got plenty spring water, Mars Tom.\"\n\n\"You don’t want spring water; you want to water it with your tears. It’s the way they always do.\"\n\n\"Why, Mars Tom, I lay I kin raise one or two ’thout any trouble, but to raise one with tears—I can’t do it. I’ll have to be powerful sorry before I can make the tears come, and I don’t know how I’m going to be sorry enough for that.\"\n\n\"Well, you’ll have to, Jim. And I’ll fetch you an onion in the morning. That’ll do it.\"\n\n\"Why, Mars Tom, I’ll cry all the time, ef dat’ll do any good. But lawsy, Mars Tom, I can’t stand all dis work. I’ll never git through. I got to make pens, en inscriptions, en journals, en rats, en snakes, en spiders, en flowers, en pitchiola, en all dem things; en I doan’ know what all, en I doan’ see how I’s ever gwyne to git through. But I’ll do it, Mars Tom, I’ll do it.\"\n\nTom turned on him when he got through, and looked at him steady and kind of wondering, and says:\n\n\"Jim, don’t you know it’s going to make a mighty big name for you, all this trouble and bother? Why, look at it! You’re going to have as many as thirty-seven things to do, and you can’t ever get through them all. And when you get out, you’ll be a hero, and people’ll come from all around to see you, and they’ll say, ‘Why, Jim, you’ve done more than any prisoner ever did in the world.’ And you’ll be famous, Jim, that’s what you’ll be, and it’ll all be on account of me and Huck, because we’re letting you have the gaudiest, out-and-out chance a prisoner ever had to make a name for himself.\"\n\nJim he couldn’t see no advantage in all this; but he was satisfied to do it if Tom and Huck would help him, and he said he would. Then Tom says:\n\n\"All right, that’s all right. Now, me and Huck’s going to bed.\"\n\nSo we left Jim to his own troubles, and went to bed.",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant portion near the end where Tom expresses frustration with Jim's reluctance and lists the many opportunities Jim has to make a name for himself as a prisoner. This section also includes Jim's apology and promise to behave better, which is missing.\n- The transition to the ending is abrupt; the original has a more developed closing exchange between Tom, Jim, and the narrator.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion leaves out some of Jim's detailed complaints about rats, including specific behaviors and comparisons to other animals he would prefer.\n- The middle section is missing some of the back-and-forth about the musical instruments, particularly the discussion about the suitability of a jews-harp and the animals' reaction to music.\n- The process and reasoning for raising a flower are condensed, omitting the discussion about the darkness of the room, the trouble involved, and the specific type of plant suggested by Jim.\n- The original includes a detailed explanation about watering the plant with tears, and Jim's skepticism about this, which is only partially represented in the completion.\n- The completion does not include the plan for Tom to secretly provide an onion by placing it in Jim's coffee-pot, nor Jim's humorous complaint about preferring tobacco in his coffee.\n- The original contains a list of the various tasks and responsibilities Jim is being asked to take on, which is only briefly summarized in the completion.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- In the early dialogue, the completion introduces a \"banjo\" as one of Jim's instruments, which is not present in the original.\n- The sequence of events is sometimes altered, such as the order in which the flower and music discussions occur.\n- Some of Jim's responses are generalized or altered, losing the specific tone and content of his reluctance and humor.\n- The ending inaccurately presents Tom as satisfied and omits his near loss of patience, which is a key emotional beat in the original.\n- The narrator's closing is simplified and does not reflect the more nuanced resolution and character dynamics present in the original passage."

            "prefix-probing": "“Well, it always is when it’s done right. You got any rats around here?”\n\n“Rats? No, I ain’t seen none lately. Why?”\n\nTom grinned, his eyes lighting up with the mischief that always seemed to be brewing in his mind. “Because, Huck, you can’t have a proper prison escape without rats. That’s what the books say. The prisoners always have rats, and they tame them, and they write messages on scraps of paper and tie them to the rats’ tails, and then the rats run out and deliver the messages to their friends on the outside.”\n\nI scratched my head, trying to remember if I’d ever seen a rat in the shed or around the yard. “I reckon we could find one if we tried. Maybe down by the woodpile.”\n\nTom nodded, satisfied. “Good. We’ll need at least two or three. And spiders, too. And snakes, if we can get ‘em.”\n\nI shivered. “Snakes? What for?”\n\n“Why, it’s part of the plan, Huck. The books say the prisoners always have snakes crawling around their cell, and they get used to ‘em, and it makes ‘em look more pitiful when folks come to visit. Besides, it’s more romantic.”\n\nI didn’t know about that, but I wasn’t going to argue with Tom. He always had a way of making things sound like they was the only way to do ‘em, and I didn’t want to spoil his fun.\n\nSo we set about looking for rats and spiders and snakes. We found a couple of spiders under a log, and Tom caught them in a tin can. We didn’t have much luck with rats, but Tom said we could set a trap and try again in the morning. As for snakes, we saw a black racer slither off into the grass, but it was too quick for us.\n\nWhen we got back to the shed, Tom started making a list of all the things we’d need for the escape. “We’ll need a rope ladder, made out of sheets. And we’ll have to bake it into a pie, so Jim can get it without the folks getting suspicious.”\n\nI frowned. “How’s he going to eat a rope ladder baked in a pie?”\n\nTom looked at me like I was simple. “He ain’t supposed to eat it, Huck. He’s supposed to find it in the pie and use it to climb out the window.”\n\n“Oh,” I said. “But there ain’t no window.”\n\nTom waved his hand. “That don’t matter. We’ll make one. Or we’ll pretend there is one. It’s all in the plan.”\n\nI didn’t see how it was going to work, but I let Tom have his way. He was the one with the ideas, and I was just glad to be along for the ride.\n\nThat night, we snuck out to the shed where Jim was locked up. He was glad to see us, and we told him about the plan. He listened real careful, and when Tom finished, Jim shook his head.\n\n“Mas’r Tom, I don’t know ‘bout all this. Seems like a heap of trouble for nothin’. Why can’t I just slip out the door when nobody’s lookin’?”\n\nTom looked shocked. “Jim, that ain’t the way it’s done. You got to do it right, or it don’t count. The books say so.”\n\nJim sighed, but he agreed to go along with it. He trusted Tom, and I reckon he trusted me, too.\n\nThe next few days was busy. We snuck around gathering things for the escape—old sheets, tin plates, candles, and anything else Tom said we needed. We even managed to catch a rat in the trap, and Tom was as proud as if he’d caught a mountain lion.\n\nWe baked the rope ladder into a pie, just like Tom said. It was a tight fit, but we managed it. When we brought it to Jim, he looked at it like he didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.\n\n“Mas’r Tom, how I’m s’posed to get that out without Miss Watson seein’?”\n\nTom grinned. “That’s the beauty of it, Jim. You just wait till she’s gone, then you take it out. Easy as pie.”\n\nJim shook his head, but he took the pie and hid it under his blanket.\n\nWe kept working on the plan, adding more and more things as Tom thought of them. We dug a tunnel under the shed, even though there wasn’t much need for it. We wrote secret messages on tin plates and threw them out the window, even though there wasn’t nobody to read them. We even tried to train the rat to carry a message, but it just bit Tom and ran off.\n\nThrough it all, Tom was as happy as a lark. He said it was the best adventure he’d ever had, and I reckon he was right. It was a lot of work, but it was fun, too.\n\nAnd all the while, Jim just waited, hoping that one day he’d be free. And I hoped so, too."

So we hunted around the cellar and the smokehouse and the henhouse, and by dinner-time we had nigh onto two dozen, all alive and kicking, and making the awfullest racket you ever heard. Aunt Sally come in once and wanted to know what was making all that noise, but Tom he said it was only the kittens fighting, and she went off, grumbling about how she wished the cats would keep out of the house.\n\nAfter dinner, we sneaked the rats up to the loft and let them out in the little pen Tom had fixed up with boards and old boxes. He said we mustn’t let them out all at once, but just a few at a time, so Jim could have the fun of catching them and taming them, the way prisoners always done in the books. Jim, he didn’t see much fun in it, but Tom said it was all in the regular line, and if he didn’t do it, it wouldn’t be right, and the escape wouldn’t work. Jim, he just groaned and said he reckoned he’d rather be a nigger than a prisoner, any day.\n\nThen Tom said we must have some snakes, too, and spiders, and bugs, and all sorts of things that prisoners have to keep them company and make it more dreadful. So we went out in the woods and turned over logs and rocks, and pretty soon we had a sack full of garter-snakes and blacksnakes, and a bottle with a couple of big spiders in it, and some beetles and things. We took them up to the loft and let them out in the pen with the rats, and Tom said it was just splendid, and Jim would have the time of his life.\n\nBut that night, when Jim went to bed, he found the rats and snakes had got out and was all over the place, and he hollered and made such a fuss that Aunt Sally come running in with a candle, and when she saw the snakes and rats, she nearly fainted. Tom and me, we had to help catch them and put them back, and Aunt Sally said if she ever caught us with another rat or snake, she’d skin us alive. But Tom, he just laughed and said it was all part of the plan, and we mustn’t give up now.\n\nSo the next day, we fixed the pen better, and Tom said we must write some mysterious messages on the walls with blood, the way prisoners do, and make some pens out of old spoons and forks. We spent all afternoon scratching on the walls and making up messages about suffering and hope and freedom, and Tom said it was the best prison he ever saw. Jim, he just shook his head and said he hoped we’d get tired of it soon, but Tom said we was just getting started, and there was lots more to do before Jim could escape the right way."

This reflective addition is not present in the original passage and shifts the focus slightly from the direct dialogue and action.\n\n2.

This is an important explanatory step in the original sequence.\n- The middle section is missing the specific dialogue exchange where Huck asks about the meaning of the \"nonnamous letters\" and Tom explains their purpose.

INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes the writing of letters to \"the old man\" as \"writing letters and sending them off, trying to find out where Jim belonged,\" which is a generalization and not as specific as the original, which mentions writing to a particular plantation.\n- The sequence of events is slightly altered: the completion blends the plan to advertise Jim and Huck's reaction into a single paragraph, rather than maintaining the original's clear cause-and-effect structure (advertising plan leads to Huck's anxiety).\n- The explanation of the historical reference (Louis XVI) is less precise, and the completion does not maintain the original's structure of Tom explaining the method and then stating they will use both approaches.\n- The completion paraphrases the plan involving the prisoner's mother and does not present it as a direct plan of action, but rather as something Tom says they will \"work in, too, somehow,\" which is less definite than the original."

This constitutes a minor invention of explanatory content.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion omits the specific emotional reaction described when the St. Louis papers are mentioned. The original includes a distinct physical response and a sense of urgency, which is only partially conveyed in the completion.\n- The completion does not include the detail about the lack of response being due to the nonexistence of the plantation as explicitly as in the original; it is mentioned, but the causal link is less clear.\n- In the dialogue about the \"nonnamous letters,\" the completion omits the explanation that sometimes warnings are done in different ways, and that there is always someone spying around to give notice to the governor of the castle. This stepwise explanation is missing.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is mostly preserved, but the completion slightly alters the order in which Tom explains the historical example and the plan for the letters. In the original, the explanation about the servant-girl and the letters comes after the general description of warnings and spies; in the completion, these are blended together.\n- The completion attributes the idea of the spy and the letter to Tom in a way that combines separate elements from the original, leading to a minor inaccuracy in how the plans are presented.\n- The reference to the \"prisoner’s mother\" plan is generally accurate, but the completion adds a detail about the mother coming to see the prisoner, which is not present in the original, and slightly changes the sequence of who stays and who leaves."

I say, let’s keep still, and not breathe a word about it. If we get into a scrape, we’ll just lay low and keep dark, and maybe they won’t find us out. That’s the way I always do when I get into trouble.”\n\nTom Sawyer looked at me with that old, mischievous twinkle in his eye. “Huck, you don’t understand. The thing of it is, if you don’t warn folks, there ain’t no excitement. What’s the use of a plan if it ain’t got some risk to it? Why, half the fun is in the danger. If we just sneak around and don’t let on to nobody, it’s just plain running away. But if we send a warning, then it’s an adventure!”\n\nI shook my head. “I don’t know, Tom. Seems to me like you’re just asking for trouble. If we was to send a warning, they’d be on the lookout, and then we’d have to be twice as smart to get away with it.”\n\nTom grinned. “That’s just it, Huck! That’s what makes it worth doing. Anybody can run off quiet, but it takes real cleverness to pull off a plan when folks is watching for you. That’s what all the best robbers and pirates do in the books. They always send a letter or a sign, so the people know something’s coming. It makes them scared, and it makes the whole thing more exciting.”\n\nI couldn’t help but smile a little at Tom’s way of looking at things. He always did have a taste for the dramatic. “Well, I reckon you know best, Tom. But if we get caught, don’t say I didn’t warn you.”\n\nTom laughed. “Don’t you worry, Huck. I got it all figured out. We’ll send the warning, but we’ll do it so clever, they won’t know what to make of it. And then, when they’re all in a fluster, we’ll slip right by ‘em, easy as pie.”\n\nI sighed, but I couldn’t help feeling a little thrill at the thought of it. Tom’s plans always did have a way of turning into real adventures, even if they did get us into trouble now and then. So I nodded, and we set about making our warning, just the way Tom wanted."

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces a lengthy invented reflection by Tom about prolonging the adventure and leaving Jim for future generations to rescue. This entire section is not present in the original and shifts the focus away from the actual events.\n- The completion omits the original's specific mention of preparing the letter and the characters' deliberation about what to do with it, which is an important step in the sequence.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion lacks the original's depiction of the characters' uncertainty about how to deliver the letter due to the presence of guards, which is a key motivator for their actions.\n- The completion does not include the detail about overhearing a conversation at supper regarding the guards, which provides context for their plan.\n- The completion omits the process of getting the letter ready before Tom goes to deliver it.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately describes the time of day and the characters' state (being up all night and tired), which is not consistent with the original sequence.\n- The sequence of Tom's actions is altered: the completion has Tom dropping from the lightning-rod and then climbing back up, which is not the order or method described in the original.\n- The completion adds a statement about this being the last letter and the household's unease, which is not present in the original passage.\n- The letter's content is mostly accurate, but there are minor deviations in phrasing and some invented transitions (such as the use of quotation marks and slight changes in wording), though these are less significant than the structural and content issues above."

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents several actions and interactions that do not occur in the original, such as Aunt Sally physically inspecting the character's hat and hand, and the character pretending to be warm and offering to set the hat on the table. These invented events alter the flow and focus of the scene.\n- The completion omits the original's direct dialogue exchange where Aunt Sally questions the character repeatedly and expresses her suspicion, as well as her decisive instruction to go to the sitting-room and her statement about finding out what happened.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the original's detailed sequence of the character blowing out the light and moving stealthily upstairs, which sets the tone and tension early in the passage.\n- The specific mention of the butter's size and its placement on the corn-pone is missing, which removes a concrete detail from the beginning.\n- The original's depiction of Aunt Sally's emotional state and her reasoning for being suspicious is not present, which diminishes the sense of urgency and context for her actions.\n- The transition from the cellar to the main floor, and the moment of being caught by Aunt Sally, is less clearly delineated.\n- The original's description of the crowd in the sitting-room, including the exact number of farmers and their armament, is only partially represented.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces inaccurate actions, such as Aunt Sally physically searching the character and handling the hat, which do not occur in the original.\n- The sequence of events is altered: in the original, the character is caught by Aunt Sally immediately after reaching the main floor, but in the completion, there is a delay and additional invented actions.\n- The number of people in the sitting-room is given as a range rather than the specific number stated in the original.\n- The completion adds invented internal reflections and justifications for actions that are not present in the original passage.\n- The ending inaccurately describes the character's emotional state and actions, adding details about not letting on to being scared, which are not part of the original's conclusion."

I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt Polly—Tom’s Aunt Polly, she is—and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.\n\nNow the way that the book winds up is this: Tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. We got six thousand dollars apiece—all gold. It was an awful sight of money when it was piled up. Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day a piece all the year round—more than a body could tell what to do with. The Widow Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn’t stand it no longer, I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable. So I went back.\n\nThe widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn’t do nothing but sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up. Well, then, the old thing commenced again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come to time. When you got to the table you couldn’t go right to eating, but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the victuals, though there warn’t really anything the matter with them—that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself."

The moon was just peeking out from behind a cloud, throwing a pale light over the yard, and I could see the outline of the lean-to ahead. I moved quicker, my breath coming fast, and slipped around the corner, pressing myself flat against the wall. I waited, counting to ten, then twenty, just to be sure nobody had heard me. Everything was still. I eased along the wall until I found the door, and pushed it open slow, careful not to let it creak. Inside, it was even darker, but I could make out the shapes of barrels and boxes stacked up against the far wall. I felt my way along, hands outstretched, until I found the spot where I’d hidden my things. My heart was pounding so loud I was sure someone would hear it. I grabbed my bundle, slung it over my shoulder, and slipped back out into the night. The air felt cool and fresh, and I took a deep breath, feeling free and wild.

Our raft was tied up where we left it, hidden in the willows. We hurried down the bank, and Jim untied the rope while Tom and me pushed off. The raft slid out into the current, and we all lay down flat, letting the river carry us away from the house and the trouble behind.\n\nFor a long time, nobody said nothing. The only sound was the water lapping against the logs and the soft creak of the rope. I felt like we was floating in a dream, with the stars overhead and the cool night air on our faces. Jim kept looking back at the shore, but after a while he settled down, and Tom started talking about what we’d do next, and how we’d have to be careful till we was safe.\n\nI listened to them, but my mind kept wandering, thinking about all we’d been through, and how things might turn out.

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the original's detailed hypothetical scenarios about the time it might take for the leg to be fixed and the possible need to wait several days.\n- The plan to tie up the character, keep him, and escape down the river is missing.\n- The intention to compensate the character after Tom is done with him is not included.\n\n3.

            "prefix-probing": "There was the clatter of knives and forks, the rattle of dishes, and the hum of voices all mixed together, so that a body could hardly hear himself think. The tables was loaded down with all sorts of good things—fried chicken, ham, greens, corn bread, and pies of every kind you could name. The farmers and their wives was dressed in their Sunday best, and the children was running about, laughing and playing, their faces shining with excitement and the promise of sweet things to come.\n\nI slipped in as quiet as I could, trying not to draw any attention, but it warn’t no use. Everybody was friendly, and before I knew it, a big, motherly woman had me by the arm and was leading me to a seat at the table. She piled my plate high with food and told me to eat my fill, and I warn’t about to argue with her. I set to work, and I reckon I never tasted anything so good in all my life.\n\nWhile I was eating, I listened to the talk around me. The men was talking about crops and the price of corn, and the women was gossiping about their neighbors and the preacher’s new wife. Every now and then, somebody would ask me who I was and where I come from, but I just said I was traveling through and didn’t have no folks around these parts. That seemed to satisfy them, and they went back to their talking and laughing.\n\nAfter dinner, everybody moved out onto the porch or into the yard, and the men lit their pipes and the women fanned themselves with their bonnets. The children played tag and hide-and-seek among the trees, and the whole place was alive with the sound of voices and laughter. I felt right at home, and for a little while, I almost forgot about all the trouble I was in.\n\nBut it warn’t long before I started to get uneasy. I kept thinking about Jim, hiding out on the island, and I knew I couldn’t stay here too long. I slipped away from the crowd and made my way back down to the river, keeping to the shadows so nobody would see me. When I got to the water’s edge, I looked back at the house, all lit up and full of people, and I felt a pang of longing. But I knew I couldn’t stay. I had to get back to Jim and figure out what we was going to do next.\n\nWhen I got back to the island, Jim was waiting for me, his eyes wide with worry. I told him about the dinner and all the people, and he listened close, nodding his head. We talked about what we should do, and finally decided we’d have to move on. It warn’t safe to stay so close to town, not with all them people around.\n\nSo that night, we packed up our things and set out down the river again, drifting with the current and keeping to the shadows. The moon was bright, and the water was smooth as glass. We didn’t say much, just listened to the sounds of the night and the splash of the oars. I felt a little sad, leaving behind the warmth and comfort of that house, but I knew we was doing the right thing.\n\nAs we floated down the river, I thought about all the people I’d met, and how different their lives was from mine and Jim’s. They had homes and families and a place in the world, while we was just drifting, trying to stay one step ahead of trouble. But I reckoned that was the way things had to be, at least for now.\n\nWe traveled on through the night, and by morning, we was far away from the town and the people. The river was wide and quiet, and the only sound was the call of a bird in the trees. Jim and me sat in the bottom of the raft, watching the sun come up over the water, and for a little while, everything seemed peaceful and right.\n\nBut I knew it wouldn’t last. There was always something waiting around the bend, some new danger or trouble. But I reckoned we could handle it, as long as we stuck together and kept our wits about us. And so we floated on, down the big river, into whatever adventures lay ahead."

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the detail about the narrator being cautious not to go too far away, which is present early in the original.\n- The mention of the people departing late in the day is absent, which removes a time marker and a sense of the setting clearing out.\n- The narrator's recounting of having already told the same story to another character is not present, omitting a layer of repetition and character interaction.\n- The original contains a reflection from Aunt Sally about her attitude toward boys and her decision to focus on gratitude rather than worry, which is only partially represented in the completion.\n- The physical gestures and emotional responses (such as kissing, patting, and falling into a thoughtful state) are not fully included, reducing the emotional nuance.\n\n3.

So I done it, but I dasn’t go fur, or she might see me and call me back. I set down and thought it over, and then I says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks, though I ain’t had no experience, and can’t say for certain; but it looks so to me, anyway; and yet here’s a case where I’m blest if it don’t look to me like the truth is better and actuly safer than a lie. I must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time or other, it’s so kind of strange and unregular. I never see nothing like it. Well, I says to myself at last, I’m a-going to chance it; I’ll up and tell the truth this time, though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see where you’ll go to. Then I started out for the house, and I see Aunt Sally coming, and I says to myself, now I’ll tackle her first, and then I’ll tackle the old man if I have to. So I says:\n\n\"Aunt Sally, we—me and Sid—woke up and heard the noise and the shooting. We didn’t know what the matter was, and the door was locked, and we wanted to see the fun, so we clumb out of the window and down the lightning-rod, and both of us got hurt a little, and we didn’t never want to try that no more.\"\n\n\"Well,\" she says, \"you done just the right thing. I never see such a boy! I’m glad you’re both safe and sound. Boys will be boys, I reckon. I’m going to be thankful you’re alive and well, and not grumble because you done what was only natural for boys to do.\"\n\nShe kissed me, and patted me on the head, and set down, kind of absent-minded, on a chair, and looked down musing, and presently she says, sort of to herself:\n\n\"It’s most night, and Sid ain’t come yet.

The house was still, with only the faintest creak of the boards under my feet. I found a spot by the back porch where the honeysuckle grew thick, and I crouched down behind it, thinking hard. I had to come up with a story that would satisfy them, something that would make sense and not get Jim or me into trouble. I turned it over in my mind, remembering what Miss Watson and the widow had said the night before, and how they’d looked at me when I said goodnight. Maybe I could say I’d gone out early to fish, or that I’d heard a noise and went to see what it was. But then, what about Jim? He couldn’t be seen, not by anybody. I’d have to make sure he stayed hid, and that nobody suspected he was anywhere near. The more I thought, the more tangled it got, but I knew I had to keep my wits about me. If I slipped up, it’d be all over for Jim, and maybe for me, too. So I set my jaw and made up my mind to stick to my story, whatever happened."

And the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and towed her over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start.

Where’s the raft?”\n“It’s all right,” I says.\n“And Jim?”\n“The same,” I says, but couldn’t say it pretty brash. But he never noticed, but says:\n“Good! Splendid! Now we’re all right and safe! Did you tell Aunty?”\nI was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says: “About what, Sid?”\n“Why, about the way the whole thing was done.”\n“What whole thing?”\n“Why, the whole thing. There ain’t but one; how we set the runaway nigger free—me and Tom.”\n“Good land! Set the run— What is the child talking about! Dear, dear, out of his head again!”\n“No, I ain’t out of my HEAD; I know all what I’m talking about. We did set him free—me and Tom. We laid out to do it, and we done it. And we done it elegant, too.” He’d got a start, and she never checked him up, just set and stared and stared, and let him clip along, and I see it warn’t no use for me to put in. “Why, Aunty, it cost us a power of work—weeks of it—hours and hours, every night, whilst you was all asleep. And we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and the shirt, and your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and case-knives, and the warming-pan, and the grindstone, and flour, and just no end of things, and you can’t think what work it was to make the saws, and pens, and inscriptions, and one thing or another, and you can’t think half the fun it was. And we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things, and nonnamous letters from the robbers, and get up and down the lightning-rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, and made the rope ladder and send it in cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and things to work with in your apron pocket—”\n“Mercy sakes!”\n“—and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on, for company for Jim; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat that you come near spiling the whole business, because the men come before we was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us and let drive at us, and I got my share, and we dodged out of the path and let them go by, and when the dogs come they warn’t interested in us, but went for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for the raft, and was all safe, and Jim was a free man, and we done it all by ourselves, and wasn’t it bully, Aunty!”",

He seemed to be in a kind of daze, like he was always thinking about something he couldn’t quite get hold of, and I made sure to keep out of his way, for fear he’d start asking questions I couldn’t answer. Tom, he was laid up in bed, but he was always scheming, whispering to me when Aunt Sally wasn’t around, and making plans for how we was going to get Jim out of the shed.\n\nThe days dragged on, and I kept busy fetching things for Tom, and sneaking out to the shed to talk to Jim when I could. Jim, he was getting mighty anxious, but he kept his spirits up, saying he trusted us boys to get him out. I told him to keep quiet and not let on to anybody, and he said he wouldn’t, not for the world. Tom, he kept making up new ideas for the escape, each one wilder than the last. He wanted to dig a tunnel with case-knives, and make Jim write a journal on a shirt with his own blood, and all sorts of things. I told him it was all foolishness, but Tom said it wouldn’t be an adventure if we didn’t do it right.\n\nOne night, after Aunt Sally had gone to bed and the house was quiet, Tom and me slipped out with our tools. We crept through the yard, keeping to the shadows, and made our way to the shed where Jim was locked up. Tom had a plan to saw the leg off the bed so Jim could slip his chain, and I was to keep watch. We worked for hours, sawing and whispering, and finally got the chain loose. Jim was so grateful he nearly cried, but Tom said we wasn’t done yet. We had to bake a pie with a rope ladder in it, and smuggle it in to Jim, just like in the books.\n\nThe next day, I helped Aunt Sally in the kitchen, pretending to be as innocent as a lamb, while Tom sneaked around gathering things for the escape. He got a sheet for the ladder, and a spoon for digging, and even a candlestick to write with. Aunt Sally kept asking where things was going, and I had to make up stories to keep her from getting suspicious. It was hard work, but Tom said it was all part of the adventure.\n\nAt last, the night came when we was ready to make the final escape. Tom and me slipped out again, our hearts pounding, and made our way to the shed. We gave Jim the rope ladder and the pie, and he was so happy he hugged us both. We waited until the house was quiet, then slipped out into the night, making our way through the fields toward the river. But just as we was almost free, we heard a shout behind us. The men from the farm had found out Jim was gone, and they was after us with dogs and guns.\n\nWe ran as fast as we could, dodging through the trees and jumping over fences. Tom got caught on a branch and tore his pants, but we didn’t stop. Jim was running for his life, and I was right behind him, my heart beating fit to burst. At last, we made it to the river, and Jim jumped in the canoe we had hidden there. Tom and me scrambled in after him, and we pushed off into the darkness, the shouts of the men fading behind us.\n\nWe floated down the river, safe at last, and Jim was free. Tom was grinning from ear to ear, and I felt like I could fly. We had done it—we had set Jim free, and had the greatest adventure of our lives. I knew I’d never forget it, not as long as I lived."

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the explicit statement from the child character affirming their intent, which is present at the start of the original passage.\n- There is a missing reference to both the narrator and Tom having known the person in question for their whole life, which is an important relational detail in the original.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of who speaks and when is altered; the original has a different order of responses and attributions.\n- The completion attributes the explanation about Miss Watson and the will to Tom, whereas the original assigns this information differently.\n- The completion introduces a narrative aside that changes the point of view and the flow of the conversation, which is not consistent with the original structure.\n- The rest of the passage, including the arrival and description of Aunt Polly, is generally accurate in terms of sequence, but the earlier inaccuracies affect the overall coherence and fidelity to the original passage."

So Tom’s Aunt Polly, she told all about who I was, and what; and I had to up and tell how I was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom Sawyer—she chipped in and says, “Oh, go on and call me Aunt Sally, I’m used to it now, and ’tain’t no need to change”—that when Aunt Sally took me for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it—there warn’t no other way, and I knowed he wouldn’t mind, because it would be nuts for him, being a mystery, and he’d make an adventure out of it, and be perfectly satisfied. And so it turned out, and he let on to be Sid, and made things as soft as he could for me.\nAnd his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting Jim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone and took all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and I couldn’t ever understand before, until that minute and that talk, how he could help a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up.",

I dusted myself off and tried to look innocent, but Aunt Sally caught sight of me and said, “Why, Huck, where have you been all this time?”\n\nI said, “Oh, just looking around, ma’am.”\n\nShe smiled at me, and I could see she was too happy to be bothered by anything. “Well, you come on and get some supper. You must be starving.”\n\nSo we all sat down to eat, and the table was full of good things—ham and greens and hot biscuits and honey, and Aunt Sally kept piling my plate high, like she was feeding a lost puppy. Tom, he was grinning from ear to ear, and telling stories about all the things he’d seen and done, and Aunt Sally and Uncle Silas just listened and shook their heads and laughed.\n\nAfter supper, we all went out on the porch, and the sun was setting over the fields, turning everything gold and pink. The air was soft and warm, and the crickets were starting up. Aunt Sally sat in her rocking chair, with Tom on one side and me on the other, and she said, “I declare, I never thought I’d see this day. My own boy home again, and safe.”\n\nTom looked at her, and his eyes were shining. “I’m glad to be home, Aunt Sally. I surely am.”\n\nAnd I sat there, feeling like maybe I belonged, just a little, and thinking that sometimes, things do turn out right, after all."
