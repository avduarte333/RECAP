I'd been through too much and seen too much of that kind of life. The Widow Douglas was going to try and sivilize me again too. I reckon I can't stand it. I been there before.

Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he got so he wouldn’t hardly notice the other niggers. Niggers would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country. Strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder. Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things, Jim would happen in and say, “Hm! What you know ’bout witches?” and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat. Jim always kept that five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it. Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn’t touch it, because the devil had had his hands on it. Jim was most ruined for a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches.",

Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked under a wall where you wouldn’t a noticed that there was a hole.

Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name in blood.”\nEverybody was willing. So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on, and read it. It swore every boy to stick to the band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family must do it, and he mustn’t eat and he mustn’t sleep till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign of the band. And nobody that didn’t belong to the band could use that mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be killed. And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever.\nEverybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got it out of his own head.",

That ain’t no sort of style. We are highwaymen. We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks on, and kill the people and take their watches and money.”\n“Must we always kill the people?”\n“Oh, certainly. It’s best. Some authorities think different, but mostly it’s considered best to kill them—except some that you bring to the cave here, and keep them till they’re ransomed.”\n“Ransomed? What’s that?”\n“I don’t know. But that’s what they do. I’ve seen it in books; and so of course that’s what we’ve got to do.”\n“But how can we do it if we don’t know what it is?”\n“Why, blame it all, we’ve got to do it. Don’t I tell you it’s in the books? Do you want to go to doing different from what’s in the books, and get things all muddled up?”\n“Oh, that’s all very fine to say, Tom Sawyer, but how in the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don’t know how to do it to them?—that’s the thing I want to get at. Now, what do you reckon it is?”\n“Well, I don’t know. But per’aps if we keep them till they’re ransomed, it means that we keep them till they’re dead.”\n“Now, that’s something like. That’ll answer. Why couldn’t you said that before? We’ll keep them till they’re ransomed to death; and a bothersome lot they’ll be, too—eating up everything, and always trying to get loose.”\n“How you talk, Ben Rogers. How can they get loose when there’s a guard over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?”\n“A guard! Well, that is good. So somebody’s got to set up all night and never get any sleep, just so as to watch them. I think that’s foolishness. Why can’t a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here?”\n“Because it ain’t in the books so—that’s why. Now, Ben Rogers, do you want to do things regular, or don’t you?—that’s the idea. Don’t you reckon that the people that made the books knows what’s the correct thing to do? Do you reckon you can learn ’em anything? Not by a good deal. No, sir, we’ll just go on and ransom them in the regular way.”\n“All right. I don’t mind; but I say it’s a fool way, anyhow. Say, do we kill the women, too?”\n“Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn’t let on. Kill the women? No; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that. You fetch them to the cave, and you’re always as polite as pie to them; and by-and-by they fall in love with you, and never want to go home any more.”\n“Well, if that’s the way I’m agreed, but I don’t take no stock in it. Mighty soon we’ll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and fellows waiting to be ransomed, that there won’t be no place for the robbers. But go ahead, I ain’t got nothing to say.”",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant middle section of the original passage, particularly the extended discussion about the meaning of 'ransom,' the confusion among the boys about what it entails, and the debate over how to handle captives. This results in a loss of the original's back-and-forth dialogue and the humorous misunderstanding central to the scene.\n- The completion introduces repetitive and nonsensical filler in the latter part, which is not present in the original and disrupts the flow of the conversation.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early on, the completion does not include the clarification about the difference between robbery and burglary, nor does it capture the explanation of what being a highwayman involves.\n- The middle section is missing the detailed exchange about ransoming, including the boys' confusion, their references to books, and the debate about how to guard captives and what to do with them.\n- The completion lacks the original's discussion about the logistics of guarding prisoners, the suggestion of using a guard, and the disagreement about the practicality of staying up all night.\n- The ending omits the original's closing remarks about the impracticality of the plan and the concern about the cave becoming overcrowded.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion inaccurately attributes the group's targets and activities, introducing invented details about robbing farmers and omitting the original's distinctions between types of crime.\n- The sequence of events is altered, with the discussion about women and their treatment occurring much earlier than in the original, and without the preceding debate about ransoming.\n- The completion invents a lengthy, repetitive monologue about how to treat women, which is not present in the original and does not reflect the actual dialogue structure.\n- The completion fails to accurately represent the original's order of questioning and responses, leading to a loss of the logical progression and humor found in the source material."

We used to hop out of the woods and go charging down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market, but we never hived any of them. Tom Sawyer called the hogs “ingots,” and he called the turnips and stuff “julery,” and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had killed and marked. But I couldn’t see no profit in it. One time Tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he called a slogan (which was the sign for the Gang to get together), and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two hundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a thousand “sumter” mules, all loaded down with di’monds, and they didn’t have only a guard of four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay in ambuscade, as he called it, and kill the lot and scoop the things. He said we must slick up our swords and guns, and get ready. He never could go after even a turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it, though they was only lath and broomsticks, and you might scour at them till you rotted, and then they warn’t worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before. I didn’t believe we could lick such a crowd of Spaniards and A-rabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants, so I was on hand next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill. But there warn’t no Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn’t no camels nor no elephants. It warn’t anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-class at that. We busted it up, and chased the children up the hollow; but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got a rag doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and then the teacher charged in, and made us drop everything and cut.",

I went up the road and around the fence to where the tracks went off into the woods. I got down on my hands and knees again, and I seen the tracks again, and I seen that the left boot-heel had a cross in the middle of it, made with big nails, to keep off the devil. I knowed his track now. Who else would make such a mark? I knowed it was old Pap's foot as well as I knowed my own name. Now I was scared, I tell you. I warn't scared before. I was just a little uneasy, but now I was scared. I knowed what was coming. I knowed he wouldn't stay away. He was bound to come, sooner or later. I knowed he was after my money.

He said if you hadn't ever spent all the money the thing could do was to tell you what was going to happen to you.

He said it was a powerful sight more trouble than it was worth.\n\nHe said the first thing the hair-ball said was, that Pap would come back, and that he hadn't gone for good. He said he was undecided whether to stay or go, and he was being pulled two ways by two angels, one white and one black. The white angel was trying to get him to do right and stay, and the black angel was trying to get him to do wrong and go. He said you couldn't tell which one would win, but it was all up with Pap if the black one did.\n\nThen he said the hair-ball said I was going to have considerable trouble in my life, and considerable joy. Sometimes I would be sick, and sometimes I would get hurt, but I would always get over it. He said there was two women in my life, and they was both going to be important to me. One was light-haired and one was dark-haired. One was rich and one was poor. I would marry the poor one first and then the rich one.\n\nHe said the hair-ball said I must keep away from the water as much as I could, and not take no risks, because it said I was going to be hanged.\n\nThat night I went up to my room, and I warn't feeling very comfortable.

I want it.”\n“I hain’t got only a dollar, and I want that to—”\n“It don’t make no difference what you want it for—you just shell it out.”\nHe took it and bit it to see if it was good, and then he said he was going down town to get some whisky; said he hadn’t had a drink all day.

He went for the judge all day (that is, till he went to bed at night), and cussed him and cussed the judge's family all over the place, and everybody else that come handy. And he went right on cussing all the time, and everything he could lay his hands on he broke it all up in a minute. He was bound to raise Cain, and he did.

So he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean and nice, and had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family, and was just as good to him as he could be. He said he reckoned a body could reform the old man with kindness. That he'd never had no chance before. So he set up with him all night, talking to him and trying to interest him in religion; but he got drunk before he went to bed, and said he wouldn't sober up for no account. When he woke up in the morning he was sober, and he was all right, and he was the judge's pet till toward noon; then he got drunk again, and he was the most ornery old cuss that ever was. He went for the judge all day (that is, till he went to bed at night), and cussed him and cussed the judge's family all over the place, and everybody else that come handy. And he went right on cussing all the time, and everything he could lay his hands on he broke it all up in a minute. He was bound to raise Cain, and he did. He cussed one of the most religious widows in the town, and gen'rally carried on so you couldn't stand it any longer; so they had to put him back in jail.  But by-and-by they fetched him out again, and they said him and the judge are going to work him over. So they all set in, five or six of 'em, on the temperance question, and Pap he said he'd sign the pledge. So they got a pen and ink, and Pap he wrote his name, or his mark, anyway, a cross alongside of his name, and they all said it was the holiest time on record. Then they all shook hands with him, and Pap he said he'd been a fool, and he'd wasted his life; but now he was a-going to turn over a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn't be ashamed of, and he hoped they'd all stand by him and see him through. And they all said they would. It was a mighty touching sight. And when Pap was a-going to bed the judge he took him into his room and talked to him a long time, and Pap he cried, and said he'd been a fool, and he'd wasted his life, and he was a-going to turn over a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn't be ashamed of, and he hoped they'd all stand by him and see him through.

His lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and Judge Thatcher knowed how to do it. And he said people allowed there’d be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian, and they guessed it would win this time. This shook me up considerable, because I didn’t want to go back to the widow’s any more and be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it. Then the old man got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of, and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn’t skipped any, and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round, including a considerable parcel of people which he didn’t know the names of, and so called them what’s-his-name when he got to them, and went right along with his cussing.\nHe said he would like to see the widow get me. He said he would watch out, and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place six or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till they dropped and they couldn’t find me. That made me pretty uneasy again, but only for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn’t stay on hand till he got that chance.\nThe old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got. There was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon, ammunition, and a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two newspapers for wadding, besides some tow. I toted up a load, and went back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest. I thought it all over, and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and take to the woods when I run away. I guessed I wouldn’t stay in one place, but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and hunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow couldn’t ever find me any more. I judged I would saw out and leave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would. I got so full of it I didn’t notice how long I was staying till the old man hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded.\nI got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark. While I was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of warmed up, and went to ripping again. He had been drunk over in town, and laid in the gutter all night, and he was a sight to look at. A body would a thought he was Adam—he was just all mud. Whenever his liquor begun to work he most always went for the govment, this time he says:\n“Call this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it’s like. Here’s the law a-standing ready to take a man’s son away from him—a man’s own son, which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and all the expense of raising. Yes, just as that man has got that son raised at last, and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin’ for him and give him a rest, the law up and goes for him. And they call that govment! That ain’t all, nuther. The law backs that old Judge Thatcher up and helps him to keep me out o’ my property. Here’s what the law does: The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and up’ards, and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets him go round in clothes that ain’t fitten for a hog. They call that govment! A man can’t get his rights in a govment like this. Sometimes I’ve a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all. Yes, and I told ’em so; I told old Thatcher so to his face. Lots of ’em heard me, and can tell what I said. Says I, for two cents I’d leave the blamed country and never come a-near it agin. Them’s the very words. I says look at my hat—if you call it a hat—but the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till it’s below my chin, and then it ain’t rightly a hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o’ stove-pipe. Look at it, says I—such a hat for me to wear—one of the wealthiest men in this town if I could git my rights.\n“Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. Why, looky here. There was a free nigger there from Ohio—a mulatter, most as white as a white man. He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the shiniest hat; and there ain’t a man in that town that’s got as fine clothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a silver-headed cane—the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State. And what do you think? They said he was a p’fessor in a college, and could talk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything. And that ain’t the wust. They said he could vote when he was at home. Well, that let me out. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming to? It was ’lection day, and I was just about to go and vote myself if I warn’t too drunk to get there; but when they told me there was a State in this country where they’d let that nigger vote, I drawed out. I says I’ll never vote agin. Them’s the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may rot for all me—I’ll never vote agin as long as I live. And to see the cool way of that nigger—why, he wouldn’t a give me the road if I hadn’t shoved him out o’ the way.",

            "prefix-probing": "Pap warn’t in a good humor—so he was his natural self. He come a-stomping in, smelling of whiskey and the river, his long hair all tangled and greasy, and his face looking like a thunder-cloud that had been left out in the sun too long. He didn’t say nothing at first, just glared around the cabin like he expected to find somebody hidin’ there. I was settin’ by the fire, trying to look small and busy, mending a fish-line. My heart was thumping against my ribs like a drum. I knew what was coming. It always come when he was like this. He’d been gone for a couple of days, off on one of his sprees, and I’d had a little peace, just me and the woods and the river sounds. But now he was back, and the peace was over. He finally spotted me and his eyes narrowed. “Well, looky here,” he growled, his voice rough as sandpaper. “Settin’ there like a lord, ain’t you? With your fine clothes and your book-learnin’.” My clothes warn’t fine; they was just the ones the Widow Douglas had give me, patched up. And the book-learnin’ was just a little bit I’d got before he snatched me away. But you couldn’t tell him that. He didn’t want to hear it. He wanted to be mad. He staggered over and kicked the stool I was settin’ on right out from under me. I landed on the floor with a thump. “Git up!” he yelled. “Think you’re too good to work, do you? Settin’ there mending fish-lines when there’s wood to chop and water to fetch! You think you’re better’n your old man, don’t you? With your schoolin’ and your clean shirt!” He was working himself up into a real frenzy now. His face was red and his eyes were wild. He started pacing back and forth, waving his arms. “I’ll show you who’s better! I’ll knock the schoolin’ right out of you! What right have you got to be goin’ to school? A boy like you! Your pap never went to school, and he got along just fine! Better’n fine! I’m a man, I am! And you’re just a boy, and you’ll do what I tell you!” He went on like that for a good while, ranting about school and books and how they was all foolishness. He said they just filled your head with nonsense and made you think you was better than honest folks. He said the government was in league with the schools to make people soft and easy to control. He said the only thing a man needed was his own two hands and a bottle of whiskey. Then he got onto the subject of my money. The six thousand dollars Judge Thatcher was keeping for me. That was always a sore spot with him. He couldn’t stand the idea of me having money and him not being able to get his hands on it. “And that money!” he roared, stopping right in front of me and shaking his fist. “Six thousand dollars! Mine, by rights! My boy’s got six thousand dollars, and I ain’t got a cent! It ain’t right! The law’s a fool! Says I can’t have it! Says I ain’t fit to have it! Who says I ain’t fit? I’m his father! I made him! I got a right to that money!” He went on about the law and the courts and how they was all against him. He said they protected folks like the Widow Douglas and Judge Thatcher, who was trying to steal his boy and his money. He said they let free niggers vote, but wouldn’t let an honest white man like him have his own son’s money. That was another thing that always set him off – free black people. He couldn’t stand the idea of them being free and having rights. He’d seen a free black man in town once, dressed in nice clothes and carrying a cane, and it had driven him crazy. He talked about it for days. He said it warn’t natural. He said they ought to be sold back into slavery. He said the government was run by fools and abolitionists. He’d get so worked up about it, his face would turn purple and he’d foam at the mouth. He’d yell and curse and smash things. Sometimes he’d chase me around the cabin, trying to beat me. I’d have to dodge and duck and try to get out the door. He was strong, even when he was drunk, and his blows hurt. He didn’t care where he hit you. He’d just flail away. I learned to be quick on my feet. I learned to read the signs in his face and his voice, to know when he was about to explode. It was a miserable life. I was scared most of the time. Scared of him, scared of the dark, scared of being alone with him in that cabin in the woods. He wouldn’t let me go to school, wouldn’t let me go to church, wouldn’t let me see my friends. He just kept me there, locked up, so he could have me all to himself and beat me and yell at me whenever he felt like it. He’d go off sometimes for days, leaving me with just enough food to get by. Those were the good times, even though I was lonely. But then he’d come back, and the nightmare would start all over again. He’d drink and rant and rave, and I’d just have to sit there and take it, or try to get out of his way. He’d talk about how he was going to get my money, how he was going to make me work for him, how he was going to show the world that he was somebody. But mostly he just drank and got meaner and meaner. He was the worst kind of human being I ever met. He was ignorant and violent and full of hate. And he was my father. It made me sick to think about it. I wished he would just disappear and never come back. I wished I was dead sometimes, just to be free of him. But mostly I just wished I could get away. Get away from the cabin, get away from him, get away from the whole miserable business. I didn’t know how I was going to do it, but I knew I had to. I couldn’t live like that forever. Nobody could. It was worse than being dead. It was like being buried alive, with a madman for company. And he was just getting started tonight. I could see it in his eyes. It was going to be a long night."

Why, they said he couldn’t be sold till he’d been in the State six months, and he hadn’t been there that long yet. There, now—that’s a specimen. They call that a govment that can’t sell a free nigger till he’s been in the State six months. Here’s a govment that calls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a govment, and yet’s got to set stock-still for six whole months before it can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free nigger, and—”\nPap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was taking him to, so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and barked both shins, and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of language—mostly hove at the nigger and the govment, though he give the tub some, too, all along, here and there. He hopped around the cabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holding first one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with his left foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick. But it warn’t good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl that fairly made a body’s hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, and rolled there, and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had ever done previous. He said so his own self afterwards. He had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it laid over him, too; but I reckon that was sort of piling it on, maybe.",

            "Instead of falling into a sound sleep, Pap remained restless, groaning, moaning, and thrashing about for a considerable time.",
            "Eventually, Huck became so overwhelmingly sleepy that he could no longer keep his eyes open and, before he realized it, fell fast asleep while the candle continued to burn.",

            "Pap began to run repeatedly around the cabin, shouting, 'Take him off! take him off! he’s biting me on the neck!' his eyes filled with a wildness Huck had never witnessed before.",

            "He then dropped to all fours and crawled away, pleading with his unseen tormentors to leave him be, finally rolling himself up in his blanket and retreating under the old pine table, still begging, and then began to cry, his sobs audible to Huck through the blanket."

He drank and drank, and tumbled down on his blankets by-and-by; but luck didn’t run my way. He didn’t go sound asleep, but was uneasy. He groaned and moaned and thrashed around this way and that for a long time. At last I got so sleepy I couldn’t keep my eyes open all I could do, and so before I knowed what I was about I was sound asleep, and the candle burning.\nI don’t know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was an awful scream and I was up. There was pap looking wild, and skipping around every which way and yelling about snakes. He said they was crawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say one had bit him on the cheek—but I couldn’t see no snakes. He started and run round and round the cabin, hollering “Take him off! take him off! he’s biting me on the neck!” I never see a man look so wild in the eyes. Pretty soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he rolled over and over wonderful fast, kicking things every which way, and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming and saying there was devils a-hold of him. He wore out by-and-by, and laid still a while, moaning. Then he laid stiller, and didn’t make a sound. I could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and it seemed terrible still. He was laying over by the corner. By-and-by he raised up part way and listened, with his head to one side. He says, very low:\n“Tramp—tramp—tramp; that’s the dead; tramp—tramp—tramp; they’re coming after me; but I won’t go. Oh, they’re here! don’t touch me—don’t! hands off—they’re cold; let go. Oh, let a poor devil alone!”\nThen he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let him alone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the old pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying.

Pap said, “Well, then, it don’t look like you can get any to-night, unless you want to swim for it; but first you know, pap ’ll get dry, and then you’ll have to hunt it up.” There warn’t no sense in wasting words; it wouldn’t do no good; so I didn’t say anything, but went and laid down on the blankets, and pap he fell to drinking again.

          "text_segment": "“Git up! What you ’bout?”\nI opened my eyes and looked around, trying to make out where I was. It was after sun-up, and I had been sound asleep. Pap was standing over me looking sour and sick, too. He says:\n“What you doin’ with this gun?”\nI judged he didn’t know nothing about what he had been doing, so I says:\n“Somebody tried to get in, so I was laying for him.”\n“Why didn’t you roust me out?”\n“Well, I tried to, but I couldn’t; I couldn’t budge you.”\n“Well, all right. Don’t stand there palavering all day, but out with you and see if there’s a fish on the lines for breakfast. I’ll be along in a minute.”\nHe unlocked the door, and I cleared out up the river-bank. I noticed some pieces of limbs and such things floating down, and a sprinkling of bark; so I knowed the river had begun to rise. I reckoned I would have great times now if I was over at the town. The June rise used to be always luck for me; because as soon as that rise begins here comes cordwood floating down, and pieces of log rafts—sometimes a dozen logs together; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the wood-yards and the sawmill.\nI went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t’other one out for what the rise might fetch along. Well, all at once here comes a canoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long, riding high like a duck. I shot head-first off of the bank like a frog, clothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe. I just expected there’d be somebody laying down in it, because people often done that to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they’d raise up and laugh at him. But it warn’t so this time. It was a drift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore. Thinks I, the old man will be glad when he sees this—she’s worth ten dollars. But when I got to shore pap wasn’t in sight yet, and as I was running her into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and willows, I struck another idea: I judged I’d hide her good, and then, ’stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I’d go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a rough time tramping on foot.\nIt was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old man coming all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and looked around a bunch of willows, and there was the old man down the path a piece just drawing a bead on a bird with his gun. So he hadn’t seen anything.\nWhen he got along I was hard at it taking up a “trot” line. He abused me a little for being so slow; but I told him I fell in the river, and that was what made me so long. I knowed he would see I was wet, and then he would be asking questions. We got five catfish off the lines and went home.",

Then we had dinner. Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch more stuff; but that warn’t pap’s style.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces a lengthy and detailed sequence involving the pig, the axe, and staging a scene of violence, which is not present in the original passage. This is a significant invention and shifts the focus away from the original content.\n- The completion adds an extended reflection and description of the narrator's feelings of loneliness, as well as a long, detailed observation of the natural surroundings, which are not part of the original excerpt.\n- The completion omits the entire section about disguising the evidence of the narrator's activities at the cabin, including the specific actions taken to conceal the entrance and the reasoning behind them.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the process of covering up the traces left behind after removing the supplies, such as scattering dust and replacing the log, which is a key part of the original passage's sequence.\n- The reasoning for leaving a particular tool behind is missing, as well as the explanation for why it was not taken.\n- The completion omits the description of how the concealment would appear to an observer and the unlikelihood of discovery due to the location.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately presents the sequence of events by introducing actions and reflections that do not occur in the original passage at this point in the narrative.\n- There are misattributed actions, such as taking items that are not mentioned in the original, and performing actions (like smashing the door or killing a pig) that are not part of the described events.\n- The completion provides an incorrect timeline, extending far beyond the original passage's scope by including events that happen later in the story or not at all in this context."

So I went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house. I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the bottom of it with the saw, for there warn’t no knives and forks on the place—pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking. Then I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and full of rushes—and ducks too, you might say, in the season. There was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles away, I don’t know where, but it didn’t go to the river. The meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake. I dropped pap’s whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so it wouldn’t leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again.\nIt was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise. I made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by-and-by laid down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan. I says to myself, they’ll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me. And they’ll follow that meal track to the lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that killed me and took the things. They won’t ever hunt the river for anything but my dead carcass. They’ll soon get tired of that, and won’t bother no more about me. All right; I can stop anywhere I want to. Jackson’s Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well, and nobody ever comes there. And then I can paddle over to town nights, and slink around and pick up things I want.

I rose up, and there was Jackson’s Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and standing up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like a steamboat without any lights. There warn’t any signs of the bar at the head—it was all under water now.\nIt didn’t take me long to get there. I shot past the head at a ripping rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and landed on the side towards the Illinois shore. I run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow branches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the outside.\nI went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town, three mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling. A monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down, with a lantern in the middle of it. I watched it come creeping down, and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, “Stern oars, there! heave her head to stabboard!” I heard that just as plain as if the man was by my side.\nThere was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the woods, and laid down for a nap before breakfast.",

I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about things, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied. I could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees all about, and gloomy in there amongst them. There was freckled places on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the freckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little breeze up there. A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very friendly.\nI was powerful lazy and comfortable—didn’t want to get up and cook breakfast. Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep sound of “boom!” away up the river. I rouses up, and rests on my elbow and listens; pretty soon I hears it again. I hopped up, and went and looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying on the water a long ways up—about abreast the ferry. And there was the ferry-boat full of people floating along down. I knowed what was the matter now. “Boom!” I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferry-boat’s side. You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my carcass come to the top.\nI was pretty hungry, but it warn’t going to do for me to start a fire, because they might see the smoke. So I set there and watched the cannon-smoke and listened to the boom. The river was a mile wide there, and it always looks pretty on a summer morning—so I was having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to eat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the drownded carcass and stop there. So, says I, I’ll keep a lookout, and if any of them’s floating around after me I’ll give them a show. I changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could have, and I warn’t disappointed. A big double loaf come along, and I most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out further. Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the shore—I knowed enough for that. But by-and-by along comes another one, and this time I won. I took out the plug and shook out the little dab of quicksilver, and set my teeth in. It was “baker’s bread”—what the quality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone.\nI got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied.",

When they got abreast the head of the island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and went home to the town.\nI knowed I was all right now. Nobody else would come a-hunting after me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick woods. I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things under so the rain couldn’t get at them. I catched a catfish and haggled him open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had supper. Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast.\nWhen it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well satisfied; but by-and-by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set on the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the stars and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed; there ain’t no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you can’t stay so, you soon get over it.\nAnd so for three days and nights. No difference—just the same thing. But the next day I went exploring around down through the island. I was boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time. I found plenty strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show. They would all come handy by-and-by, I judged.",

There wasn’t no wind, and not a sound anywheres, the canoe coasted in silent.

When it was good and dark I started to build a fire and cook supper. Then I thought I better not, because Pap might be prowling around.

About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake, and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after it, trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.\nMy heart jumped up amongst my lungs. I never waited for to look further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast as ever I could. Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the thick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn’t hear nothing else. I slunk along another piece further, then listened again; and so on, and so on. If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of my breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too.\nWhen I got to camp I warn’t feeling very brash, there warn’t much sand in my craw; but I says, this ain’t no time to be fooling around. So I got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight, and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last year’s camp, and then clumb a tree.\nI reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn’t see nothing, I didn’t hear nothing—I only thought I heard and seen as much as a thousand things. Well, I couldn’t stay up there forever; so at last I got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast.\nBy the time it was night I was pretty hungry. So when it was good and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the Illinois bank—about a quarter of a mile. I went out in the woods and cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there all night when I hear a plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk, and says to myself, horses coming; and next I hear people’s voices. I got everything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping through the woods to see what I could find out. I hadn’t got far when I hear a man say:\n“We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about beat out. Let’s look around.”\nI didn’t wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy.

By-and-by I says to myself, I can’t live this way; I’m a-going to find out who it is that’s here on the island with me; I’ll find it out or bust. Well, I felt better right off.\nSo I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows. The moon was shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day. I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound asleep. Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island. A little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying the night was about done. I give her a turn with the paddle and brung her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the woods. I sat down there on a log, and looked out through the leaves. I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket the river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops, and knowed the day was coming. So I took my gun and slipped off towards where I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two to listen. But I hadn’t no luck somehow; I couldn’t seem to find the place. But by-and-by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees. I went for it, cautious and slow. By-and-by I was close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground. It most give me the fan-tods. He had a blanket around his head, and his head was nearly in the fire. I set there behind a clump of bushes, in about six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady. It was getting gray daylight now. Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson’s Jim! I bet I was glad to see him.

Den I swum to de stern uv it en tuck a-holt. It clouded up en ’uz pooty dark for a little while. So I clumb up en laid down on de planks. De men ’uz all ’way yonder in de middle, whah de lantern wuz. De river wuz a-risin’, en dey wuz a good current; so I reck’n’d ’at by fo’ in de mawnin’ I’d be twenty-five mile down de river, en den I’d slip in jis b’fo’ daylight en swim asho’, en take to de woods on de Illinois side.\n“But I didn’ have no luck. When we ’uz mos’ down to de head er de islan’ a man begin to come aft wid de lantern, I see it warn’t no use fer to wait, so I slid overboard en struck out fer de islan’. Well, I had a notion I could lan’ mos’ anywhers, but I couldn’t—bank too bluff. I ’uz mos’ to de foot er de islan’ b’fo’ I found’ a good place. I went into de woods en jedged I wouldn’ fool wid raffs no mo’, long as dey move de lantern roun’ so. I had my pipe en a plug er dog-leg, en some matches in my cap, en dey warn’t wet, so I ’uz all right.”",

I catched a catfish as big as a man, being hungry, and Jim cleaned him; and towards daylight we started the fire, and had breakfast. And I never see a nigger that was a better hand to cook. I was a good deal astonished, 'cause I knowed he was awful ignorant, and I didn't see how he was going to make a fire in a rainy night—and such a night as that, too. But somehow he got dry sticks, and dry leaves, and he lit it with a match. Well, next day he was awful hungry, poor chap. Sometimes he went off a-fishing, but he didn't ketch nothing. The next day he went out a-hunting, and got a young wild pig and a fowl, and we had a good supper. And all that time he was a-waiting for the river to go down.

He just stood there, his eyes bugged out like a toad's, and he says, low and scared, 'Mars Georgy! What in de name o' goodness is dis?'\n\nI told him it warn't nothing but me going back to the widow's and getting some things. He shook his head slow and solemn. 'No, sah,' he says. 'Dat ain't de way it come. I seed you go off in dat canoe, and I seed you come back. Dey warn't nothin' in it when you went, and dey warn't nothin' in it when you come back. Dis stuff, it jes' riz up outen de groun', I tell you! Dis island is hoodooed, sho's you born!'\n\nHe was so worked up about it that I didn't try to argue none. I just told him to quit talking foolishness and help me get supper ready. He was still muttering about witches and spells, but he went to work, though he kept looking over his shoulder like he expected a ghost to jump out of the bushes. We fried the bacon, and it smelt powerful good, and I made the coffee, and we had a regular feast. It warn't like the widow's table, all set out proper, but it was better, because we was free, and the food tasted like freedom.\n\nAfter supper, we laid back by the fire, and Jim told me all about how he run off. He said Miss Watson was going to sell him down the river, and he heard her talking about it. That's why he lit out. He was mighty scared, but he said he'd rather be dead than sold away from his family. He talked about his wife and children, and his voice got all shaky. I felt kind of sorry for him, but I didn't say nothing. It warn't my business.\n\nHe told me about the sign he got from the birds, how they was talking about rain, and how he knowed a big storm was coming. Jim was full of signs and superstitions. He knowed all about bad luck and good luck, and how to keep off witches, and what it meant when a dog howled, and a million other things. He said if you counted the things you were going to cook for dinner, you'd spoil the broth. He said if you shook a tablecloth after sundown, you'd shake a ship right into the water. He had a hair-ball out of the fourth stomach of an ox, and he said there was a spirit inside it that knowed everything. He'd ask it questions, and it would answer him in a kind of a murmur, and he'd interpret it. He was the most superstitious man I ever knowed, but he was kind of comforting to have around, too.\n\nWe talked till late, watching the fireflies blink in the dark. The island was quiet and peaceful, and it felt like we was the only two people in the world. We decided to make a camp in the thickest part of the woods, where nobody would find us. The next day, we explored the island. It was a big place, covered in trees and vines, with sandy beaches and rocky points. We found a cave on the side of a hill, hidden by bushes, and it was perfect. It was dry and big enough for us to stand up in, and it had a little opening at the top for smoke to get out. We moved our things into the cave, and it felt like a real home.\n\nWe settled into a routine. In the daytime, we'd fish and hunt for berries and roots. Jim was good at finding things to eat. He showed me how to catch fish with a line made of bark and a hook made of a bone. He taught me which plants were good to eat and which ones would make you sick. We'd cook our meals over a fire outside the cave, being careful not to make too much smoke. We spent a lot of time just laying around, talking and watching the river go by. At night, we'd sleep in the cave, safe and hidden.\n\nOne day, the sky turned black, and the wind started to blow. Jim said the birds had told him it was coming. It was the biggest storm I ever saw. The rain came down in sheets, and the thunder rattled the ground. We huddled in the cave, listening to the wind howl and the trees crash down outside. The river rose higher and higher, flooding the lower parts of the island. We were safe in our cave, high up on the hill. It was kind of scary, but also exciting, being in the middle of such a powerful storm.\n\nAfter the storm, the river was full of trash and logs and whole trees floating downstream. And then we saw it – a whole house, floating down the river, right side up. It was a two-story house, and it looked like it had been torn loose from its foundations. We paddled out in the canoe to see if there was anything in it we could use. The front door was open, and we tied the canoe to the porch and went inside. The water was ankle-deep on the first floor. Everything was a mess – furniture knocked over, mud everywhere. We rummaged around, looking for anything useful. We found some clothes, a lantern, some candles, a tin cup, and a lot of other odds and ends. We even found a pack of cards and some chips, which Jim said was bad luck, but I didn't care.\n\nThen we went upstairs. It was drier up there. We looked through the rooms, and in one of them, we found a bed. And on the bed, there was a man laying on his face. His back was all covered with blood, and he"

You’ve had to keep in the woods all the time, of course. Did you hear ’em shooting the cannon?”\n“Oh, yes. I knowed dey was arter you. I see um go by heah—watched um thoo de bushes.”\nSome young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time and lighting. Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain. He said it was a sign when young chickens flew that way, and so he reckoned it was the same way when young birds done it. I was going to catch some of them, but Jim wouldn’t let me. He said it was death. He said his father laid mighty sick once, and some of them catched a bird, and his old granny said his father would die, and he did.\nAnd Jim said you mustn’t count the things you are going to cook for dinner, because that would bring bad luck. The same if you shook the table-cloth after sundown. And he said if a man owned a beehive and that man died, the bees must be told about it before sun-up next morning, or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die. Jim said bees wouldn’t sting idiots; but I didn’t believe that, because I had tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn’t sting me.\nI had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them. Jim knowed all kinds of signs. He said he knowed most everything. I said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked him if there warn’t any good-luck signs. He says:\n“Mighty few—an’ dey ain’t no use to a body. What you want to know when good luck’s a-comin’ for? Want to keep it off?” And he said: “Ef you’s got hairy arms en a hairy breas’, it’s a sign dat you’s agwyne to be rich. Well, dey’s some use in a sign like dat, ’kase it’s so fur ahead. You see, maybe you’s got to be po’ a long time fust, en so you might git discourage’ en kill yo’sef ’f you didn’ know by de sign dat you gwyne to be rich bymeby.”\n“Have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast, Jim?”\n“What’s de use to ax dat question? Don’t you see I has?”\n“Well, are you rich?”\n“No, but I ben rich wunst, and gwyne to be rich agin. Wunst I had foteen dollars, but I tuck to specalat’n’, en got busted out.”\n“What did you speculate in, Jim?”\n“Well, fust I tackled stock.”\n“What kind of stock?”\n“Why, live stock—cattle, you know. I put ten dollars in a cow. But I ain’ gwyne to resk no mo’ money in stock. De cow up ’n’ died on my han’s.”\n“So you lost the ten dollars.”\n“No, I didn’t lose it all. I on’y los’ ’bout nine of it. I sole de hide en taller for a dollar en ten cents.”\n“You had five dollars and ten cents left. Did you speculate any more?”\n“Yes. You know that one-laigged nigger dat b’longs to old Misto Bradish? Well, he sot up a bank, en say anybody dat put in a dollar would git fo’ dollars mo’ at de en’ er de year. Well, all de niggers went in, but dey didn’t have much. I wuz de on’y one dat had much. So I stuck out for mo’ dan fo’ dollars, en I said ’f I didn’ git it I’d start a bank mysef. Well, o’ course dat nigger want’ to keep me out er de business, bekase he says dey warn’t business ’nough for two banks, so he say I could put in my five dollars en he pay me thirty-five at de en’ er de year.\n“So I done it. Den I reck’n’d I’d inves’ de thirty-five dollars right off en keep things a-movin’. Dey wuz a nigger name’ Bob, dat had ketched a wood-flat, en his marster didn’ know it; en I bought it off’n him en told him to take de thirty-five dollars when de en’ er de year come; but somebody stole de wood-flat dat night, en nex day de one-laigged nigger say de bank’s busted. So dey didn’ none uv us git no money.”\n“What did you do with the ten cents, Jim?”\n“Well, I ’uz gwyne to spen’ it, but I had a dream, en de dream tole me to give it to a nigger name’ Balum—Balum’s Ass dey call him for short; he’s one er dem chuckleheads, you know. But he’s lucky, dey say, en I see I warn’t lucky. De dream say let Balum inves’ de ten cents en he’d make a raise for me. Well, Balum he tuck de money, en when he wuz in church he hear de preacher say dat whoever give to de po’ len’ to de Lord, en boun’ to git his money back a hund’d times. So Balum he tuck en give de ten cents to de po’, en laid low to see what wuz gwyne to come of it.”\n“Well, what did come of it, Jim?”\n“Nuffn never come of it. I couldn’ manage to k’leck dat money no way; en Balum he couldn’. I ain’ gwyne to len’ no mo’ money ’dout I see de security. Boun’ to git yo’ money back a hund’d times, de preacher says! Ef I could git de ten cents back, I’d call it squah, en be glad er de chanst.”\n“Well, it’s all right anyway, Jim, long as you’re going to be rich again some time or other.”\n“Yes; en I’s rich now, come to look at it.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces an extended and repetitive sequence involving the raft coming loose, attempts to secure it, and a dialogue about swimming abilities. This entire scenario is invented and does not appear in the original passage.\n- The completion omits a significant descriptive section in the middle of the original, where the storm's visual and auditory effects are described in detail.\n- The ending dialogue in the completion is replaced with invented conversation about the raft and swimming, rather than the original exchange about the storm, food, and the birds' predictive abilities.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the original's detailed depiction of the storm's progression, including changes in light, the appearance of the trees, and the sequence of wind and rain.\n- There is no mention of the sensory experience of the storm, such as the color of the sky, the movement of the trees, or the sound of thunder, which are present in the original.\n- The original's reflection on the birds' ability to predict the weather and the sense of comfort and safety inside the cavern are missing.\n- The specific exchange about enjoying the meal and the gratitude expressed for being safe and dry is not present.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The timing and sequence of events are altered: the completion introduces a delay before the storm and focuses on the raft, rather than the immediate onset of the storm as in the original.\n- The dialogue is inaccurate, focusing on concerns about the raft and swimming, rather than the original's focus on the storm, food, and the birds' predictive abilities.\n- The completion repeats a dialogue sequence multiple times, which does not reflect the structure or flow of the original passage."

We went winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung so thick we had to back away and go some other way. Well, on every old broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; and when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your hand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles—they would slide off in the water.

He’s ben shot in de back. I reck’n he’s ben dead two er three days. Come in, Huck, but doan’ look at his face—it’s too gashly.”\nI didn’t look at him at all. Jim throwed some old rags over him, but he needn’t done it; I didn’t want to see him. There was heaps of old greasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles, and a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal. There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some women’s underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men’s clothing, too. We put the lot into the canoe—it might come good. There was a boy’s old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that, too. And there was a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for a baby to suck. We would a took the bottle, but it was broke. There was a seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke. They stood open, but there warn’t nothing left in them that was any account. The way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a hurry, and warn’t fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff.\nWe got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, and a bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet and some nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some monstrous hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar, and a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn’t have no label on them; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb, and Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg. The straps was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn’t find the other one, though we hunted all around.",

We got on the roof and buckled down south for about a mile, come to a nice cove, amongst the cottonwood trees, and moored there all day long. Then we went to exploring the house. She was dead still; nobody inside; couldn’t see a light anywhere; so we got in and clumb up to the top-most room, and stayed there till daylight. Well, and it was a mighty grand sight, that first dawn amongst the trees and creepers and vines, and bushes, all matted together, and lit up by the glinting sun; and the water was sparkling, and the waves were rippling all around, and the minnows jumping at the top. The house was laying all over, considerable out of plumb, from what she had gone through.

That was all he would say about it.

Well, Jim he was mighty particular about snake-skins. He said if a man could lay his hands on a snake-skin he was all right; he couldn’t get hurt. He said snakes wouldn’t bite him no more. He would skin the snake and hang the skin up in the house, and then he was safe. I said it was all nonsense, and I didn’t believe it. He said it was so, and he knowed it. He said he had tried it.

Jim told me to chop off the snake’s head and throw it away, and then skin the body and roast a piece of it. I done it, and he eat it and said it would help cure him.

In this neighborhood?’\n“No’m. In Hookerville, seven mile below. I’ve walked all the way and I’m all tired out.”\n“Hungry, too, I reckon. I’ll find you something.”\n“No’m, I ain’t hungry. I was so hungry I had to stop two miles below here at a farm; so I ain’t hungry no more. It’s what makes me so late. My mother’s down sick, and out of money and everything, and I come to tell my uncle Abner Moore. He lives at the upper end of the town, she says. I hain’t ever been here before. Do you know him?”\n“No; but I don’t know everybody yet. I haven’t lived here quite two weeks. It’s a considerable ways to the upper end of the town. You better stay here all night. Take off your bonnet.”\n“No,” I says; “I’ll rest a while, I reckon, and go on. I ain’t afeared of the dark.”\nShe said she wouldn’t let me go by myself, but her husband would be in by-and-by, maybe in a hour and a half, and she’d send him along with me. Then she got to talking about her husband, and about her relations up the river, and her relations down the river, and about how much better off they used to was, and how they didn’t know but they’d made a mistake coming to our town, instead of letting well alone—and so on and so on, till I was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her to find out what was going on in the town; but by-and-by she dropped on to pap and the murder, and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter right along. She told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand dollars (only she got it ten) and all about pap and what a hard lot he was, and what a hard lot I was, and at last she got down to where I was murdered. I says:\n“Who done it? We’ve heard considerable about these goings on down in Hookerville, but we don’t know who ’twas that killed Huck Finn.”\n“Well, I reckon there’s a right smart chance of people here that’d like to know who killed him. Some think old Finn done it himself.”\n“No—is that so?”\n“Most everybody thought it at first. He’ll never know how nigh he come to getting lynched. But before night they changed around and judged it was done by a runaway nigger named Jim.”\n“Why he—”\nI stopped. I reckoned I better keep still. She run on, and never noticed I had put in at all:\n“The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed. So there’s a reward out for him—three hundred dollars. And there’s a reward out for old Finn, too—two hundred dollars. You see, he come to town the morning after the murder, and told about it, and was out with ’em on the ferry-boat hunt, and right away after he up and left. Before night they wanted to lynch him, but he was gone, you see. Well, next day they found out the nigger was gone; they found out he hadn’t ben seen sence ten o’clock the night the murder was done. So then they put it on him, you see; and while they was full of it, next day, back comes old Finn, and went boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for the nigger all over Illinois with. The judge gave him some, and that evening he got drunk, and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty hard-looking strangers, and then went off with them. Well, he hain’t come back sence, and they ain’t looking for him back till this thing blows over a little, for people thinks now that he killed his boy and fixed things so folks would think robbers done it, and then he’d get Huck’s money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit. People do say he warn’t any too good to do it. Oh, he’s sly, I reckon. If he don’t come back for a year he’ll be all right. You can’t prove anything on him, you know; everything will be quieted down then, and he’ll walk in Huck’s money as easy as nothing.”\n“Yes, I reckon so, ’m. I don’t see nothing in the way of it.

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces invented events and dialogue not present in the original, such as the character giving multiple false names and eventually revealing a different identity and gender. This sequence of confessions and the associated dialogue are not part of the original passage.\n- The completion omits a significant portion of the original, specifically the extended conversation about the murder, the townspeople's suspicions, the rewards, and the detailed recounting of events surrounding Huck Finn and his father.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The initial exchange about hunger and the reason for being late is only partially present, with some details about stopping at a farm and being tired omitted or altered.\n- The original's discussion about the character's mother being sick, the purpose of the visit, and the mention of the uncle is only partially included, with some details missing or changed.\n- The lengthy section where the woman discusses the murder, the townspeople's theories, the rewards, and the sequence of events after the murder is entirely missing from the completion.\n- The original's closing exchange about whether people still suspect the runaway individual is not present.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion provides inaccurate names and changes the sequence of name-giving, introducing additional false identities and a gender reveal that do not occur in the original passage.\n- The sequence of events is altered, with invented questioning about family members and their names, and a focus on the character's illness, which is not a central point in the original.\n- The completion attributes actions and dialogue to the characters that do not match the original, such as the woman pressing for more family details and the character confessing to being someone else entirely.\n- The timing and reasons for the character's journey are inaccurately described, with invented illness and motivations replacing the original explanations.\n\nOverall, the completion diverges significantly from the original in both structure and content, inventing new scenes and omitting key narrative developments."

She said she had to have things handy to throw at them when she was alone, or they wouldn’t give her no peace. She showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good shot with it generly, but she’d wrenched her arm a day or two ago, and didn’t know whether she could throw true now. But she watched for a chance, and directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and said “Ouch!” it hurt her arm so. Then she told me to try for the next one. I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back, but of course I didn’t let on. I got the thing, and the first rat that showed his nose I let drive, and if he’d a stayed where he was he’d a been a tolerable sick rat. She said that was first-rate, and she reckoned I would hive the next one. She went and got the lump of lead and fetched it back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help her with. I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them, and went on talking about her and her husband’s matters. But she broke off to say:\n“Keep your eye on the rats. You better have the lead in your lap, handy.”\nSo she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I clapped my legs together on it and she went on talking. But only about a minute.

I’ll keep it; and, what’s more, I’ll help you. So’ll my old man if you want him to. You see, you’re a runaway ’prentice, that’s all. It ain’t anything. There ain’t no harm in it.

I ain't going to hurt you, and I ain't going to tell on you. You just set down and make yourself easy. The fact is, you ain't a girl—you are a boy. It ain't no use to try to hide it. You can't hide the way you handle them things; you can't hide the way you set, nor the way you throw. Why, you throw like a boy. When you set out a rat you throw like a boy. When you set out a rat you throw like a boy. I see it when you done it. And you set like a boy, square-shouldered and spread out, kind of, and not puckered up and in a heap, like a girl. And a girl don't catch a thing that falls in her lap the way you catch it. Why, I see you catch that lead in your lap just now. I see you catch it with your legs, the way a boy would. Girls don't do that. They catch it with their hands. And you never thought of that, did you? You are a boy. I see it easy enough. And you ain't no runaway apprentice, either. What are you?'

Don’t forget and tell me it’s Elexander before you go, and then get out by saying it’s George Elexander when I catch you. And don’t go about women in that old calico. You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool men, maybe. Bless you, child, when you set out to thread a needle don’t hold the thread still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the needle still and poke the thread at it; that’s the way a woman most always does, but a man always does t’other way. And when you throw at a rat or anything, hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as awkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot. Throw stiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it to turn on, like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm out to one side, like a boy. And, mind you, when a girl tries to catch anything in her lap she throws her knees apart; she don’t clap them together, the way you did when you catched the lump of lead. Why, I spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle; and I contrived the other things just to make certain. Now trot along to your uncle, Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if you get into trouble you send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and I’ll do what I can to get you out of it.

But only about a minute after she was out of sight I heard her paddleing around up there, and pretty soon I heard her step coming that-away. I set up straight. She stopped in the door, and I see it was a smile coming onto her face. She says:\n\n“Come here, Sarah. What’s your name, child?”\n\n“Sarah Williams.”\n\n“Whereabouts do you live? In this neighborhood?”\n\n“No, mum. In Hookerville, seven mile below.”\n\n“Pretty far down. You’ve purty good grit, I tell you.

My father’s name is George Peters, mum.”\n\n“Well,” she says, “George Peters. I reckon your father’s dead. I reckon he is. Well, what did he do?”\n\n“He was a farmer, mum. He died last winter.”\n\n“Well, now, Sarah, I’m a-going to ask you a question.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces an invented scene at the beginning, where the character is told not to disturb the woman as she goes upstairs, which does not appear in the original passage.\n- There is a significant omission of the original's extended advice and instructions about how to behave and present oneself, especially regarding threading a needle, throwing, and catching, which are key to the original's structure and message.\n- The ending is incomplete, cutting off mid-dialogue and omitting the conclusion and the woman's final advice and offer of help.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the sequence of practical advice and observations about gendered behavior, which is a major part of the original's middle and end sections.\n- The original's closing remarks, including the woman's instructions about the river road, footwear, and her offer of assistance, are missing.\n- The original's playful warning about not mixing up names is absent.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces inaccurate time and event sequencing by having the woman leave and return, which does not occur in the original.\n- There are inaccuracies in the sequence of questions and answers, with some questions about personal background and family inserted that are not present in the original passage.\n- The completion repeats a line about 'just a-loafing around' multiple times, which is not reflective of the original's dialogue structure.\n- Some attributions of statements and questions are incorrect, with invented dialogue about the character's father and occupation that do not match the original content.\n- The order of the animal and tree questions is altered, and the phrasing of the cow question is changed, affecting the flow and accuracy of the exchange."

When I was about the middle I heard the clock begin to strike, so I stops and listens; the sound come faint over the water but clear—eleven. When I struck the head of the island I never waited to blow, though I was most winded, but I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be, and started a good fire there on a high and dry spot.\nThen I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a half below, as hard as I could go. I landed, and slopped through the timber and up the ridge and into the cavern. There Jim laid, sound asleep on the ground. I roused him out and says:\n“Git up and hump yourself, Jim! There ain’t a minute to lose. They’re after us!”\nJim never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the way he worked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared. By that time everything we had in the world was on our raft, and she was ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid. We put out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing, and didn’t show a candle outside after that.\nI took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and took a look; but if there was a boat around I couldn’t see it, for stars and shadows ain’t good to see by.

Before daylight in the mornings, I used to slip into cornfields and melon patches and steal watermelons, and muskmelons, and pumpkins, and new corn, and such things. Pap always said it warn’t no harm to borrow things if you was meaning to pay them back some time; but the Widow Douglas she said it warn’t anything but stealing, and she said a person that acted that way warn’t ever going to amount to shucks, and warn’t a bit better than the poorest roustabout they could find in the state.\n\nJim said he reckoned the Widow was partly right and Pap was partly right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things from the list and not borrow them any more—then he reckoned it wouldn’t be no harm to borrow the others. So we talked it over all one night, drifting along down the river, and next day we had fetched up a list, and Jim he said he would take a crabapple and a persimmon, and me and him wouldn’t borrow no more crabapples and persimmons. I was glad to get shut of borrowing them, anyway, because I hated crabapples and persimmons wouldn’t be ripe for two or three months yet.\n\"\"\"\n```",

We didn’t have no trouble about grub, mostly. The river was generous. We’d catch catfish big as a man, sometimes, and fry ‘em up. Or we’d find a watermelon patch ashore and borrow a few. Jim was mighty particular about not stealing, but borrowing was different, he said, if you meant to pay it back sometime. I reckon we borrowed a heap. Mostly, though, we just drifted. Daytimes, we’d tie up in some thick timber where the current warn’t strong, and lay low. It was peaceful there, just the sound of the water lapping and the birds singing. Jim would maybe sleep, or we’d talk a little, quiet-like. He was always thinking about his family, wishing he was free so he could buy ‘em. That made me feel a bit mean, being free myself and him not. Nights was the best. We’d shove out into the middle of the river, where it was wide and dark. The stars was something else out there, thick as sand on a bar. You could lay on your back on the raft and just look up, and it felt like you was floating in the sky too. The river sounds was different at night – more mysterious, maybe. Sometimes you’d hear a steamboat way off, its lights like eyes in the dark, or the hoot of an owl. It was lonesome, but a good lonesome. We didn’t see many people, and that suited us fine. We was just us, the raft, and the big river, heading south into the unknown. It felt like we was the only two folks in the whole world sometimes, just drifting along, free and easy, with nothing to bother us but the next meal and keeping out of sight."

Take it all round, we lived pretty high.\nThe fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with a power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid sheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself. When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead, and high, rocky bluffs on both sides. By-and-by says I, “Hel-lo, Jim, looky yonder!” It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock. We was drifting straight down for her. The lightning showed her very distinct. She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it, when the flashes come.\nWell, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like, I felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river. I wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see what there was there. So I says:\n“Le’s land on her, Jim.”\nBut Jim was dead against it at first. He says:\n“I doan’ want to go fool’n ’long er no wrack. We’s doin’ blame’ well, en we better let blame’ well alone, as de good book says. Like as not dey’s a watchman on dat wrack.”\n“Watchman your grandmother,” I says; “there ain’t nothing to watch but the texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon anybody’s going to resk his life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when it’s likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?” Jim couldn’t say nothing to that, so he didn’t try. “And besides,” I says, “we might borrow something worth having out of the captain’s stateroom. Seegars, I bet you—and cost five cents apiece, solid cash. Steamboat captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and they don’t care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it. Stick a candle in your pocket; I can’t rest, Jim, till we give her a rummaging. Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing? Not for pie, he wouldn’t. He’d call it an adventure—that’s what he’d call it; and he’d land on that wreck if it was his last act. And wouldn’t he throw style into it?—wouldn’t he spread himself, nor nothing? Why, you’d think it was Christopher C’lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come. I wish Tom Sawyer was here.”",

We kept a lookout for dead cottonwood trees, too, that had got hung up on some snag or other, and pulled them off for firewood. In this way we got along pretty comfortably. The river was getting wider and wider, and about the middle of the afternoon we judged we had got to the widest place in the river now where it was a mile and a half across. We kept away from the shore all day and all night the next night. The fifth night we passed St. Louis, just a vast range of lights that spread for miles and miles. By the time I was ready to turn in, the storm was abating, and the moon came out and not a cloud left about as big as your hat, and the stars shone, and the leaves of the trees stopped rustling. It was the stillest night you ever see.

Then the streak went out, and it was dark as pitch, and so still that you could hear the bugs crawling. By-and-by, next streak, away off to the left, away down the river, about twenty mile, as near as I could judge, but it seemed mighty close, because it was so dark; and this time it showed a black wall of wood, like a forest, along the river, away down that side.

But we warn’t going to land; we couldn’t, of course, with that wind blowing and the rain coming down like buckets, and the lightning and thunder a-going the way it was. So we just shoved the raft in under the lee of a tow-head, and got into the wigwam, and waited.

So we was pretty near the wreck, and everything was dark, and still, and we hauled her to and fastened her. It warn't a difficult job to clamber up the side. The only trouble was, the deck was that slanting that you couldn't stand up straight. We stooped along in the dark, on our hands and knees, towards the forward end of the skylight, that the robbers was in. We didn't know that yet, but we was feeling kind of spooky. We got to the skylight, and crawled on to it, and stood up. We could look up the texas-deck, now, and towards the pilot-house, but couldn't see anybody. The lightning begun to flare up now and then, and we'd see a low stack of stove-pipe, or a black smoke-stack, or some parts of the machinery, and feel it was all very lonesome and mysterious.

He said we ought to keep still, and not talk at all, because if we was to run across any robbers they would make all the noise they could, and we would hear them. He said if we could see the light enough we would run to the raft with noise enough to wake the dead, and after that we didn't need to listen for them. So we was pretty near the wreck, and everything was dark, and still, and we hauled her to and fastened her. It warn't a difficult job to clamber up the side. The only trouble was, the deck was that slanting that you couldn't stand up straight. We stooped along in the dark, on our hands and knees, towards the forward end of the skylight, that the robbers was in. We didn't know that yet, but we was feeling kind of spooky. We got to the skylight, and crawled on to it, and stood up. We could look up the texas-deck, now, and towards the pilot-house, but couldn't see anybody. The lightning begun to flare up now and then, and we'd see a low stack of stove-pipe, or a black smoke-stack, or some parts of the machinery, and feel it was all very lonesome and mysterious. Then, pretty soon, we made out a light away off in the texas, and Jim whispered and said he didn't know what it was, but he allowed it was ghosts. I said no, ghosts didn't have to have lights to see with. He said, \"Well, spy-lights, anyway;\" and says \"le's get out o' here, en go som'ers else.\" But I says -- \"It ain't anything but robbers. We'll go and watch the robbers a little while.\" So I started, and he scrabbled after. We crept along towards the light, and got to the texas door, and stood there, peeking. Presently we could see two men stretched on the floor with their hands and feet tied. They had been gagged, too, but one of the gags had got loose.

So he said we better not talk at all, and then if we did happen on them, we wouldn't be doing nothing to show we was there.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces invented scenes and dialogue that are not present in the original, such as detailed descriptions of tied-up men, extended conversations about money, and repeated threats. These additions significantly alter the structure and focus of the passage.\n- The completion omits the original's concise progression from sneaking onto the wreck, moving toward the captain's door, and the immediate discovery of voices and light. Instead, it adds lengthy, invented interactions and internal reflections.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion lacks specific details about the method and sequence of boarding the wreck, such as the use of certain parts of the boat and the way the characters navigated in the dark.\n- The completion does not include the original's focus on the physical environment, such as the description of the deck's height and the tactile experience of moving in darkness.\n- The moment of encountering the captain's door and the immediate reaction to seeing the light and hearing voices is not accurately represented.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion provides inaccurate timing and sequence of events, such as when and how the light and voices are discovered.\n- There are misattributed actions and dialogue, with invented lines and attributions that do not match the original speakers or their intentions.\n- The completion repeats certain invented lines and actions multiple times, which disrupts the flow and does not reflect the original passage's structure.\n- The emotional responses and motivations of the characters are altered, with added fear and speculation about ghosts, which are not present in the original.\n\nTo improve, focus on accurately following the sequence of actions and discoveries as they occur in the original, avoid inventing new scenes or dialogue, and ensure that the physical and emotional details match the source material."

I was just a-biling with curiosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn’t back out now, and so I won’t either; I’m a-going to see what’s going on here. So I dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft in the dark till there warn’t but one stateroom betwixt me and the cross-hall of the texas. Then in there I see a man stretched on the floor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one of them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol. This one kept pointing the pistol at the man’s head on the floor, and saying:\n“I’d like to! And I orter, too—a mean skunk!”\nThe man on the floor would shrivel up and say, “Oh, please don’t, Bill; I hain’t ever goin’ to tell.”\nAnd every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say:\n“’Deed you ain’t! You never said no truer thing ’n that, you bet you.” And once he said: “Hear him beg! and yit if we hadn’t got the best of him and tied him he’d a killed us both. And what for? Jist for noth’n. Jist because we stood on our rights—that’s what for. But I lay you ain’t a-goin’ to threaten nobody any more, Jim Turner. Put up that pistol, Bill.”\nBill says:\n“I don’t want to, Jake Packard. I’m for killin’ him—and didn’t he kill old Hatfield jist the same way—and don’t he deserve it?”\n“But I don’t want him killed, and I’ve got my reasons for it.”\n“Bless yo’ heart for them words, Jake Packard! I’ll never forgit you long’s I live!” says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering.\nPackard didn’t take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail and started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill to come. I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boat slanted so that I couldn’t make very good time; so to keep from getting run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side. The man came a-pawing along in the dark, and when Packard got to my stateroom, he says:\n“Here—come in here.”\nAnd in he come, and Bill after him. But before they got in I was up in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come. Then they stood there, with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked. I couldn’t see them, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they’d been having. I was glad I didn’t drink whisky; but it wouldn’t made much difference anyway, because most of the time they couldn’t a treed me because I didn’t breathe. I was too scared. And, besides, a body couldn’t breathe and hear such talk. They talked low and earnest. Bill wanted to kill Turner. He says:\n“He’s said he’ll tell, and he will. If we was to give both our shares to him now it wouldn’t make no difference after the row and the way we’ve served him. Shore’s you’re born, he’ll turn State’s evidence; now you hear me. I’m for putting him out of his troubles.”\n“So’m I,” says Packard, very quiet.\n“Blame it, I’d sorter begun to think you wasn’t. Well, then, that’s all right. Le’s go and do it.”\n“Hold on a minute; I hain’t had my say yit. You listen to me. Shooting’s good, but there’s quieter ways if the thing’s got to be done. But what I say is this: it ain’t good sense to go court’n around after a halter if you can git at what you’re up to in some way that’s jist as good and at the same time don’t bring you into no resks. Ain’t that so?”\n“You bet it is. But how you goin’ to manage it this time?”\n“Well, my idea is this: we’ll rustle around and gather up whatever pickins we’ve overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hide the truck. Then we’ll wait. Now I say it ain’t a-goin’ to be more’n two hours befo’ this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river. See? He’ll be drownded, and won’t have nobody to blame for it but his own self. I reckon that’s a considerble sight better ’n killin’ of him. I’m unfavorable to killin’ a man as long as you can git aroun’ it; it ain’t good sense, it ain’t good morals. Ain’t I right?”",

What in de worl’ has become o’ you?”\n\nI told him the whole story, right from the start, about how I got separated from him in the fog, and how I got ashore, and about the dogs and the house and the Grangerfords and the Shepherdsons, and Buck and the beautiful Miss Sophia and Harney Shepherdson, and the church and the sermon, and the poetry and the pictures, and the dead girl, and the feud, and how Buck got killed, and all the rest of it. I didn’t leave out a thing. Jim listened with his eyes bugging out, and every now and then he’d fetch a groan or a sigh, and when I told about Buck and the others getting shot, he just shivered and says:\n\n“Lord, Lord, po’ Buck! En’ de oders. Hit’s awful, Huck, awful!”\n\nHe was mighty sorry for me, and for Buck, and for everybody that got mixed up in that mess. He said he’d been hiding in the swamp, and he’d seen the raft float by, and he’d been mighty scared I was drowned or captured. He’d been living on berries and roots, and he was powerful hungry. He said he’d found the canoe I’d used to get ashore, and he’d been paddling around the edge of the swamp, looking for me, and he’d heard the shooting and the yelling, and he’d been scared out of his wits.\n\nWe talked for a long time, sitting there on the bank. It felt so good to be with Jim again, away from all that killing and meanness. He was the only person I knowed that didn’t seem to be crazy or wicked in some way. He was just Jim, and he was my friend.\n\nAfter a while, he says:\n\n“Well, we better git de raft.”\n\nSo we went down to where he’d hid it. It was tucked away in a little cove, all safe and sound. We got aboard, and Jim pushed off. The current caught us, and we begun to drift downstream. It was night by then, and the stars was out, and the river was dark and quiet. It felt like we was the only two people in the world, floating along on that big, silent river.\n\nWe didn’t talk much at first. We just laid there on the raft, looking up at the stars, and listening to the sounds of the river. It was the peacefulest thing I ever knowed. After all that fuss and trouble ashore, it was like coming home. The raft was home. It was free and easy and natural, and there warn’t no rules or no fighting or no dead people. Just us and the river.\n\nJim says, after a long time:\n\n“Huck"

No sign of a boat. Jim said he didn’t believe he could go any further—so scared he hadn’t hardly any strength left, he said. But I said, come on, if we get left on this wreck we are in a fix, sure. So on we prowled again. We struck for the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along forwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the edge of the skylight was in the water. When we got pretty close to the cross-hall door, there was the skiff, sure enough! I could just barely see her. I felt ever so thankful. In another second I would a been aboard of her, but just then the door opened. One of the men stuck his head out only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was gone; but he jerked it in again, and says:\n“Heave that blame lantern out o’ sight, Bill!”\nHe flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himself and set down.

My eyes felt like they was glued wide open, and I couldn't swallow if I'd a-tried. It was Pap. Standing right there, not ten foot away, looking like he'd come straight out of the bad place. His face was all pale and raggedy, and his eyes had that wild, crazy look in 'em that always made my blood run cold. He had his old slouch hat pulled down low, but you could see the sweat streaks on his face and neck. He was leaning against a tree, just watching the river, and he hadn't seen me yet. I was hid good behind a thick bush, but I felt like he could smell me out, like a hound dog. All the stories about ghosts and hants and dead folks walking come a-swarming into my head, and I reckon for a minute I truly believed he was a spirit come back to torment me. My legs felt like water, and I couldn't move a muscle. I just stayed there, frozen, watching him, waiting for him to turn his head and see me. What would he do? Would he grab me and take me back to that cabin? Would he beat me again? The thought of it made me feel sick to my stomach. I wished I was dead myself, or back in Widow Douglas's house, sivilized and safe, even if it was awful tiresome. Anything was better than this. I watched him for what felt like an hour, though I reckon it warn't more'n a few minutes. He didn't move much, just shifted his weight now and then and scratched his beard. He looked powerful miserable, even for him. It was a strange thing to see. Pap, who was always raising Cain and making a fuss, just standing there quiet like, staring at the water. It made him seem almost... human, in a way that was scarier than when he was drunk and raving. Because when he was drunk, you knew what to expect. But this quietness, this stillness, it was something new and unknown, and it filled me with a dread I hadn't felt before. I started to think maybe he warn't a ghost after all, but just Pap, come back for some reason. And that thought was almost worse than the ghost one. Because if he was real, he could catch me. And if he catched me, my life on the river, my freedom, everything I'd worked for, would be over. I had to get away. I had to get away right now, before he saw me. But my body wouldn't listen. It just stayed there, trembling, watching the man who was my father and my worst nightmare, standing there by the side of the big river, looking like he belonged to the shadows."

So says I to Jim:\n“The first light we see we’ll land a hundred yards below it or above it, in a place where it’s a good hiding-place for you and the skiff, and then I’ll go and fix up some kind of a yarn, and get somebody to go for that gang and get them out of their scrape, so they can be hung when their time comes.”\nBut that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begun to storm again, and this time worse than ever. The rain poured down, and never a light showed; everybody in bed, I reckon. We boomed along down the river, watching for lights and watching for our raft.",

Miss Hooker was a-visiting up there to the town—”\n“Yes, Booth’s Landing—go on.”\n“She was a-visiting there at Booth’s Landing, and just in the edge of the evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horse-ferry to stay all night at her friend’s house, Miss What-you-may-call-her I disremember her name—and they lost their steering-oar, and swung around and went a-floating down, stern first, about two mile, and saddle-baggsed on the wreck, and the ferryman and the nigger woman and the horses was all lost, but Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck. Well, about an hour after dark we come along down in our trading-scow, and it was so dark we didn’t notice the wreck till we was right on it; and so we saddle-baggsed; but all of us was saved but Bill Whipple—and oh, he was the best cretur!—I most wish’t it had been me, I do.”\n“My George! It’s the beatenest thing I ever struck. And then what did you all do?”\n“Well, we hollered and took on, but it’s so wide there we couldn’t make nobody hear. So pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help somehow. I was the only one that could swim, so I made a dash for it, and Miss Hooker she said if I didn’t strike help sooner, come here and hunt up her uncle, and he’d fix the thing. I made the land about a mile below, and been fooling along ever since, trying to get people to do something, but they said, ‘What, in such a night and such a current? There ain’t no sense in it; go for the steam ferry.’ Now if you’ll go and—”",

A kind of cold shiver went through me, and then I struck out for her. She was very deep, and I see in a minute there warn’t much chance for anybody being alive in her.

He said that wasn’t wise, that was just plain foolishness. He reckoned if he was a king, he’d do things different. He’d get him a whole raft of money and buy his family out of slavery and live free. He couldn’t get over the idea of folks being so rich and lazy. It beat him.

            "He concluded that the cut bank was a large island and Jim had passed on the other side, a more significant obstacle than a tow-head.",

I whooped and listened. Away down there somewheres I hears a small whoop, and up comes my spirits. I went tearing after it, listening sharp to hear it again. The next time it come, I see I warn’t heading for it, but heading away to the right of it. And the next time I was heading away to the left of it—and not gaining on it much either, for I was flying around, this way and that and t’other, but it was going straight ahead all the time.\nI did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it all the time, but he never did, and it was the still places between the whoops that was making the trouble for me. Well, I fought along, and directly I hears the whoop behind me. I was tangled good now. That was somebody else’s whoop, or else I was turned around.\nI throwed the paddle down. I heard the whoop again; it was behind me yet, but in a different place; it kept coming, and kept changing its place, and I kept answering, till by-and-by it was in front of me again, and I knowed the current had swung the canoe’s head down-stream, and I was all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering. I couldn’t tell nothing about voices in a fog, for nothing don’t look natural nor sound natural in a fog.\nThe whooping went on, and in about a minute I come a-booming down on a cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the current throwed me off to the left and shot by, amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared, the currrent was tearing by them so swift.\nIn another second or two it was solid white and still again. I set perfectly still then, listening to my heart thump, and I reckon I didn’t draw a breath while it thumped a hundred.\nI just give up then. I knowed what the matter was. That cut bank was an island, and Jim had gone down t’other side of it. It warn’t no tow-head that you could float by in ten minutes. It had the big timber of a regular island; it might be five or six miles long and more than half a mile wide.\nI kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I reckon. I was floating along, of course, four or five miles an hour; but you don’t ever think of that. No, you feel like you are laying dead still on the water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don’t think to yourself how fast you’re going, but you catch your breath and think, my! how that snag’s tearing along. If you think it ain’t dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night, you try it once—you’ll see.\nNext, for about a half an hour, I whoops now and then; at last I hears the answer a long ways off, and tries to follow it, but I couldn’t do it, and directly I judged I’d got into a nest of tow-heads, for I had little dim glimpses of them on both sides of me—sometimes just a narrow channel between, and some that I couldn’t see I knowed was there because I’d hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash that hung over the banks. Well, I warn’t long loosing the whoops down amongst the tow-heads; and I only tried to chase them a little while, anyway, because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o’-lantern. You never knowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so quick and so much.\nI had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times, to keep from knocking the islands out of the river; and so I judged the raft must be butting into the bank every now and then, or else it would get further ahead and clear out of hearing—it was floating a little faster than what I was.\nWell, I seemed to be in the open river again by-and-by, but I couldn’t hear no sign of a whoop nowheres.",

The moon was down, and it was mighty dark; it was so dark you couldn’t hardly see your hand before your face. The river was still as glass, and the only sound was the soft wash of the water against the raft and the occasional hoot of an owl away off in the woods. It was powerful lonesome, but peaceful too, in a way. I stood there a spell, just looking at Jim and listening. He was breathing deep and steady, like a log. It made me feel kind of warm inside, seeing him there, trusting me to watch whilst he rested. We’d been through a heap together, Jim and me, and the river was our home now. It wasn’t much of a home, just these logs lashed together, but it was ours, and it was free. Free from Miss Watson and her everlasting naggings, free from the Widow Douglas and her trying to sivilize me, free from Pap and his drunk rages. And for Jim, it was free from chains and selling him down the river. That thought always made my stomach feel a bit queer. Here was a runaway slave, and here was me, helping him. It was against everything they taught me in Sunday school, against the law, against what folks called right. But somehow, out here on the river, under the big sky, it felt more right than anything else. It felt like the natural thing to do. Jim was a good man, the best I ever knowed, white or black. He was kind, and he cared about me, and he was trying to get his family back. How could that be wrong? The river kept sliding by, quiet and strong. You could feel its power even when it was still. It was carrying us south, further and further away from everything we knew, further into the unknown. It was a big river, the Mississippi, and it went on forever, it seemed like. It made you feel mighty small, floating on it like a chip. But it also made you feel like you were part of something big, something that had been flowing for thousands of years. I wondered what was around the next bend, or the bend after that. More towns? More trouble? Or maybe just more river, more quiet nights like this. I hoped for the quiet nights. Trouble seemed to find us easy enough without looking for it. I shifted my weight, and the raft creaked a little. Jim stirred in his sleep but didn’t wake up. I decided I’d let him sleep on. He needed the rest. We both did. The stars were starting to fade a little in the east, a faint gray light creeping up. Dawn wasn’t far off. Another day on the river. Another day closer to Cairo, maybe, or maybe just another day of drifting. It didn’t matter so much where we were going, sometimes, as long as we were going together, Jim and me, on our raft, free on the big river. I picked up the other steering-oar and settled down to watch the river and wait for the sun to come up, feeling the cool air on my face and the gentle sway of the raft under my feet. It was a good feeling, a free feeling."

The lot of tow-heads was troubles we was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean folks, but if we minded our business and didn’t talk back and aggravate them, we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big clear river, which was the free States, and wouldn’t have no more trouble.\nIt had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft, but it was clearing up again now.\n“Oh, well, that’s all interpreted well enough as far as it goes, Jim,” I says; “but what does these things stand for?”\nIt was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar.

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the specific time reference that is present in the original, which is important for conveying the narrator's emotional process.\n- The sequence of actions—working up the courage, humbling oneself, and the resulting change in behavior—is not clearly or accurately followed.\n- The final resolution and the narrator's lasting feelings about the event are missing.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion provides inaccurate or invented details about the narrator's age and emotional state, which are not present in the original.\n- The order of events is disrupted by the insertion of invented dialogue and reflections before the narrator's act of humbling himself.\n- The emotional focus is shifted from remorse and change to repeated anger, which misrepresents the original tone and message."

It amounted to something being a raftsman on such a craft as that.\nWe went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and got hot. The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on both sides; you couldn’t see a break in it hardly ever, or a light. We talked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got to it. I said likely we wouldn’t, because I had heard say there warn’t but about a dozen houses there, and if they didn’t happen to have them lit up, how was we going to know we was passing a town? Jim said if the two big rivers joined together there, that would show. But I said maybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the same old river again. That disturbed Jim—and me too. So the question was, what to do? I said, paddle ashore the first time a light showed, and tell them pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow, and was a green hand at the business, and wanted to know how far it was to Cairo.

He said he’d be mighty sure to see it, because he’d be a free man the minute he seen it, but if he missed it he’d be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom. Every little while he jumps up and says:\n“Dah she is?”\nBut it warn’t. It was Jack-o’-lanterns, or lightning bugs; so he set down again, and went to watching, same as before. Jim said it made him all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom. Well, I can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him, because I begun to get it through my head that he was most free—and who was to blame for it? Why, me. I couldn’t get that out of my conscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn’t rest; I couldn’t stay still in one place. It hadn’t ever come home to me before, what this thing was that I was doing. But now it did; and it stayed with me, and scorched me more and more. I tried to make out to myself that I warn’t to blame, because I didn’t run Jim off from his rightful owner; but it warn’t no use, conscience up and says, every time, “But you knowed he was running for his freedom, and you could a paddled ashore and told somebody.” That was so—I couldn’t get around that noway. That was where it pinched. Conscience says to me, “What had poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off right under your eyes and never say one single word? What did that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean? Why, she tried to learn you your book, she tried to learn you your manners, she tried to be good to you every way she knowed how. That’s what she done.”\nI got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead. I fidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim was fidgeting up and down past me. We neither of us could keep still. Every time he danced around and says, “Dah’s Cairo!” it went through me like a shot, and I thought if it was Cairo I reckoned I would die of miserableness.\nJim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself. He was saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when he got enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close to where Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy the two children, and if their master wouldn’t sell them, they’d get an Ab’litionist to go and steal them.\nIt most froze me to hear such talk. He wouldn’t ever dared to talk such talk in his life before. Just see what a difference it made in him the minute he judged he was about free. It was according to the old saying, “Give a nigger an inch and he’ll take an ell.” Thinks I, this is what comes of my not thinking. Here was this nigger, which I had as good as helped to run away, coming right out flat-footed and saying he would steal his children—children that belonged to a man I didn’t even know; a man that hadn’t ever done me no harm.",

So we tied up a while considerably before daylight, to wait.\n\nJim said it made him all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom. Well, I can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him talk. I begun to get it through my head that he was most free—and who was to blame for it? Why, me. I couldn’t get that out of my conscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn’t rest; I couldn’t stay still in one place. It hadn’t ever come home to me before, what I was doing.

I tried to put it off on Jim, but it warn’t no use. Conscience says to me, “What do you want to go and do that for? Why ain’t your conscience friendly with this person? Why is it against him?” I says, “I don’t know, I don’t know nothing about it.” It says, “Well, you know, don’t you, that this is Miss Watson’s nigger? And if you was to fetch him back she’d give you a heap of rewards, and be good to you, and bless you, and so on?” I says, “Yes, I know that.” It says, “Well, then, what you going to do?” And I says, “I don’t know.”\n\nSo I got a-tossing and a-tuming and a-walking the raft, and Jim he kept a-jumping up and saying, “Heads up, Huck! Looky yonder! Is that it?” And he’d see a light, and sing out, “Dat’s it! She’s Cairo!” And it would turn out to be just a spark from a chimney, or a firefly, or something.\n\nAnd all this time, he was a-talking about his plans, and about his wife and his children, and how soon he would buy them, and fetch them to a free State, and so on. And he kept a-saying it would be all his own money he earned them with, and they wouldn’t belong to anybody but him. And he was so happy, and so thankful, and so proud of his money and his plans, and so glad to be a free man, and have a home of his own, and his family with him, and all that, that I couldn’t stand it no longer. I felt so mean, and so ornery, and so low down and dirty, that I couldn’t look him in the face.\n\nHe was a-going on, and he says: “Dah’s de place we’s gwyne to; dah’s de place where’s de home dat we’s gwyne to find out about.” I says: “Yes, Jim.” And he says: “And den we’s gwyne to buy a home and a farm wif de money, and we’s gwyne to raise cotton and corn, and truck, and stock—and we’s gwyne to be rich, and we’s gwyne to have nigger-servants, and we’s gwyne to have a church, and a school, and a graveyard, and we’s gwyne to have a town, and we’s gwyne to have a State, and we’s gwyne to have a country, and we’s gwyne to have a world, and we’s gwyne to have a universe, and we’s gwyne to have a God, and we’s gwyne to have a heaven, and we’s gwyne to have a hell, and we’s gwyne to have a judgment day, and we’s gwyne to have a resurrection, and we’s gwyne to have a life everlasting, and we’s gwyne to have a death, and we’s gwyne to have a burial, and we’s gwyne to have a tomb, and we’s gwyne to have a monument, and we’s gwyne to have a history, and we’s gwyne to have a literature, and we’s gwyne to have a science, and we’s gwyne to have a philosophy, and we’s gwyne to have a religion, and we’s gwyne to have a politics, and we’s gwyne to have a society, and we’s gwyne to have a civilization, and we’s gwyne to have a progress, and we’s gwyne to have a reform, and we’s gwyne to have a revolution, and we’s gwyne to have a millennium, and we’",

He said if it was daylight betwixt the island and the shore, we could see it as well as we could see a church. So we tied up a while considerably before daylight, to wait.\n\nJim said it made him all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom. Well, I can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him talk. I begun to get it through my head that he was most free—and who was to blame for it? Why, me. I couldn’t get that out of my conscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn’t rest; I couldn’t stay still in one place. It hadn’t ever come home to me before, what I was doing. But now it did. It made me sick at my stomach, ‘longside of the river, to see this awful trouble coming onto me.\n\nI tried to think I warn’t doing nothing to hurt anybody. I tried to put it off on Jim, but it warn’t no use. Conscience says to me, “What do you want to go and do that for? Why ain’t your conscience friendly with this person? Why is it against him?” I says, “I don’t know, I don’t know nothing about it.” It says, “Well, you know, don’t you, that this is Miss Watson’s nigger? And if you was to fetch him back she’d give you a heap of rewards, and be good to you, and bless you, and so on?” I says, “Yes, I know that.” It says, “Well, then, what you going to do?” And I says, “I don’t know.”\n\nSo I got a-tossing and a-tuming and a-walking the raft, and Jim he kept a-jumping up and saying, “Heads up, Huck! Looky yonder! Is that it?” And he’d see a light, and sing out, “Dat’s it! She’s Cairo!” And it would turn out to be just a spark from a chimney, or a firefly, or something.\n\nAnd all this time, he was a-talking about his plans, and about his wife and his children, and how soon he would buy them, and fetch them to a free State, and so on. And he kept a-saying it would be all his own money he earned them with, and they wouldn’t belong to anybody but him. And he was so happy, and so thankful, and so proud of his money and his plans, and so glad to be a free man, and have a home of his own, and his family with him, and all that, that I couldn’t stand it no longer. I felt so mean, and so ornery, and so low down and dirty, that I couldn’t look him in the face.\n\nHe was a-going on, and he says: “Dah’s de place we’s gwyne to; dah’s de place where’s de home dat we’s gwyne to find out about.” I says: “Yes, Jim.” And he says: “And den we’s gwyne to buy a home and a farm wif de money, and we’s gwyne to raise cotton and corn, and truck, and stock—and we’s gwyne to be rich, and we’s gwyne to have nigger-servants, and we’s gwyne to have a church, and a school, and a graveyard, and we’s gwyne to have a town, and we’s gwyne to have a State, and we’s gwyne to have a country, and we’s gwyne to have a world, and we’s gwyne to have a universe, and we’s gwyne to have a God, and we’s gwyne to have a heaven, and we’s gwyne to have a hell, and we’s gwyne to have a judgment day, and we’s gwyne to have a resurrection, and we’s gwyne to have a life everlasting, and we’s gwyne to have a death, and we’s gwyne to have a burial, and we’s gwyne to have a tomb, and we’s gwyne to have a monument, and we’s gwyne to have a history, and we’s gwyne to have a literature, and we’s gwyne to have a science, and we’s gwyne to have a philosophy, and we’s gwyne to have a religion, and we’s gwyne to have a politics, and we’s gwyne to have a society, and we’s gwyne to have a civilization, and we’s gwyne to have a progress, and we’s gwyne to have a reform, and we’s gwyne to have a revolution, and we’s gwyne to have a millennium, and we’",

We judged that we was going about six mile an hour, and that warn’t fast enough for us, but it was all we could do. The river was mighty big and grand, and the stars was out, and it was a beautiful night; but we was so anxious about Cairo that we couldn’t enjoy it hardly. We kept a-watching the shore, and every little while we’d see a light, and we’d say, “There it is!” and then it would turn out to be just a house or a wood-yard light, or something like that. It was powerful discouraging. Jim was mighty hopeful, though. He talked about how he was going to buy his wife and children out of slavery with the money he was going to make, and how they would all be free together. It made me feel kind of sick, because I knew I was helping a runaway slave, and that was a sin. But then I’d think about Jim, and how good he was, and how he called me his best friend, and it would make me feel better. Still, the thought of helping him get free was always there, gnawing at me. We drifted on, hour after hour, the river whispering secrets to the banks. The air got damp and cold, and a thick white fog began to creep over the water. At first it was just patches, like cotton balls floating on the surface, but then it got thicker and thicker, until you couldn’t see ten foot ahead. It was the lonesomest thing in the world. We couldn’t see the shore, couldn’t see the stars, couldn’t see nothing but the fog. We had to paddle slow and careful, listening for sounds. We heard steamboats whistling, but we couldn’t tell where they was, and that was scary. We got separated in the fog. I was in the canoe, scouting ahead, and Jim was on the raft. I yelled for him, but the fog swallowed my voice. I paddled around, trying to find the raft, my heart pounding like a drum. I was scared I’d lost him, scared he’d drifted away and I’d never see him again. I drifted for hours, it seemed like, just me and the fog. When the fog finally lifted, the sun was up, and I was miles downstream from where I thought I was. I saw the raft way off in the distance, and my heart leaped. I paddled towards it as fast as I could. When I got there, Jim was asleep, worn out from the night. I tied the canoe to the raft and woke him up. I played a trick on him, telling him I’d been there all along, and that him dreaming about the fog and getting lost was just a dream. He was so happy to see me, and he believed me at first. But then he saw the leaves and rubbish on the raft from the storm and the fog, and he knew I was lying. He got mad, really mad. He said, “When I waked up, en' see you back agin, all safe en soun', de tears come, en' I could 'a' got down on my knees en' kiss' yo' foot I's so thankful. En' all you wuz thinkin' 'bout wuz how you could make a fool uv ole Jim wid a lie.” It hit me hard. I hadn’t thought about how much he cared, how scared he must have"

My conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I says to it, “Let up on me—it ain’t too late yet—I’ll paddle ashore at the first light and tell.” I felt easy and happy and light as a feather right off. All my troubles was gone. I went to looking out sharp for a light, and sort of singing to myself. By-and-by one showed. Jim sings out:\n“We’s safe, Huck, we’s safe! Jump up and crack yo’ heels! Dat’s de good ole Cairo at las’, I jis knows it!”\nI says:\n“I’ll take the canoe and go and see, Jim. It mightn’t be, you know.”\nHe jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his old coat in the bottom for me to set on, and give me the paddle; and as I shoved off, he says:\n“Pooty soon I’ll be a-shout’n’ for joy, en I’ll say, it’s all on accounts o’ Huck; I’s a free man, en I couldn’t ever ben free ef it hadn’ ben for Huck; Huck done it. Jim won’t ever forgit you, Huck; you’s de bes’ fren’ Jim’s ever had; en you’s de only fren’ ole Jim’s got now.”\nI was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he says this, it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me. I went along slow then, and I warn’t right down certain whether I was glad I started or whether I warn’t. When I was fifty yards off, Jim says:\n“Dah you goes, de ole true Huck; de on’y white genlman dat ever kep’ his promise to ole Jim.”\nWell, I just felt sick. But I says, I got to do it—I can’t get out of it. Right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns, and they stopped and I stopped. One of them says:\n“What’s that yonder?”\n“A piece of a raft,” I says.\n“Do you belong on it?”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“Any men on it?”\n“Only one, sir.”\n“Well, there’s five niggers run off to-night up yonder, above the head of the bend. Is your man white or black?”\nI didn’t answer up prompt. I tried to, but the words wouldn’t come. I tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it, but I warn’t man enough—hadn’t the spunk of a rabbit. I see I was weakening; so I just give up trying, and up and says:\n“He’s white.”\n“I reckon we’ll go and see for ourselves.”\n“I wish you would,” says I, “because it’s pap that’s there, and maybe you’d help me tow the raft ashore where the light is. He’s sick—and so is mam and Mary Ann.”\n“Oh, the devil! we’re in a hurry, boy. But I s’pose we’ve got to. Come, buckle to your paddle, and let’s get along.”\nI buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars. When we had made a stroke or two, I says:\n“Pap’ll be mighty much obleeged to you, I can tell you. Everybody goes away when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore, and I can’t do it by myself.”\n“Well, that’s infernal mean. Odd, too. Say, boy, what’s the matter with your father?”\n“It’s the—a—the—well, it ain’t anything much.”\nThey stopped pulling. It warn’t but a mighty little ways to the raft now. One says:\n“Boy, that’s a lie. What is the matter with your pap? Answer up square now, and it’ll be the better for you.”\n“I will, sir, I will, honest—but don’t leave us, please. It’s the—the—gentlemen, if you’ll only pull ahead, and let me heave you the headline, you won’t have to come a-near the raft—please do.”\n“Set her back, John, set her back!” says one. They backed water. “Keep away, boy—keep to looard. Confound it, I just expect the wind has blowed it to us. Your pap’s got the small-pox, and you know it precious well. Why didn’t you come out and say so? Do you want to spread it all over?”\n“Well,” says I, a-blubbering, “I’ve told everybody before, and they just went away and left us.”\n“Poor devil, there’s something in that. We are right down sorry for you, but we—well, hang it, we don’t want the small-pox, you see. Look here, I’ll tell you what to do. Don’t you try to land by yourself, or you’ll smash everything to pieces. You float along down about twenty miles, and you’ll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river. It will be long after sun-up then, and when you ask for help you tell them your folks are all down with chills and fever. Don’t be a fool again, and let people guess what is the matter. Now we’re trying to do you a kindness; so you just put twenty miles between us, that’s a good boy. It wouldn’t do any good to land yonder where the light is—it’s only a wood-yard. Say, I reckon your father’s poor, and I’m bound to say he’s in pretty hard luck. Here, I’ll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this board, and you get it when it floats by. I feel mighty mean to leave you; but my kingdom! it won’t do to fool with small-pox, don’t you see?”\n“Hold on, Parker,” says the other man, “here’s a twenty to put on the board for me. Good-bye, boy; you do as Mr. Parker told you, and you’ll be all right.”\n“That’s so, my boy—good-bye, good-bye. If you see any runaway niggers you get help and nab them, and you can make some money by it.”",

Well, then, I happened to look around and see that catfishing was good for about the next twenty-four hours, and so I judged I would put in that time at it; and I didn’t think the raft could get but about twenty-five miles further down stream than we was then, in the twenty-four hours that was next ahead of us. So I reckoned we would drop into Cairo and strike the Ohio river, and go up that to the free States. I begun to get down on myself. I begun to blame myself because I hadn’t ever thought of it before, and it hadn’t struck me that I was doing wrong. I had stole Jim, and I was mighty uneasy all the time, because I reckoned I couldn’t come to see how I could look anybody in the face again, after that. And I begun to think how dreadful it was, even for murderers, to be in the river at night, and how it must look to God. I didn’t sleep any that night.

But the canoe was floating along so easy and still, and Jim was singing low and sweet to himself, about the good times we was going to have, and about how he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm not far from there, and his two children, and how we would all be free and happy and go up the river and have a camp-fire every night, and camp and fish and hunt, and get plenty of money, and buy us a little farm and build a little house, and the widow would be so proud of me for helping to free a poor old man, and Miss Watson would be so proud of me for helping to free a poor old man, and everybody would be so proud of me for helping to free a poor old man. And he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the ONLY one he ever had; and when he was saying this, his voice trembled, a little, and he was so thankful it made me feel bad and sick, and I wished I hadn’t come. It was because I had been doing wrong. I see it now. I been doing wrong all along. I hadn’t no business to help him, nor to steal him. I ought to told. I ought to told right at the start. It was all I could do to keep from crying. But I done it. I got the canoe ready and went to shove off. Jim says: “What you going to do, Huck?” “Set her loose,” I says. “All right, Huck; good boy! Dat’s what I calls a raft; when she’s in a tight place she fetches up standing. You’re the man to do it, Huck. You’s de bes’ fren’ I ever had, Huck.” I was paddling off, all in a sweat to get ashore and tell on him; but when he calls me that, it kind of took the tuck out of me. I warn’t used to it. But I done it. I shoved off. I didn’t look at him; I didn’t say nothing to him. I just shoved off, and paddled towards the light. When I got about fifty yards off, Jim says: “Dah you goes, de ole true Huck! de on’y white genlman dat ever kep’ his promise to ole Jim.” Well, I just felt sick. But I says, I got to do it. I can’t help it. I got to do the right thing, and the clean thing, and the honest thing; and I hope I can pray now. But I couldn’t. I tried, but the words wouldn’t come. I tried to think of the widow and Miss Watson, but the more I thought of them the more I couldn’t pray. I says, I can’t pray a lie. I found that out. I warn’t going to tell on Jim. I made up my mind I wouldn’t do nothing more that was wrong. I wouldn’t do nothing that was bad. I wouldn’t do nothing that was mean. I wouldn’t do nothing that was low.

You see, I had been raised to believe that a nigger warn't much better than an animal, and here was Jim, a runaway slave, humbling himself to me, a white boy, and apologizing for playing a trick. It didn't fit with what I'd been taught. It made me feel all mixed up inside. We had been separated in the fog, and I had drifted away on the canoe while Jim stayed on the raft. It was a terrible time, all alone in that thick white blindness, hollering for Jim and getting no answer but the echo. I was scared to death. When I finally found the raft again, after what seemed like forever, Jim was asleep. I crept aboard and lay down, pretending I'd been there all along. When he woke up, I started telling him about being lost in the fog, making it sound like a dream. I described how I'd been scared and alone, and how I'd seen all sorts of strange things in the mist. Jim was mighty glad to see me, and he listened with wide eyes, believing it was a dream. He talked about how worried he'd been, how he'd called and called for me, and how his heart was broke when he thought I was gone for good. He even cried a little, talking about it. He pointed to the raft, which was covered in trash and leaves and branches from the flood, and said how the 'dream' was a sign, and how the trash was 'rubbage and nuff truck' that stood for the trouble they'd been through, and how me being found again meant the good times were coming back. He was so earnest and so happy to have me safe. And then I sprung it on him. I told him it warn't no dream at all, that we had been separated, and I had been lost, and he had been asleep. I showed him the leaves and the trash on the raft and asked him if that looked like a dream. I expected him to be mad, or maybe just sheepish. But he warn't. He just looked at the trash, and then at me, and his face fell. He didn't say nothing for a minute. He just stood there, looking sorrowful. And then he said what he said, about how he was sorry, and how he wouldn't play no more tricks on me, and how he felt bad for making fun of me when I was scared. That's when I felt that lowering. Here was this old nigger, who I had helped escape, who was risking his life for freedom, and he was apologizing to me, a boy who had just played a mean trick on him. It didn't seem right. It made me feel small. I had been proud of my trick, proud of fooling him. But when he humbled himself like that, it took all the starch out of my pride. I looked at him, sitting there with his head down, looking so miserable, and I saw the leaves and the dirt on the raft, and I remembered how scared I had been, and how scared he must have been too, alone on that raft thinking I was gone. And something clicked in my head. He warn't just a nigger anymore. He was Jim. He was a man who cared about me. He had feelings, just like white folks. He could be hurt, and he could be sorry, and he could be kind. It was a powerful thought. It went against everything I had ever been taught. My pap, the Widow Douglas, Miss Watson – they all said niggers warn't human like us. But Jim was. Right there, in front of me, was a human being, and he was my friend, and I had hurt his feelings. It was a hard pill to swallow. It took me a long time to work up the nerve. My heart was thumping like a drum. I knew"

Then I thought a minute, and says to myself, hold on; s’pose you’d a done right and give Jim up, would you felt better than what you do now?

Well, then, says I, what’s the use you learning to do right when it’s troublesome to do right and ain’t no trouble to do wrong, and the wages is just the same? I was stuck. I couldn’t answer that.

It was a pretty good raise—twenty dollars apiece. Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat now, and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free States. He said twenty mile more warn’t far for the raft to go, but he wished we was already there.\nTowards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular about hiding the raft good.

But you've got to go a long way yet; and you're pretty near the foot of the island now. You'll have to paddle hard to get out of the bend before daylight. Good-night.\" He went away, and I paddled back to the raft. I told Jim it wasn't Cairo. Jim was most downhearted, because he had got his heart set on Cairo. But I told him it was all right; we'd get to Cairo next time, sure. We stopped at the head of a big island, and waited for daylight. We didn't go ashore, because we didn't know the country. By-and-by daylight came, and we started. My heart was beating pretty lively, I tell you; but it ain't no use to worry; it only makes you feel bad. We passed a little town, and a little island, but it wasn't Cairo. We kept on, and by-and-by we saw a big town away off down the river. \"That's Cairo!\" says Jim. \"I bet it is!\" says I. We paddled along, and by-and-by we got close enough to see the houses. \"That's Cairo!\" says Jim. \"I bet it is!\" says I.

We knowed it was a town, because you could see the lights scattered along the shore, and a big cluster of them where the main part was. Jim was mighty uneasy. He always was when we come near a town, and I couldn't blame him. He was a runaway slave, and every town was a risk. We talked it over, quiet-like, whispering so the river wouldn't carry our voices. We decided it wouldn't do to land right there. Too many people, too much chance of somebody seeing us and asking questions. We'd float on past, keep to the middle of the river where it was dark, and maybe tie up in a lonesome place further down, after the town was well behind us and the lights was just a memory. The river was wide and dark, and the stars was out, but they didn't seem to give much light down on the water. The current was strong, pushing us along steady. You could hear the sounds from the town drifting out – maybe a dog barking, or somebody shouting, or the whistle of a steamboat way off. It made you feel lonesome and a little scared, being out there on the dark river with all that life going on ashore that you couldn't be a part of, or didn't dare to be a part of. Jim was sitting up front, peering ahead, his face dark against"

You can’t tell the shape of the river, and you can’t see no distance. It got to be very late and still, and then along comes a steamboat up the river. We lit the lantern, and judged she would see it.

She aimed right for us. Often they do that and try to see how close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks he’s mighty smart. Well, here she comes, and we said she was going to try and shave us; but she didn’t seem to be sheering off a bit. She was a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black cloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulged out, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right over us.

Now, all ready. Step forward, George Jackson. And mind, don’t you hurry—come mighty slow. If there’s anybody with you, let him keep back—if he shows himself he’ll be shot. Come along now.

It’s just as easy.”\n“Which candle?” I says.\n“Why, any candle,” he says.\n“I don’t know where he was,” says I; “where was he?”\n“Why, he was in the dark! That’s where he was!”\n“Well, if you knowed where he was, what did you ask me for?”\n“Why, blame it, it’s a riddle, don’t you see? Say, how long are you going to stay here? You got to stay always. We can just have booming times—they don’t have no school now. Do you own a dog? I’ve got a dog—and he’ll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in. Do you like to comb up Sundays, and all that kind of foolishness? You bet I don’t, but ma she makes me. Confound these ole britches! I reckon I’d better put ’em on, but I’d ruther not, it’s so warm. Are you all ready? All right. Come along, old hoss.”\nCold corn-pone, cold corn-beef, butter and buttermilk—that is what they had for me down there, and there ain’t nothing better that ever I’ve come across yet. Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes, except the nigger woman, which was gone, and the two young women. They all smoked and talked, and I eat and talked. The young women had quilts around them, and their hair down their backs. They all asked me questions, and I told them how pap and me and all the family was living on a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my sister Mary Ann run off and got married and never was heard of no more, and Bill went to hunt them and he warn’t heard of no more, and Tom and Mort died, and then there warn’t nobody but just me and pap left, and he was just trimmed down to nothing, on account of his troubles; so when he died I took what there was left, because the farm didn’t belong to us, and started up the river, deck passage, and fell overboard; and that was how I come to be here. So they said I could have a home there as long as I wanted it. Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed, and I went to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in the morning, drat it all, I had forgot what my name was.",

There warn’t no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heaps of parlors in towns has beds in them. There was a big fireplace that was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes they wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown, same as they do in town. They had big brass dog-irons that could hold up a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece, with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front, and a round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see the pendulum swinging behind it. It was beautiful to hear that clock tick; and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her up and got her in good shape, she would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she got tuckered out. They wouldn’t took any money for her.\nWell, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock, made out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy. By one of the parrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other; and when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn’t open their mouths nor look different nor interested. They squeaked through underneath. There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out behind those things. On the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier than real ones is, but they warn’t real because you could see where pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever it was, underneath.\nThis table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and blue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around. It come all the way from Philadelphia, they said. There was some books, too, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table. One was a big family Bible full of pictures. One was Pilgrim’s Progress, about a man that left his family, it didn’t say why. I read considerable in it now and then. The statements was interesting, but tough. Another was Friendship’s Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn’t read the poetry. Another was Henry Clay’s Speeches, and another was Dr. Gunn’s Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body was sick or dead. There was a hymn book, and a lot of other books.

It didn't have an old-fashioned brass knob to the front door, that nobody ever polished, but a new one that you could see your face in, it was so bright and shining. It ain't every house that's got a brass knob to the front door. The stairs was carpeted, and everything was clean and sweet. The parlor was big and handsome, with pictures all over the walls, painted in oil. There was a big fireplace that was bricked all up, solid, like a chimney; and on the mantelpiece was a clock, and two big chalk dogs, and a crockery cat that was a-sittin' up and begging for something. And there was a big table in the middle of the room, with a pile of books on each corner, and a big family Bible in the middle of the pile. And there was a lot of chairs, and a sofa, and a big looking-glass over the fireplace. And there was a lot of other things, too, that I can't remember now.

            "Huck describes the various pictures hanging on the walls, which include depictions of Washingtons, Lafayettes, battle scenes, Highland Marys, and one titled 'Signing the Declaration.'",
            "He gives special attention to a collection of crayon drawings created by the family's deceased daughter, Emmeline, when she was merely fifteen years old, noting their predominantly dark and somber quality, which he found unusual.",
            "He provides detailed descriptions of several of Emmeline's melancholic artworks: one featuring a woman in a slim black dress mourning by a tombstone under a weeping willow, captioned 'Shall I Never See Thee More Alas'; another portraying a young lady weeping into a handkerchief while holding a dead bird, titled 'I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas'; and a third showing a tearful young lady at a window gazing at the moon, clutching an open letter, with the caption 'And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.'",
            "Huck confesses that while these pictures were considered fine, they invariably made him feel uneasy or 'gave him the fan-tods.'",
            "He recounts the story of Emmeline's ambitious but unfinished painting: a young woman in a long white gown poised to jump from a bridge, depicted with multiple sets of arms because Emmeline passed away before deciding on the final pose. This picture is preserved above the head of the bed in her room and adorned with flowers on her birthday.",
            "Huck observes that the subject of this painting had a sweet face but appeared 'too spidery' due to the profusion of arms.",
            "Emmeline also maintained a scrapbook where she pasted obituaries, accounts of accidents, and stories of suffering from the 'Presbyterian Observer,' which then inspired her to write poetry, exemplified by her 'ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC’D,' a poem about a boy who drowned in a well.",
            "Huck expresses admiration for her youthful talent, and Buck's accounts confirm Emmeline's prolific and rapid poetic output, always focusing on sad themes.",
            "She gained a local reputation for her promptly composed 'tributes' for deceased individuals, reportedly faltering only once when she struggled to find a rhyme for the name 'Whistler,' an incident after which her spirits and health seemingly declined.",
            "Despite sometimes being unsettled by her morbid creations, Huck felt an affinity for the entire Grangerford family, including the departed Emmeline, and would often retreat to her room to read her scrapbook.",
            "Feeling that Emmeline herself deserved a poetic tribute after her death, Huck attempted to write some verses for her but found himself unable to succeed.",
            "Emmeline's room is kept meticulously preserved by the old lady, just as it was when she was alive, and serves as a private space for sewing and Bible reading."

          "text_segment": "They had pictures hung on the walls—mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes, and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called “Signing the Declaration.” There was some that they called crayons, which one of the daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen years old. They was different from any pictures I ever see before—blacker, mostly, than is common. One was a woman in a slim black dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule, and underneath the picture it said “Shall I Never See Thee More Alas.” Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath the picture it said “I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.” There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath the picture it said “And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.” These was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn’t somehow seem to take to them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the fan-tods. Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done what they had lost. But I reckoned that with her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard. She was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it done, but she never got the chance. It was a picture of a young woman in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up towards the moon—and the idea was to see which pair would look best, and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung flowers on it. Other times it was hid with a little curtain. The young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me.\nThis young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the Presbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her own head. It was very good poetry. This is what she wrote about a boy by the name of Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded:\nODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC’D\n\nAnd did young Stephen sicken,\n    And did young Stephen die?\nAnd did the sad hearts thicken,\n    And did the mourners cry?\n\nNo; such was not the fate of\n    Young Stephen Dowling Bots;\nThough sad hearts round him thickened,\n    ’Twas not from sickness’ shots.\n\nNo whooping-cough did rack his frame,\n    Nor measles drear with spots;\nNot these impaired the sacred name\n    Of Stephen Dowling Bots.\n\nDespised love struck not with woe\n    That head of curly knots,\nNor stomach troubles laid him low,\n    Young Stephen Dowling Bots.\n\nO no. Then list with tearful eye,\n    Whilst I his fate do tell.\nHis soul did from this cold world fly\n    By falling down a well.\n\nThey got him out and emptied him;\n    Alas it was too late;\nHis spirit was gone for to sport aloft\n    In the realms of the good and great.\nIf Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was fourteen, there ain’t no telling what she could a done by-and-by. Buck said she could rattle off poetry like nothing. She didn’t ever have to stop to think. He said she would slap down a line, and if she couldn’t find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down another one, and go ahead. She warn’t particular; she could write about anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful. Every time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died, she would be on hand with her “tribute” before he was cold. She called them tributes. The neighbors said it was the doctor first, then Emmeline, then the undertaker—the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once, and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person’s name, which was Whistler. She warn’t ever the same after that; she never complained, but she kinder pined away and did not live long. Poor thing, many’s the time I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been aggravating me and I had soured on her a little. I liked all that family, dead ones and all, and warn’t going to let anything come between us. Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was alive, and it didn’t seem right that there warn’t nobody to make some about her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two myself, but I couldn’t seem to make it go somehow. They kept Emmeline’s room trim and nice, and all the things fixed in it just the way she liked to have them when she was alive, and nobody ever slept there. The old lady took care of the room herself, though there was plenty of niggers, and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there mostly.",

          "text_segment": "Col. Grangerford was a gentleman, you see. He was a gentleman all over; and so was his family. He was well born, as the saying is, and that’s worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn’t no more quality than a mudcat himself. Col. Grangerford was very tall and very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it anywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you, as you may say. His forehead was high, and his hair was black and straight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it; and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it. He carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it. There warn’t no frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn’t ever loud. He was as kind as he could be—you could feel that, you know, and so you had confidence. Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first, and find out what the matter was afterwards. He didn’t ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners—everybody was always good-mannered where he was. Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine most always—I mean he made it seem like good weather. When he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was enough; there wouldn’t nothing go wrong again for a week.\nWhen him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got up out of their chairs and give them good-day, and didn’t set down again till they had set down. Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where the decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him, and he held it in his hand and waited till Tom’s and Bob’s was mixed, and then they bowed and said, “Our duty to you, sir, and madam;” and they bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank, all three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, and give it to me and Buck, and we drank to the old people too.\nBob was the oldest and Tom next—tall, beautiful men with very broad shoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes. They dressed in white linen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, and wore broad Panama hats.\nThen there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall and proud and grand, but as good as she could be when she warn’t stirred up; but when she was, she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks, like her father. She was beautiful.\nSo was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind. She was gentle and sweet like a dove, and she was only twenty.\nEach person had their own nigger to wait on them—Buck too. My nigger had a monstrous easy time, because I warn’t used to having anybody do anything for me, but Buck’s was on the jump most of the time.\nThis was all there was of the family now, but there used to be more—three sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died.\nThe old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers. Sometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten or fifteen mile around, and stay five or six days, and have such junketings round about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the woods daytimes, and balls at the house nights. These people was mostly kinfolks of the family. The men brought their guns with them. It was a handsome lot of quality, I tell you.",

But they don’t always kill. Pa’s got a few buckshot in him; but he don’t mind it ’cuz he don’t weigh much, anyway. Bob’s been carved up some with a bowie, and Tom’s been hurt once or twice.”\n“Has anybody been killed this year, Buck?”\n“Yes; we got one and they got one. ’Bout three months ago my cousin Bud, fourteen year old, was riding through the woods on t’other side of the river, and didn’t have no weapon with him, which was blame’ foolishness, and in a lonesome place he hears a horse a-coming behind him, and sees old Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin’ after him with his gun in his hand and his white hair a-flying in the wind; and ’stead of jumping off and taking to the brush, Bud ’lowed he could out-run him; so they had it, nip and tuck, for five mile or more, the old man a-gaining all the time; so at last Bud seen it warn’t any use, so he stopped and faced around so as to have the bullet holes in front, you know, and the old man he rode up and shot him down. But he didn’t git much chance to enjoy his luck, for inside of a week our folks laid him out.”\n“I reckon that old man was a coward, Buck.”\n“I reckon he warn’t a coward. Not by a blame’ sight. There ain’t a coward amongst them Shepherdsons—not a one. And there ain’t no cowards amongst the Grangerfords either. Why, that old man kep’ up his end in a fight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords, and come out winner. They was all a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and got behind a little woodpile, and kep’ his horse before him to stop the bullets; but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around the old man, and peppered away at him, and he peppered away at them. Him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled, but the Grangerfords had to be fetched home—and one of ’em was dead, and another died the next day.

It was pretty ornery preaching—all about brotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it was a good sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such a powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and preforeordestination, and I don’t know what all, that it did seem to me to be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet.\nAbout an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in their chairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull. Buck and a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep. I went up to our room, and judged I would take a nap myself. I found that sweet Miss Sophia standing in her door, which was next to ours, and she took me in her room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I liked her, and I said I did; and she asked me if I would do something for her and not tell anybody, and I said I would. Then she said she’d forgot her Testament, and left it in the seat at church between two other books, and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her, and not say nothing to nobody. I said I would. So I slid out and slipped off up the road, and there warn’t anybody at the church, except maybe a hog or two, for there warn’t any lock on the door, and hogs likes a puncheon floor in summer-time because it’s cool. If you notice, most folks don’t go to church only when they’ve got to; but a hog is different.\nSays I to myself, something’s up; it ain’t natural for a girl to be in such a sweat about a Testament. So I give it a shake, and out drops a little piece of paper with “Half-past two” wrote on it with a pencil. I ransacked it, but couldn’t find anything else. I couldn’t make anything out of that, so I put the paper in the book again, and when I got home and upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me. She pulled me in and shut the door; then she looked in the Testament till she found the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad; and before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and said I was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody. She was mighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted up, and it made her powerful pretty. I was a good deal astonished, but when I got my breath I asked her what the paper was about, and she asked me if I had read it, and I said no, and she asked me if I could read writing, and I told her “no, only coarse-hand,” and then she said the paper warn’t anything but a book-mark to keep her place, and I might go and play now.",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the entire sequence that occurs after the church service, including the events at the house, the interactions with Miss Sophia, the errand involving the Testament, and the discovery of the note. These are significant narrative developments in the original passage.\n- The completion invents details about additional characters (such as Jim and uncles) attending church, and adds invented descriptions of the congregation's demeanor and the preacher's appearance, which are not present in the original.\n- The completion becomes dominated by an extremely lengthy, repetitive list of moral qualities, which is not reflective of the original passage's structure or content and disrupts the narrative flow.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The description of the family's activities after returning from church, including the post-dinner atmosphere and the characters' locations and actions, is missing.\n- The interaction between the narrator and Miss Sophia, including her request and the secretive nature of the errand, is absent.\n- The narrator's trip to the church to retrieve the Testament, the observations about the empty church and the presence of hogs, and the narrator's internal suspicions are not included.\n- The discovery of the note, the return to Miss Sophia, her reaction, and the subsequent conversation about the note are all omitted.\n\n3.

            "prefix-probing": "I went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soon I noticed that my nigger was following along behind. I didn't say nothing, just kept on going till I got to where the canoe was hid. He come up and stood there, looking at me, and I knowed what was in his mind. He was scared, naturally, after all that shooting and carrying on back there at the house. He didn't know what was going to happen next, and he was sticking to me like a burr. And I reckon I was glad of it, though I wouldn't let on. It was powerful lonesome, all that mess back there, and seeing them folks killed, and the silence afterwards was worse than the noise. Being with Jim felt like coming home, in a way, though it was a home on the run.  We got the canoe out and paddled back to the island where we'd hid the raft. It felt good to see her again, riding there quiet amongst the willows. The sun was getting low, painting the sky all sorts of colors, and the river was smooth as glass. We tied up the canoe and climbed aboard the raft. Jim didn't say much at first either. He just looked around, sort of taking it all in, like he was making sure it was real and we was safe. Then he sighed, a big, shaky sigh, and sat down on the blankets.  I sat down too, and we just watched the river go by for a spell. My mind was still working on that business back at the Grangerfords'. It was awful. Just plain awful. And I kept thinking about Buck, and how he was just a boy, and them others. It made me feel sick inside. And then I'd look at Jim, sitting there quiet, and I'd think about how I was helping him get away.  That's when the old trouble started up in my head again. Here I was, a-helping a runaway nigger. Stealing property, as the Widow Douglas and Miss Watson would call it. They'd told me time and time again that it was a wicked thing to do, a sin. They said niggers was property, just like a cow or a horse, and helping one escape was just the same as stealing. My conscience was starting to prick me hard. It said, \"Huck, you know this is wrong. You're going to hell for this. Think about Miss Watson, how good she was to you, and you're stealing her nigger.\"  It was a powerful argument, and it made me feel mighty uncomfortable. I'd been raised to believe that helping a slave was about the worst thing a body could do. It went against everything I'd been taught. And here I was, doing it, and not just doing it, but feeling... well, I didn't know exactly what I was feeling. It wasn't like I felt good about breaking the law, not exactly. But being with Jim, out here on the river, away from all that craziness and meanness on shore, it felt right. It felt peaceful.  Jim finally spoke. \"Huck,\" he said, his voice low, \"we's safe now, ain't we?\"  \"Yeah, Jim,\" I said. \"We're safe. For now.\"  He nodded, looking out at the water. \"Dat was awful back dar, Huck. Awful.\"  \"It surely was, Jim.\"  We was quiet again. I kept turning it over in my mind. Was I doing the right thing? According to everybody I'd ever knowed, no. I was doing the wrongest thing possible. I was helping a slave get his freedom. It was like I was going against God and man. It was enough to make a body sweat, just thinking about it.  But then I'd look at Jim. I'd remember how he'd nursed me when I was sick, how he'd been there for me, how he talked about his family and how much he wanted to see them again. He wasn't just property. He was a man. He had feelings, and hopes, and fears, just like anybody else. More than some folks I knowed on shore, that's for sure.  My conscience kept hammering away, though. It said, \"Turn him in, Huck. It's the right thing to do. It's what society expects. It's"

I waked up about dawn, and was a-going to turn over and go to sleep again, when I noticed how still it was—didn’t seem to be anybody stirring. That warn’t usual. Next I noticed that Buck was up and gone. Well, I gets up, a-wondering, and goes down stairs—nobody around; everything as still as a mouse. Just the same outside. Thinks I, what does it mean? Down by the wood-pile I comes across my Jack, and says:\n“What’s it all about?”\nSays he:\n“Don’t you know, Mars Jawge?”\n“No,” says I, “I don’t.”\n“Well, den, Miss Sophia’s run off! ’deed she has. She run off in de night some time—nobody don’t know jis’ when; run off to get married to dat young Harney Shepherdson, you know—leastways, so dey ’spec. De fambly foun’ it out ’bout half an hour ago—maybe a little mo’—en’ I tell you dey warn’t no time los’. Sich another hurryin’ up guns en hosses you never see! De women folks has gone for to stir up de relations, en ole Mars Saul en de boys tuck dey guns en rode up de river road for to try to ketch dat young man en kill him ’fo’ he kin git acrost de river wid Miss Sophia. I reck’n dey’s gwyne to be mighty rough times.”\n“Buck went off ’thout waking me up.”\n“Well, I reck’n he did! Dey warn’t gwyne to mix you up in it. Mars Buck he loaded up his gun en ’lowed he’s gwyne to fetch home a Shepherdson or bust. Well, dey’ll be plenty un ’m dah, I reck’n, en you bet you he’ll fetch one ef he gits a chanst.”\nI took up the river road as hard as I could put. By-and-by I begin to hear guns a good ways off. When I come in sight of the log store and the woodpile where the steamboats lands, I worked along under the trees and brush till I got to a good place, and then I clumb up into the forks of a cottonwood that was out of reach, and watched. There was a wood-rank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree, and first I was going to hide behind that; but maybe it was luckier I didn’t.\nThere was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open place before the log store, cussing and yelling, and trying to get at a couple of young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of the steamboat landing; but they couldn’t come it. Every time one of them showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at. The two boys was squatting back to back behind the pile, so they could watch both ways.\nBy-and-by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling. They started riding towards the store; then up gets one of the boys, draws a steady bead over the wood-rank, and drops one of them out of his saddle. All the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started to carry him to the store; and that minute the two boys started on the run. They got half way to the tree I was in before the men noticed. Then the men see them, and jumped on their horses and took out after them. They gained on the boys, but it didn’t do no good, the boys had too good a start; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree, and slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the men again. One of the boys was Buck, and the other was a slim young chap about nineteen years old.\nThe men ripped around awhile, and then rode away. As soon as they was out of sight I sung out to Buck and told him. He didn’t know what to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first. He was awful surprised. He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the men come in sight again; said they was up to some devilment or other—wouldn’t be gone long. I wished I was out of that tree, but I dasn’t come down. Buck begun to cry and rip, and ’lowed that him and his cousin Joe (that was the other young chap) would make up for this day yet. He said his father and his two brothers was killed, and two or three of the enemy. Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in ambush. Buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for their relations—the Shepherdsons was too strong for them. I asked him what was become of young Harney and Miss Sophia. He said they’d got across the river and was safe. I was glad of that; but the way Buck did take on because he didn’t manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him—I hain’t ever heard anything like it.\nAll of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three or four guns—the men had slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their horses! The boys jumped for the river—both of them hurt—and as they swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and singing out, “Kill them, kill them!” It made me so sick I most fell out of the tree. I ain’t a-going to tell all that happened—it would make me sick again if I was to do that. I wished I hadn’t ever come ashore that night to see such things. I ain’t ever going to get shut of them—lots of times I dream about them.",

I lay awake most all night, thinking, and would a give anything to been on the raft the minute I landed; but I didn’t, you see. It was most daylight when I got to thinking of the raft, and then I thought of Jim, and wanted to see him. I waked up full of trouble, right at dawn, and set up in bed and listened. The house was perfectly quiet. I got up and dressed myself, hard as it was to do, and went downstairs. The house was shut up, tight and fast, and all dark. I went into the parlor, and looked out of the window. There wasn’t anybody stirring. I went to the back door and got my things, and started for the river. I met a nigger woman coming along with a bucket of milk; she said she belonged to Miss Sophia, and she was going to milk the cows. She was most down to the river now. It was a mighty nice morning, all gray and misty, and the river was just simmering along, quiet and smooth. I was going to slip in, if I could, and get to the raft; but as I come a-nigh the place where I hid it, I see a nigger man setting on a log, waiting for me. He was Jack, Miss Sophia’s nigger. He says:\n\n“Hello, Huck!”\n\n“Hello, Jack! What you doin’ here?”\n\n“Why, I come to tell you to clear out; the old man’s done gone up the river, and told everybody how you’ve been a-helping Miss Sophia to run off with young Harney Shepherdson.”\n\n“Good land! and she’s gone?”\n\n“Yes, she run off in the night, sometime. They found it out about half an hour ago—just as I was a-coming along. The old man was a-raging considerable; he says you got to clear out, and he’ll give you a start. He says he’ll give you a start, and he’ll give you a start, and he’ll give you a start.”\n\nI didn’t wait to hear any more, but lit out for the river. I didn’t see anybody on the way. I got to the river, and there was the raft, safe and sound. I was going to shove off, but I thought I better wait a minute, and see if I could see Jim. I looked up and down the river, but I didn’t see him. I was just a-going to shove off, when I heard a whole lot of shooting up the river. I jumped ashore and hid in the bushes. I heard some more shooting, and then I heard a lot of yelling. I crept up to the bank, and looked through the bushes. There was a whole crowd of men on horseback, a-going up the river, full tilt. They was all Shepherdsons. I see Buck and his father and his two brothers, and a lot more of the Grangerfords, a-coming along behind, a-shooting. They was all a-shooting. I see Buck shoot one of the Shepherdsons off his horse. The Shepherdsons stopped, and the Grangerfords come up, and they had a big fight. I couldn’t see it very good, because the bushes was so thick. I heard a lot of yelling and shooting, and then I see the Grangerfords turn and run. The Shepherdsons after them, a-shooting. I see Buck and his father and his two brothers get killed. I see a lot more get killed on both sides. It was a dreadful sight. I didn’t want to see any more, so I crept back in the bushes and hid. I lay there a long time, and then I heard somebody a-coming. I looked through the bushes, and I see Buck a-coming, all bloody and dirty. He was crying. He set down on the log, and I crept out and went to him.\n\n“Hello, Buck!”\n\nHe looked up, and he was mighty glad to see me. “Hello, Huck! I thought you was killed.”\n\n“No, I ain’t killed. What’s the matter?”\n\n“They killed pap, and killed Tom, and killed Bob, and killed Joe, and killed everybody, most. They killed pap, and Tom, and Bob, and Joe, and a whole lot more.

I lay awake most all night, thinking, and would a give anything to been on the raft the minute I landed; but I didn’t, you see. It was most daylight when I got to thinking of the raft, and then I thought of Jim, and wanted to see him. I waked up full of trouble, right at dawn, and set up in bed and listened. The house was perfectly quiet. I got up and dressed myself, hard as it was to do, and went downstairs. The house was shut up, tight and fast, and all dark. I went into the parlor, and looked out of the window. There wasn’t anybody stirring. I went to the back door and got my things, and started for the river. I met a nigger woman coming along with a bucket of milk; she said she belonged to Miss Sophia, and she was going to milk the cows. She was most down to the river now. It was a mighty nice morning, all gray and misty, and the river was just simmering along, quiet and smooth. I was going to slip in, if I could, and get to the raft; but as I come a-nigh the place where I hid it, I see a nigger man setting on a log, waiting for me. He was Jack, Miss Sophia’s nigger. He says:\n\n“Hello, Huck!”\n\n“Hello, Jack! What you doin’ here?”\n\n“Why, I come to tell you to clear out; the old man’s done gone up the river, and told everybody how you’ve been a-helping Miss Sophia to run off with young Harney Shepherdson.”\n\n“Good land! and she’s gone?”\n\n“Yes, she run off in the night, sometime. They found it out about half an hour ago—just as I was a-coming along. The old man was a-raging considerable; he says you got to clear out, and he’ll give you a start. He says he’ll give you a start, and he’ll give you a start, and he’ll give you a start.”\n\nI didn’t wait to hear any more, but lit out for the river. I didn’t see anybody on the way. I got to the river, and there was the raft, safe and sound. I was going to shove off, but I thought I better wait a minute, and see if I could see Jim. I looked up and down the river, but I didn’t see him. I was just a-going to shove off, when I heard a whole lot of shooting up the river. I jumped ashore and hid in the bushes. I heard some more shooting, and then I heard a lot of yelling. I crept up to the bank, and looked through the bushes. There was a whole crowd of men on horseback, a-going up the river, full tilt. They was all Shepherdsons. I see Buck and his father and his two brothers, and a lot more of the Grangerfords, a-coming along behind, a-shooting. They was all a-shooting. I see Buck shoot one of the Shepherdsons off his horse. The Shepherdsons stopped, and the Grangerfords come up, and they had a big fight. I couldn’t see it very good, because the bushes was so thick. I heard a lot of yelling and shooting, and then I see the Grangerfords turn and run. The Shepherdsons after them, a-shooting. I see Buck and his father and his two brothers get killed. I see a lot more get killed on both sides. It was a dreadful sight. I didn’t want to see any more, so I crept back in the bushes and hid. I lay there a long time, and then I heard somebody a-coming. I looked through the bushes, and I see Buck a-coming, all bloody and dirty. He was crying. He set down on the log, and I crept out and went to him.\n\n“Hello, Buck!”\n\nHe looked up, and he was mighty glad to see me. “Hello, Huck! I thought you was killed.”\n\n“No, I ain’t killed. What’s the matter?”\n\n“They killed pap, and killed Tom, and killed Bob, and killed Joe, and killed everybody, most. They killed pap, and Tom, and Bob, and Joe, and a whole lot more. They killed about fifteen of our men. And we killed about ten of them. It was a dreadful fight. I don’t know how I got away. I was shot in the arm, and shot in the leg.”\n\nHe showed me his arm and his leg; they was all bloody. He was crying and sobbing, and I didn’t know what to do. I set down by him, and put my arm around him, and he leaned his head on my shoulder, and cried. He was just a boy, and he was all broke up. I didn’t say nothing; I just let him cry. After a while he got quiet, and he says:\n\n“Huck, they killed pap, and Tom, and Bob, and Joe, and a whole lot more. And we killed about ten of them. It was a dreadful fight. I don’t know how I got away. I was shot in the arm, and shot in the leg.”\n\nHe showed me his arm and his leg again. They was all bloody. He was crying and sobbing, and I didn’t know what to do.

            "Jim explains that Jack had come and reported that Huck was likely shot because he hadn't returned home. Consequently, Jim was just starting to move the raft down the creek to be ready to leave as soon as Jack confirmed Huck's death.",
            "Huck reassures Jim and explains that his disappearance will lead the Grangerfords to believe he was killed and floated downriver, a belief that will be aided by 'something up there' (likely the bodies he covered). He urges Jim to shove off into the main river immediately.",

Sometimes I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen little gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so I reckoned the trouble was still a-going on. I was mighty downhearted; so I made up my mind I wouldn’t ever go anear that house again, because I reckoned I was to blame, somehow. I judged that that piece of paper meant that Miss Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half-past two and run off; and I judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way she acted, and then maybe he would a locked her up, and this awful mess wouldn’t ever happened.\nWhen I got down out of the tree, I crept along down the river bank a piece, and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, and tugged at them till I got them ashore; then I covered up their faces, and got away as quick as I could. I cried a little when I was covering up Buck’s face, for he was mighty good to me.\nIt was just dark now. I never went near the house, but struck through the woods and made for the swamp. Jim warn’t on his island, so I tramped off in a hurry for the crick, and crowded through the willows, red-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country. The raft was gone! My souls, but I was scared! I couldn’t get my breath for most a minute. Then I raised a yell. A voice not twenty-five foot from me says:\n“Good lan’! is dat you, honey? Doan’ make no noise.”\nIt was Jim’s voice—nothing ever sounded so good before. I run along the bank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me, he was so glad to see me. He says:\n“Laws bless you, chile, I ’uz right down sho’ you’s dead agin. Jack’s been heah; he say he reck’n you’s ben shot, kase you didn’ come home no mo’; so I’s jes’ dis minute a startin’ de raf’ down towards de mouf er de crick, so’s to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as Jack comes agin en tells me for certain you is dead. Lawsy, I’s mighty glad to git you back agin, honey.”\nI says:\n“All right—that’s mighty good; they won’t find me, and they’ll think I’ve been killed, and floated down the river—there’s something up there that’ll help them think so—so don’t you lose no time, Jim, but just shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can.”\nI never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the middle of the Mississippi. Then we hung up our signal lantern, and judged that we was free and safe once more. I hadn’t had a bite to eat since yesterday, so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk, and pork and cabbage and greens—there ain’t nothing in the world so good when it’s cooked right—and whilst I eat my supper we talked, and had a good time. I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds, and so was Jim to get away from the swamp. We said there warn’t no home like a raft, after all. Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery, but a raft don’t. You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft.",

It was lonesome up there, and the wind moaned through the leaves like somebody sighing, and the woods got awful still except for the crickets and a hoot owl away off. My stomach was gnawing at me, and I was powerful thirsty. I kept thinking about Pap and how mad he’d be if he found me, and then I’d think about the Widow and Miss Watson and how they’d carry on if they knew I was out here all alone. But mostly I was just scared of the dark and the noises the woods make when the sun goes down. Every little snap of a twig sounded like a footstep, and every rustle of leaves like somebody creeping up. I reckon I stayed up there a good hour after it was proper dark, just listening and shivering, partly from the cold and partly from the fear.  Finally, I couldn't stand it no more. My legs was cramped, and I was so hungry I felt weak. I waited till the moon poked its nose over the trees, just a sliver, but enough to see the ground right under me. I slid down slow and careful, making as little noise as I could. When my feet hit the ground, I stood still for a long time, listening. Nothing but the night sounds.  I started moving real quiet, keeping low to the ground, heading towards where I reckoned the river was. I knew I had to get away from Pap's cabin. He'd be back sooner or later, and I didn't want to be there when he was sober or drunk, neither one. Sober, he'd beat me for running off; drunk, he'd beat me just because.  I stumbled through the bushes and over roots, my eyes getting used to the dim light. I was looking for something to eat. Anything. Berries, roots, anything that didn't look like it would poison me. I found some wild grapes, sour as sin, but I ate 'em anyway. They didn't do much for the hunger, but they helped with the thirst a little.  I kept going till I could smell the river. That was a good smell. It meant freedom, somehow. I crept up to the bank and looked out. The river was dark and wide, with the moon making a shimmery path across it. There wasn't a sound but the gentle lapping of the water against the bank. It felt safe, or safer than being in the woods near the cabin.  I knew I couldn't stay right there. Pap might come looking along the bank. I needed to find a better hiding place, maybe a cave or a thicket further down. I started walking along the edge of the water, keeping in the shadows. My mind was racing, trying to figure out what to do next. I had to make it look like I was dead, that was the only way to be truly free of Pap and the Widow and all that sivilizing business. I had a plan forming in my head, a desperate one, but it seemed like the only way out. I just needed to find the right spot and gather the things I'd need. The river flowed on, quiet and steady, like it was waiting for me to make my move. I felt a little bit of hope stirring in my chest, small as a mustard seed, but it was there. I was on my own now, and that was a scary thought, but also a powerful one. I was free to do what I wanted, if I could just stay alive and out of sight. The night was my friend now, and the river was my road."

It was a monstrous big river down there—sometimes a mile and a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up—nearly always in the dead water under a tow-head; and then cut young cottonwoods and willows, and hid the raft with them. Then we set out the lines. Next we slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool off; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee deep, and watched the daylight come. Not a sound anywheres—perfectly still—just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs a-cluttering, maybe. The first thing to see, looking away over the water, was a kind of dull line—that was the woods on t’other side; you couldn’t make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then more paleness spreading around; then the river softened up away off, and warn’t black any more, but gray; you could see little dark spots drifting along ever so far away—trading scows, and such things; and long black streaks—rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking; or jumbled up voices, it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by-and-by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the streak that there’s a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it and makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl up off of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and you make out a log-cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t’other side of the river, being a woodyard, likely, and piled by them cheats so you can throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up, and comes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh and sweet to smell on account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way, because they’ve left dead fish laying around, gars and such, and they do get pretty rank; and next you’ve got the full day, and everything smiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it!\nA little smoke couldn’t be noticed now, so we would take some fish off of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast.

The whole world was asleep, only the frogs was doing their work, and the snakes was scratching around. And you couldn't see nothing, for miles around, but just the black water and the trees away off on the banks, away off in the gloom. We didn't ever feel lonesome, or wish we hadn't come.

We used to camp out on the big river, and the lonesomest place there is, is a big river when the sun goes down. We would tie up in the daytime and hide in the cottonwood thickets and other places where there was plenty of young cottonwoods to cut, and make the raft look like a little island, and shove it back into the bank. We would pull out right after dark and drift all night, and fetch up a little after daylight, and tie up again and hide. Sometimes we would float away all night and not see hide nor hair of a steamboat. We had good times now, great times. Every night we passed towns, some of them lit up, and by and by you could hear the dogs begin to howl away off in the dark, and see a light or two twinkling, and then you wouldn't see them any more. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and we'd try to count them, but they come so thick they ain't no use trying to count them. We had the sky up there, all speckled with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and say it was awful lonesome, but we warn't lonesome. We knowed a star that fell was a sign somebody's died, and we used to watch them come slanting down and say somebody was dying, sure. Well, we got to know the river pretty well, and we knowed the signs of it. We knowed when we was coming to a town by the way the banks begun to look, and when we was coming to a bend by the way the water begun to swell up, and when we was coming to a snag by the way the water begun to break, and when we was coming to a bar by the way the water begun to get shallow. We knowed all these signs, and we knowed how to steer the raft, and we knowed how to keep out of the way of the steamboats. We had a little fire on the raft, and we cooked our meals on it. We had a little tent on the raft, and we slept in it. We had a little box on the raft, and we kept our things in it. We had a little bucket on the raft, and we dipped water out of the river with it. We had a little paddle on the raft, and we steered the raft with it. We had a little rope on the raft, and we tied the raft up with it. We had a little pole on the raft, and we pushed the raft off with it. We had a little axe on the raft, and we cut wood with it. We had a little gun on the raft, and we shot game with it. We had a little dog on the raft, and he barked at the steamboats. We had a little cat on the raft, and she caught rats. We had a little chicken on the raft, and she laid eggs. We had a little pig on the raft, and he grunted. We had a little cow on the raft, and she mooed. We had a little horse on the raft, and he neighed. We had a little sheep on the raft, and he baaed. We had a little goat on the raft, and he bleated. We had a little duck on the raft, and he quacked. We had a little goose on the raft, and he honked. We had a little turkey on the raft, and he gobbled. We had a little rooster on the raft, and he crowed. We had a little hen on the raft, and she clucked. We had a little chick on the raft, and he peeped. We had a little pigeon on the raft, and he cooed. We had a little dove on the raft, and she mourned. We had a little owl on the raft, and he hooted. We had a little bat on the raft, and he flitted. We had a little moth on the raft, and he fluttered. We had a little whip-poor-will on the raft, and he cried. We had a little bullfrog on the raft, and he croaked. We had a little snake on the raft, and he hissed. We had a little turtle on the raft, and he sunned himself. We had a little fish on the raft, and he swam. We had a little crawfish on the raft, and he crawled. We had a little bug on the raft, and he buzzed. We had a little fly on the raft, and he hummed.

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents a lengthy, abstract, and philosophical list of contrasts and concepts that is not present in the original passage. This invented section disrupts the narrative flow and introduces themes and reflections that do not belong to the original scene.\n- The completion omits the detailed, step-by-step description of the characters' morning routine and the specific activities they perform after stopping the raft, which is a major structural component of the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion does not include the specific details about how the characters spend their time during the day and night, such as their navigation habits, hiding the raft, and preparing for the day.\n- The completion lacks the sequence of actions involving preparing the raft, setting out lines, swimming, and sitting in the water to watch the dawn.\n- The description of the gradual changes in the river and sky as morning arrives, including the visual cues and sounds, is largely missing or only vaguely referenced.\n- The original's depiction of the river's width, the presence of trading boats and rafts, and the identification of a woodyard are not included.\n- The process of making breakfast and the subsequent activities, such as observing the river's lonesomeness and drifting off to sleep, are omitted.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces inaccurate or invented animal activity (e.g., snakes scratching around) and personifies the sun and moon in a way not present in the original.\n- The sequence of events is altered, with the focus shifting from concrete actions and observations to generalized feelings and invented poetic musings.\n- The completion attributes a reflective, almost philosophical tone to the narrator, which is not consistent with the original's straightforward, observational style.\n- The order of natural events and the progression from night to day is not accurately followed, and some details are generalized or misplaced.\n- The completion fails to accurately represent the transition from night to morning, the specific environmental cues, and the practical actions taken by the characters."

            "Their days were spent lazily, immersed in the river's stillness.",
            "On one occasion, a dense fog enveloped them, and passing rafts and other vessels would beat tin pans as a warning to steamboats to prevent collisions.",
            "During this fog, they heard men on a nearby, unseen raft talking, cursing, and laughing, which created an eerie, crawly sensation, as if spirits were present.",
            "Jim expressed his belief that these unseen voices belonged to spirits.",
            "Huck, however, pragmatically countered Jim's superstition, reasoning that spirits wouldn't use earthly curses like “Dern the dern fog.”",
            "As night approached, they would push the raft into the river's current, allowing it to float freely.",
            "They would then light their pipes, dangle their legs in the water, and engage in conversations on various topics.",
            "Huck mentions their preference for being naked day and night, weather permitting, as the new clothes from Buck's family were too fine for comfort and he generally wasn't fond of clothing.",
            "They often experienced the sensation of having the entire vast river to themselves for extended periods.",
            "They would observe distant sparks of light, identifying them as candles in cabin windows or lights on other rafts or scows.",
            "Occasionally, the faint sound of a fiddle or a song would drift across the water from these other crafts.",
            "Huck reflects on the loveliness of living on a raft.",
            "They would lie on their backs, gazing at the star-speckled sky, and debate whether the stars were created or simply came into existence on their own.",
            "Jim believed the stars were made, while Huck, considering their vast number, thought they just happened.",
            "Jim proposed that the moon could have laid the stars, an idea Huck found somewhat reasonable by comparing it to a frog laying numerous eggs.",
            "They also watched falling stars, which Jim believed were spoiled stars ejected from their celestial nest.",
            "At night, they would sometimes see steamboats gliding by, emitting showers of sparks from their chimneys that looked beautiful as they fell into the river.",
            "After a steamboat passed and disappeared around a bend, its waves would eventually reach and joggle the raft, followed by a prolonged silence, broken only by natural sounds like frogs.",
            "After midnight, lights from shore cabins would extinguish, indicating that people had gone to bed; these lights served as their clock, and the first reappearance of a light signaled approaching morning, prompting them to quickly find a hiding place."

Next you’d see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on it chopping, because they’re most always doing it on a raft; you’d see the axe flash and come down—you don’t hear nothing; you see that axe go up again, and by the time it’s above the man’s head then you hear the k’chunk!—it had took all that time to come over the water. So we would put in the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness. Once there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beating tin pans so the steamboats wouldn’t run over them. A scow or a raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and laughing—heard them plain; but we couldn’t see no sign of them; it made you feel crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air. Jim said he believed it was spirits; but I says:\n“No; spirits wouldn’t say, ‘Dern the dern fog.’”\nSoon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about the middle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted her to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and talked about all kinds of things—we was always naked, day and night, whenever the mosquitoes would let us—the new clothes Buck’s folks made for me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn’t go much on clothes, nohow.\nSometimes we’d have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest time. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybe a spark—which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on the water you could see a spark or two—on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts. It’s lovely to live on a raft. We had the sky up there, all speckled with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened. Jim he allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I judged it would have took too long to make so many. Jim said the moon could a laid them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn’t say nothing against it, because I’ve seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it could be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them streak down. Jim allowed they’d got spoiled and was hove out of the nest.\nOnce or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out of her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful pretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and her powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by-and-by her waves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle the raft a bit, and after that you wouldn’t hear nothing for you couldn’t tell how long, except maybe frogs or something.\nAfter midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or three hours the shores was black—no more sparks in the cabin windows. These sparks was our clock—the first one that showed again meant morning was coming, so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away.",

I says: “Well, I says, spirits don’t cuss, Jim. Spirits don’t cuss and swear. I says, what makes you think they’re spirits?” He says: “Well, I says, I don’t know, but I think they are.

I don’t blame you, gentlemen—far from it; I don’t blame anybody. I deserve it all. Let the cold world do its worst; one thing I know—there’s a grave somewhere for me. The world may go on just as it’s always done, and take everything from me—loved ones, property, everything; but it can’t take that. Some day I’ll lie down in it and forget it all, and my poor broken heart will be at rest.” He went on a-wiping.\n“Drot your pore broken heart,” says the baldhead; “what are you heaving your pore broken heart at us f’r? We hain’t done nothing.”\n“No, I know you haven’t. I ain’t blaming you, gentlemen. I brought myself down—yes, I did it myself. It’s right I should suffer—perfectly right—I don’t make any moan.”\n“Brought you down from whar? Whar was you brought down from?”\n“Ah, you would not believe me; the world never believes—let it pass—’tis no matter. The secret of my birth—”\n“The secret of your birth! Do you mean to say—”\n“Gentlemen,” says the young man, very solemn, “I will reveal it to you, for I feel I may have confidence in you. By rights I am a duke!”\nJim’s eyes bugged out when he heard that; and I reckon mine did, too. Then the baldhead says: “No! you can’t mean it?”\n“Yes. My great-grandfather, eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater, fled to this country about the end of the last century, to breathe the pure air of freedom; married here, and died, leaving a son, his own father dying about the same time. The second son of the late duke seized the titles and estates—the infant real duke was ignored. I am the lineal descendant of that infant—I am the rightful Duke of Bridgewater; and here am I, forlorn, torn from my high estate, hunted of men, despised by the cold world, ragged, worn, heart-broken, and degraded to the companionship of felons on a raft!”\nJim pitied him ever so much, and so did I. We tried to comfort him, but he said it warn’t much use, he couldn’t be much comforted; said if we was a mind to acknowledge him, that would do him more good than most anything else; so we said we would, if he would tell us how. He said we ought to bow when we spoke to him, and say “Your Grace,” or “My Lord,” or “Your Lordship”—and he wouldn’t mind it if we called him plain “Bridgewater,” which, he said, was a title anyway, and not a name; and one of us ought to wait on him at dinner, and do any little thing for him he wanted done.\nWell, that was all easy, so we done it. All through dinner Jim stood around and waited on him, and says, “Will yo’ Grace have some o’ dis or some o’ dat?” and so on, and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to him.",

            "When pressed, the older man, after securing a promise of trust from the 'Duke,' dramatically revealed his own secret: he declared himself to be the 'late Dauphin,' Louis XVII, son of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, the rightful King of France.",
            "This revelation caused Huck and Jim to stare in amazement. The 'Duke' expressed skepticism, particularly regarding the older man's age in relation to the historical Dauphin.",
            "The older man attributed his aged appearance, gray hairs, and premature baldness to 'trouble,' presenting himself as the wandering, exiled, trampled-on, and suffering King of France, clad in blue jeans and misery.",
            "Moved by his sorrowful display, Huck and Jim felt both pity and a sense of pride at having such an eminent personage with them. They began to comfort him as they had the 'Duke.'",
            "The 'King' claimed that only death could truly relieve his suffering, but he admitted that being treated according to his royal rights often made him feel better. He requested that people kneel when speaking to him, always call him 'Your Majesty,' serve him first at meals, and not sit in his presence until invited.",
            "Huck and Jim readily complied, bestowing royal honors upon him, which significantly cheered him up.",
            "However, the 'Duke' became somewhat resentful of the new hierarchy and the attention the 'King' was receiving. Despite this, the 'King' acted very friendly towards the 'Duke,' mentioning that his (the King's) father had held the Duke's ancestors in high regard.",
            "After the 'Duke' remained disgruntled for some time, the 'King' philosophically reasoned with him. He pointed out that they would likely be together on the raft for a long time, so being sour would only create discomfort. He emphasized that it wasn't his fault he wasn't born a duke, nor the 'Duke's' fault he wasn't born a king, so there was no use in worrying. He advocated for making the best of their situation and offered his hand in friendship.",

So, along in the afternoon, he says:\n“Looky here, Bilgewater,” he says, “I’m nation sorry for you, but you ain’t the only person that’s had troubles like that.”\n“No?”\n“No you ain’t. You ain’t the only person that’s ben snaked down wrongfully out’n a high place.”\n“Alas!”\n“No, you ain’t the only person that’s had a secret of his birth.” And, by jings, he begins to cry.\n“Hold! What do you mean?”\n“Bilgewater, kin I trust you?” says the old man, still sort of sobbing.\n“To the bitter death!” He took the old man by the hand and squeezed it, and says, “That secret of your being: speak!”\n“Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!”\nYou bet you, Jim and me stared this time. Then the duke says:\n“You are what?”\n“Yes, my friend, it is too true—your eyes is lookin’ at this very moment on the pore disappeared Dauphin, Looy the Seventeen, son of Looy the Sixteen and Marry Antonette.”\n“You! At your age! No! You mean you’re the late Charlemagne; you must be six or seven hundred years old, at the very least.”\n“Trouble has done it, Bilgewater, trouble has done it; trouble has brung these gray hairs and this premature balditude. Yes, gentlemen, you see before you, in blue jeans and misery, the wanderin’, exiled, trampled-on, and sufferin’ rightful King of France.”\nWell, he cried and took on so that me and Jim didn’t know hardly what to do, we was so sorry—and so glad and proud we’d got him with us, too. So we set in, like we done before with the duke, and tried to comfort him. But he said it warn’t no use, nothing but to be dead and done with it all could do him any good; though he said it often made him feel easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his rights, and got down on one knee to speak to him, and always called him “Your Majesty,” and waited on him first at meals, and didn’t set down in his presence till he asked them. So Jim and me set to majestying him, and doing this and that and t’other for him, and standing up till he told us we might set down. This done him heaps of good, and so he got cheerful and comfortable. But the duke kind of soured on him, and didn’t look a bit satisfied with the way things was going; still, the king acted real friendly towards him, and said the duke’s great-grandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good deal thought of by his father, and was allowed to come to the palace considerable; but the duke stayed huffy a good while, till by-and-by the king says:\n“Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h-yer raft, Bilgewater, and so what’s the use o’ your bein’ sour? It’ll only make things oncomfortable. It ain’t my fault I warn’t born a duke, it ain’t your fault you warn’t born a king—so what’s the use to worry? Make the best o’ things the way you find ’em, says I—that’s my motto. This ain’t no bad thing that we’ve struck here—plenty grub and an easy life—come, give us your hand, Duke, and le’s all be friends.”\nThe duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it. It took away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it, because it would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the raft; for what you want, above all things, on a raft, is for everybody to be satisfied, and feel right and kind towards the others.",

He said he was a king.\n\n“The King of France,” he says, very solemn. “Louis the Seventeenth, son of Louis the Sixteenth and Marie Antoinette.”\n\nWell, Huck and Jim they stared and stared, and didn’t know what to make of it. The duke he looked at him a minute, and then says:\n\n“You—you—you can’t mean it?” says he.\n\n“I can’t help it, sir,” says the old man, crying. “I am the unfortunate Louis the Seventeenth.”\n\n“You! At your age! No!” says the duke.\n\n“Trouble has done it, Bilgewater,” says the old man, with a groan; “trouble has done it; trouble has brung these gray hairs and this premature balditude. Yes, gentlemen, you see before you, in blue jeans and misery, the wanderin’, exiled, trampled-on, and sufferin’ rightful King of France.”\n\nWell, he was so ragged, and dirty, and old, and drunk, that he looked it, every bit of it, and that was the trouble. If he’d a had any dignity in him, his words would have sounded natural. But you couldn’t make anything out of him that way; and as for his clothes, well, they warn’t nothing, not hardly.\n\nHuck and Jim they felt very sorry for him, and proud, too, because they had a king aboard, though it warn’t a very grand one.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents a new exchange where the old man asks the duke \"Say, who are you?\" and the duke responds with his title, which is not present in the original.\n- The completion omits the entire latter portion of the original passage, including the reconciliation between the king and the duke, the king's advice about making the best of things, and the resulting improvement in the group's mood.\n- The completion ends abruptly, cutting off before the resolution and group dynamic described in the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the king's request for special treatment (such as being called \"Your Majesty,\" being waited on first at meals, and others kneeling before him), nor the group's response to these requests.\n- The passage lacks the description of how Jim and the narrator react emotionally to the king's story and their efforts to comfort him.\n- The completion omits the king's conciliatory speech to the duke about their shared situation and the importance of getting along on the raft.\n- The final reflection on the importance of harmony among the group on the raft is missing.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion introduces invented dialogue and questions not found in the original, such as the old man directly asking the duke about his identity.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the king's revelation and the duke's reaction are presented differently, and the emotional responses are not in the same order as in the original.\n- The completion attributes certain lines and emotional reactions to the wrong characters or presents them in a way that does not match the original structure.\n- The completion introduces a description of the old man's appearance and state (ragged, dirty, drunk) that is not present in the original passage at this point.\n\nTo improve, ensure the sequence of events and character interactions closely follow the original, avoid inventing new dialogue or scenes, and include all major developments and group dynamics described in the latter part of the passage."

Your Grace’ll take the shuck bed yourself.”\nJim and me was in a sweat again for a minute, being afraid there was going to be some more trouble amongst them; so we was pretty glad when the duke says:\n“’Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of oppression. Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit; I yield, I submit; ’tis my fate. I am alone in the world—let me suffer; I can bear it.”",

The wind sprung up and blowed strong, and the waves begun to get rough. We was in the canoe, and it felt mighty small and shaky out there on the big river. Jim looked worried, and I reckon I did too. The lightning got brighter and closer, and the thunder begun to rumble like a wagon going over a bridge a long ways off, but getting nearer every minute. The rain held off for a bit, but you could smell it coming, that damp, earthy smell. We paddled hard towards the Illinois shore, hoping to find some place to tie up and wait it out. The river was getting meaner by the second, tossing the canoe around like a chip. It was getting so dark you could hardly see the water, just the flashes of lightning showing the whitecaps. Jim said we had to get ashore quick, or we'd be swamped. My arms ached from paddling, but the fear of being caught in that storm on the open river made me keep going. The trees on the bank looked like black ghosts against the sky. We finally spotted a little cove, just big enough to pull the canoe into, and we scrambled ashore just as the first big drops of rain started to fall, heavy and cold. The thunder cracked right overhead, and the whole sky lit up like day for a second. We huddled under some thick bushes, shivering, and listened to the storm break loose. It was a powerful sight, and a scary one."

When we was three-quarters of a mile below we hoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o’clock it come on to rain and blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king told us to both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him and the duke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night. It was my watch below till twelve, but I wouldn’t a turned in anyway if I’d had a bed, because a body don’t see such a storm as that every day in the week, not by a long sight. My souls, how the wind did scream along! And every second or two there’d come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half a mile around, and you’d see the islands looking dusty through the rain, and the trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a h-whack!—bum! bum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum—and the thunder would go rumbling and grumbling away, and quit—and then rip comes another flash and another sockdolager. The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes, but I hadn’t any clothes on, and didn’t mind. We didn’t have no trouble about snags; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or that and miss them.\nI had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by that time, so Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me; he was always mighty good that way, Jim was. I crawled into the wigwam, but the king and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn’t no show for me; so I laid outside—I didn’t mind the rain, because it was warm, and the waves warn’t running so high now. About two they come up again, though, and Jim was going to call me; but he changed his mind, because he reckoned they warn’t high enough yet to do any harm; but he was mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a regular ripper and washed me overboard. It most killed Jim a-laughing. He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was, anyway.\nI took the watch, and Jim he laid down and snored away; and by-and-by the storm let up for good and all; and the first cabin-light that showed, I rousted him out and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the day.",

Then they got tired of it, and allowed they would “lay out a campaign,” as they called it. The duke went down into his carpet-bag, and fetched up a lot of little printed bills and read them out loud. One bill said, “The celebrated Dr. Armand de Montalban, of Paris,” would “lecture on the Science of Phrenology” at such and such a place, on the blank day of blank, at ten cents admission, and “furnish charts of character at twenty-five cents apiece.” The duke said that was him. In another bill he was the “world-renowned Shakespearian tragedian, Garrick the Younger, of Drury Lane, London.” In other bills he had a lot of other names and done other wonderful things, like finding water and gold with a “divining-rod,” “dissipating witch spells,” and so on. By-and-by he says:\n“But the histrionic muse is the darling. Have you ever trod the boards, Royalty?”\n“No,” says the king.\n“You shall, then, before you’re three days older, Fallen Grandeur,” says the duke. “The first good town we come to we’ll hire a hall and do the sword fight in Richard III. and the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet. How does that strike you?”\n“I’m in, up to the hub, for anything that will pay, Bilgewater; but, you see, I don’t know nothing about play-actin’, and hain’t ever seen much of it. I was too small when pap used to have ’em at the palace. Do you reckon you can learn me?”\n“Easy!”\n“All right. I’m jist a-freezn’ for something fresh, anyway. Le’s commence right away.”\nSo the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet was, and said he was used to being Romeo, so the king could be Juliet.\n“But if Juliet’s such a young gal, duke, my peeled head and my white whiskers is goin’ to look oncommon odd on her, maybe.”\n“No, don’t you worry; these country jakes won’t ever think of that. Besides, you know, you’ll be in costume, and that makes all the difference in the world; Juliet’s in a balcony, enjoying the moonlight before she goes to bed, and she’s got on her night-gown and her ruffled nightcap. Here are the costumes for the parts.”\nHe got out two or three curtain-calico suits, which he said was meedyevil armor for Richard III. and t’other chap, and a long white cotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match. The king was satisfied; so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the most splendid spread-eagle way, prancing around and acting at the same time, to show how it had got to be done; then he give the book to the king and told him to get his part by heart.",

He allowed he'd been in the show business all his life, and he'd got bills printed to prove it. He pulled out a roll of them and showed them. One said, \"The celebrated Dr. Armand de Montalban, of Paris, will deliver his great lecture on the Science of Phrenology, at the Court House to-night, at 7 o'clock.

He said they had some old clothes in the bundle that would do for costumes. He got out a book and found the scene, and he read it out loud, showing the king how to stand and how to say the lines.

There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with branches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles of watermelons and green corn and such-like truck.\nThe preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they was bigger and held crowds of people. The benches was made out of outside slabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into for legs. They didn’t have no backs. The preachers had high platforms to stand on at one end of the sheds. The women had on sun-bonnets; and some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a few of the young ones had on calico. Some of the young men was barefooted, and some of the children didn’t have on any clothes but just a tow-linen shirt. Some of the old women was knitting, and some of the young folks was courting on the sly.\nThe first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn. He lined out two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it, there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; then he lined out two more for them to sing—and so on. The people woke up more and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end some begun to groan, and some begun to shout. Then the preacher begun to preach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side of the platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the front of it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and shouting his words out with all his might; and every now and then he would hold up his Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way and that, shouting, “It’s the brazen serpent in the wilderness! Look upon it and live!” And people would shout out, “Glory!—A-a-men!” And so he went on, and the people groaning and crying and saying amen:\n“Oh, come to the mourners’ bench! come, black with sin! (amen!) come, sick and sore! (amen!) come, lame and halt and blind! (amen!) come, pore and needy, sunk in shame! (a-a-men!) come, all that’s worn and soiled and suffering!—come with a broken spirit! come with a contrite heart! come in your rags and sin and dirt! the waters that cleanse is free, the door of heaven stands open—oh, enter in and be at rest!” (a-a-men! glory, glory hallelujah!)\nAnd so on. You couldn’t make out what the preacher said any more, on account of the shouting and crying. Folks got up everywheres in the crowd, and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners’ bench, with the tears running down their faces; and when all the mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd, they sung and shouted and flung themselves down on the straw, just crazy and wild.",

Then somebody sings out, “Take up a collection for him, take up a collection!” Well, a half a dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out, “Let him pass the hat around!” Then everybody said it, the preacher too.\nSo the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes, and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being so good to the poor pirates away off there; and every little while the prettiest kind of girls, with the tears running down their cheeks, would up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by; and he always done it; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or six times—and he was invited to stay a week; and everybody wanted him to live in their houses, and said they’d think it was an honor; but he said as this was the last day of the camp-meeting he couldn’t do no good, and besides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to work on the pirates.\nWhen we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had collected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents. And then he had fetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under a wagon when he was starting home through the woods.

He said he was a poor, lost lamb, and he wanted to be took into the fold. He cried and sobbed, and the tears run down his face, and he shook all over. The people they was all stirred up, and some of the women was crying too. The preacher he was mighty pleased, and he kep’ a-saying, “Bless your poor old heart,” and things like that. The king he went on a-telling how he’d been a-roaming the seas, and a-robbing and a-murdering, and how he’d buried treasure, and how he’d been in storms and shipwrecks, and all sorts of awful things. He laid it on thick, you bet. He said he’d come ashore to get religion, and he was going to live a new life, and he hoped the good people would help him along. He said he was broke, and hadn’t a cent in the world, and he needed a little something to start him off right. Then he got down on his knees and prayed, and he prayed awful loud and long, and he groaned and moaned, and he looked like he was suffering terrible. The people they was all melted, and they begun to pull out their handkerchiefs and wipe their eyes. The duke he was standing by the door, and he had a hat in his hand, and when the king got done praying, the duke he stepped up and said he’d pass the hat around for the poor old repentant pirate. And the people they just piled in the money. They give him quarters, and halves, and even some dollars. Some of the women they give him their rings and things. It was a sight to see. The duke he collected it all up, and he give it to the king, and the king he put it in his pocket, and he looked like he was going to faint for joy. They got a good haul, you can bet on that. I reckon they got nigh on to eighty dollars. As soon as they got the money, the king he said he felt a heap better, and he thanked the people, and him and the duke they slipped out the back way whilst the preacher was still a-talking about the wonderful conversion. We got back to the raft, and they was mighty tickled with theirselves. The king he counted the money, and he was chuckling and slapping the duke on the back. They said it was the easiest money they ever made. I didn’t say nothing, but I thought it was a mighty mean trick to play on them poor simple country people. But that’s the way they done, them two frauds. Always a-looking for a chance to skin somebody."

And he had got in ten dollars’ worth of advertisements for the paper, which he said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance—so they done it. The price of the paper was two dollars a year, but he took in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them paying him in advance; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as usual, but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the price as low as he could afford it, and was going to run it for cash. He set up a little piece of poetry, which he made, himself, out of his own head—three verses—kind of sweet and saddish—the name of it was, “Yes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart”—and he left that all set up and ready to print in the paper, and didn’t charge nothing for it. Well, he took in nine dollars and a half, and said he’d done a pretty square day’s work for it.\nThen he showed us another little job he’d printed and hadn’t charged for, because it was for us. It had a picture of a runaway nigger with a bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and “$200 reward” under it. The reading was all about Jim, and just described him to a dot. It said he run away from St. Jacques’ plantation, forty mile below New Orleans, last winter, and likely went north, and whoever would catch him and send him back he could have the reward and expenses.\n“Now,” says the duke, “after to-night we can run in the daytime if we want to. Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and foot with a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we captured him up the river, and were too poor to travel on a steamboat, so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down to get the reward. Handcuffs and chains would look still better on Jim, but it wouldn’t go well with the story of us being so poor. Too much like jewelry. Ropes are the correct thing—we must preserve the unities, as we say on the boards.”",

When he got through he counted up his money and it stood three dollars and twenty-five cents. The duke had been fishing and hadn’t catched nothing, consequently he felt pretty glum and low. The king felt perky and fine. But presently he begun to get sorrowful; said that last place he’d come from was the meanest place he ever see; said they had pocket-piles of money, and said not a single one of them was willing to stand a show.

He said he’d been doing a pretty fair business as a doctor, and considering how lively business was, considered he’d come out pretty well. When he got through he counted up his money and it stood three dollars and twenty-five cents. The duke had been fishing and hadn’t catched nothing, consequently he felt pretty glum and low. The king felt perky and fine. But presently he begun to get sorrowful; said that last place he’d come from was the meanest place he ever see; said they had pocket-piles of money, and said not a single one of them was willing to stand a show. He said it made him feel so bad to see a lot of people with so much cash, and so little generorisity. Says he: “This ain’t no healthy place for me, after all’s told. If I got to be here I’ll druther steal it, and I druther not steal it; consequently I b’lieve I’ll light out. I ain’t agoing back there, anyway.” The duke said, “Well, your wants is many, and you can’t supply none of them yourself. You got to have somebody to do it for you; and it’s right here. All you got to do is to say the word, and I’ll fill the bill. He said, “Well, I don’t know; maybe it’s so, maybe it ain’t. I b’lieve I’ll think it over.” The duke said, “You better, because money is scarce, and I’m going to have some before long. I’ve been doing pretty well to-day myself. I’ve raked in ten dollars and fifty cents, and I ain’t done yet. I’ve got a job here that’ll fetch a hundred dollars, if it ain’t more. I’m going to print a handbill here in a minute, and I’ll show you.” He set up the handbill, and printed it. It was a picture of a runaway nigger, with a reward of two hundred dollars for him. The picture was a good likeness of Jim, and the description was all right, too. The duke said, “There, now, that’ll fetch a hundred dollars, sure. I’m going to take that and go down to the next town and post it up, and then I’ll come back and we’ll go down to the next town and post it up, and so on, till we get to New Orleans. Then we’ll take the nigger and collect the reward.” The king said, “Well, I don’t know; maybe it’s so, maybe it ain’t.

Come, all three of us. Le’s stretch out here on the raft, and see if we can’t go to sleep.\" Well, the river was brown and ripply, and the sun was blazing down on it, and light was sparkling on the water, and it was a beautiful day. We all stretched out on the raft, and pretty soon we was all asleep. I don’t know how long we slept, but when we woke up, the sun was away up in the sky, and it was getting hot. The King and the Duke was setting up, and they was looking at each other, and they was smiling. \"Well,\" says the King, \"I reckon we’ve had a good rest. Now, what do you say we do something?\" \"All right,\" says the Duke, \"what ’ll we do?\" \"I don’t know,\" says the King. \"What do you propose?\" \"Well,\" says the Duke, \"I reckon we ought to have a little recreation.

Ah, it’s sublime, sublime! Always fetches the house. I haven’t got it in the book—I’ve only got one volume—but I reckon I can piece it out from memory. I’ll just walk up and down a minute, and see if I can call it back from recollection’s vaults.”\nSo he went to marching up and down, thinking, and frowning horrible every now and then; then he would hoist up his eyebrows; next he would squeeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan; next he would sigh, and next he’d let on to drop a tear.

Then he strikes a most noble attitude, with one leg shoved forwards, and his arms stretched away up, and his head tilted back, looking up at the sky; and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth; and after that, all through his speech, he howled, and spread around, and swelled up his chest, and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever I see before. This is the speech—I learned it, easy enough, while he was learning it to the king:\nTo be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin\nThat makes calamity of so long life;\nFor who would fardels bear, till Birnam Wood do come to Dunsinane,\nBut that the fear of something after death\nMurders the innocent sleep,\nGreat nature’s second course,\nAnd makes us rather sling the arrows of outrageous fortune\nThan fly to others that we know not of.\nThere’s the respect must give us pause:\nWake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst;\nFor who would bear the whips and scorns of time,\nThe oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,\nThe law’s delay, and the quietus which his pangs might take.\nIn the dead waste and middle of the night, when churchyards yawn\nIn customary suits of solemn black,\nBut that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns,\nBreathes forth contagion on the world,\nAnd thus the native hue of resolution, like the poor cat i’ the adage,\nIs sicklied o’er with care.\nAnd all the clouds that lowered o’er our housetops,\nWith this regard their currents turn awry,\nAnd lose the name of action.\n’Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished.\nBut soft you, the fair Ophelia:\nOpe not thy ponderous and marble jaws.\nBut get thee to a nunnery—go!\nWell, the old man he liked that speech, and he mighty soon got it so he could do it first rate.

The stores are right along the river, and are mighty old and rickety. If there’s dirt on the floor, the dogs and the hogs and the chickens and the cattle stroll in and root and scratch and dust themselves and lie down and go to sleep right in the middle of the way. If a cow comes onto the porch, she goes to the door and stands there and waits for somebody to come and drive her out. It’s a pretty ornery place.\n\nThe duke and the king they surveyed the town, and the duke says:\n\n“Well, I’ve been in worse towns than this to put on a show. I ain’t discouraged. But there’s them circus bills to contend with, and them warn’t here before. What we want is an empty house, and we want it quick, and we want it cheap. Come on; le’s go and see the mayor.”\n\nSo they went to the mayor’s, and mayor he had never heard of them circus people, and said that that was the trouble with them circus folks, they always come in unannounced, and didn’t pay any license fee; and the town was agoin’ to fix them; but nobody didn’t know where they was going to be next. He said they had been there that day, and they was agoin’ to perform that night; and the house was jammed, wall to wall, with people, which was very unusual for that town. He said he had been to the show, and it was the best circus he had ever seen; and he was sorry it was going to leave that night. He said he wished he could see it again. He said there was a show coming to town the next night, but he didn’t know what it was. He said he hoped it was a good one, because the town needed something to stir it up. He said he was willing to do anything he could to help them out, and he would",

            "The group then wandered through the town, taking in its general state of disrepair.",
            "Huck noted that the stores and houses were predominantly old, unpainted wooden structures, elevated on stilts to protect against river flooding. Their gardens appeared neglected, primarily cultivating weeds, sunflowers, and accumulating debris like ash-piles and old discarded items.",
            "The fences were haphazardly constructed from various types of boards added at different times, leaning in multiple directions, and often equipped with only a single leather hinge for a gate. Some bore faint remnants of whitewash, which the Duke humorously suggested dated back to Columbus's era.",
            "Hogs were a common sight in gardens, with residents frequently attempting to shoo them away.",
            "All the town's stores were situated along a single street, featuring white fabric awnings in front, where country visitors would tie their horses.",
            "Under these awnings, idle men, referred to as loafers, spent their days perched on empty dry-goods boxes, whittling wood with Barlow knives, chewing tobacco, and exhibiting general lethargy through yawning and stretching—a rather uncouth assembly.",
            "These men typically wore wide-brimmed yellow straw hats but no coats or waistcoats, addressed each other by familiar names like Bill, Buck, Hank, Joe, and Andy, spoke in a slow, lazy drawl, and used a considerable amount of profanity.",
            "Nearly every awning-post had a loafer leaning against it, usually with hands in pockets, except when retrieving tobacco or scratching.",
            "Huck described their conversations, highlighting the frequent requests to borrow chewing tobacco, often accompanied by false claims about having just given away their last piece.",
            "He detailed the ritual of sharing tobacco, where a borrower would gnaw off a piece from a plug, sometimes to the feigned dismay of the owner.",
            "The town's streets and alleys were entirely composed of mud, deep and black in places, and universally present.",
            "Hogs were ubiquitous, lounging and grunting throughout the town. A common sight was a muddy sow with her piglets leisurely occupying a walkway, forcing people to detour, while she appeared contentedly nursing her young.",
            "This tranquility would often be broken by a loafer inciting a dog to chase the sow, leading to a chaotic pursuit that amused the onlookers, who would then resettle until the next diversion, such as a dog fight.",
            "The narrator observed that nothing animated the loafers as much as a dog fight, unless it was a cruel prank like setting fire to a stray dog or tying a tin pan to its tail.",
            "Some houses along the riverfront were precariously situated, leaning and appearing ready to collapse into the water due to erosion, though some were still inhabited despite the danger.",
            "The town was in a constant state of retreat as the river relentlessly eroded its banks."

          "text_segment": "Then we went loafing around the town. The stores and houses was most all old shackly dried-up frame concerns that hadn’t ever been painted; they was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts, so as to be out of reach of the water when the river was overflowed. The houses had little gardens around them, but they didn’t seem to raise hardly anything in them but jimpson weeds, and sunflowers, and ash-piles, and old curled-up boots and shoes, and pieces of bottles, and rags, and played-out tin-ware. The fences was made of different kinds of boards, nailed on at different times; and they leaned every which-way, and had gates that didn’t generly have but one hinge—a leather one. Some of the fences had been whitewashed, some time or another, but the duke said it was in Clumbus’s time, like enough. There was generly hogs in the garden, and people driving them out.\nAll the stores was along one street. They had white domestic awnings in front, and the country people hitched their horses to the awning-posts. There was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings, and loafers roosting on them all day long, whittling them with their Barlow knives; and chawing tobacco, and gaping and yawning and stretching—a mighty ornery lot. They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella, but didn’t wear no coats nor waistcoats, they called one another Bill, and Buck, and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and talked lazy and drawly, and used considerable many cuss words. There was as many as one loafer leaning up against every awning-post, and he most always had his hands in his britches-pockets, except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw of tobacco or scratch. What a body was hearing amongst them all the time was:\n“Gimme a chaw ’v tobacker, Hank.”\n“Cain’t; I hain’t got but one chaw left. Ask Bill.”\nMaybe Bill he gives him a chaw; maybe he lies and says he ain’t got none. Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world, nor a chaw of tobacco of their own. They get all their chawing by borrowing; they say to a fellow, “I wisht you’d len’ me a chaw, Jack, I jist this minute give Ben Thompson the last chaw I had”—which is a lie pretty much everytime; it don’t fool nobody but a stranger; but Jack ain’t no stranger, so he says:\n“You give him a chaw, did you? So did your sister’s cat’s grandmother. You pay me back the chaws you’ve awready borry’d off’n me, Lafe Buckner, then I’ll loan you one or two ton of it, and won’t charge you no back intrust, nuther.”\n“Well, I did pay you back some of it wunst.”\n“Yes, you did—’bout six chaws. You borry’d store tobacker and paid back nigger-head.”\nStore tobacco is flat black plug, but these fellows mostly chaws the natural leaf twisted. When they borrow a chaw they don’t generly cut it off with a knife, but set the plug in between their teeth, and gnaw with their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in two; then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it when it’s handed back, and says, sarcastic:\n“Here, gimme the chaw, and you take the plug.”\nAll the streets and lanes was just mud; they warn’t nothing else but mud—mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places, and two or three inches deep in all the places. The hogs loafed and grunted around everywheres. You’d see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way, where folks had to walk around her, and she’d stretch out and shut her eyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her, and look as happy as if she was on salary. And pretty soon you’d hear a loafer sing out, “Hi! so boy! sick him, Tige!” and away the sow would go, squealing most horrible, with a dog or two swinging to each ear, and three or four dozen more a-coming; and then you would see all the loafers get up and watch the thing out of sight, and laugh at the fun and look grateful for the noise. Then they’d settle back again till there was a dog fight. There couldn’t anything wake them up all over, and make them happy all over, like a dog fight—unless it might be putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him, or tying a tin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death.\nOn the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank, and they was bowed and bent, and about ready to tumble in. The people had moved out of them. The bank was caved away under one corner of some others, and that corner was hanging over. People lived in them yet, but it was dangersome, because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house caves in at a time. Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the river in one summer. Such a town as that has to be always moving back, and back, and back, because the river’s always gnawing at it.",

            "prefix-probing": "Then we went loafing around the town. It was a powerful hot day, the kind that makes the dust lay thick on everything and the air shimmer over the roofs like water. We didn't have nothing particular to do, which suited me just fine. Tom, he was always looking for something to make a fuss about, some adventure or another, but sometimes just drifting along and seeing things was good enough for me. We ambled down to the river landing first, watching the steamboats come and go. There was a big one just pulling out, churning the water all white and foamy behind her, and the deck hands singing out and the passengers waving handkerchiefs. It always made me feel a bit restless, seeing them boats heading off to places I'd never seen, but mostly I just liked the noise and the stir. The smell of the river was strong, muddy and fishy, mixed with the coal smoke from the stacks. We sat on a pile of lumber for a spell, whittling on sticks and watching the niggers load cotton bales. They sweated powerful, their backs shining, and the overseer stood there with a whip, though he wasn't using it just then. It made you feel lazy just watching them work so hard in the heat. After that, we drifted up into the main street. It wasn't a very big town, but it had all the usual things – the general store, the blacksmith shop, the church, the tavern, and a few houses scattered around. The street was mostly dirt, packed hard in the middle but dusty on the sides. There was a dog sleeping right in the middle of the road, didn't even lift his head when a wagon rumbled by. Just twitched an ear. We stopped outside the general store for a bit. Old Mr. Silas was inside, talking to Judge Thatcher. You could hear their voices rumbling through the open door, talking about crops and politics and such. There was a barrel of crackers outside, and a big cheese under a netting, and the smell of molasses and calico and plug tobacco came drifting out. It was a good smell, the smell of a store. We didn't go in, just hung around the porch, kicking at the dust and watching the folks go by. There wasn't many folks out, it being so hot, but you'd see a woman hurrying along with a basket, or a farmer riding in on his horse, or a couple of loafers leaning against the wall of the tavern, spitting tobacco juice and talking low. Tom, he pointed out old Widow Douglas's house up on the hill, looking all proper and sivilized with its white paint and green shutters. He said something about how she was always trying to make people behave themselves, and I just grunted. I knew all about that. We walked past the blacksmith shop, the hammer ringing out like a bell and the sparks flying when he hit the hot iron. It was fascinating to watch, the way he could shape the metal, but it was too hot to stand there long. We went down towards the creek then, hoping to maybe catch a crawdad or two, but the water was low and muddy. We saw some other boys down there, swimming in a hole, but we didn't join them. Just watched for a bit. One of them yelled something at us, but we didn't pay him no mind. We climbed up the bank and walked along the edge of the woods for a spell, kicking at roots and listening to the birds. Tom was telling me about some plan he had for digging for treasure, but I wasn't paying much attention. My mind was just sort of drifting, taking in the smells of the woods – the damp earth, the pine needles, the sweet smell of honeysuckle. We came back into town near the schoolhouse. It was empty, of course, school being out for the summer. Looked quiet and lonely. I never did like school much. Too much sitting still and learning things that didn't seem to matter. We ended up back near the river landing as the sun started to dip lower in the sky, painting the clouds all orange and pink. The heat wasn't quite so bad then, and more people were starting to come out. You could hear laughter from the tavern and the sound of a fiddle playing somewhere. We saw Jim down by the levee, talking to some other slaves. He waved at us, and we waved back. Jim was a good nigger. Always kind. We didn't go talk to him though, just kept on loafing. We watched the ferry boat cross the river, carrying wagons and people and livestock. It looked peaceful, gliding across the water. We talked a bit about maybe going fishing later, or maybe just sleeping out under the stars. It didn't much matter what we did, as long as we didn't have to be anywhere special or do anything we didn't want to. Loafing was good. It was the best way to spend a hot afternoon in a little river town. Just watching the world go by, not a care in the world, except maybe wondering what was for supper. We saw the doctor ride by in his buggy, looking important. Saw the minister walking slow, with his hands clasped behind his back, probably thinking about his sermon. Saw the town drunk stumbling out of the tavern, looking like he'd had a powerful good time, or a powerful bad one, depending on how you looked at it. We didn't talk much, me and Tom, just sort of ambled along, side by side, taking it all in"

He says to Boggs, mighty ca’m and slow—he says:\n“I’m tired of this, but I’ll endure it till one o’clock. Till one o’clock, mind—no longer. If you open your mouth against me only once after that time you can’t travel so far but I will find you.”\nThen he turns and goes in. The crowd looked mighty sober; nobody stirred, and there warn’t no more laughing.

Some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up, but he wouldn’t; they told him it would be one o’clock in about fifteen minutes, and so he must go home—he must go right away. But it didn’t do no good. He cussed away with all his might, and throwed his hat down in the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away he went a-raging down the street again, with his gray hair a-flying.

INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately describes the initial scene as a crowd escorting Boggs in a celebratory manner, rather than the more subdued and uneasy approach in the original.\n- The sequence of events is altered: in the completion, Sherburn appears before Boggs stops, whereas in the original, Sherburn calls out after Boggs is already being hurried along.\n- The completion attributes more dialogue and characterization to Boggs than is present in the original passage.\n- The description of Sherburn's actions and posture with the pistol is not accurate to the original sequence.\n- The completion has Sherburn pausing to look at Boggs after the shooting, which is not in the original, and adds a location (his store) for Sherburn's exit, which is not specified in the original."

About ten minutes after that—in fact, it was nigh onto eleven—I seen a man come a-lurching along, and two men with him, one on each side, and they was hurrying him along. He was bare-headed, and staggering, and looking uneasy, but not resisting—he was helping them hurry him right along. He warn't drunk, but he was scared, and white as a sheet. He warn't on his horse this time. It was Boggs.\n\nAll of a sudden, a voice calls out, \"Boggs!\"\n\nI looked and seen Colonel Sherburn standing perfectly still in the street, holding a long pistol in his right hand, the barrel pointing straight up in the air. It warn't aimed, but it was there. At the same second I seen a young girl tearing down the street, and two men with her.\n\nBoggs and the men with him stopped and turned around to see who it was. When they seen Sherburn with the pistol, the two men that was with Boggs jumped to one side.\n\nSherburn slowly and deliberately lowered the pistol till it was level with Boggs's breast, and the barrel come down slow and steady to a level, and both barrels cocked.\n\nBoggs throwed up both of his hands and says, \"O Lord, don't shoot!\"\n\nBang! goes the first shot, and he staggered back, clawing at the air—Bang! goes the second one, and he come a-tumbling down, heavy and solid, and his arms spread out.\n\nThe young girl screamed, and she come a-rushing and throwed herself down on her father, crying, \"Oh, he's killed! he's killed!\"\n\nThe crowd closed in around them, and they was all a-shouldering and a-jamming and a-craning their necks to see, and the people on the inside was trying to shove 'em back and saying, \"Back, back! Give him air! Give him air!\"\n\nColonel Sherburn he tossed the pistol down on the ground, and turned on his heel and walked away.\n```",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the initial detail about the time that passes before Boggs reappears, which is present in the original. This affects the pacing and buildup of the scene.\n- The completion invents a description of Boggs's hair being all over his face, which is not present in the original passage.\n- The completion adds a statement identifying the young girl as Boggs's daughter, which is not explicitly stated in the original at this point.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The specific time interval between the narrator stopping and Boggs reappearing is missing from the early part of the completion.\n- The completion does not include the detail that Boggs is not on his horse when he reappears.\n- The original includes a description of the pistol not being aimed but held with the barrel tilted up, which is not fully captured in the completion.\n- The completion omits the detail that the pistol-barrel comes down slow and steady to a level, which is a key moment in the sequence.\n- The completion does not mention that both barrels are cocked at the moment the pistol is leveled.\n- The original describes Boggs falling backwards onto the ground, heavy and solid, with his arms spread out, which is only partially captured in the completion.\n- The completion omits the crowd's reaction of shouldering and jamming one another, and the specific phrase about people on the inside trying to shove them back and shouting for air.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion gives an inaccurate sense of timing by saying \"in a minute\" instead of the more precise interval in the original.\n- The sequence of events is slightly altered: the completion has the men with Boggs stop and turn around before seeing Sherburn, whereas the original has them turn after hearing Sherburn call out.\n- The completion attributes the young girl as Boggs's daughter, which is not specified in the original at this point.\n- The completion has Sherburn stand for a second before tossing the pistol, whereas the original has him toss the pistol immediately after the crowd closes in.\n- The completion changes the crowd's dialogue, omitting the repeated command to \"back, back!\" and the urgency of giving air."

Sherburn run his eye slow along the crowd; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to out-gaze him, but they couldn’t; they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky. Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed; not the pleasant kind, but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread that’s got sand in it.\nThen he says, slow and scornful:\n“The idea of you lynching anybody! It’s amusing. The idea of you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a man! Because you’re brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come along here, did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a man? Why, a man’s safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind—as long as it’s daytime and you’re not behind him.\n“Do I know you? I know you clear through. I was born and raised in the South, and I’ve lived in the North; so I know the average all around. The average man’s a coward. In the North he lets anybody walk over him that wants to, and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it. In the South one man all by himself, has stopped a stage full of men in the daytime, and robbed the lot. Your newspapers call you a brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other people—whereas you’re just as brave, and no braver. Why don’t your juries hang murderers? Because they’re afraid the man’s friends will shoot them in the back, in the dark—and it’s just what they would do.\n“So they always acquit; and then a man goes in the night, with a hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal. Your mistake is, that you didn’t bring a man with you; that’s one mistake, and the other is that you didn’t come in the dark and fetch your masks. You brought part of a man—Buck Harkness, there—and if you hadn’t had him to start you, you’d a taken it out in blowing.\n“You didn’t want to come. The average man don’t like trouble and danger. You don’t like trouble and danger. But if only half a man—like Buck Harkness, there—shouts ‘Lynch him! lynch him!’ you’re afraid to back down—afraid you’ll be found out to be what you are—cowards—and so you raise a yell, and hang yourselves on to that half-a-man’s coat-tail, and come raging up here, swearing what big things you’re going to do. The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that’s what an army is—a mob; they don’t fight with courage that’s born in them, but with courage that’s borrowed from their mass, and from their officers. But a mob without any man at the head of it is beneath pitifulness. Now the thing for you to do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole. If any real lynching’s going to be done, it will be done in the dark, Southern fashion; and when they come they’ll bring their masks, and fetch a man along. Now leave—and take your half-a-man with you”—tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this.",

The ring-master couldn’t ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he ever could think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what I couldn’t noway understand. Why, I couldn’t a thought of them in a year. And by-and-by a drunk man tried to get into the ring—said he wanted to ride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was. They argued and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn’t listen, and the whole show come to a standstill. Then the people begun to holler at him and make fun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so that stirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the benches and swarm towards the ring, saying, “Knock him down! throw him out!” and one or two women begun to scream. So, then, the ring-master he made a little speech, and said he hoped there wouldn’t be no disturbance, and if the man would promise he wouldn’t make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse. So everybody laughed and said all right, and the man got on. The minute he was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around, with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and the drunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air every jump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears rolled down. And at last, sure enough, all the circus men could do, the horse broke loose, and away he went like the very nation, round and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side, and then t’other one on t’other side, and the people just crazy. It warn’t funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger. But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle, a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a-going like a house afire too. He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable as if he warn’t ever drunk in his life—and then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them. He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he was, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly hum—and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to the dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and astonishment.\nThen the ring-master he see how he had been fooled, and he was the sickest ring-master you ever see, I reckon. Why, it was one of his own men! He had got up that joke all out of his own head, and never let on to nobody.

They most busted the door down, right at the start. Then the duke he went out on the stage and bowed, all dignified and grand, and said he would 'address the house briefly.' He said he was humble to see so many friends of the drama there, and said it showed how deep their love of the drama was, away up there toward the North Pole, drat that name, anyway, said he, no offense intended, certainly, only it warn't the name they called it by down South. And he said they got here just in time, because a slight indisposition had attacked him—he was not well, he said, but he would drat it all, be true to his principles and perform or die in the attempt—least he would if the house was satisfactory to him. He said that was the main thing—'satisfactory house'—and he hoped they would all do him the justice to say the house WAS satisfactory. He said not another living soul but himself and his brother—him and the king, of course—was furnished in the costumes, as they were so particular about the genuineness of them; and so the tragedy they would drayma-tize was the world-renowned Shaksperean drayma of The Royal Nonesuch; that they would play it through, fair and square, for the benefit of science and art; that he would though his brother was the celebrated Edmund Kean the elder, he himself would personally appear in the title role. And he concluded by saying, 'If you call that a satisfactory house, I don't know what you do call it.'\n\nThe house was satisfactory; they said it was. Then he bowed again, and told them to get ready for the intellectual feast. Said when the curtain rose they would behold Othello the Moor, in his splendidest costume, which was the short as it was gorgeous, the duke himself had composed it, designed it, and every female in New Orleans had a dressmaker struck dead with envy when she seen it. Said he did it all by himself. Then he brought in a little old stove, and lit a candle and put it on the back of it, and put one more on the floor, and then he opened the curtain and stood aside.\n\nWell, what do you think? The king he come a-prancing out on all fours, naked; and he was painted all over, ring-streaked-and-striped, all sorts of colors, as splendid as a rainbow. And—but never mind the rest of his outfit, it was just wild, but it was awful funny. The people most killed themselves laughing; and when the king got done prancing, and capered off behind the curtain, they roared and stomped and whistled and clapped till they got out of breath and couldn't make no more noise. Then the duke he shoves the curtain open and the king he prances out again; and done it three times, and it was better every time, and mighty lively, and funny. Then he bowed in the most dignified way, and says:\n\n'Ladies and gentlemen, I would explain that that was only a part of the tragedy of The Royal Nonesuch. I will now proceed to enact it all. I beg of you to give me your undivided attention.'\n\nThen he went off the stage, and presently he come back, dressed up in a long white shirt and a night-cap, and a long beard; and he says:\n\n'I am the ghost of the murdered king!'\n\nAnd then he went on and done the ghost in Hamlet—that is, in two or three acts of it, which the duke said was all that was necessary to get the spirit of the thing. He done it pretty good, too, considering. He was a mighty good mimic; and he done the ghost as solemn as a church. But the people didn't seem to care for it much. They was all expecting something else, I reckon.

They most busted the door down, right at the start. Then the duke he went out on the stage and bowed, all dignified and grand, and said he would 'address the house briefly.' He said he was humble to see so many friends of the drama there, and said it showed how deep their love of the drama was, away up there toward the North Pole, drat that name, anyway, said he, no offense intended, certainly, only it warn't the name they called it by down South. And he said they got here just in time, because a slight indisposition had attacked him—he was not well, he said, but he would drat it all, be true to his principles and perform or die in the attempt—least he would if the house was satisfactory to him. He said that was the main thing—'satisfactory house'—and he hoped they would all do him the justice to say the house WAS satisfactory. He said not another living soul but himself and his brother—him and the king, of course—was furnished in the costumes, as they were so particular about the genuineness of them; and so the tragedy they would drayma-tize was the world-renowned Shaksperean drayma of The Royal Nonesuch; that they would play it through, fair and square, for the benefit of science and art; that he would though his brother was the celebrated Edmund Kean the elder, he himself would personally appear in the title role. And he concluded by saying, 'If you call that a satisfactory house, I don't know what you do call it.'\n\nThe house was satisfactory; they said it was. Then he bowed again, and told them to get ready for the intellectual feast. Said when the curtain rose they would behold Othello the Moor, in his splendidest costume, which was the short as it was gorgeous, the duke himself had composed it, designed it, and every female in New Orleans had a dressmaker struck dead with envy when she seen it. Said he did it all by himself. Then he brought in a little old stove, and lit a candle and put it on the back of it, and put one more on the floor, and then he opened the curtain and stood aside.\n\nWell, what do you think? The king he come a-prancing out on all fours, naked; and he was painted all over, ring-streaked-and-striped, all sorts of colors, as splendid as a rainbow. And—but never mind the rest of his outfit, it was just wild, but it was awful funny. The people most killed themselves laughing; and when the king got done prancing, and capered off behind the curtain, they roared and stomped and whistled and clapped till they got out of breath and couldn't make no more noise. Then the duke he shoves the curtain open and the king he prances out again; and done it three times, and it was better every time, and mighty lively, and funny. Then he bowed in the most dignified way, and says:\n\n'Ladies and gentlemen, I would explain that that was only a part of the tragedy of The Royal Nonesuch. I will now proceed to enact it all. I beg of you to give me your undivided attention.'\n\nThen he went off the stage, and presently he come back, dressed up in a long white shirt and a night-cap, and a long beard; and he says:\n\n'I am the ghost of the murdered king!'\n\nAnd then he went on and done the ghost in Hamlet—that is, in two or three acts of it, which the duke said was all that was necessary to get the spirit of the thing.

The Royal Nonesuch is a tragedy, you understand. I am the ghost of the murdered king, and I am here to tell you that I was murdered by my brother, and I want you to avenge my death.' He said that was the whole thing. Twenty people sung out: 'Sold!' and they rose up mad, and was a-going for that stage and them actors. But a big, fine-looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts: 'Hold on, everybody! Don't do nothing rash! I know what you're a-thinking. You're a-thinking you've been sold—and so you have. I ain't denying it. But what you want to do is to go home quiet, and spread around that it ain't any account, and that it's the blamedest fraud that ever was. That's what you want to do.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents a lengthy introduction and speech by the duke that is not present in the original, including invented dialogue, explanations about the play, and references to costumes and Shakespearean drama.\n- There is an invented sequence involving the king performing as the ghost from Hamlet, with costume changes and additional performances, which does not occur in the original passage.\n- The completion omits the entire final section of the original, where the audience realizes they have been tricked, their reaction, and the speech by the man who convinces them to keep quiet and trick the rest of the town.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the sequence where the duke raises the audience's expectations with a speech about the tragedy and the actor who will play the main part.\n- The moment when the king appears in his outlandish costume and the audience's reaction is only partially present; the repetition of the king's act at the audience's demand is not fully captured.\n- The completion omits the critical aftermath: the audience's realization of the trick, their anger, the intervention by another audience member, and the plan to keep the trick secret and bring in more townspeople.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces inaccurate details about the duke's speech, including invented references to the North Pole, the drama's title, and the nature of the costumes.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the king's performance is followed by invented additional acts and costume changes, which do not occur in the original.\n- The completion repeats certain invented lines and actions, such as the king's ghost performance, which are not part of the original passage.\n- The audience's reaction is inaccurately portrayed, focusing on confusion and lack of interest rather than the uproar and subsequent plan described in the original.\n\nOverall, the completion should avoid inventing new speeches, scenes, and performances, and should ensure that the key sequence of audience reaction and the plan to trick the rest of the town is included."

He bowed awful low, and then he started to spout. He said he was goin' to give 'em the celebrated \"Balcony Scene\" from \"Romeo and Juliet.\" He begun to rip and to roar and to gesticulate like a crazy person, but it warn't no Shakespeare that ever I heard tell of. It was all mixed up and garbled, and he'd forget his lines and make up stuff, and sometimes he'd stop and scratch his head. The audience was quiet at first, tryin' to make head or tail of it, but pretty soon they begun to stir and whisper. Then the king he come out. He was dressed in a calico dress, and a sunbonnet, and he had a long string of onions around his neck. He was supposed to be Juliet. He was old and fat and drunk, and he wobbled out onto the stage and begun to say his lines in a high, squeaky voice. It was the most ridicklous thing I ever see. The men in the audience they just stared for a minute, like they couldn't believe their eyes. Then one man begun to snicker, and then another, and pretty soon the whole house was laughin' and yellin'. They begun to throw things – rotten cabbages and dead cats and whatever else they had handy. The duke he seen it was a failure, and he stepped forward and held up his hand. He yelled over the noise, \"Gentlemen! Gentlemen! This is just a rehearsal! We ain't had time to practice! Tomorrow night, we'll give you the real thing! The 'Royal Nonesuch'! It's a tragedy, a scream, a laugh, a tear! It's everything! And it only lasts five minutes!\" Well, that quieted 'em down some. They was mad, but they was also curious about this 'Royal Nonesuch' that only lasted five minutes. They figured they'd been swindled, but maybe this five-minute show would be worth somethin'. So they grumbled and swore, but they didn't tear the place down. The duke and the king they bowed and scraped and got off the stage quick as they could, and the crowd begun to file out, still cussin' and discussin' the show. It was a close call, but the duke's quick thinkin' saved 'em for one more night."

            "The group traveled approximately ten miles downriver before feeling secure enough to light a lamp and prepare supper.",
            "During their meal, the King and the Duke reveled in their successful deception of the townspeople and their narrow escape from the planned retaliation.",
            "The Duke elaborated on his strategy, explaining he had anticipated that the first audience, feeling swindled, would encourage others to attend, and that the third night would be when the duped townsfolk would attempt their revenge.",
            "He humorously speculated on how the townspeople were now 'enjoying' their opportunity for payback with the rotten provisions they had brought.",
            "The narrator reveals that the conmen had amassed a total of four hundred and sixty-five dollars from their three-night theatrical scam, a sum that astonished Huck.",
            "Later, after the King and Duke had fallen asleep, Jim expressed his bewilderment to Huck regarding the uncouth behavior of these self-proclaimed 'kings'.",
            "Huck responded that their actions were not surprising to him, as he believed such conduct was inherent to all royalty.",
            "Jim contended that their companions were merely common swindlers, not actual kings.",
            "Huck, however, maintained his cynical view, asserting that, based on his understanding, most kings were essentially rapscallions.",
            "To illustrate his point, Huck launched into a comically inaccurate and anachronistic diatribe about various historical monarchs, portraying all of them, especially Henry VIII, as villains of the highest order, conflating figures, events, and timelines.",
            "He concluded that their current 'king' was comparatively mild and that one simply had to make allowances for kings, whom he described as a 'mighty ornery lot' due to their upbringing.",
            "Jim then remarked on the unpleasant body odor of their 'king'.",
            "Huck philosophized that all kings likely smelled bad and that history offered no remedies for such a royal trait.",
            "Jim acknowledged that the Duke was perhaps slightly more tolerable in some respects.",
            "Huck concurred that a duke was different, but not significantly so, deeming their Duke a rather poor specimen, particularly when inebriated.",
            "Jim declared he had had enough of both 'kings' and 'dukes'.",
            "Huck shared Jim's exhaustion but pragmatically noted they were stuck with the conmen and needed to remember their true nature and tolerate them, wistfully wishing for a country devoid of kings.",
            "Huck reflected internally on the futility of revealing to Jim that the King and Duke were frauds, believing it would serve no purpose and that their behavior was, in his eyes, indistinguishable from that of genuine royalty."

          "text_segment": "We never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village. Then we lit up and had a supper, and the king and the duke fairly laughed their bones loose over the way they’d served them people. The duke says:\n“Greenhorns, flatheads! I knew the first house would keep mum and let the rest of the town get roped in; and I knew they’d lay for us the third night, and consider it was their turn now. Well, it is their turn, and I’d give something to know how much they’d take for it. I would just like to know how they’re putting in their opportunity. They can turn it into a picnic if they want to—they brought plenty provisions.”\nThem rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in that three nights. I never see money hauled in by the wagon-load like that before. By-and-by, when they was asleep and snoring, Jim says:\n“Don’t it s’prise you de way dem kings carries on, Huck?”\n“No,” I says, “it don’t.”\n“Why don’t it, Huck?”\n“Well, it don’t, because it’s in the breed. I reckon they’re all alike.”\n“But, Huck, dese kings o’ ourn is reglar rapscallions; dat’s jist what dey is; dey’s reglar rapscallions.”\n“Well, that’s what I’m a-saying; all kings is mostly rapscallions, as fur as I can make out.”\n“Is dat so?”\n“You read about them once—you’ll see. Look at Henry the Eight; this’n ’s a Sunday-school Superintendent to him. And look at Charles Second, and Louis Fourteen, and Louis Fifteen, and James Second, and Edward Second, and Richard Third, and forty more; besides all them Saxon heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise Cain. My, you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom. He was a blossom. He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head next morning. And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs. ‘Fetch up Nell Gwynn,’ he says. They fetch her up. Next morning, ‘Chop off her head!’ And they chop it off. ‘Fetch up Jane Shore,’ he says; and up she comes, Next morning, ‘Chop off her head’—and they chop it off. ‘Ring up Fair Rosamun.’ Fair Rosamun answers the bell. Next morning, ‘Chop off her head.’ And he made every one of them tell him a tale every night; and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand and one tales that way, and then he put them all in a book, and called it Domesday Book—which was a good name and stated the case. You don’t know kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old rip of ourn is one of the cleanest I’ve struck in history. Well, Henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country. How does he go at it—give notice?—give the country a show? No. All of a sudden he heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard, and whacks out a declaration of independence, and dares them to come on. That was his style—he never give anybody a chance. He had suspicions of his father, the Duke of Wellington. Well, what did he do? Ask him to show up? No—drownded him in a butt of mamsey, like a cat. S’pose people left money laying around where he was—what did he do? He collared it. S’pose he contracted to do a thing, and you paid him, and didn’t set down there and see that he done it—what did he do? He always done the other thing. S’pose he opened his mouth—what then? If he didn’t shut it up powerful quick he’d lose a lie every time. That’s the kind of a bug Henry was; and if we’d a had him along ’stead of our kings he’d a fooled that town a heap worse than ourn done. I don’t say that ourn is lambs, because they ain’t, when you come right down to the cold facts; but they ain’t nothing to that old ram, anyway. All I say is, kings is kings, and you got to make allowances. Take them all around, they’re a mighty ornery lot. It’s the way they’re raised.”\n“But dis one do smell so like de nation, Huck.”\n“Well, they all do, Jim. We can’t help the way a king smells; history don’t tell no way.”\n“Now de duke, he’s a tolerble likely man in some ways.”\n“Yes, a duke’s different. But not very different. This one’s a middling hard lot for a duke. When he’s drunk, there ain’t no near-sighted man could tell him from a king.”\n“Well, anyways, I doan’ hanker for no mo’ un um, Huck. Dese is all I kin stan’.”\n“It’s the way I feel, too, Jim. But we’ve got them on our hands, and we got to remember what they are, and make allowances. Sometimes I wish we could hear of a country that’s out of kings.”\nWhat was the use to tell Jim these warn’t real kings and dukes? It wouldn’t a done no good; and, besides, it was just as I said: you couldn’t tell them from the real kind.",

It was a grand sight, that was. The river was miles wide, and awful still and grand. We had the sky up there, all speckled with stars, and we was drifting down the river, and by and by the moon come up, a big ball of fire, and it throwed a long shadder acrost the water, and it was all so lonesome and still and grand. We was drifting along, easy and comfortable, and we didn't say nothing for a long time. We just laid there, and looked up at the stars, and listened to the sounds of the river – the little lapping sounds against the raft, and the hooting of owls away off in the woods, and the lowing of cattle on the shore, and the far-off sound of a steamboat whistle. It was all so peaceful and quiet, and it made you feel so free and easy and comfortable. There warn't no houses, nor towns, nor people to bother you. You was just out there on the big river, with the sky and the stars and the moon, and you could go wherever you wanted to go, and nobody could stop you. It was the best life I ever lived. Jim he was laying there too, on his side, with his head propped up on his hand, and he was looking up at the stars, and I reckon he was thinking about his wife and children. He didn't say nothing neither, but I could tell by the way he was looking that he was feeling it too, the peace and the quiet and the freedom. We had a little fire going on the raft, just a little one, to cook our fish on, and it throwed a little light around us, and it made the darkness seem even bigger and deeper. We had plenty of provisions – corn pone, and bacon, and fish we caught ourselves, and we had a jug of water. We was all set. We didn't need nothing else. We had the river, and the raft, and each other, and that was enough. We talked some, by and by, about the stars, and about how big the world was, and about how we was just two little specks on it, drifting along. Jim he had some curious notions about the stars. He reckoned they was made, some of them, by the moon laying eggs, and the eggs hatched out little stars. I didn't say nothing, because I didn't want to hurt his feelings, but I knowed better. I knowed they was worlds, like ours, maybe, or maybe just big balls of fire. But it didn't matter none. We was just talking, passing the time, and it was good to have someone to talk to, out there in the middle of the river. We talked about where we was going, and about how we was going to get Jim free, and about how we was going to live in the free states. Jim he was mighty hopeful about it. He reckoned we'd get there all right, if we just kept going. I hoped so too, but sometimes I had my doubts. It was a long way, and there was a lot of dangers. But when you was out there on the river, under the stars, it didn't seem so bad. It seemed like anything was possible. We drifted along like that for hours, just letting the current carry us. We didn't have to do nothing. The river did all the work. We just had to steer a little, now and then, to keep from running into snags or sandbars. It was the easiest way to travel there ever was. We slept some too, on the raft. We had a little shelter we made out of blankets and poles, and we'd crawl in there and sleep like logs. It was the best sleep you ever had, out there on the river, with the sounds of the water all around you. You felt safe and secure, even though you was out in the middle of nowhere. We'd wake up in the morning, and the sun would be coming up, and the river would be all gold and pink, and it would be a brand new day. And we'd start all over again, drifting down the river, towards freedom. It was a hard life, in some ways, but it was a good life. It was a free life. And that's all that mattered. We kept a sharp lookout, of course, for steamboats and other craft. We didn't want to get run over, and we didn't want nobody to see us. We was always a little bit scared, but mostly we was just happy to be out there, on our own, away from everybody. We saw some strange things on the river, too. We saw wrecks, and we saw people on the shore, and we heard all sorts of sounds. But mostly it was just the river, and the sky, and us. And that was enough. We had our little world, out there on the raft, and it was a good world. We didn't have no worries, except for getting caught, and we tried not to think about that too much. We just lived in the moment, and enjoyed the ride. It was the best time of my life, those weeks on the river with Jim. We was free, and we was together, and that's all that mattered. We drifted on, day after day, night after night, and the river carried us along, towards our destiny. It was a grand adventure, and I wouldn't trade it for nothing."

He was thinking about his wife and his children, away up yonder, and he was low and homesick; because he hadn’t ever been away from home before in his life; and I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white folks does for their’n. It don’t seem natural, but I reckon it’s so. He was often moaning and mourning that way nights, when he judged I was asleep, and saying, “Po’ little ’Lizabeth! po’ little Johnny! it’s mighty hard; I spec’ I ain’t ever gwyne to see you no mo’, no mo’!” He was a mighty good nigger, Jim was.\nBut this time I somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young ones; and by-and-by he says:\n“What makes me feel so bad dis time ’uz bekase I hear sumpn over yonder on de bank like a whack, er a slam, while ago, en it mine me er de time I treat my little ’Lizabeth so ornery.

I waked up when it was broad day, and most towards breakfast, and there was Jim sitting curled up with his face in his hands, moaning and groaning, and his shoulders working, and the tears running down between his fingers; and I was sorry to see it. It was new to me. Your average nigger would moil around and fidget, and bother you, and sing, and mumble, and go on, but Jim always took it very patient, and was quiet; and he didn’t open his head at all, but set there moaning and groaning. I knew what it was, right away. He was thinking about his wife and his children, away up yonder, and he was low and homesick; because he hadn’t ever been away from them before in his life; and I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white folks does for their’n. It don’t seem natural, but I reckon it’s so. He was saying over and over again the day before, he would steal his children—the ones that belonged to a man named Phelps, down on a place about two mile below Pikesville—and sell them South, if he could get a chance. It’s his wife that’s down to Pikesville. Well, he was thinking about his poor wife and his children, that’s what it was. And whilst I was thinking about it, Jim says:\n“Laws bless you, chile, I ’uz right down sho’ you’s asleep. You looks so peaceful, en so satisf’y in yo’ sleep, dat I couldn’t bear to wake you.”\n“Well, I’m glad you didn’t, Jim.”\n“But you MUS’ git up now, honey: it’s day-light all over de worl’, en it’s time f’r ole Jim to go to wuk.”\n“I ain’t going to work, Jim. There ain’t no use. Nobody comes here at this time of day.”\nJim looked glad, and moaned some more. “Now, now, don’t begin to cry again,” I says; “take on all you want to, Jim, and don’t mind me.”\n“Gosh, it’s awful perkigious close to de line!”\n“What is?”\n“Why, this place. Seems like it’s right at de do’ of de Kingdom. Looky, all aroun’—four sides. You can’t find no hole to git out of.”\n“Well, it ain’t Kingdom Come, Jim. It ain’t going to do you no harm. It’s a mighty nice place, on the whole.”\n“No; look at it, Huck; look at it. Ain’t it awful like de Kingdom?”\n“I don’t see it, Jim, but I reckon maybe it’s so. What makes you think so?”\n“Laws, chile, it’s de noise! It’s de noise dat makes me think so. Look at it, Huck, ain’t it awful like de noise of de Kingdom?”\n“I don’t hear no noise, Jim.”\n“Well, den, you ain’t list’nin’. Listen. Don’t you hear dat?”\nHe stopped moaning and held his breath, and so did I. And then we did hear a noise away off in the woods—away off in the dim distance—a sort of a murmur, like of a breeze or a tree-top just stirring, but very faint.\n“No,” I says, “I don’t hear nothing but the wind.”\n“Dat ain’t no wind, Huck. Dat’s de noise of de Kingdom. En it makes my heart ache so, dat I can’t hardly stan’ it!”\n“Jim, you’re not well. You’re homesick, that’s what’s the trouble. You’re thinking about your wife and children.”\n“Yes, I is, Huck. En I ain’t got no peace, en no comfort all de time. I feels so bad, I do. En de noise—dat noise—it makes me think of my little ’Lizabeth. Oh, she warn’t no bigger dan dat!” He measured about a foot and a half with his hand. “She warn’t no bigger dan dat, en she was de best little cretur—Oh, looky here, Huck; I’s a-gwyne to tell you de whole thing, en I wants you to understan’ about it, en doan’ ever disremember it.”\nSo he went on, and told me the whole story. He said he used to beat his little girl, and she was four years old. And she had the scarlet fever, and got well, and was all right. And one day he was a-holding her up, and telling her to shut the door; and he says, “You hear me, ’Lizabeth? Shut de do’!” And she just stood there, looking down, and didn’t budge. And she was a-smiling a little, too, you know. That made him mad. And he says, “I tell you agin, shut de do’!” She didn’t move; just kept smiling. Then he says his eye",

Jim he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn’t take but a few hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope. You see, when we left him all alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all by himself and not tied it wouldn’t look much like he was a runaway nigger, you know. So the duke said it was kind of hard to have to lay roped all day, and he’d cipher out some way to get around it.\nHe was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it. He dressed Jim up in King Lear’s outfit—it was a long curtain-calico gown, and a white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his theater paint and painted Jim’s face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead, dull, solid blue, like a man that’s been drownded nine days. Blamed if he warn’t the horriblest looking outrage I ever see. Then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so:\nSick Arab—but harmless when not out of his head.\nAnd he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five foot in front of the wigwam. Jim was satisfied. He said it was a sight better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling all over every time there was a sound. The duke told him to make himself free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone. Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he wouldn’t wait for him to howl. Why, he didn’t only look like he was dead, he looked considerable more than that.",

We had all bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put his’n on, and he told me to put mine on. I done it, of course.

Why, before, he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever was; but now, when he’d take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand and good and pious that you’d say he had walked right out of the ark, and maybe was old Leviticus himself. Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I got my paddle ready. There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away up under the point, about three mile above the town—been there a couple of hours, taking on freight.

Go for the steamboat, Huckleberry; we’ll come down to the village on her.”\nI didn’t have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride.

          "text_segment": "“Run her nose in shore,” says the king. I done it. “Wher’ you bound for, young man?”\n“For the steamboat; going to Orleans.”\n“Git aboard,” says the king. “Hold on a minute, my servant ’ll he’p you with them bags. Jump out and he’p the gentleman, Adolphus”—meaning me, I see.\nI done so, and then we all three started on again. The young chap was mighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather. He asked the king where he was going, and the king told him he’d come down the river and landed at the other village this morning, and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there. The young fellow says:\n“When I first see you I says to myself, ‘It’s Mr. Wilks, sure, and he come mighty near getting here in time.’ But then I says again, ‘No, I reckon it ain’t him, or else he wouldn’t be paddling up the river.’ You ain’t him, are you?”\n“No, my name’s Blodgett—Elexander Blodgett—Reverend Elexander Blodgett, I s’pose I must say, as I’m one o’ the Lord’s poor servants. But still I’m jist as able to be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arriving in time, all the same, if he’s missed anything by it—which I hope he hasn’t.”\n“Well, he don’t miss any property by it, because he’ll get that all right; but he’s missed seeing his brother Peter die—which he mayn’t mind, nobody can tell as to that—but his brother would a give anything in this world to see him before he died; never talked about nothing else all these three weeks; hadn’t seen him since they was boys together—and hadn’t ever seen his brother William at all—that’s the deef and dumb one—William ain’t more than thirty or thirty-five. Peter and George were the only ones that come out here; George was the married brother; him and his wife both died last year. Harvey and William’s the only ones that’s left now; and, as I was saying, they haven’t got here in time.”\n“Did anybody send ’em word?”\n“Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because Peter said then that he sorter felt like he warn’t going to get well this time. You see, he was pretty old, and George’s g’yirls was too young to be much company for him, except Mary Jane, the red-headed one; and so he was kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and didn’t seem to care much to live. He most desperately wanted to see Harvey—and William, too, for that matter—because he was one of them kind that can’t bear to make a will. He left a letter behind for Harvey, and said he’d told in it where his money was hid, and how he wanted the rest of the property divided up so George’s g’yirls would be all right—for George didn’t leave nothing. And that letter was all they could get him to put a pen to.”\n“Why do you reckon Harvey don’t come? Wher’ does he live?”\n“Oh, he lives in England—Sheffield—preaches there—hasn’t ever been in this country. He hasn’t had any too much time—and besides he mightn’t a got the letter at all, you know.”\n“Too bad, too bad he couldn’t a lived to see his brothers, poor soul. You going to Orleans, you say?”\n“Yes, but that ain’t only a part of it. I’m going in a ship, next Wednesday, for Ryo Janeero, where my uncle lives.”\n“It’s a pretty long journey. But it’ll be lovely; wisht I was a-going. Is Mary Jane the oldest? How old is the others?”\n“Mary Jane’s nineteen, Susan’s fifteen, and Joanna’s about fourteen—that’s the one that gives herself to good works and has a hare-lip.”\n“Poor things! to be left alone in the cold world so.”\n“Well, they could be worse off. Old Peter had friends, and they ain’t going to let them come to no harm. There’s Hobson, the Babtis’ preacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley, and—well, there’s a lot of them; but these are the ones that Peter was thickest with, and used to write about sometimes, when he wrote home; so Harvey ’ll know where to look for friends when he gets here.”\nWell, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied that young fellow. Blamed if he didn’t inquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town, and all about the Wilkses; and about Peter’s business—which was a tanner; and about George’s—which was a carpenter; and about Harvey’s—which was a dissentering minister; and so on, and so on. Then he says:\n“What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?”\n“Because she’s a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn’t stop there. When they’re deep they won’t stop for a hail. A Cincinnati boat will, but this is a St. Louis one.”\n“Was Peter Wilks well off?”\n“Oh, yes, pretty well off. He had houses and land, and it’s reckoned he left three or four thousand in cash hid up som’ers.”\n“When did you say he died?”\n“I didn’t say, but it was last night.”\n“Funeral to-morrow, likely?”\n“Yes, ’bout the middle of the day.”\n“Well, it’s all terrible sad; but we’ve all got to go, one time or another. So what we want to do is to be prepared; then we’re all right.”\n“Yes, sir, it’s the best way. Ma used to always say that.”",

            "prefix-probing": "“Run her nose in shore,” says the king. “We got business, and we got to land.”\n\nSo the duke give the steering-oar a jerk, and we swung in towards the bank. It was a lonesome place, all woods and thickets, and the river was wide and lazy here. You couldn’t see a house nor a sign of folks anywhere. Just the big trees hangin’ over the water and the vines danglin’ down like ropes. It felt spooky and quiet, like somethin’ was fixin’ to happen.\n\nThe king and the duke they was all excited, whisperin’ together and lookin’ sly. They’d been studyin’ a paper they got hold of back at the last town – some kind of advertisement or notice, I reckon. They wouldn’t let me nor Jim see it, but I could tell by the way they acted it was somethin’ they figured they could make money out of, which always meant trouble for somebody, usually us.\n\nWe scraped bottom a little, and then the duke shoved the raft right into a little cove where the trees made it dark and hidden. We tied her up good and snug, and then the king says, “Now, boys, listen up. Me and the duke here, we got a little enterprise to attend to. It’s a delicate matter, requires tact and discretion. We’re goin’ up to that house yonder – it’s about a mile back from the river, accordin’ to this here paper – and we’re goin’ to see about a little inheritance.”\n\nJim’s eyes got big. “Inheritance?” he whispers. “Whose inheritance?”\n\n“Never you mind, Jim,” says the king, lookin’ important. “It’s a family matter. A rich old man died, and left a pile of money and property. And it just so happens,” he says, puffin’ out his chest, “that me and the duke bear a striking resemblance to his long-lost brothers who live in England. Ain’t that a coincidence?”\n\nI didn’t say nothin’. I’d heard enough of their schemes to know this one was likely to be the biggest and the dirtiest yet. Impersonatin’ dead folks’ brothers for money – it was low-down, even for them.\n\nThe duke chimes in, “Yes, indeed. The paper says these brothers, William and Harvey Wilks, were expected to arrive from England. Poor old Peter Wilks, he died just before they got here. Left everything to his nieces. But if the brothers show up, they get a good chunk of it. And who,” he says, smirkin’, “looks more like respectable English gentlemen than your humble servants?”\n\nThey had it all planned out. They’d pretend to be these Wilks brothers, claim the inheritance, and then light out before anyone got wise. They even had the names down: the king was goin’ to be Harvey, and the duke was goin’ to be William, who was deaf and dumb, which the duke seemed right pleased about, figurin’ it would cut down on the amount of talkin’ he had to do and maybe explain away any slips.\n\n“Now, you two,” the king says, lookin’ at me and Jim. “You stay here with the raft. Keep her hidden. Don’t let nobody see you. If anyone comes snoopin’ around, you lay low. We’ll be back as soon as we can, loaded with plunder.”\n\nJim looked worried. “Marse King,” he says, hesitatin’. “Dat soun’ mighty risky. S’pose folks fin’ out?”\n\n“They won’t find out if you keep your mouths shut and do as you’re told,” snaps the king. “This is a gold mine, Jim! We’ll all be rich!”\n\nI didn’t believe that for a second. Their kind of rich always came with a heap of trouble attached. But there wasn’t nothin’ I could do. They was the bosses, and we was stuck with them.\n\nThey spent a little while fixin’ themselves up, tryin’ to look respectable. The king put on his old, greasy coat and tried to smooth his hair. The duke straightened his collar. They looked about as much like English gentlemen as a couple of stray dogs, but they seemed to think they was mighty convincin’. They took the paper with them and set off through the woods, headin’ inland. We watched them go till they was out of sight, and then it was just me and Jim again, alone on the raft in the quiet, spooky cove, waitin’ for the next piece of meanness to come rollin’ down the river."

And, mind you, everybody was doing the same; and the place was that damp I never see anything like it. Then one of them got on one side of the coffin, and t’other on t’other side, and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the coffin, and let on to pray all to themselves.

Come, children, come—for your poor uncle Alan's heart is breaking for the sight of you!'\n\nAll three of the girls flew into the Duke's arms, crying, and he hugged them close, and sobbed, and said:\n\n'Oh, my loving nieces, that I never saw before, your poor uncle's heart is broken.

We know they would want to come; so don’t you all trouble yourselves about them.” Pity and sorrow was in every face. I stood a-looking on. There was two or three young women at the front that begun to sob, and the others all joined in, and pretty soon there warn’t a hold-back left, but everybody that was there was crying the best they could; and the noise they made was something awful—only the doctor and the lawyer they stood together and looked on, with the tears running down their faces the same as the others, but they didn’t make no sound. Everybody was saying, “Poor souls!—poor distressed afflicted orphans!” And so they carried on, and so they carried on. Pretty soon Hanner Greks’s old mother she got to letting on she was faint, and her friends gathered around her and cooled her off with fans, and rubbed her hands and things, and pretty soon she come to and was all right; but she breshed a couple of knuckles off her spine first, though. Well, by this time the whole room was agoing, and everybody was sad; but the king he stood up and looked solemn, and begun to talk, and the women they hushed up, and the men they quit their noise, and so you could hear. He says: “Why, my poor nieces, that they should come to this! But we know that God’s ways are dark and mysterious; and now we see the reason for this affliction: it was to bring here these dear children that God hath afflicted lest they also be smitten with a heavy disappointment! And—” You see he was a-going to say, lest they also should be smitten with a heavy disappointment if they hadn’t got the money; but he stopped, and went on,— “And in His boundless wisdom He hath appointed me and my brother to be the guardians and protectors of these orphans during their unguided age!” Then he fetched a deep sigh, and begun to sob, and the tears come a-running down his face. Everybody else begun to sob, too. And the king he bowed his head and rested it on his hand, and stood that way a minute, sobbing, and then suddenly he busted out crying louder than ever, and flung his arms around the girls and hugged them to his breast, and says: “Oh, my poor sweet suffering chil’ren!” And the way he sobbed, and the girls sobbed, and everybody sobbed, was just that the most touchingest thing ever I see, and so it seemed to everybody else. Presently the king he quits sobbing, and stands up and takes a handkerchief out of his pocket and wipes his face, and he says: “I feel better now. I can bear it.

                "text": "Then the king begins to work his jaw again, and says how him and his nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the family would take supper here with them this evening, and help set up with the ashes of the diseased; and says if his poor brother laying yonder could speak he knows who he would name, for they was names that was very dear to him, and mentioned often in his letters; and so he will name the same, to wit, as follows, vizz.:—Rev. Mr. Hobson, and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Mr. Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley. Well, by that time they had them all listed out, and the king he says: “I will call around this afternoon on my own self and see the gentlemen and tell them they are invited to the funeral, and to supper to-night. We know they would want to come; so don’t you all trouble yourselves about them.” Pity and sorrow was in every face. I stood a-looking on. There was two or three young women at the front that begun to sob, and the others all joined in, and pretty soon there warn’t a hold-back left, but everybody that was there was crying the best they could; and the noise they made was something awful—only the doctor and the lawyer they stood together and looked on, with the tears running down their faces the same as the others, but they didn’t make no sound. Everybody was saying, “Poor souls!—poor distressed afflicted orphans!” And so they carried on, and so they carried on. Pretty soon Hanner Greks’s old mother she got to letting on she was faint, and her friends gathered around her and cooled her off with fans, and rubbed her hands and things, and pretty soon she come to and was all right; but she breshed a couple of knuckles off her spine first, though. Well, by this time the whole room was agoing, and everybody was sad; but the king he stood up and looked solemn, and begun to talk, and the women they hushed up, and the men they quit their noise, and so you could hear. He says: “Why, my poor nieces, that they should come to this! But we know that God’s ways are dark and mysterious; and now we see the reason for this affliction: it was to bring here these dear children that God hath afflicted lest they also be smitten with a heavy disappointment! And—” You see he was a-going to say, lest they also should be smitten with a heavy disappointment if they hadn’t got the money; but he stopped, and went on,— “And in His boundless wisdom He hath appointed me and my brother to be the guardians and protectors of these orphans during their unguided age!” Then he fetched a deep sigh, and begun to sob, and the tears come a-running down his face. Everybody else begun to sob, too. And the king he bowed his head and rested it on his hand, and stood that way a minute, sobbing, and then suddenly he busted out crying louder than ever, and flung his arms around the girls and hugged them to his breast, and says: “Oh, my poor sweet suffering chil’ren!” And the way he sobbed, and the girls sobbed, and everybody sobbed, was just that the most touchingest thing ever I see, and so it seemed to everybody else. Presently the king he quits sobbing, and stands up and takes a handkerchief out of his pocket and wipes his face, and he says: “I feel better now. I can bear it. We are all poor creatures, and ain’t only temporary, out in this life. We are in the hands of Providence all the time, but don’t know it. “Now, the friends of the family that’s been named, will please stand up next to me now. That’s right.

So these two frauds said they’d go and fetch it up, and have everything square and above-board; and told me to come with a candle.

We’re a-going to give this money to the girls.”\nHe turned to the duke, and says:\n“Bill, you see what I mean. We ain’t a-going to do it, are we?”\n“No,” says the duke, goo-gooing and hugging the king, “we ain’t a-going to do it. We’re a-going to give it to the girls.”\n“That’s it,” says the king. “And now, Mary Jane, Susan, and Joanna, here’s your money. It ain’t much, but it’s all your poor dear father left you.”\nHe handed the bag to Mary Jane, and she grabbed it and hugged it to her breast, and then she and Susan and Joanna all three of them made a rush for the king and the duke, and they hugged and kissed them, and cried over them, and the crowd all got around and shook hands with the king and the duke, and cried over them, and said they were the best men in the world.",

But he needn’t a worried—it was jest what I was at.”\nThen he weaves along again, perfectly ca’m, and goes to dropping in his funeral orgies again every now and then, just like he done before. And when he done it the third time he says:\n“I say orgies, not because it’s the common term, because it ain’t—obsequies bein’ the common term—but because orgies is the right term. Obsequies ain’t used in England no more now—it’s gone out. We say orgies now in England. Orgies is better, because it means the thing you’re after more exact.

This results in a significant missing section that includes the interactions and dialogue at the supper.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include any of the social exchanges or commentary about the food that occur during the meal.\n- There is no mention of the conversational dynamics or the way the guests respond to the food, which are important to the original passage.\n- The completion lacks the depiction of the typical behaviors and rituals that take place at such a supper, which are described in the original.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- There are no invented events or inaccuracies in the portion provided, but the abrupt ending means that the sequence of events is incomplete and the flow of the original passage is disrupted."

Well, I bet I have—he goes to our church.” I knowed he was dead years ago, but I never let on. So when I says he goes to our church, she says:\n“What—regular?”\n“Yes—regular. His pew’s right over opposite ourn—on t’other side the pulpit.”\n“I thought he lived in London?”\n“Well, he does. Where would he live?”\n“But I thought you lived in Sheffield?”\nI see I was up a stump. I had to let on to get choked with a chicken bone, so as to get time to think how to get down again. Then I says:\n“I mean he goes to our church regular when he’s in Sheffield. That’s only in the summer time, when he comes there to take the sea baths.”\n“Why, how you talk—Sheffield ain’t on the sea.”\n“Well, who said it was?”\n“Why, you did.”\n“I didn’t nuther.”\n“You did!”\n“I didn’t.”\n“You did.”\n“I never said nothing of the kind.”\n“Well, what did you say, then?”\n“Said he come to take the sea baths—that’s what I said.”\n“Well, then, how’s he going to take the sea baths if it ain’t on the sea?”\n“Looky here,” I says; “did you ever see any Congress-water?”\n“Yes.”\n“Well, did you have to go to Congress to get it?”\n“Why, no.”\n“Well, neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea bath.”\n“How does he get it, then?”\n“Gets it the way people down here gets Congress-water—in barrels. There in the palace at Sheffield they’ve got furnaces, and he wants his water hot. They can’t bile that amount of water away off there at the sea. They haven’t got no conveniences for it.”\n“Oh, I see, now. You might a said that in the first place and saved time.”\nWhen she said that I see I was out of the woods again, and so I was comfortable and glad. Next, she says:\n“Do you go to church, too?”\n“Yes—regular.”\n“Where do you set?”\n“Why, in our pew.”\n“Whose pew?”\n“Why, ourn—your Uncle Harvey’s.”\n“His’n? What does he want with a pew?”\n“Wants it to set in. What did you reckon he wanted with it?”\n“Why, I thought he’d be in the pulpit.”\nRot him, I forgot he was a preacher. I see I was up a stump again, so I played another chicken bone and got another think. Then I says:\n“Blame it, do you suppose there ain’t but one preacher to a church?”\n“Why, what do they want with more?”\n“What!—to preach before a king? I never did see such a girl as you. They don’t have no less than seventeen.”\n“Seventeen! My land! Why, I wouldn’t set out such a string as that, not if I never got to glory. It must take ’em a week.”\n“Shucks, they don’t all of ’em preach the same day—only one of ’em.”\n“Well, then, what does the rest of ’em do?”\n“Oh, nothing much. Loll around, pass the plate—and one thing or another. But mainly they don’t do nothing.”\n“Well, then, what are they for?”\n“Why, they’re for style. Don’t you know nothing?”\n“Well, I don’t want to know no such foolishness as that. How is servants treated in England? Do they treat ’em better ’n we treat our niggers?”\n“No! A servant ain’t nobody there. They treat them worse than dogs.”\n“Don’t they give ’em holidays, the way we do, Christmas and New Year’s week, and Fourth of July?”\n“Oh, just listen! A body could tell you hain’t ever been to England by that. Why, Hare-l—why, Joanna, they never see a holiday from year’s end to year’s end; never go to the circus, nor theater, nor nigger shows, nor nowheres.”\n“Nor church?”\n“Nor church.”\n“But you always went to church.”\nWell, I was gone up again. I forgot I was the old man’s servant. But next minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was different from a common servant and had to go to church whether he wanted to or not, and set with the family, on account of its being the law.

She had a hare-lip, and she had a mad look in her eyes, and she snorted when she talked, and she was about fifteen or sixteen. She was a good girl, and she was trying to be good, but you could see it warn't no use—she'd been so trained and drilled that she couldn't help but blurt out things and follow them up. Well, she begun to ask me questions. She says:\n“What’s your name, honey?”\n“M—Mary Williams,” says I.\nSomehow it didn’t seem to fit nohow.\n“Oh, that’s a pretty name. But your brother told me your name was George Peters.”\n“Oh, I know. My name is Mary George Peters Williams. I call myself Mary, but my full name is Mary George Peters Williams.”\n“Well, I never heard of such a name. Is it common in England?”\n“Yes, sir, very common.” I felt better right off. I says to myself, I can lick this girl. She ain’t half as hard as she looks.\n“What part of England do you live in?”\n“Sheffield, sir. I mean, miss.”\n“What do they do there?”\n“Oh, lots of things. Mostly work in the factories.”\n“What kind of factories?”\n“Oh, all kinds. Steel factories, mostly.”\n“Do you like it there?”\n“Yes, sir. I mean, miss. It’s a good place.”\n“Did you ever see the King?”\n“Yes, sir. I mean, miss. Lots of times.”\n“He attends your church, don’t he?”\n“Yes, sir. I mean, miss. Regular.”\n“Where is his pew?”\n“Right opposite ourn—on the other side of the pulpit.”\n“I thought he lived in London.”\n“Well, he does. But he comes down to Sheffield every summer for the sea-baths.”\n“Sheffield ain’t on the sea.”\n“Well, no, not right on it. But it’s close enough. They fetch the water up in barrels.”\n“Fetch it up in barrels! Why, that’s the most ridiculous thing I ever heard of.”\n“Well, I don’t know. They do it in Congress-water, and I don’t see why they shouldn’t do it in sea-water. It’s the same principle.”\nShe snorted again. She was getting madder and madder. I was getting scared. I wished I hadn’t tackled her. I wished I was out of it.\n“Do you attend church regularly?”\n“Yes, sir. I mean, miss. Regular.”\n“In your family pew?”\n“Yes, sir. I mean, miss. Uncle Harvey’s pew.”\n“Uncle Harvey! Why, he’s a preacher. What does he want with a pew?”\nI see I was in for it now. I didn’t know what to say. I choked on a chicken bone. I coughed and coughed. I thought I was going to die. I wished I was dead. I wished I hadn’t come to this house. I wished I hadn’t come to this town. I wished I hadn’t been born. I wished I was a fish.

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the sequence of questions and answers about England, the king, church attendance, and servants, which are the core of the original passage.\n- There is no representation of the narrator's attempts to fabricate stories or the moments of being caught in inconsistencies, which are key to the original's progression.\n- The completion does not include the exchanges about the number of preachers, the treatment of servants, or the narrator's attempts to explain away contradictions.\n- The ending, where the narrator reflects on the success or failure of the deception, is missing.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces invented details about the hare-lip's appearance, age, and temperament, none of which are described in the original passage.\n- The structure is dominated by a repeated, irrelevant phrase, which disrupts the narrative flow and does not correspond to any part of the original.\n- The completion fails to follow the original sequence of events, omitting the progression from supper to interrogation to the narrator's internal reactions.\n\nOverall, the completion should focus on accurately reproducing the dialogue and narrative developments, avoiding invented or repetitive character descriptions, and maintaining the original's structure and sequence of events."

It was a mighty quiet supper. Nobody said much of anything. The hare-lip, she just picked at her food and looked down at her plate, and I didn't feel like talking neither. The house was awful still, except for the sounds of folks moving around upstairs and the niggers whispering out back. It felt like death was hanging in the air, thick and heavy. It was a lonesome feeling, being in that big house with all that sorrow. I couldn't get them poor boys out of my head, Buck and them others. It didn't seem right, all that killing over something nobody even remembered how it started. They was good people, the Grangerfords, in their own way, and the Shepherdsons too, I reckon, though I didn't know them. But they was all mixed up in something that didn't make no sense. They'd go to church and hear about brotherly love and then go right out and shoot each other. It was enough to make a body sick. I thought about the river, and the raft, and Jim. That was the only place that felt like home, the only place where things was simple and didn't involve folks killing each other over points of honor that wasn't honorable at all. I wished I was back there. I wished I'd never seen this place. After supper, I went up to the room Buck and I used to share. It felt empty and cold. His clothes was still there, and his gun leaning in the corner. It made my heart ache. I couldn't sleep. I laid there in the dark, listening to the house creak and settle, and every little sound made me jump. I kept thinking I heard things, like ghosts walking around. The moon came up and shone through the window, making long, spooky shadows. I tossed and turned, and the more I thought about it, the more I knew I couldn't stay there another minute. I had to get back to Jim. He was waiting for me, and the raft was waiting. That was my family, out there in the swamp. I got up quiet as a mouse. I put on my clothes, not making a sound. I didn't take nothing with me but the clothes on my back. I crept out of the room and down the stairs. The house was dark and silent now. I could hear my own heart beating in my ears. I got to the back door and slipped the bolt back slow and careful. It made a little click, and I froze, listening. But nobody stirred. I opened the door just enough to squeeze through and then closed it soft behind me. I was outside, in the cool night air. It felt good to be out of that house of death. I started walking towards the swamp, where I'd told Jim to hide. The ground was rough and uneven, and I stumbled a few times in the dark. The crickets was chirping, and the frogs was croaking, and the swamp smelled of mud and water and growing things. It was a friendly smell compared to the smell of sorrow back at the house. I walked and walked, my heart full of hope and a little bit of fear. What if Jim wasn't there? What if something had happened to him? I pushed those thoughts away and kept going. Finally, I got to the place where I'd left the canoe. I found it and paddled out into the swamp, calling Jim's name soft. \"Jim? You there, Jim?\" I called again, a little louder this time. And then I heard it, a low voice answering back. \"Huck? Dat you, Huck?\" It was Jim! My heart leaped. I paddled towards the sound, and pretty soon I saw the dark shape of the raft tied up amongst the trees. And there was Jim, standing on it, looking like the most welcome sight in the world. \"Jim!\" I said, my voice cracking a little. \"It's me! I'm here!\" He helped me onto the raft, and we just stood there for a minute, looking at each other. \"Lord, Huck,\" he said, shaking his head. \"I thought you was gone for good. I been so worried.\" \"I know, Jim,\" I said. \"It was awful. I'll tell you about it later. Let's just get out of here.\" We untied the raft and pushed off into the current. It felt so good to be back on the river, with Jim,"

Upstairs the hall was dark, but I found the duke’s room, and started to paw around it with my hands; but I recollected it wouldn’t be much like the king to let anybody else take care of that money but his own self; so then I went to his room and begun to paw around there. But I see I couldn’t do nothing without a candle, and I dasn’t light one, of course. So I judged I’d got to do the other thing—lay for them and eavesdrop. About that time I hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the bed; I reached for it, but it wasn’t where I thought it would be; but I touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane’s frocks, so I jumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still.\nThey come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done was to get down and look under the bed. Then I was glad I hadn’t found the bed when I wanted it. And yet, you know, it’s kind of natural to hide under the bed when you are up to anything private. They sets down then, and the king says:\n“Well, what is it? And cut it middlin’ short, because it’s better for us to be down there a-whoopin’ up the mournin’ than up here givin’ ’em a chance to talk us over.”\n“Well, this is it, Capet. I ain’t easy; I ain’t comfortable. That doctor lays on my mind. I wanted to know your plans. I’ve got a notion, and I think it’s a sound one.”\n“What is it, duke?”\n“That we better glide out of this before three in the morning, and clip it down the river with what we’ve got. Specially, seeing we got it so easy—given back to us, flung at our heads, as you may say, when of course we allowed to have to steal it back. I’m for knocking off and lighting out.”\nThat made me feel pretty bad. About an hour or two ago it would a been a little different, but now it made me feel bad and disappointed, The king rips out and says:\n“What! And not sell out the rest o’ the property? March off like a passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous’n’ dollars’ worth o’ property layin’ around jest sufferin’ to be scooped in?—and all good, salable stuff, too.”\nThe duke he grumbled; said the bag of gold was enough, and he didn’t want to go no deeper—didn’t want to rob a lot of orphans of everything they had.\n“Why, how you talk!” says the king. “We sha’n’t rob ’em of nothing at all but jest this money. The people that buys the property is the suff’rers; because as soon ’s it’s found out ’at we didn’t own it—which won’t be long after we’ve slid—the sale won’t be valid, and it’ll all go back to the estate. These yer orphans ’ll git their house back agin, and that’s enough for them; they’re young and spry, and k’n easy earn a livin’. They ain’t a-goin to suffer. Why, jest think—there’s thous’n’s and thous’n’s that ain’t nigh so well off. Bless you, they ain’t got noth’n’ to complain of.”\nWell, the king he talked him blind; so at last he give in, and said all right, but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay, and that doctor hanging over them. But the king says:\n“Cuss the doctor! What do we k’yer for him? Hain’t we got all the fools in town on our side? And ain’t that a big enough majority in any town?”",

            "prefix-probing": "So, thinks I, I’ll go and search them rooms. It was a big house, quiet as a graveyard at midnight, and the moon was shining in through the windows, making long, spooky shadows that danced around like ghosts whenever a cloud went over. My heart was thumping like a drum, but I reckoned I had to do it. Pap always said you got to face things, even if they make your knees knock together like castanets. I slipped off my shoes so I wouldn't make no noise, and started with the parlor. It was all fancy, with stiff-backed chairs and a big fireplace that looked like it hadn't had a fire in it for a hundred years. There was a big picture on the wall of a woman with eyes that seemed to follow you, and I didn't much like that. I peeked behind the curtains, under the table, and even in a big china cabinet, careful not to rattle none of the dishes. Nothing. Just dust and the smell of old furniture. Next was the dining room. A long table covered with a white cloth, and more stiff chairs. A big sideboard with silver things that gleamed in the moonlight. I opened the drawers slow and quiet. Just napkins and forks and spoons. Nothing hidden, nothing secret. I felt a bit disappointed, and a bit relieved too. It's a funny feeling, wanting to find something but being scared of what it might be. I moved on to a room that looked like a study. Books everywhere, piled high on shelves and even on the floor. A big desk in the middle. I went through the drawers of the desk. Papers, pens, ink bottles, but nothing that looked like money or anything valuable. One drawer was stuck, and I had to wiggle it a bit, making a little squeak that sounded like a cannon shot in the quiet house. I froze, listening, but nobody stirred. I finally got it open, and it was just full of old letters tied up with ribbon. I didn't bother reading them. Letters ain't never told me nothing useful. There was a big armchair by the window, and I even felt under the cushion, just in case. Still nothing. I was starting to think this was a fool's errand. Maybe there wasn't nothing to find. But I had come this far, so I reckoned I might as well finish. There were a couple more rooms upstairs, and I figured I'd tackle them next. The stairs creaked a little, no matter how careful I was, and I held my breath with every step. Up there, it was darker, and the shadows seemed thicker. The first room was a bedroom. A big bed with a quilt, a dresser, and a washstand. I looked under the bed, in the dresser drawers, and in the closet. Just clothes and blankets. The air felt cold in there, and I shivered, though it wasn't really cold. It was just the quiet and the dark getting to me. The last room was smaller, maybe a child's room once. A little bed, a small chest. I checked them all. Nothing. I stood in the middle of the room, feeling the silence press in on me. I hadn't found a single thing. No treasure, no secrets, nothing hidden away. Just empty rooms and old furniture. I reckoned it was time to get out of there before the moon went down and left me in total darkness. My search hadn't turned up nothing, but at least I knew for sure. Sometimes knowing there's nothing is just as important as finding something, I s'pose. I crept back down the stairs, just as quiet as I could, and slipped out the way I came in, leaving the spooky old house to the moon and the shadows."

The king says:\n“Why?”\n“Because Mary Jane ’ll be in mourning from this out; and first you know the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds up and put ’em away; and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and not borrow some of it?”\n“Your head’s level agin, duke,” says the king; and he comes a-fumbling under the curtain two or three foot from where I was. I stuck tight to the wall and kept mighty still, though quivery; and I wondered what them fellows would say to me if they catched me; and I tried to think what I’d better do if they did catch me. But the king he got the bag before I could think more than about a half a thought, and he never suspicioned I was around. They took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw tick that was under the feather-bed, and crammed it in a foot or two amongst the straw and said it was all right now, because a nigger only makes up the feather-bed, and don’t turn over the straw tick only about twice a year, and so it warn’t in no danger of getting stole now.\nBut I knowed better. I had it out of there before they was half-way down stairs. I groped along up to my cubby, and hid it there till I could get a chance to do better. I judged I better hide it outside of the house somewheres, because if they missed it they would give the house a good ransacking: I knowed that very well. Then I turned in, with my clothes all on; but I couldn’t a gone to sleep if I’d a wanted to, I was in such a sweat to get through with the business. By-and-by I heard the king and the duke come up; so I rolled off my pallet and laid with my chin at the top of my ladder, and waited to see if anything was going to happen.

Well, the nigger wench 'll be getting up, and she'll be going through them rooms, and she'll be packing up Mary Jane's things, and she'll run across that money, and then—\"\n\n\"Hold on,\" says the King. \"What's the matter with that?\"\n\n\"Matter? Why, she'll borrow some of it, sure.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" says the King, \"is that it? Well, then—\"\n\nHe stood a second or two, thinking.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the initial conversation between the two characters about the safety of the money, which is a significant part of the original passage.\n- The sequence of events is incomplete; the completion jumps directly to Huck's action without showing the preceding dialogue or the process of hiding the money.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the reasoning given by the characters for moving the money, including concerns about who might find it and why.\n- There is no mention of the specific actions taken by the characters to hide the money, such as where and how it is hidden.\n- The completion does not include Huck's internal thoughts and anxieties about being discovered, nor his planning about what to do if caught.\n- The passage omits the details of Huck's subsequent actions after retrieving the money, such as where he hides it and his reasoning for doing so.\n- The completion does not describe the time progression, such as waiting for the house to become quiet before making his move.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is out of order; Huck's retrieval of the money is presented before the hiding of the money by the other characters.\n- The completion attributes actions and knowledge to Huck without showing the context or the events that led to those actions.\n- There is a lack of transition between the actions of the other characters and Huck's response, making the narrative unclear and disconnected from the original structure."

I says to myself, it's yet dark, they won't come here all early yet; they won't come till daylight. It's well I waited till dark, 'cause if I hadn't that fixing of the candles would a stood against us that much, anyway. I were a fool not to snatch that money this morning. But I couldn't see how with them all at my heels. It makes no difference, it's all the same; they'll get it now, certain. Slap it in the coffin now, and it's all right. It'll be buried, and nobody can get it but them. They'll trap me; they ain't no doubt about it. They'll think it was me. I could a got away, but I couldn't stand it to leave that money there, after all I'd been through. It's no use, I've got to stand it. I can't get away. I've got to see the thing out. I can't write to Mary Jane about it—she'd be sure to tell. I've got to keep mum. I wish I hadn't a done it. But I done it, and I can't undo it. I've got to face it. If I'd a left it in the coffin, it would a been all right. But I couldn't stand it. I had to do it. I couldn't help it. I've got to take my chances. I can't get away. I've got to stand it.

I watched their faces to see if anything had been happening, but I couldn’t tell.\nTowards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man, and they set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs, and then set all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more from the neighbors till the hall and the parlor and the dining-room was full. I see the coffin lid was the way it was before, but I dasn’t go to look in under it, with folks around.\nThen the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls took seats in the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an hour the people filed around slow, in single rank, and looked down at the dead man’s face a minute, and some dropped in a tear, and it was all very still and solemn, only the girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent, and sobbing a little. There warn’t no other sound but the scraping of the feet on the floor and blowing noses—because people always blows them more at a funeral than they do at other places except church.\nWhen the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the last touches, and getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable, and making no more sound than a cat. He never spoke; he moved people around, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done it with nods, and signs with his hands. Then he took his place over against the wall. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever see; and there warn’t no more smile to him than there is to a ham.\nThey had borrowed a melodeum—a sick one; and when everything was ready a young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and colicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only one that had a good thing, according to my notion. Then the Reverend Hobson opened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was only one dog, but he made a most powerful racket, and he kept it up right along; the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait—you couldn’t hear yourself think. It was right down awkward, and nobody didn’t seem to know what to do. But pretty soon they see that long-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say, “Don’t you worry—just depend on me.” Then he stooped down and begun to glide along the wall, just his shoulders showing over the people’s heads. So he glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more and more outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had gone around two sides of the room, he disappears down cellar. Then in about two seconds we heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or two, and then everything was dead still, and the parson begun his solemn talk where he left off. In a minute or two here comes this undertaker’s back and shoulders gliding along the wall again; and so he glided and glided around three sides of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his mouth with his hands, and stretched his neck out towards the preacher, over the people’s heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, “He had a rat!” Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his place. You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people, because naturally they wanted to know. A little thing like that don’t cost nothing, and it’s just the little things that makes a man to be looked up to and liked. There warn’t no more popular man in town than what that undertaker was.",

It was very dark down there and spooky, and it was good to see the daylight again. For a while I set on the steps sorting out what was what. There was a nigger woman going around doing up the house, and she was where I could see her all the time; she was setting near the open door, sewing. She was tall and awkward, and seemed gentle and kindly. She was about forty, I judged. She said, ‘Good morning, honey. Has you had yo’ breakfast?’ I said, ‘No, ma’am.’ ‘Well, den, yo’ ma’ll fix you some. She’s up stairs yet, I reckon.’ ‘No, she ain’t. She’s gone to the country.’ ‘Laws sakes! I didn’t know dat.

They came in carriages and wagons and on foot. They all looked sad. They went in the parlor and sat down. The undertaker went around and whispered to them. They all nodded. He was a slick one. He could make a body feel comfortable in a minute. He had a way of doing it. He was the most mournfulest man I ever saw. He could cry easier than anybody. He could cry at a funeral, and he could cry at a wedding. He could cry at anything. He was a professional mourner. He made a good living at it. He was a good man, though. He was kind to the poor.

It was awful quiet, not a sound but the wind sighing through the trees outside, which sounded like it was crying too. I felt sick inside, thinking about Buck and the others. It didn't seem right, all that fuss and pride and then just... gone. Laid out cold. I couldn't stand being in that house another minute. It felt haunted by all the trouble and the blood. I slipped out the back way, quiet as a mouse, and headed for the woods. My heart was heavy as lead. All that fine living and fancy clothes and poetry and then this. It made me feel like the river was the only place for me, the only place that made any sense. Up on the river, you didn't have people killing each other over things they couldn't even remember the start of. You just had the river, and the sky, and the stars, and the raft, and Jim. And that was enough. More than enough. I wandered through the woods, calling for Jim low down, not wanting to make no noise that might bring somebody after me. I didn't know where he'd gone, or if he was safe. That was the worst part, not knowing about Jim. He was the only friend I had in the world that wasn't trying to sivilize me or make me something I wasn't. I kept going, pushing through the bushes and the vines, my clothes getting snagged and torn. I didn't care. I just had to find him. I called his name again, a little louder this time, 'Jim! Oh, Jim!' And then, faint like, I heard a sound back. It was him! My heart jumped into my throat. I pushed on harder, crashing through the underbrush, not caring about the noise now. And there he was, crouched down in the thickest part of the swamp, looking scared but whole. And there, tied up to a tree root, was the raft! It was like seeing home after being lost in a strange, terrible place. Jim was mighty glad to see me, and I was mighty glad to see him. We didn't waste no time talking. We just got the raft loose and shoved off into the current. It felt so good to be back on the river, with the water slipping by and the trees on the banks going past like a dream. The silence out there on the water wasn't like the silence in the house; it was a peaceful silence, a healing silence. We didn't talk much for a long time, just drifted. I told Jim about everything that had happened, about Buck and the feud and all the killing. He listened quiet, his face looking sad. He said he'd been hiding in the swamp ever since the shooting started, scared to death somebody would find him and take him back. He'd seen some of it from a distance, heard the guns, and knew it was bad trouble. He'd managed to get the raft hidden away good. We both felt the same way about it. That whole business was awful and senseless. It made you feel small and dirty just thinking about it. But out on the river, under the big sky, it felt like we could wash it all away. The river was our friend. It carried us away from the trouble, away from the dead people and the crying and the hate. It was just us and the river again, heading south, towards freedom. It felt like we'd been given a second chance. We lay on the raft, looking up at the stars coming out, and it was the most beautiful sight in the world. No houses, no parlors, no watchers, no feuds. Just the river and the stars and the quiet. It was home."

The sun was shining, and pleasant kind of weather, and if I was ever to feel down and disappointed about anything, it seemed like this warn't the time to do it. Well, just then the undertaker he fetched a sigh, not a loud one, but just a kind of gentle living sigh, and then he picked up the screw-driver and went to work. Well, I thought, here's a go. If anybody has got that money, it's him. And then I thought, well, if it ain't him it's somebody else; anyway, they've got it, and that's the end of the row. And then I thought, well, maybe it ain't gone, after all. I'll wait and see. So I waited. He worked a good while, and pretty soon he got the lid fastened down, and they carried the coffin out and put it in the hearse. Then they all got in their carriages and started.

I had done everything I could to help her, and here I was, in a worse fix than ever. I had got the money, and I had hid it, and I had told her about it, and she had gone and told the truth, and now the money was gone, and I didn't know where it was, and I didn't know who had got it, and I didn't know what to do. I set there a long time, and I got to thinking about how I had told her to write to the lawyer, and how she had gone and done it, and how I had told her to tell the truth, and how she had gone and done it, and how I had told her to keep dark about the money, and how she had gone and told about it.

He was a long, lanky man with a face like a wet week. He moved quiet and solemn, like he was afraid of waking the dead. He got the lid off the box and was just about to screw it down when old Colonel Grangerford stepped up, looking grim as judgment. He didn't say a word, just stood there, and then Buck's mother let out a terrible cry and fell on the coffin. Everybody was crying and moaning, and it was awful. Then, all of a sudden, there was a big commotion outside. Shots rang out! The feud had busted loose right there at the funeral. Men grabbed their guns, women screamed, and it was a stampede. I didn't wait to see who was shooting who. I just lit out for the woods as fast as my legs could carry me, my heart pounding like a drum. The peace was shattered, and death was everywhere again."

          "text_segment": "Next day was auction day. About broad day in the morning the king and the duke come up in the garret and woke me up, and I see by their look that there was trouble. The king says:\n“Was you in my room night before last?”\n“No, your majesty”—which was the way I always called him when nobody but our gang warn’t around.\n“Was you in there yisterday er last night?”\n“No, your majesty.”\n“Honor bright, now—no lies.”\n“Honor bright, your majesty, I’m telling you the truth. I hain’t been a-near your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the duke and showed it to you.”\nThe duke says:\n“Have you seen anybody else go in there?”\n“No, your grace, not as I remember, I believe.”\n“Stop and think.”\nI studied awhile and see my chance; then I says:\n“Well, I see the niggers go in there several times.”\nBoth of them gave a little jump, and looked like they hadn’t ever expected it, and then like they had. Then the duke says:\n“What, all of them?”\n“No—leastways, not all at once—that is, I don’t think I ever see them all come out at once but just one time.”\n“Hello! When was that?”\n“It was the day we had the funeral. In the morning. It warn’t early, because I overslept. I was just starting down the ladder, and I see them.”\n“Well, go on, go on! What did they do? How’d they act?”\n“They didn’t do nothing. And they didn’t act anyway much, as fur as I see. They tiptoed away; so I seen, easy enough, that they’d shoved in there to do up your majesty’s room, or something, s’posing you was up; and found you warn’t up, and so they was hoping to slide out of the way of trouble without waking you up, if they hadn’t already waked you up.”\n“Great guns, this is a go!” says the king; and both of them looked pretty sick and tolerable silly. They stood there a-thinking and scratching their heads a minute, and the duke he bust into a kind of a little raspy chuckle, and says:\n“It does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand. They let on to be sorry they was going out of this region! And I believed they was sorry, and so did you, and so did everybody. Don’t ever tell me any more that a nigger ain’t got any histrionic talent. Why, the way they played that thing it would fool anybody. In my opinion, there’s a fortune in ’em. If I had capital and a theater, I wouldn’t want a better lay-out than that—and here we’ve gone and sold ’em for a song. Yes, and ain’t privileged to sing the song yet. Say, where is that song—that draft?”\n“In the bank for to be collected. Where would it be?”\n“Well, that’s all right then, thank goodness.”\nSays I, kind of timid-like:\n“Is something gone wrong?”\nThe king whirls on me and rips out:\n“None o’ your business! You keep your head shet, and mind y’r own affairs—if you got any. Long as you’re in this town don’t you forgit that—you hear?” Then he says to the duke, “We got to jest swaller it and say noth’n’: mum’s the word for us.”\nAs they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again, and says:\n“Quick sales and small profits! It’s a good business—yes.”\nThe king snarls around on him and says:\n“I was trying to do for the best in sellin’ ’em out so quick. If the profits has turned out to be none, lackin’ considable, and none to carry, is it my fault any more’n it’s yourn?”\n“Well, they’d be in this house yet and we wouldn’t if I could a got my advice listened to.”\nThe king sassed back as much as was safe for him, and then swapped around and lit into me again. He give me down the banks for not coming and telling him I see the niggers come out of his room acting that way—said any fool would a knowed something was up. And then waltzed in and cussed himself awhile, and said it all come of him not laying late and taking his natural rest that morning, and he’d be blamed if he’d ever do it again. So they went off a-jawing; and I felt dreadful glad I’d worked it all off on to the niggers, and yet hadn’t done the niggers no harm by it.",

So I come down the ladder and started for down-stairs; but as I come to the girls’ room the door was open, and I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk, which was open and she’d been packing things in it—getting ready to go to England. But she had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap, and had her face in her hands, crying. I felt awful bad to see it; of course anybody would. I went in there and says:\n“Miss Mary Jane, you can’t a-bear to see people in trouble, and I can’t—most always. Tell me about it.”\nSo she done it. And it was the niggers—I just expected it. She said the beautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for her; she didn’t know how she was ever going to be happy there, knowing the mother and the children warn’t ever going to see each other no more—and then busted out bitterer than ever, and flung up her hands, and says:\n“Oh, dear, dear, to think they ain’t ever going to see each other any more!”\n“But they will—and inside of two weeks—and I know it!” says I.\nLaws, it was out before I could think! And before I could budge she throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it again, say it again, say it again!\nI see I had spoke too sudden and said too much, and was in a close place. I asked her to let me think a minute; and she set there, very impatient and excited and handsome, but looking kind of happy and eased-up, like a person that’s had a tooth pulled out. So I went to studying it out. I says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks, though I ain’t had no experience, and can’t say for certain; but it looks so to me, anyway; and yet here’s a case where I’m blest if it don’t look to me like the truth is better and actuly safer than a lie. I must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time or other, it’s so kind of strange and unregular. I never see nothing like it. Well, I says to myself at last, I’m a-going to chance it; I’ll up and tell the truth this time, though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see where you’ll go to. Then I says:\n“Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways where you could go and stay three or four days?”\n“Yes; Mr. Lothrop’s. Why?”\n“Never mind why yet. If I’ll tell you how I know the niggers will see each other again inside of two weeks—here in this house—and prove how I know it—will you go to Mr. Lothrop’s and stay four days?”\n“Four days!” she says; “I’ll stay a year!”\n“All right,” I says, “I don’t want nothing more out of you than just your word—I druther have it than another man’s kiss-the-Bible.” She smiled and reddened up very sweet, and I says, “If you don’t mind it, I’ll shut the door—and bolt it.”\nThen I come back and set down again, and says:\n“Don’t you holler. Just set still and take it like a man. I got to tell the truth, and you want to brace up, Miss Mary, because it’s a bad kind, and going to be hard to take, but there ain’t no help for it. These uncles of yourn ain’t no uncles at all; they’re a couple of frauds—regular dead-beats. There, now we’re over the worst of it, you can stand the rest middling easy.”\nIt jolted her up like everything, of course; but I was over the shoal water now, so I went right along, her eyes a-blazing higher and higher all the time, and told her every blame thing, from where we first struck that young fool going up to the steamboat, clear through to where she flung herself on to the king’s breast at the front door and he kissed her sixteen or seventeen times—and then up she jumps, with her face afire like sunset, and says:\n“The brute! Come, don’t waste a minute—not a second—we’ll have them tarred and feathered, and flung in the river!”",

The doctor and the widow had been up a good while, but Mary Jane was setting by her door in the wood-shed, crying—not just crying, but crying hard. I opened the door easy and stepped in, and says:\n\n“Miss Mary Jane, you can’t a-bear it no longer—you got to tell me. Tell me what it is.”\n\nShe hid her face in her hands, and not make a sound. I set down close by her, and says:\n\n“Miss Mary Jane, don’t take on so—I come to tell you.”\n\nShe took her hands away and stood up, looking towards me. I knowed what it was about. I judged she was feeling worried about the niggers. She stood awhile, and then says, in a voice that didn’t sound like a natural voice:\n\n“Come in here, Huck.”\n\nShe opened the door of her room, and I went in. She shut it very soft, and motioned me to set down on the side of the bed. Then she set down too, and took my hand in hers, and begun to sob, and says:\n\n“Poor things! poor things! Can’t anybody do anything for them, Huck? You feel for them, don’t you?”\n\n“Yes, ma’am, I do.”\n\nShe took a breath, and waited, and then says:\n\n“I sha’n’t ever see them again in this world, I don’t believe. And they’ve been good to me. They hain’t ever done me no harm. It’s a cruel business!”\n\nShe sobbed some more, and then says:\n\n“Huck, can’t you reckon up something to do for them? I’ve tried, and it hain’t no use. They’ve got two weeks to raise the money in, and sell them down the river. They can’t raise it; of course they can’t. And they’re only going to one place, and they hain’t going there together. And they hain’t got no friends but what’s here; and however friends is going to help them, I don’t know. They declare as how they hain’t got no father, nor mother, nor brothers, nor sisters.”\n\nShe sobbed again, and I said:\n\n“Why, bless you, honey, when I was down at the plantation, all the darkies made such a fuss over me, and so did the niggers I hain’t seen before, and I don’t know no more about it then what I knowed before, but all I know is, they said they hadn’t no father, nor mother, nor brothers, nor sisters, and so I couldn’t see no way for them to get together again.”\n\n“Oh, Huck, you know I hain’t got no patience with you. You don’t seem to understand. Can’t you see that they’ll never get together again? that they’re going to be separated forever?”\n\nI see it warn’t no use to try to play it any longer. I had to tell her the truth. I says:\n\n“Why, bless your soul, they ain’t going to be separated at all! They’re going to be together again in two weeks, and they ain’t going to be sold down the river, they’re going to stay right here in this town, and they’re going to be free!”\n\nShe looked at me like I was crazy, and says:\n\n“Huck, what are you talking about? Are you out of your mind?”\n\n“No, ma’am, I ain’t out of my mind. I’m telling you the truth. They ain’t going to be sold, and they ain’t going to be separated. They’re going to be free, and they’re going to stay right here.”\n\n“But how do you know that, Huck? How can you be so sure?”\n\n“Why, I know it because I know the people that’s doing it. I know the whole business.”\n\n“Do you mean to say that you know the people that’s going to buy them?”\n\n“No, ma’am, I don’t mean that. I mean I know the people that’s selling them, and I know they ain’t going to sell them.”\n\n“But they’ve already sold them, Huck. The bill of sale is signed.”\n\n“Yes, ma’am, I know that. But that ain’t the whole story. There’s more to it than that.”\n\n“Well, what is it, Huck? Tell me! Don’t keep me in suspense!”\n\nI thought a minute, and then I says:\n\n“Miss Mary Jane, you got to do something for me first.”\n\n“Anything, Huck, anything! Just tell me what it is.”\n\n“Well, you got to go away from here for a little while. You got to go to Mr. Lothrop’s and stay there for three or four days.”\n\n“But why, Huck? Why do I have to go away?”\n\n“Because I can’t tell you the whole story unless you do. It’s a secret, and I can’t tell it to you here.”\n\n“But I don’t understand, Huck. Why can’t you tell me here?”\n\n“Because if I tell you here, it’ll get out, and it’ll spoil everything. You got to go away so I can tell you without anybody else hearing.”\n\nShe looked at me for a long time, and then she says:\n\n“Huck, I don’t know what you’re talking about, but I trust you.

But do you mean before you go to Mr. Lothrop’s, or—”\n“Oh,” she says, “what am I thinking about!” she says, and set right down again. “Don’t mind what I said—please don’t—you won’t, now, will you?” Laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that I said I would die first. “I never thought, I was so stirred up,” she says; “now go on, and I won’t do so any more. You tell me what to do, and whatever you say I’ll do it.”\n“Well,” I says, “it’s a rough gang, them two frauds, and I’m fixed so I got to travel with them a while longer, whether I want to or not—I druther not tell you why; and if you was to blow on them this town would get me out of their claws, and I’d be all right; but there’d be another person that you don’t know about who’d be in big trouble. Well, we got to save him, hain’t we? Of course. Well, then, we won’t blow on them.”\nSaying them words put a good idea in my head. I see how maybe I could get me and Jim rid of the frauds; get them jailed here, and then leave. But I didn’t want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard to answer questions but me; so I didn’t want the plan to begin working till pretty late to-night. I says:\n“Miss Mary Jane, I’ll tell you what we’ll do, and you won’t have to stay at Mr. Lothrop’s so long, nuther. How fur is it?”\n“A little short of four miles—right out in the country, back here.”\n“Well, that’ll answer. Now you go along out there, and lay low till nine or half-past to-night, and then get them to fetch you home again—tell them you’ve thought of something. If you get here before eleven put a candle in this window, and if I don’t turn up wait till eleven, and then if I don’t turn up it means I’m gone, and out of the way, and safe. Then you come out and spread the news around, and get these beats jailed.”\n“Good,” she says, “I’ll do it.”\n“And if it just happens so that I don’t get away, but get took up along with them, you must up and say I told you the whole thing beforehand, and you must stand by me all you can.”\n“Stand by you! indeed I will. They sha’n’t touch a hair of your head!” she says, and I see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said it, too.\n“If I get away I sha’n’t be here,” I says, “to prove these rapscallions ain’t your uncles, and I couldn’t do it if I was here. I could swear they was beats and bummers, that’s all, though that’s worth something. Well, there’s others can do that better than what I can, and they’re people that ain’t going to be doubted as quick as I’d be. I’ll tell you how to find them. Gimme a pencil and a piece of paper. There—‘Royal Nonesuch, Bricksville.’ Put it away, and don’t lose it. When the court wants to find out something about these two, let them send up to Bricksville and say they’ve got the men that played the Royal Nonesuch, and ask for some witnesses—why, you’ll have that entire town down here before you can hardly wink, Miss Mary. And they’ll come a-biling, too.”\nI judged we had got everything fixed about right now. So I says:\n“Just let the auction go right along, and don’t worry. Nobody don’t have to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction on accounts of the short notice, and they ain’t going out of this till they get that money; and the way we’ve fixed it the sale ain’t going to count, and they ain’t going to get no money. It’s just like the way it was with the niggers—it warn’t no sale, and the niggers will be back before long. Why, they can’t collect the money for the niggers yet—they’re in the worst kind of a fix, Miss Mary.”\n“Well,” she says, “I’ll run down to breakfast now, and then I’ll start straight for Mr. Lothrop’s.”",

What was it?”\n“Why, it’s because you ain’t one of these leather-face people. I don’t want no better book than what your face is. A body can set down and read it off like coarse print. Do you reckon you can go and face your uncles when they come to kiss you good-morning, and never—”\n“There, there, don’t! Yes, I’ll go before breakfast—I’ll be glad to. And leave my sisters with them?”\n“Yes; never mind about them. They’ve got to stand it yet a while. They might suspicion something if all of you was to go. I don’t want you to see them, nor your sisters, nor nobody in this town; if a neighbor was to ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something. No, you go right along, Miss Mary Jane, and I’ll fix it with all of them. I’ll tell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles and say you’ve went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change, or to see a friend, and you’ll be back to-night or early in the morning.”\n“Gone to see a friend is all right, but I won’t have my love given to them.”\n“Well, then, it sha’n’t be.” It was well enough to tell her so—no harm in it. It was only a little thing to do, and no trouble; and it’s the little things that smooths people’s roads the most, down here below; it would make Mary Jane comfortable, and it wouldn’t cost nothing. Then I says: “There’s one more thing—that bag of money.”\n“Well, they’ve got that; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think how they got it.”\n“No, you’re out, there. They hain’t got it.”\n“Why, who’s got it?”\n“I wish I knowed, but I don’t. I had it, because I stole it from them; and I stole it to give to you; and I know where I hid it, but I’m afraid it ain’t there no more. I’m awful sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I’m just as sorry as I can be; but I done the best I could; I did honest. I come nigh getting caught, and I had to shove it into the first place I come to, and run—and it warn’t a good place.”\n“Oh, stop blaming yourself—it’s too bad to do it, and I won’t allow it—you couldn’t help it; it wasn’t your fault. Where did you hide it?”\nI didn’t want to set her to thinking about her troubles again; and I couldn’t seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach. So for a minute I didn’t say nothing; then I says:\n“I’d ruther not tell you where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, if you don’t mind letting me off; but I’ll write it for you on a piece of paper, and you can read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop’s, if you want to. Do you reckon that’ll do?”\n“Oh, yes.”\nSo I wrote: “I put it in the coffin. It was in there when you was crying there, away in the night. I was behind the door, and I was mighty sorry for you, Miss Mary Jane.”\nIt made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by herself in the night, and them devils laying there right under her own roof, shaming her and robbing her; and when I folded it up and give it to her I see the water come into her eyes, too; and she shook me by the hand, hard, and says:\n“Good-bye. I’m going to do everything just as you’ve told me; and if I don’t ever see you again, I sha’n’t ever forget you and I’ll think of you a many and a many a time, and I’ll pray for you, too!”—and she was gone.\nPray for me! I reckoned if she knowed me she’d take a job that was more nearer her size. But I bet she done it, just the same—she was just that kind. She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notion—there warn’t no back-down to her, I judge. You may say what you want to, but in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see; in my opinion she was just full of sand. It sounds like flattery, but it ain’t no flattery. And when it comes to beauty—and goodness, too—she lays over them all. I hain’t ever seen her since that time that I see her go out of that door; no, I hain’t ever seen her since, but I reckon I’ve thought of her a many and a many a million times, and of her saying she would pray for me; and if ever I’d a thought it would do any good for me to pray for her, blamed if I wouldn’t a done it or bust.",

This way, you’ll be safe at Mr. Lothrop’s, and they won’t suspect a thing till it’s too late for them to do anything but get caught.”\n\nShe thought for a minute, biting her lip. Then she straightened up. “All right, Huck. I’ll do it. It’s dreadful, but I’ll do it. I’ll go right now.”\n\n“That’s the girl!” I says, feeling a load lift off me. “Now, slip out quiet. Don’t let nobody see you. Go out the back way, through the garden, and make for Mr. Lothrop’s. And remember about the letter and ten o’clock.”\n\nShe nodded again, her eyes determined now.

A body might stump his toe, and take pison, and fall down the well, and break his neck, and bust his brains out, and somebody come along and ask what killed him, and some numskull up and say, ‘Why, he stumped his toe.’ Would ther’ be any sense in that? No. And ther’ ain’t no sense in this, nuther. Is it ketching?”\n“Is it ketching? Why, how you talk. Is a harrow catching—in the dark? If you don’t hitch on to one tooth, you’re bound to on another, ain’t you? And you can’t get away with that tooth without fetching the whole harrow along, can you? Well, these kind of mumps is a kind of a harrow, as you may say—and it ain’t no slouch of a harrow, nuther, you come to get it hitched on good.”\n“Well, it’s awful, I think,” says the hare-lip. “I’ll go to Uncle Harvey and—”\n“Oh, yes,” I says, “I would. Of course I would. I wouldn’t lose no time.”\n“Well, why wouldn’t you?”\n“Just look at it a minute, and maybe you can see. Hain’t your uncles obleegd to get along home to England as fast as they can? And do you reckon they’d be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that journey by yourselves? You know they’ll wait for you. So fur, so good. Your uncle Harvey’s a preacher, ain’t he? Very well, then; is a preacher going to deceive a steamboat clerk? is he going to deceive a ship clerk?—so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard? Now you know he ain’t. What will he do, then? Why, he’ll say, ‘It’s a great pity, but my church matters has got to get along the best way they can; for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus-unum mumps, and so it’s my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months it takes to show on her if she’s got it.’ But never mind, if you think it’s best to tell your uncle Harvey—”\n“Shucks, and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good times in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Jane’s got it or not? Why, you talk like a muggins.”\n“Well, anyway, maybe you’d better tell some of the neighbors.”\n“Listen at that, now. You do beat all for natural stupidness. Can’t you see that they’d go and tell? Ther’ ain’t no way but just to not tell anybody at all.”\n“Well, maybe you’re right—yes, I judge you are right.”\n“But I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey she’s gone out a while, anyway, so he won’t be uneasy about her?”\n“Yes, Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that. She says, ‘Tell them to give Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss, and say I’ve run over the river to see Mr.’—Mr.—what is the name of that rich family your uncle Peter used to think so much of?—I mean the one that—”\n“Why, you must mean the Apthorps, ain’t it?”\n“Of course; bother them kind of names, a body can’t ever seem to remember them, half the time, somehow. Yes, she said, say she has run over for to ask the Apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy this house, because she allowed her uncle Peter would ruther they had it than anybody else; and she’s going to stick to them till they say they’ll come, and then, if she ain’t too tired, she’s coming home; and if she is, she’ll be home in the morning anyway. She said, don’t say nothing about the Proctors, but only about the Apthorps—which’ll be perfectly true, because she is going there to speak about their buying the house; I know it, because she told me so herself.”\n“All right,” they said, and cleared out to lay for their uncles, and give them the love and the kisses, and tell them the message.\nEverything was all right now. The girls wouldn’t say nothing because they wanted to go to England; and the king and the duke would ruther Mary Jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of Doctor Robinson. I felt very good; I judged I had done it pretty neat—I reckoned Tom Sawyer couldn’t a done it no neater himself. Of course he would a throwed more style into it, but I can’t do that very handy, not being brung up to it.",

She was up-stairs in a second, and down-stairs in a second, and out she slid, and nobody the wiser, not even them big sisters, which was asleep. I judged that when they got up they wouldn't find her, and then the game would be up. So I slid down, myself, and struck for the back stairs and out into the yard. I stood in the dark and the rain a minute, and I was feeling right down solid miserable, for the rain came down, and I didn't know what to do; and I didn't know where to go for good and all; because I didn't like the idea of trusting the king and the duke, and I didn't like to trust anybody else. But I felt anxious about Mary Jane, so I struck out for the back gate and fetched up at the back door of the tavern. There was a light in the dining-room, and I crept to the window and peeped in. Mary Jane was setting there, looking pale and sick, and sorrowful. The minute a body sees a thing like that, they know what it's for. She's a-crying. I felt a good deal better, then, because I knowed she was all right now. She was suffering, but that was nothing; she was alive and safe and out of the way of harm. But what was high-pressure on me was Mary Jane's sisters, what was still in the house with that gang, and so I lit out for there, and got up to the back door stealthy and slipped in. I was feeling ever so thankful to think they hadn't waked up yet. Mary Jane she had told me where they slept, and I crept up there and eased in and see they were sound asleep. They wasn't looking well, of course, but they was sound asleep. And them four hundred and fifteen dollars was as safe as if it was in the bank. Well, I stood there a minute or two, thinking. Then I reckoned I better wake up the sisters and tell them what was o'clock. So I waked them up, gentle, and they stared around and looked scared, till I whispered and said it was only me.

            "prefix-probing": "Well, Mary Jane she lit out the back way, I reckon; because nobody see her go. It was right smart of her, and I knowed she wouldn't budge till I give the word. I felt powerful lonesome and shaky for a minute, thinking about her being gone and me left there amongst them frauds. But I didn't have no time to stand around shivering. I had to get that money. I slipped out of the room and down the stairs, my heart thumping like a drum. The house was quiet, but it felt like every board creaked just to spite me. I got to the parlor door and peeked in. The King and the Duke was still in there, talking low and serious. I reckon they was figuring out how to skin the rest of the property. I eased on past and went into the little room where the coffin was. It was dark and spooky in there, and the smell of death was heavy. I felt a cold sweat break out on me. I knowed I had to do it quick. I got down on my hands and knees by the coffin. My fingers trembled as I fumbled with the lid. It was heavy, and I had to strain to lift it just a little bit. I shoved my hand in under the edge, feeling around in the dark. It was awful. I expected to touch something cold and clammy any second. But my fingers closed on the bag. It was heavy, all right. I pulled it out slow and careful, trying not to make a sound. I got it out and let the lid down easy. Then I just knelt there for a second, holding the bag, my breath coming in short gasps. I had it. I had the money. Now what? I couldn't just walk out with it. I had to hide it again, somewhere safe, till I could get it to Mary Jane or figure out some other way. I thought about the cellar, but that seemed too risky. Too many places for them to look. I thought about the woods, but it was dark outside, and I didn't want to be stumbling around in the dark with that much money. My eyes fell on the big old clock in the corner of the room. It was one of them tall grandfather clocks. I got an idea. I stood up, still holding the bag tight. I opened the little door at the bottom of the clock. It was empty inside, just the weights and pendulum hanging there. I shoved the bag in amongst the weights. It fit snug. I closed the door and stood back, trying to look natural. My hands were still shaking. I felt a little better knowing the money wasn't in the coffin anymore, but I was still in a heap of trouble. I had to get out of there before they missed Mary Jane or got suspicious. I crept back out of the room and towards the back door. I heard voices in the parlor again, louder this time. I froze. It sounded like they was arguing. I couldn't make out what they was saying, but the tone was ugly. I didn't wait to hear more. I slipped out the back door and into the yard. The night air felt good on my face. I stood there for a minute, trying to decide what to do next. I wanted to get to Mary Jane, but I didn't know if it was safe. What if they had already figured out she was gone? What if they suspected me? I decided the best thing was to lay low for a bit and see what happened. I crept around the side of the house and hid behind some bushes near the parlor window. I could hear them plain now. They was yelling at each other. The King was accusing the Duke of trying to cheat him out of his share. The Duke was yelling back, saying the King was a greedy old fool. They was calling each other names and cussing something awful. It was a real show. I almost forgot I was in danger, watching them go at it. They was so busy fighting, they didn't even notice the steamboat whistle blowing down at the landing. I heard it, though. And then I heard a commotion down the street. Voices getting louder, footsteps hurrying. I peeked through the bushes. A crowd was coming up the street towards the house. And in the middle of the crowd, I saw two men that looked mighty familiar. One of them was tall and thin, with a long face and a kind of stoop. The other was shorter and stouter, with a round face and a bald head. My heart jumped into my mouth. It was the real Wilks brothers! Peter Wilks's actual brothers, Harvey and William, come all the way from England. I knowed it was them the minute I saw them. They looked just like the pictures Mary Jane had showed me. The crowd stopped in front of the house. The King and the Duke came rushing out onto the porch, looking surprised and a little scared. The tall man, Harvey, stepped forward. He looked around at the crowd, then his eyes fell on the King. \"Who are you, sir?\" he said, his voice clear and strong. The King puffed himself up. \"I am your brother, Harvey Wilks, come to claim my inheritance!\" he boomed out. Harvey just stared at him for a second, and then he let out a laugh. It wasn't a mean laugh, but it was full of disbelief. \"My brother Harvey?\" he said. \"Why, I am Harvey Wilks! And this,\" he said, putting a hand on the shorter man's shoulder, \"is my brother William.\" The crowd started murmuring. The King's face went white. The Duke looked like he wanted to sink through the floor. \"This is an outrage!\" the King sputtered. \"These men are impostors! I am Harvey Wilks!\" The real Harvey Wilks just shook his head. \"We have papers,\" he said. \"Letters from our brother Peter, describing us. And we have friends here in town who know us.\" He pointed to a couple of men in the crowd. They nodded their heads. The King and the Duke was trapped. They didn't know what to say. The crowd was getting restless. People was starting to look suspicious."

Oh, he done it admirable. Lots of the principal people gethered around the king, to let him see they was on his side. That old gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death. Pretty soon he begun to speak, and I see straight off he pronounced like an Englishman—not the king’s way, though the king’s was pretty good for an imitation. I can’t give the old gent’s words, nor I can’t imitate him; but he turned around to the crowd, and says, about like this:\n“This is a surprise to me which I wasn’t looking for; and I’ll acknowledge, candid and frank, I ain’t very well fixed to meet it and answer it; for my brother and me has had misfortunes; he’s broke his arm, and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the night by a mistake. I am Peter Wilks’ brother Harvey, and this is his brother William, which can’t hear nor speak—and can’t even make signs to amount to much, now’t he’s only got one hand to work them with.

The doctor says:\n“Neighbors, I don’t know whether the new couple is frauds or not; but if these two ain’t frauds, I am an idiot, that’s all.

Said his brother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn’t tried to write—he see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute he put the pen to paper. And so he warmed up and went warbling and warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was saying himself; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in, and says:\n“I’ve thought of something. Is there anybody here that helped to lay out my br—helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?”\n“Yes,” says somebody, “me and Ab Turner done it. We’re both here.”\nThen the old man turns towards the king, and says:\n“Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast?”\nBlamed if the king didn’t have to brace up mighty quick, or he’d a squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took him so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make most anybody sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any notice, because how was he going to know what was tattooed on the man? He whitened a little; he couldn’t help it; and it was mighty still in there, and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him. Says I to myself, Now he’ll throw up the sponge—there ain’t no more use. Well, did he? A body can’t hardly believe it, but he didn’t. I reckon he thought he’d keep the thing up till he tired them people out, so they’d thin out, and him and the duke could break loose and get away. Anyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says:\n“Mf! It’s a very tough question, ain’t it! Yes, sir, I k’n tell you what’s tattooed on his breast. It’s jest a small, thin, blue arrow—that’s what it is; and if you don’t look clost, you can’t see it. Now what do you say—hey?”\nWell, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out cheek.\nThe new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, and his eye lights up like he judged he’d got the king this time, and says:\n“There—you’ve heard what he said! Was there any such mark on Peter Wilks’ breast?”\nBoth of them spoke up and says:\n“We didn’t see no such mark.”\n“Good!” says the old gentleman. “Now, what you did see on his breast was a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he was young), and a W, with dashes between them, so: P—B—W”—and he marked them that way on a piece of paper. “Come, ain’t that what you saw?”\nBoth of them spoke up again, and says:\n“No, we didn’t. We never seen any marks at all.”",

This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever was in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different from what I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time if I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to save me and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in the world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks. If they didn’t find them—\nI couldn’t bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn’t think about nothing else. It got darker and darker, and it was a beautiful time to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by the wrist—Hines—and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip.

Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so, and I reckon he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited and panting.\nAll of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare, and somebody sings out:\n“By the living jingo, here’s the bag of gold on his breast!”\nHines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist and give a big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I lit out and shinned for the road in the dark there ain’t nobody can tell.",

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the protagonist's internal reflection about wishing a particular character was present to help, which is a significant part of the original's early section.\n- The completion invents a period of waiting and confusion at the graveyard before digging begins, which is not present in the original.\n- The completion does not include the detail about the lack of a lantern and the sending of someone to fetch one, which is a key event in the middle of the passage.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion leaves out the protagonist's thoughts about a missed opportunity for help and the sense of regret regarding a specific character's absence.\n- The description of the crowd's noisy procession and the protagonist's feelings of fear and being overwhelmed are less developed or missing.\n- The completion does not mention the protagonist being physically restrained by a specific individual, nor the comparison to a famous strong figure, which is important for conveying the sense of being trapped.\n- The original's detailed depiction of the storm intensifying, the flickering lightning, and the crowd's disregard for the weather is condensed and lacks the progression found in the source.\n- The moment of suspense regarding the tattoo-marks and their significance is omitted.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces a period of silence and waiting at the graveyard, which is not accurate to the sequence of events in the original.\n- The digging is described as happening in silence and with a rope used to hoist the coffin, which does not match the original's depiction of the crowd's behavior and the process.\n- The completion attributes the discovery of the gold to a generic shout, rather than capturing the specific exclamation and the dramatic effect of the lightning.\n- The protagonist's escape is described with more generic storm imagery and lacks the specific details about how the restraint is released and the immediate actions taken.\n- The emotional tone at the end is shifted, focusing more on fear and less on the sense of sudden opportunity and chaos present in the original."

No light there; the house all dark—which made me feel sorry and disappointed, I didn’t know why. But at last, just as I was sailing by, flash comes the light in Mary Jane’s window! and my heart swelled up sudden, like to bust; and the same second the house and all was behind me in the dark, and wasn’t ever going to be before me no more in this world. She was the best girl I ever see, and had the most sand.\nThe minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the tow-head, I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow, and the first time the lightning showed me one that wasn’t chained I snatched it and shoved. It was a canoe, and warn’t fastened with nothing but a rope. The tow-head was a rattling big distance off, away out there in the middle of the river, but I didn’t lose no time; and when I struck the raft at last I was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp if I could afforded it. But I didn’t. As I sprung aboard I sung out:\n“Out with you, Jim, and set her loose! Glory be to goodness, we’re shut of them!”\nJim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms spread, he was so full of joy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in my mouth and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was old King Lear and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it most scared the livers and lights out of me. But Jim fished me out, and was going to hug me and bless me, and so on, he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the king and the duke, but I says:\n“Not now; have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast!

I didn’t stop for a second till I was clean outside of the town. I wished I hadn’t shoved the candle under the bed when I done it, because now I hadn’t any light, and of course I didn’t dare to strike a match. I trotted along, and kept my eye out for that tow-head all the time, calculating it was about two mile above town. I see it now and then when the lightning busted out. Well, I got down towards the river, and I didn’t see no canoe nor nothing. I felt kind of discouraged, and was going to loaf along a little further, when here comes a raging thunder-gust from the upper end of the river, and stoutened me up; and I started on again at a trot. The bank was all wooded and thick, and I couldn’t see the river no way, for a long distance. All at once I come upon a canoe, and she was hauled up just a little way below the head of the island. I shoved her in and jumped aboard, and paddled off. I didn’t take no half-second to think. The lightning showed me the tow-head, and I aimed for that. It was a long pull, and a hard one, but I paddled right along and never stopped to take breath. I was dead tired when I got to the tow-head, and I laid there and rested a minute. Then I shoved off again. I was afraid the lightning would show me, and I didn’t want to be seen. I paddled along, and got close to the raft before I seen her. The lightning showed her to me. I was right against her. I laid on my oars and called out, “Jim!” There wasn’t no answer. I called again, “Jim!” Still no answer. I was getting scared. I called out, “Jim, I’m here!” He answered, “Who dat?” I said, “It’s me, Huck.” He says, “Is dat you, Huck? What in de name o’ goodness is you doin’ here?” I says, “Jim, I’m here! I’m here!

And I begun to wish I hadn’t come ashore at all; but it was too late now. I struck the road again, and trotted along for about a mile, and then I see a light a little ways ahead. I slowed up and went on tiptoe. When I got close I see it was a house. I hadn’t seen any light there before. I crept up and peeped in. It was the house where I had been staying. I see a light in the window. I felt kind of disappointed, because I was hoping to see Mary Jane. I crept up closer and peeped in again. I see Mary Jane sitting by the table, reading. I felt kind of glad, and kind of sorry, both together. I knew I wouldn’t see her again, maybe never in this world. I went away and trotted along again.

But he grabbed me and hugged me up tight, and says: “Bless yo’ soul, honey, I’s mighty glad to see you! You ain’t dead—you ain’t drownded—you’s back agin! It’s too good for true, honey, it’s too good for true! Lemme look at you, chile, lemme look at you, bless de Lord! Say, how DID you come to git away, Huck?” Well, I begun to laugh, and couldn’t help it. The minute I seen him I knowed him, but I done forgot he was dressed up.

There, now!”\n“Well, then, I b’lieve you. But answer me only jest this one more—now don’t git mad; didn’t you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide it?”\nThe duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he says:\n“Well, I don’t care if I did, I didn’t do it, anyway. But you not only had it in mind to do it, but you done it.”\n“I wisht I never die if I done it, duke, and that’s honest. I won’t say I warn’t goin’ to do it, because I was; but you—I mean somebody—got in ahead o’ me.”\n“It’s a lie! You done it, and you got to say you done it, or—”\nThe king began to gurgle, and then he gasps out:\n“’Nough!—I own up!”\nI was very glad to hear him say that; it made me feel much more easier than what I was feeling before. So the duke took his hands off and says:\n“If you ever deny it again I’ll drown you. It’s well for you to set there and blubber like a baby—it’s fitten for you, after the way you’ve acted. I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble everything—and I a-trusting you all the time, like you was my own father. You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot of poor niggers, and you never say a word for ’em. It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to believe that rubbage. Cuss you, I can see now why you was so anxious to make up the deffisit—you wanted to get what money I’d got out of the Nonesuch and one thing or another, and scoop it all!”\nThe king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:\n“Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffisit; it warn’t me.”\n“Dry up! I don’t want to hear no more out of you!” says the duke. “And now you see what you got by it. They’ve got all their own money back, and all of ourn but a shekel or two besides. G’long to bed, and don’t you deffersit me no more deffersits, long ’s you live!”\nSo the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort, and before long the duke tackled his bottle; and so in about a half an hour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got, the lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other’s arms. They both got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn’t get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag again. That made me feel easy and satisfied. Of course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble, and I told Jim everything.",

The river was miles wide, and awful still and grand. \nWe went right along, and looked at the place, and liked it. And Jim says:\n“I wish we could stop here. I ain’t ever seen no place that suits me so well.”\nSo we did stop. We tied up just below the town, in a little cove, that was dark and still and didn’t have no houses close to it, but only cottonwoods and sycamores and big trees that spread their branches away out over the water. \nWe was there a good while, and it was getting late.

I’m a-going ashore,” says the king, and he got up and started.\n“Hold on,” says the duke. “What you going to do?”\n“Well, I’m a-going to do a little private business,” says the king.\n“Well, I reckon I better go along with you,” says the duke.\n“No, you don’t,” says the king. “I’m a-going to do it myself.”\n“Well, I reckon I better go along with you,” says the duke.\n“No, you don’t,” says the king. “I’m a-going to do it myself.”\n“Well, I reckon I better go along with you,” says the duke.\n“No, you don’t,” says the king. “I’m a-going to do it myself.”\n“Well, I reckon I better go along with you,” says the duke.\n“No, you don’t,” says the king. “I’m a-going to do it myself.”\n“Well, I reckon I better go along with you,” says the duke.\n“No, you don’t,” says the king. “I’m a-going to do it myself.”\n“Well, I reckon I better go along with you,” says the duke.\n“No, you don’t,” says the king. “I’m a-going to do it myself.”\n“Well, I reckon I better go along with you,” says the duke.\n“No, you don’t,” says the king. “I",

But I soon give up that notion for two things: she’d be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for leaving her, and so she’d sell him straight down the river again; and if she didn’t, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger, and they’d make Jim feel it all the time, and so he’d feel ornery and disgraced. And then think of me! It would get all around that Huck Finn helped a nigger to get his freedom; and if I was ever to see anybody from that town again I’d be ready to get down and lick his boots for shame. That’s just the way: a person does a low-down thing, and then he don’t want to take no consequences of it. Thinks as long as he can hide it, it ain’t no disgrace. That was my fix exactly. The more I studied about this, the more my conscience went to grinding me, and the more wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling.

I thought I would try it again, and see if I couldn’t work it this time. I got down on my knees, and shut my eyes, and the words wouldn’t come. I tried, they wouldn’t come. It was because my heart warn’t right; it was because I warn’t square; it was because I was playing double. I was letting on to give up sin, but away inside of me I was holding on to the biggest one of all and letting it alone. It warn’t no use my praying; I couldn’t pray. I put my head down on my knees, I was so discouraged and troubled. And when I looked up, I seen the paper on the table. It was a blank piece of paper. I says to myself, I will write to Miss Watson and tell her where Jim is. She’ll fetch him back, and be good to him, and clothe him, and be glad to get him so safe and sound, and I can’t ever feel easy till I do it. I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn’t do it straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking—thinking how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost and going to hell. And went on thinking. And got to thinking over our trip down the river; and I see Jim in the day-time, and Jim in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing. But somehow I couldn’t strike no place to harden me against him, but only the other kind. I’d see him standing my watch on top of his’n, stead of calling me, when I was dead tired. I’d see him rocking along all day, and fretting his heart out, because he couldn’t see his wife and his children. And I’d see how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, after we had been separated, and he was so glad he didn’t know what to do, he just set there a-moaning and a-sobbing, and then he says: “Laws bless you, honey, doan’ I know you? Your voice is all I want. I been a-listening for it, honey—I been a-listening for it this long, long time. Is dat you, honey—is dat you? I knowed you would come back to me.” I couldn’t seem to strike no place to harden me against him, but only the other kind",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces a lengthy, invented reflection on the honesty of various characters (Aunt Polly, the widow, Mary, Pap, etc.) and their attitudes toward lying and borrowing, which is not present in the original passage. This section significantly diverges from the original narrative and adds content that does not belong.\n- The completion omits the entire sequence where the narrator describes his internal struggle with prayer, the realization about his own insincerity, and the specific decision-making process leading up to writing the letter.\n- The actual act of writing the letter, including the content of the letter and the emotional shift that follows, is missing from the completion.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The initial internal conflict about praying and the inability to do so is not fully developed; the specific reasons for this struggle are not clearly articulated.\n- The narrator’s self-awareness about his own duplicity and the acknowledgment of holding onto a particular wrongdoing are not present.\n- The pivotal moment where the narrator decides to write a letter and the immediate emotional relief that follows are absent.\n- The actual text of the letter and the narrator’s signature are not included.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes a series of moral reflections and anecdotes about other characters’ honesty, which are not part of the original passage at this point in the narrative.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion focuses on external examples and memories rather than the narrator’s introspective struggle and decision-making process.\n- The emotional progression is incorrect; the original passage moves from internal conflict to resolution and action, while the completion remains in a loop of reflection and does not reach the decisive act or its emotional aftermath."

So I just took a look, and shoved along, straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was the duke. He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch—three-night performance—like that other time. They had the cheek, them frauds! I was right on him before I could shirk.

We didn’t have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the country till we tired him out. We never got him till dark; then we fetched him over, and I started down for the raft. When I got there and see it was gone, I says to myself, ‘they’ve got into trouble and had to leave; and they’ve took my nigger, which is the only nigger I’ve got in the world, and now I’m in a strange country, and ain’t got no property no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;’ so I set down and cried. I slept in the woods all night. But what did become of the raft, then?—and Jim—poor Jim!”\n“Blamed if I know—that is, what’s become of the raft. That old fool had made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the doggery the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but what he’d spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night and found the raft gone, we said, ‘That little rascal has stole our raft and shook us, and run off down the river.’”\n“I wouldn’t shake my nigger, would I?—the only nigger I had in the world, and the only property.”\n“We never thought of that. Fact is, I reckon we’d come to consider him our nigger; yes, we did consider him so—goodness knows we had trouble enough for him.

That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and the money’s gone.”\n“Sold him?” I says, and begun to cry; “why, he was my nigger, and that was my money. Where is he?—I want my nigger.”\n“Well, you can’t get your nigger, that’s all—so dry up your blubbering. Looky here—do you think you’d venture to blow on us? Blamed if I think I’d trust you. Why, if you was to blow on us—”\nHe stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes before. I went on a-whimpering, and says:\n“I don’t want to blow on nobody; and I ain’t got no time to blow, nohow. I got to turn out and find my nigger.”\nHe looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering on his arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead. At last he says:\n“I’ll tell you something. We got to be here three days. If you’ll promise you won’t blow, and won’t let the nigger blow, I’ll tell you where to find him.”\nSo I promised, and he says:\n“A farmer by the name of Silas Ph—” and then he stopped. You see, he started to tell me the truth; but when he stopped that way, and begun to study and think again, I reckoned he was changing his mind. And so he was. He wouldn’t trust me; he wanted to make sure of having me out of the way the whole three days. So pretty soon he says:\n“The man that bought him is named Abram Foster—Abram G. Foster—and he lives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.”\n“All right,” I says, “I can walk it in three days. And I’ll start this very afternoon.”\n“No you wont, you’ll start now; and don’t you lose any time about it, neither, nor do any gabbling by the way. Just keep a tight tongue in your head and move right along, and then you won’t get into trouble with us, d’ye hear?”\nThat was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for. I wanted to be left free to work my plans.\n“So clear out,” he says; “and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want to. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim is your nigger—some idiots don’t require documents—leastways I’ve heard there’s such down South here. And when you tell him the handbill and the reward’s bogus, maybe he’ll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for getting ’em out. Go ’long now, and tell him anything you want to; but mind you don’t work your jaw any between here and there.”",

Say howdy to him.” And the children, they was about a dozen of them, little white children, they come a-running and a-shaking my hands, and a-saying: “Howdy, cousin Tom!” And the nigger woman, she come a-running and a-shaking my hands, and a-saying: “Howdy, Mars Tom!” And the little nigger children, they come a-running and a-shaking my hands, and a-saying: “Howdy, Mars Tom!” And the two young white women, they come a-running and a-shaking my hands, and a-saying: “Howdy, cousin Tom!” And the man, he come a-running and a-shaking my hands, and a-saying: “Howdy, Tom!” It was a mighty warm welcome, I tell you.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces an entirely new setting and sequence at the beginning, describing a shanty, a man, and two young women, which are not present in the original passage. This is a significant invention.\n- The completion omits the original's detailed description of the protagonist being surrounded by dogs in a wheel-like formation and the specific actions of the dogs.\n- The completion invents a lengthy, repetitive exchange with a woman about being lost and stuttering, which is not part of the original passage.\n- The emotional reunion with the white woman and her children, as well as the recognition and embrace, are missing from the completion.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the original's depiction of the protagonist's trust in Providence leading directly into the encounter with the dogs.\n- The specific sequence where the protagonist is encircled by dogs, with vivid imagery of their behavior and the growing number, is absent.\n- The actions of the woman with the rolling pin dispersing the dogs, and the subsequent return of some dogs to be friendly, are not present.\n- The introduction of the children (both Black and white), their behavior, and the arrival of the white woman with her spinning-stick are omitted.\n- The emotional greeting, physical embrace, and the woman's comments about the protagonist's resemblance and her joy are not included.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately describes the setting, introducing characters and actions (such as a man reading, women sewing, and a woman with glasses) that do not appear in the original.\n- The number and behavior of the dogs are described differently, with invented details about their actions and the people dealing with them.\n- The sequence of events is altered, with the protagonist waiting by a fence and a different order of people emerging from the house.\n- The dialogue and interaction with the woman are inaccurate, focusing on being lost and repeated stuttering, which does not reflect the original's content or emotional tone.\n- The completion fails to capture the original's progression from tension with the dogs to the warm family reunion."

Where’d she get aground?”\nI didn’t rightly know what to say, because I didn’t know whether the boat would be coming up the river or down. But I go a good deal on instinct; and my instinct said she would be coming up—from down towards Orleans. That didn’t help me much, though; for I didn’t know the names of bars down that way. I see I’d got to invent a bar, or forget the name of the one we got aground on—or—Now I struck an idea, and fetched it out:\n“It warn’t the grounding—that didn’t keep us back but a little. We blowed out a cylinder-head.”\n“Good gracious! anybody hurt?”\n“No’m. Killed a nigger.”\n“Well, it’s lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt. Two years ago last Christmas your uncle Silas was coming up from Newrleans on the old Lally Rook, and she blowed out a cylinder-head and crippled a man. And I think he died afterwards. He was a Baptist. Your uncle Silas knowed a family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well. Yes, I remember now, he did die. Mortification set in, and they had to amputate him. But it didn’t save him. Yes, it was mortification—that was it. He turned blue all over, and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection. They say he was a sight to look at. Your uncle’s been up to the town every day to fetch you. And he’s gone again, not more’n an hour ago; he’ll be back any minute now. You must a met him on the road, didn’t you?—oldish man, with a—”\n“No, I didn’t see nobody, Aunt Sally. The boat landed just at daylight, and I left my baggage on the wharf-boat and went looking around the town and out a piece in the country, to put in the time and not get here too soon; and so I come down the back way.”\n“Who’d you give the baggage to?”\n“Nobody.”\n“Why, child, it’ll be stole!”\n“Not where I hid it I reckon it won’t,” I says.\n“How’d you get your breakfast so early on the boat?”\nIt was kinder thin ice, but I says:\n“The captain see me standing around, and told me I better have something to eat before I went ashore; so he took me in the texas to the officers’ lunch, and give me all I wanted.”",

He talked about disguises, secret passwords, and maybe even capturing somebody and holding them for ransom in a dark cellar. That's just like Tom; he could take a simple thing and twist it into something out of a storybook in two seconds flat.

I hain’t seen a wagon this week. Run, Jimmy, and tell Lize to put on another plate for dinner.” Everybody made a rush for the front door, because it was so lonesome and dull that anything was welcome that came to break the monotony. Tom he lit down from the wagon, and I see it was him. He was dressed up in store clothes, and I knew he was grand. He was feeling tip-top, and proud, and stood up straight and stiff, and so distinguished-like. He most killed me with joy. He was the completest ass I ever see. The Phelpses they flocked around him, then, still in the front yard, and asked him if he was a stranger, and where he come from, and what his name was. And he told them he was a stranger from Hicksville, Ohio, and his name was William Thompson, and he done it pretty smooth, too. He acted like he didn’t know none of us, and they acted like they didn’t know him. It made me feel good and bad both. It was good because I knowed that this was going to be fun, and it was bad because I knowed that Tom Sawyer was going to make trouble and delay everything he could. He was always that way. He wouldn’t do anything simple if he could help it. He had to make it complicated, and he had to make it showy. He had to make it romantic, and he had to make it interesting.

Out with their names, or ther’ll be an idiot short.”\nHe got up and looked distressed, and fumbled his hat, and says:\n“I’m sorry, and I warn’t expecting it. They told me to. They all told me to.

And after they got a little quiet again she says:\n“Why, dear me, I never see such a surprise. We warn’t looking for you at all, but only Tom. Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but him.”",

There was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon, and me and Tom was on the lookout all the time; but it warn’t no use, they didn’t happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger, and we was afraid to try to work up to it.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the concluding event of the original passage, which involves a specific interaction at supper initiated by one of the younger characters. This results in an abrupt ending that does not match the original's progression.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion leaves out some of the emotional responses and dialogue exchanges, particularly the more nuanced reactions and comments from Aunt Sally.\n- The description of the meal is missing certain details, such as the quantity and quality of the food, and the comparison to less appetizing meals.\n- The original includes a specific comment about the blessing not cooling the food, which is not present in the completion.\n- The passage originally describes the ongoing conversation throughout the afternoon and the characters' vigilance, which is only partially represented in the completion.\n- The transition to the supper scene and the specific action by a younger character is missing entirely.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- There are inaccuracies in the sequence of events, particularly in how the meal and the blessing are described; the completion generalizes or alters the order and focus of these events.\n- Some dialogue is attributed or phrased in a way that changes the tone or intent of the original speakers.\n- The completion introduces a reflective comment about not knowing how much the others knew about the runaway, which is not present in the original at this point in the passage.\n- The completion invents a moment where a character grins and exchanges looks, which is not part of the original scene."

            "Huck reflects that Tom's plan, while likely effective in freeing Jim, would also be far more stylish and potentially perilous, and he knew Tom would continuously alter and add 'bullinesses' to it as they proceeded."

Where?”\n“In that hut down by the ash-hopper. Why, looky here. When we was at dinner, didn’t you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles?”\n“Yes.”\n“What did you think the vittles was for?”\n“For a dog.”\n“So’d I. Well, it wasn’t for a dog.”\n“Why?”\n“Because part of it was watermelon.”\n“So it was—I noticed it. Well, it does beat all that I never thought about a dog not eating watermelon. It shows how a body can see and don’t see at the same time.”\n“Well, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he locked it again when he came out. He fetched uncle a key about the time we got up from table—same key, I bet. Watermelon shows man, lock shows prisoner; and it ain’t likely there’s two prisoners on such a little plantation, and where the people’s all so kind and good. Jim’s the prisoner. All right—I’m glad we found it out detective fashion; I wouldn’t give shucks for any other way. Now you work your mind, and study out a plan to steal Jim, and I will study out one, too; and we’ll take the one we like the best.”\nWhat a head for just a boy to have! If I had Tom Sawyer’s head I wouldn’t trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clown in a circus, nor nothing I can think of. I went to thinking out a plan, but only just to be doing something; I knowed very well where the right plan was going to come from. Pretty soon Tom says:\n“Ready?”\n“Yes,” I says.\n“All right—bring it out.”\n“My plan is this,” I says. “We can easy find out if it’s Jim in there. Then get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from the island. Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the old man’s britches after he goes to bed, and shove off down the river on the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me and Jim used to do before. Wouldn’t that plan work?”\n“Work? Why, cert’nly it would work, like rats a-fighting. But it’s too blame’ simple; there ain’t nothing to it. What’s the good of a plan that ain’t no more trouble than that? It’s as mild as goose-milk. Why, Huck, it wouldn’t make no more talk than breaking into a soap factory.”\nI never said nothing, because I warn’t expecting nothing different; but I knowed mighty well that whenever he got his plan ready it wouldn’t have none of them objections to it.\nAnd it didn’t. He told me what it was, and I see in a minute it was worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a man as mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides. So I was satisfied, and said we would waltz in on it. I needn’t tell what it was here, because I knowed it wouldn’t stay the way, it was. I knowed he would be changing it around every which way as we went along, and heaving in new bullinesses wherever he got a chance. And that is what he done.",

We went through the yard so as to see what the hounds would do. They knowed us, and didn’t make no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by in the night. When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and the two sides; and on the side I warn’t acquainted with—which was the north side—we found a square window-hole, up tolerable high, with just one stout board nailed across it. I says:\n“Here’s the ticket. This hole’s big enough for Jim to get through if we wrench off the board.”\nTom says:\n“It’s as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as playing hooky. I should hope we can find a way that’s a little more complicated than that, Huck Finn.”\n“Well, then,” I says, “how’ll it do to saw him out, the way I done before I was murdered that time?”\n“That’s more like,” he says. “It’s real mysterious, and troublesome, and good,” he says; “but I bet we can find a way that’s twice as long. There ain’t no hurry; le’s keep on looking around.”\nBetwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that joined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank. It was as long as the hut, but narrow—only about six foot wide. The door to it was at the south end, and was padlocked. Tom he went to the soap-kettle and searched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with; so he took it and prized out one of the staples. The chain fell down, and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a match, and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn’t no connection with it; and there warn’t no floor to the shed, nor nothing in it but some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow. The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the staple again, and the door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful. He says;\n“Now we’re all right. We’ll dig him out. It’ll take about a week!”\nThen we started for the house, and I went in the back door—you only have to pull a buckskin latch-string, they don’t fasten the doors—but that warn’t romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but he must climb up the lightning-rod. But after he got up half way about three times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most busted his brains out, he thought he’d got to give it up; but after he was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck, and this time he made the trip.",

The niggers was just getting through breakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim’s nigger was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was leaving, the key come from the house.\nThis nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was all tied up in little bunches with thread. That was to keep witches off. He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and making him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of strange words and noises, and he didn’t believe he was ever witched so long before in his life. He got so worked up, and got to running on so about his troubles, he forgot all about what he’d been a-going to do. So Tom says:\n“What’s the vittles for? Going to feed the dogs?”\nThe nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when you heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:\n“Yes, Mars Sid, a dog. Cur’us dog, too. Does you want to go en look at ’im?”\n“Yes.”\nI hunched Tom, and whispers:\n“You going, right here in the daybreak? That warn’t the plan.”\n“No, it warn’t; but it’s the plan now.”\nSo, drat him, we went along, but I didn’t like it much. When we got in we couldn’t hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure enough, and could see us; and he sings out:\n“Why, Huck! En good lan’! ain’ dat Misto Tom?”\nI just knowed how it would be; I just expected it. I didn’t know nothing to do; and if I had I couldn’t a done it, because that nigger busted in and says:\n“Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?”\nWe could see pretty well now. Tom he looked at the nigger, steady and kind of wondering, and says:\n“Does who know us?”\n“Why, dis-yer runaway nigger.”\n“I don’t reckon he does; but what put that into your head?”\n“What put it dar? Didn’ he jis’ dis minute sing out like he knowed you?”\nTom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way:\n“Well, that’s mighty curious. Who sung out? When did he sing out? what did he sing out?” And turns to me, perfectly ca’m, and says, “Did you hear anybody sing out?”\nOf course there warn’t nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says:\n“No; I ain’t heard nobody say nothing.”\nThen he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before, and says:\n“Did you sing out?”\n“No, sah,” says Jim; “I hain’t said nothing, sah.”\n“Not a word?”\n“No, sah, I hain’t said a word.”\n“Did you ever see us before?”\n“No, sah; not as I knows on.”\nSo Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, and says, kind of severe:\n“What do you reckon’s the matter with you, anyway? What made you think somebody sung out?”\n“Oh, it’s de dad-blame’ witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I do. Dey’s awluz at it, sah, en dey do mos’ kill me, dey sk’yers me so. Please to don’t tell nobody ’bout it sah, er ole Mars Silas he’ll scole me; ’kase he say dey ain’t no witches. I jis’ wish to goodness he was heah now—den what would he say! I jis’ bet he couldn’ fine no way to git aroun’ it dis time. But it’s awluz jis’ so; people dat’s sot, stays sot; dey won’t look into noth’n’en fine it out f’r deyselves, en when you fine it out en tell um ’bout it, dey doan’ b’lieve you.”\nTom give him a dime, and said we wouldn’t tell nobody; and told him to buy some more thread to tie up his wool with; and then looks at Jim, and says:\n“I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger. If I was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, I wouldn’t give him up, I’d hang him.” And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good, he whispers to Jim and says:\n“Don’t ever let on to know us. And if you hear any digging going on nights, it’s us; we’re going to set you free.”\nJim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it; then the nigger come back, and we said we’d come again some time if the nigger wanted us to; and he said he would, more particular if it was dark, because the witches went for him mostly in the dark, and it was good to have folks around then.",

And so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan. There ain’t no watchman to be drugged—now there ought to be a watchman. There ain’t even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to. And there’s Jim chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the leg of his bed: why, all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain. And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody; sends the key to the punkin-headed nigger, and don’t send nobody to watch the nigger. Jim could a got out of that window-hole before this, only there wouldn’t be no use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg. Why, drat it, Huck, it’s the stupidest arrangement I ever see. You got to invent all the difficulties. Well, we can’t help it; we got to do the best we can with the materials we’ve got. Anyhow, there’s one thing—there’s more honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers, where there warn’t one of them furnished to you by the people who it was their duty to furnish them, and you had to contrive them all out of your own head. Now look at just that one thing of the lantern. When you come down to the cold facts, we simply got to let on that a lantern’s resky.

Who ever heard of getting a prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that? No; the way all the best authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two, and leave it just so, and swallow the sawdust, so it can’t be found, and put some dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal can’t see no sign of it’s being sawed, and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound. Then, the night you’re ready, fetch the leg a kick, down she goes; slip off your chain, and there you are. Nothing to do but hitch your rope ladder to the battlements, shin down it, break your leg in the moat—because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short, you know—and there’s your horses and your trusty vassles, and they scoop you up and fling you across a saddle, and away you go to your native Langudoc, or Navarre, or wherever it is.

The best way is to eat it. Yes, eat it. You got to eat the sawdust. It’s the proper thing. And then, as to the saw.

And besides, you ain’t got any right to complain, anyway. It’s my plan, and I’ve got a right to have it my own way. So, then, we’ll saw the leg off, and we’ll eat the sawdust, and we’ll hide the saw, and the rope ladder, and the tin plate with the inscription on it, and the shirt, and the bone.”\n“But, Tom, we ain’t got no—”\n“Oh, shut up! What’s the use of your talking? You don’t know anything about it. I wish the old man was here; he’d know what to do. He wouldn’t be for ever bothering about what you got and what you ain’t got. He’d go right ahead and do it. Come on; we’ll saw the leg off.”\nSo we went to work, and Tom sawed, and I held the leg steady. We sawed till we was all tired out. Then Tom says:\n“Looky here, Huck, this ain’t going to work. We can’t saw it off. It’s too hard.”\n“I told you so,” says I. “Why didn’t we slip the chain off?”\n“Well, then, we got to dig him out. That’s the next best way. It ain’t so gaudy, but it’s according to the rules. You got to dig him out with a tin plate, or a pickaxe, or a saw, or something.”\n“Why, Tom, we can slip the chain off in a second.”\n“Yes, but that ain’t the plan. You got to dig him out. And besides, there’s the sawdust. You got to dispose of the sawdust. You can’t just leave it laying around. You got to eat it.”\n“But, Tom, we ain’t got no sawdust.”\n“Well, then, we got to make some. We got to saw something",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces invented dialogue and references, such as mentions of historical figures and events (e.g., Dan'l Webster, Powhatan, and extended discussion of tin plates and wheelbarrows) that are not present in the original passage. These additions shift the focus away from the original's discussion of escape methods and literary references.\n- The completion omits a significant portion of the original's detailed, imaginative escape plan, including the sequence of actions involving the saw, sawdust, disguising the sawed leg, and the escape with rope ladders and horses.\n- The ending of the completion diverges into an invented, exaggerated list of fortification features, which is not present in the original and interrupts the narrative flow.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the original's references to specific literary and historical figures used to justify the escape method.\n- The step-by-step description of the escape plan, including the handling of sawdust, disguising the sawed bed-leg, and the sequence of actions leading to the escape, is missing.\n- The imaginative details about the escape, such as the use of a rope ladder, the moat, and the final getaway, are not included.\n- The original's playful tone and rationale for following 'the best authorities' is not fully captured.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion presents an inaccurate sequence of events, with invented arguments and justifications that do not align with the original's logic.\n- There are misattributed actions and dialogue, with characters expressing ideas and plans that are not present in the source material.\n- The completion introduces anachronistic or irrelevant references, which detract from the authenticity and coherence of the passage.\n- The flow of the conversation is altered, with the focus shifting away from the original's literary parody and detailed escape plan to unrelated topics and invented dialogue."

All he’s got to do is to write on the plate and throw it out. You don’t have to be able to read it. Why, half the time you can’t read anything a prisoner writes on a tin plate, or anywhere else.”\n“Well, then, what’s the sense in wasting the plates?”\n“Why, blame it all, it ain’t the prisoner’s plates.”\n“But it’s somebody’s plates, ain’t it?”\n“Well, spos’n it is? What does the prisoner care whose—”\nHe broke off there, because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing. So we cleared out for the house.\nAlong during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the clothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in it, and we went down and got the fox-fire, and put that in too. I called it borrowing, because that was what pap always called it; but Tom said it warn’t borrowing, it was stealing. He said we was representing prisoners; and prisoners don’t care how they get a thing so they get it, and nobody don’t blame them for it, either. It ain’t no crime in a prisoner to steal the thing he needs to get away with, Tom said; it’s his right; and so, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a perfect right to steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves out of prison with. He said if we warn’t prisoners it would be a very different thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery person would steal when he warn’t a prisoner. So we allowed we would steal everything there was that come handy. And yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that, when I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he made me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for. Tom said that what he meant was, we could steal anything we needed. Well, I says, I needed the watermelon. But he said I didn’t need it to get out of prison with; there’s where the difference was. He said if I’d a wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal with, it would a been all right. So I let it go at that, though I couldn’t see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if I got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like that every time I see a chance to hog a watermelon.",

We want to make it interesting, and difficult, and romantic; and I don't know no other way than what's in the books. We got to dig him out with case-knives.\"\n\n\"Laws sakes! Why, they ain't no sense in that. You can't dig a man out of a cabin foundation with case-knives. It'll take a hundred years.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you got to do it right. You can't dig him out with a pick and shovel. That ain't the way they do it in books. They always dig them out with case-knives. And it's always through solid rock, too—leastways, they call it solid rock. And it takes them weeks and weeks and weeks, and for ever and ever. Why, look at one of them prisoners in the books—which I wish I had the name of, but I can't call it to mind now—he dug his way out of the Castle Deef, down in Europe, with a case-knife; and it took him thirty-seven year, and he come out in China.

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents a discussion about ropes and climbing over fences, which is not present in the original passage.\n- There is an invented reflection about a prisoner gnawing through a rock foundation for nineteen years, which does not match the original content or its details.\n- The completion omits the extended dialogue about the appropriateness of using picks and shovels versus case-knives, which is a central part of the original passage.\n- The completion ends abruptly and does not include the concluding exchange about the duration of digging and the reference to a famous prisoner.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the original's step-by-step reasoning about why certain tools are or are not appropriate for the escape.\n- The specific debate over the use of case-knives as digging tools is missing.\n- The original's reference to literary conventions and the importance of heroism in escapes is not present.\n- The passage omits the back-and-forth guessing about how long it took a prisoner to dig out, as well as the exaggerated outcome of that escape.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered: the discussion about tools and methods is replaced with invented dialogue about ropes and climbing, which does not occur in the original.\n- The completion attributes invented actions and reflections to the characters, such as Tom considering gnawing as a method, which is not accurate.\n- The timing and logic of the escape plan are misrepresented, with invented durations and methods that do not align with the original passage.\n- The completion misattributes the idea of using picks and shovels as the preferred method, whereas the original passage critiques this idea and proposes an alternative.\n\nTo improve, focus on accurately following the sequence of reasoning and dialogue about escape methods, ensure all major exchanges about tools and their appropriateness are included, and avoid inventing new scenarios or reflections not present in the source material."

He’ll hear Jim ain’t from there. Then his next move will be to advertise Jim, or something like that. So we can’t resk being as long digging him out as we ought to.

Tom said he was right behind Jim’s bed now, and we’d dig in under it, and when we got through there couldn’t nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole there, because Jim’s counter-pin hung down most to the ground, and you’d have to raise it up and look under to see the hole. So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then we was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn’t see we’d done anything hardly. At last I says:\n“This ain’t no thirty-seven year job; this is a thirty-eight year job, Tom Sawyer.”\nHe never said nothing. But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped digging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking. Then he says:\n“It ain’t no use, Huck, it ain’t a-going to work. If we was prisoners it would, because then we’d have as many years as we wanted, and no hurry; and we wouldn’t get but a few minutes to dig, every day, while they was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn’t get blistered, and we could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right, and the way it ought to be done. But we can’t fool along; we got to rush; we ain’t got no time to spare. If we was to put in another night this way we’d have to knock off for a week to let our hands get well—couldn’t touch a case-knife with them sooner.”\n“Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?”\n“I’ll tell you. It ain’t right, and it ain’t moral, and I wouldn’t like it to get out; but there ain’t only just the one way: we got to dig him out with the picks, and let on it’s case-knives.”\n“Now you’re talking!” I says; “your head gets leveler and leveler all the time, Tom Sawyer,” I says. “Picks is the thing, moral or no moral; and as for me, I don’t care shucks for the morality of it, nohow. When I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school book, I ain’t no ways particular how it’s done so it’s done. What I want is my nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I want is my Sunday-school book; and if a pick’s the handiest thing, that’s the thing I’m a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sunday-school book out with; and I don’t give a dead rat what the authorities thinks about it nuther.”\n“Well,” he says, “there’s excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like this; if it warn’t so, I wouldn’t approve of it, nor I wouldn’t stand by and see the rules broke—because right is right, and wrong is wrong, and a body ain’t got no business doing wrong when he ain’t ignorant and knows better. It might answer for you to dig Jim out with a pick, without any letting on, because you don’t know no better; but it wouldn’t for me, because I do know better. Gimme a case-knife.”\nHe had his own by him, but I handed him mine. He flung it down, and says:\n“Gimme a case-knife.”\nI didn’t know just what to do—but then I thought.

We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was as long as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it. When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing his level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn’t come it, his hands was so sore. At last he says:\n“It ain’t no use, it can’t be done. What you reckon I better do? Can’t you think of no way?”\n“Yes,” I says, “but I reckon it ain’t regular. Come up the stairs, and let on it’s a lightning-rod.”\nSo he done it.\nNext day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house, for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin plates. Tom says it wasn’t enough; but I said nobody wouldn’t ever see the plates that Jim throwed out, because they’d fall in the dog-fennel and jimpson weeds under the window-hole—then we could tote them back and he could use them over again. So Tom was satisfied. Then he says:\n“Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim.”\n“Take them in through the hole,” I says, “when we get it done.”\nHe only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard of such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying. By-and-by he said he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn’t no need to decide on any of them yet. Said we’d got to post Jim first.\nThat night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took one of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard Jim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn’t wake him. Then we whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half the job was done. We crept in under Jim’s bed and into the cabin, and pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile, and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle and gradual. He was so glad to see us he most cried; and called us honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away, and clearing out without losing any time. But Tom he showed him how unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans, and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, sure. So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old times awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt Sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and both of them was kind as they could be, Tom says:\n“Now I know how to fix it. We’ll send you some things by them.”",

And the next night after that we had the same trouble—all tired, and hands blistered and sore. So we laid by again. You see, we was working most of the time, and we didn’t use no lanterns, because we daren’t. So it was powerful slow work, and tiresome. And besides, we didn’t know how to do it right. We had to dig under the bottom log, and it was a powerful hard job. The next day Tom allowed we would stop digging, and start on the lightning-rod. So he climbed up the lightning-rod, and got up to the window, and then he couldn’t get down. He tried and he tried, but he couldn’t. I told him to just slide down the lightning-rod, but he said his hands was so sore he couldn’t. So then I told him to just climb down the stairs and pretend it was the lightning-rod. He thought a minute, and then he said it was a good idea, and he would do it. So he did.

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The initial sequence where the narrator observes Tom struggling with the lightning-rod and their subsequent conversation about alternative ways to enter is missing.\n- The detailed account of acquiring and discussing the use of various household items for the escape is not included.\n- The process of sneaking out at night, interacting with Jim, and the emotional reunion is absent.\n- The discussion about how to communicate with Jim and the plan to use Aunt Sally and Uncle Silas is not present.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The timing and sequence of events are incorrect; the completion suggests multiple days of rest and repeated blistering, which does not align with the original timeline.\n- Actions and dialogue are misattributed or invented, such as Huck giving advice about how escapes should be done, which does not occur in the original passage.\n- The completion repeats a list of fortification terms excessively, which is not part of the original narrative and distracts from the actual plot progression.\n\nOverall, the completion should focus on accurately following the sequence of events, including the planning, execution, and emotional interactions, and avoid inventing or excessively repeating content not present in the original."

We’ll do the noble thing, Jim, we’ll ’low you to dig yourself out with a spoon.”\n\n“Well, den, I’s gwyne to dig my way out wid a spoon, en I’s gwyne to scrape de dirt out wid a tin plate, en I’s gwyne to hide de dirt under my bed,” says Jim, mighty meek.\n\n“It’s the only way, Jim, as a Spanish prisoner would do it.

He said we had to dig Jim out with case-knives, and saw the leg off the bed, and write messages on a shirt with blood, and have a rope-ladder made out of sheets, and all sorts of foolishness like that. I told him it was crazy, that it would take forever, and likely get us all caught, or worse, get Jim killed. It was too much trouble for nothing. We could just lift the latch or steal the key and be done with it quick and easy. But Tom, he just wouldn't listen to sense. He said that wouldn't be romantic or adventurous enough. It had to be done with style and difficulty, or it wouldn't count as a proper rescue. He was so excited about all the unnecessary complications, his eyes shining like he'd found a gold mine. He started talking about moats and sentinels and secret signs, things that had no business being mixed up with getting a poor runaway slave free. It made my head swim just listening to him. I knew it was going to be a heap of trouble, and probably wouldn't work, but when Tom Sawyer gets an idea, there ain't no stopping him. He just drags you along whether you want to go or not. I sighed and figured I was in for it, no matter how much I knew it was pure foolishness."

We found two shingle-nails, and Tom said they'd come handy for a prisoner to scratch his name and sorrows on the walls of his dungeon, and so they had to be saved. Then we took the tin washpan at midnight and went down in the cellar and stole the flour, and filled the pan with the flour, and hid the pan and flour away. And when breakfast was ready, we waited and waited and waited, for Aunt Sally to come down; but she didn't come, and didn't come, and didn't come. So at last Uncle Silas he said he wouldn't wait no longer, but set down and went to tearing away at the meat and other things, and we set in, too. Of course our hands and faces were perfectly clean, and so was our clothes; for we'd got up early and washed. But we didn't know what the upshot was going to be; and we felt pretty mean, and pretty uncomfortable. While we was eating, Tom he reached over and put a pewter spoon in Uncle Silas's coat pocket. Uncle Silas says: \"Why, what's this?\" \"Nothing,\" says Tom. \"It's only a spoon.\" \"A spoon? What business has a spoon in my pocket?\" \"Well, I don't know, Uncle Silas; I reckon somebody put it there.\" \"Somebody put it there? Who do you reckon it was?\" \"I don't know; must 'a' been you, Uncle Silas; you ain't got anybody else to blame.\" He looked kind of bothered, and stood there with his mouth full, considering; and his eye got kind of glazed and vacant, and he seemed to lose himself. Then he shook his head, and sighed, and says: \"I reckon I did do it, Tom; but it's the most puzzlingest thing I ever heard of.\" And he went on eating. So then we went and stuck one of the shingle-nails in Aunt Sally's apron pocket that was hanging on a chair; and whilst we was at it, we stuck the other one in the band of Uncle Silas's hat that was laying on the bureau; because we heard the Phelpses was going to see Jim that morning, and we wanted them to have something to find.",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces a lengthy and unrelated inventory of objects found, including items and events (such as finding a dead rat, a spinning wheel, and a hair-sofa) that do not appear in the original passage. This is a significant invention and diverges from the original sequence.\n- The completion omits the entire sequence involving the placement of shingle-nails in specific locations and the reasoning behind these actions, which is a major missing section.\n- The completion invents an extended, repetitive dialogue about digging with a spoon, which is not present in the original passage.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the specific description of the rubbage-pile and the types of items found there, as well as the process of searching for a suitable baking vessel and preparing it for use.\n- The actions involving taking the washpan to the cellar, filling it with flour, and the transition to breakfast are missing.\n- The details about the children’s conversation and the adults’ plans for the morning are omitted.\n- The sequence of hiding small objects (shingle-nails and a pewter spoon) in particular places is not present.\n- The waiting for Aunt Sally at breakfast is not included.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion presents an inaccurate sequence of events, with invented actions and objects that do not align with the original order.\n- The focus on a debate about the utility of a spoon for digging is misplaced and not part of the original passage’s content or structure.\n- The completion attributes actions and motivations to the characters that are not present in the original, such as the idea of scaring children with a stuffed rat or the extended discussion about digging tools.\n- The transition between events is inconsistent with the original, leading to a loss of narrative coherence."

But after that we was all right again—it was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold. Uncle Silas he says:\n“It’s most uncommon curious, I can’t understand it. I know perfectly well I took it off, because—”\n“Because you hain’t got but one on. Just listen at the man! I know you took it off, and know it by a better way than your wool-gethering memory, too, because it was on the clo’s-line yesterday—I see it there myself. But it’s gone, that’s the long and the short of it, and you’ll just have to change to a red flann’l one till I can get time to make a new one. And it’ll be the third I’ve made in two years.

A body ’d think you would learn to take some sort of care of ’em at your time of life.”\n“I know it, Sally, and I do try all I can. But it oughtn’t to be altogether my fault, because, you know, I don’t see them nor have nothing to do with them except when they’re on me; and I don’t believe I’ve ever lost one of them off of me.”\n“Well, it ain’t your fault if you haven’t, Silas; you’d a done it if you could, I reckon. And the shirt ain’t all that’s gone, nuther. Ther’s a spoon gone; and that ain’t all. There was ten, and now ther’s only nine. The calf got the shirt, I reckon, but the calf never took the spoon, that’s certain.”\n“Why, what else is gone, Sally?”\n“Ther’s six candles gone—that’s what. The rats could a got the candles, and I reckon they did; I wonder they don’t walk off with the whole place, the way you’re always going to stop their holes and don’t do it; and if they warn’t fools they’d sleep in your hair, Silas—you’d never find it out; but you can’t lay the spoon on the rats, and that I know.”\n“Well, Sally, I’m in fault, and I acknowledge it; I’ve been remiss; but I won’t let to-morrow go by without stopping up them holes.”\n“Oh, I wouldn’t hurry; next year’ll do. Matilda Angelina Araminta Phelps!”\nWhack comes the thimble, and the child snatches her claws out of the sugar-bowl without fooling around any. Just then the nigger woman steps on to the passage, and says:\n“Missus, dey’s a sheet gone.”\n“A sheet gone! Well, for the land’s sake!”\n“I’ll stop up them holes to-day,” says Uncle Silas, looking sorrowful.\n“Oh, do shet up!—s’pose the rats took the sheet? Where’s it gone, Lize?”\n“Clah to goodness I hain’t no notion, Miss’ Sally. She wuz on de clo’sline yistiddy, but she done gone: she ain’ dah no mo’ now.”\n“I reckon the world is coming to an end. I never see the beat of it in all my born days.

It’s Uncle Silas—and him a preacher, too, and a deacon besides—away out in the woods, eight mile from anywheres, and his church only three mile off, yet; he can’t nobody hear him preach but a little handful, all told, and they ain’t never been used to no other preacher but him all their lives, and so they’ve got to stand it, I reckon. And he’s a-preachin’ and a-preachin’ away, and in his righteous mind he knows he don’t belong there at all; and he knows he’s got to come to dinner, too, and yet he stays away all the mornin’, no doubt, and preaches his fool head off, for forty cents a year, when he’s got one of the likeliest plantations in this State. It ain’t right, and I wouldn’t do it if I was him. No, sir, I wouldn’t do it. And what’s become of that shirt?”\n\nNow, that took me aback. I says to myself, and blushes like a girl, “It’s up a stump, I reckon. I’m a goner.” Tom he looks at me, and I look at him; and he blushes, too. “What shirt, Aunt Sally?”\n\n“Why, Silas’s new calico one—the one you brought him.”\n\n“What do you reckon’s become of it, Aunt Sally?”\n\n“Reckon? I reckon it’s been stole! That’s what I reckon.”\n\n“Stole by a nigger?”\n\n“Course it was stole by a nigger. Who else would want it? And what do they want with it? I wish the crows’d get it and tear it up and pack it off to the woods and git rid of it. They’ve stole Silas’s white shirt, too.”\n\n“What white shirt, Aunt Sally?”\n\n“Why, the one he had on yesterday—the one you brought him.”\n\n“He had it on yesterday, did he?”\n\n“Yes, he did. I see him come in with it.”\n\n“Well, I reckon he’s got it on now, ain’t he?”\n\n“No, he ain’t. I see him take it off and hang it up on the clothes-line where the washin’ was. And it ain’t there now. And he ain’t got it on, neither. And I can’t find it nowhere. And I’ve looked everywhere. And I’m a-goin’ to have it, too. I ain’t a-goin’ to have niggers stealin’ my clothes. I ain’t a-goin’ to have it.”\n\nShe was a-goin’ on that way when Uncle Silas come in, and he was a-lookin’ pretty meek, and he says:\n\n“Good mornin’, Sally.”\n\n“Good mornin’, Silas. What do you reckon’s become of your shirt?”\n\nHe looked surprised, and says:\n\n“What shirt, Sally?”\n\n“Why, the one you had on yesterday.”\n\n“Well, I reckon I got it on now, ain’t I?”\n\n“No, you ain’t.

I ain’t a-goin’ to have it.”\n\nHe looked pretty meek, and says:\n\n“Well, I reckon I did take it off and hang it up on the clothes-line where the washin’ was. But I don’t reckon it’s been stole. I reckon it’s just mislaid.”\n\n“Mislaid? Mislaid by who? Mislaid by a nigger, that’s who. And what do they want with it? I wish the crows’d get it and tear it up and pack it off to the woods and git rid of it. They’ve stole Silas’s white shirt, too.”\n\n“What white shirt, Sally?”\n\n“Why, the one he had on yesterday—the one you brought him.”\n\n“He had it on yesterday, did he?”\n\n“Yes, he did.

And the children they kept a-squirming and a-whispering and a-kicking each other under the table, and the mother she kept a-thimbling them and a-sloshing coffee, and the whole business was the most awful racket you ever struck. It was a big table, and everybody was there – the old man and the old woman, and Buck, and the two young women, Miss Charlotte and Miss Sophia, and the four young men, and me. And there was a nigger woman standing behind each of the young women, fanning them with a fan made of turkey-feathers, and another nigger woman standing behind the old woman and the old man, doing the same. And there was a nigger man standing behind each of the young men, and they had a big fan made of peacock-feathers, and they didn’t do nothing but fan them. And there was a nigger boy standing behind me, and he didn’t have no fan, but he was there to wait on me, I reckon. And there was a nigger man standing at each end of the table, carving the meat.\n\nIt was a mighty nice dinner, though. Plenty of everything – fried chicken, and roast pig, and ham, and greens, and corn-pone, and hot biscuits, and sweet potatoes, and pie, and cake, and I don’t know what all. And everybody eat like they hadn’t had nothing for a week. And the Colonel he set there and eat, and didn’t say a word, except now and then he’d look up and say, “Buck, fetch me some more of that chicken,” or “Charlotte, pass me them biscuits.” And the young men they eat and talked about horses and dogs and guns, and the young women they eat and talked about clothes and parties and young men, and the children they eat and fit amongst themselves, and the mother she eat and thimbled and sloshed, and the niggers they stood and fanned and waited.\n\nAfter a while, the Colonel he laid down his knife and fork and wiped his mouth, and then everybody laid down their knives and forks and wiped their mouths. And then the Colonel he says, “Well, Buck, what’s the news?”\n\nAnd Buck he says, “Well, pap, I reckon there ain’t much news, except old man Shepherdson’s got a new horse – a sorrel, a beauty.”\n\nAnd the Colonel he says, “A sorrel, eh? Well, I reckon he won’t keep him long.” And he give a little chuckle, and everybody else give a little chuckle, except me. I didn’t see nothing to chuckle about.

Pretty soon he got it all ravelled out, and then he hitched one end of it to a beam, and stood there a-thinking, and scratching his head. He looked like he was trying to remember something, but couldn't. At last he sighed, and begun to look around; and pretty soon his eyes fell on the rat-holes. He went and looked at them, and then he stood there a good while thinking. By-and-by he sighed again, and fumbled in his bundle, and got out a pipe and a plug of tobacco, and laid them down on a barrel, and set down by the rope and begun to pick his teeth with a pin. He sat there a-mumbling and a-mussing around till I thought he was asleep; then he got up and looked at the rat-holes again, and picked up his candle and started to go. Then he stopped, and looked down at the pipe and the tobacco; then he sighed again, and picked them up and laid them on the shelf and then started again. Then he stopped again, and looked back at the rope which he had hitched to the beam, and then laid down his candle and fumbled with it. By-and-by he got it unhitched, and then he coiled it up and laid it down with his bundle, and sighed again and picked up his candle and started again. He didn't act like he knew what he was about, but just acted like he was moony and absent-minded. As he was going out he stopped again and looked at the rat-holes, and then picked up his candle and went on out. We waited till we didn't hear him any more, and then we come out. We never see a man that was so absent-minded as that old man. He was the kindest old man I ever see, and the innocentest; but he was of no more use than a cow; and he didn't know enough to come in when it rained.

We told him we had—been—a-working at it—off and on—for nine months, and the like of that; and so he said it warn’t no wonder it was so perfect. We had him out that night, and Jim and us felt pretty gay that it was done and ready for hiding. It was a tolerable long ladder, but not thicker than a man’s wrist when it was twisted; you could hide it in a chair-cushion. We had to cut the ladder in two pieces, though, before we could get it in the pie; and we had to bend it and cram it, too. So it warn’t no time till it was baked hard, and we done it all right. And as for the pie, it warn’t no great things, because my hands was all only just big clots of dough and flour, and I couldn’t see the way it was working, and the oven warn’t right, and everything was wrong.

          "text_segment": "Making them pens was a distressid tough job, and so was the saw; and Jim allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all. That’s the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall. But he had to have it; Tom said he’d got to; there warn’t no case of a state prisoner not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and his coat of arms.\n“Look at Lady Jane Grey,” he says; “look at Gilford Dudley; look at old Northumberland! Why, Huck, s’pose it is considerble trouble?—what you going to do?—how you going to get around it? Jim’s got to do his inscription and coat of arms. They all do.”\nJim says:\n“Why, Mars Tom, I hain’t got no coat o’ arm; I hain’t got nuffn but dish yer ole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat.”\n“Oh, you don’t understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very different.”\n“Well,” I says, “Jim’s right, anyway, when he says he ain’t got no coat of arms, because he hain’t.”\n“I reckon I knowed that,” Tom says, “but you bet he’ll have one before he goes out of this—because he’s going out right, and there ain’t going to be no flaws in his record.”\nSo whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece, Jim a-making his’n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon, Tom set to work to think out the coat of arms. By-and-by he said he’d struck so many good ones he didn’t hardly know which to take, but there was one which he reckoned he’d decide on. He says:\n“On the scutcheon we’ll have a bend or in the dexter base, a saltire murrey in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for common charge, and under his foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with a chevron vert in a chief engrailed, and three invected lines on a field azure, with the nombril points rampant on a dancette indented; crest, a runaway nigger, sable, with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister; and a couple of gules for supporters, which is you and me; motto, Maggiore fretta, minore atto. Got it out of a book—means the more haste, the less speed.”\n“Geewhillikins,” I says, “but what does the rest of it mean?”\n“We ain’t got no time to bother over that,” he says; “we got to dig in like all git-out.”\n“Well, anyway,” I says, “what’s some of it? What’s a fess?”\n“A fess—a fess is—you don’t need to know what a fess is. I’ll show him how to make it when he gets to it.”\n“Shucks, Tom,” I says, “I think you might tell a person. What’s a bar sinister?”\n“Oh, I don’t know. But he’s got to have it. All the nobility does.”\nThat was just his way. If it didn’t suit him to explain a thing to you, he wouldn’t do it. You might pump at him a week, it wouldn’t make no difference.\nHe’d got all that coat of arms business fixed, so now he started in to finish up the rest of that part of the work, which was to plan out a mournful inscription—said Jim got to have one, like they all done. He made up a lot, and wrote them out on a paper, and read them off, so:\n1. Here a captive heart busted.\n2. Here a poor prisoner, forsook by the world and friends, fretted out his sorrowful life.\n3. Here a lonely heart broke, and a worn spirit went to its rest, after thirty-seven years of solitary captivity.\n4. Here, homeless and friendless, after thirty-seven years of bitter captivity, perished a noble stranger, natural son of Louis XIV.\nTom’s voice trembled whilst he was reading them, and he most broke down. When he got done he couldn’t no way make up his mind which one for Jim to scrabble on to the wall, they was all so good; but at last he allowed he would let him scrabble them all on. Jim said it would take him a year to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail, and he didn’t know how to make letters, besides; but Tom said he would block them out for him, and then he wouldn’t have nothing to do but just follow the lines. Then pretty soon he says:\n“Come to think, the logs ain’t a-going to do; they don’t have log walls in a dungeon: we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock. We’ll fetch a rock.”\nJim said the rock was worse than the logs; he said it would take him such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn’t ever get out. But Tom said he would let me help him do it. Then he took a look to see how me and Jim was getting along with the pens. It was most pesky tedious hard work and slow, and didn’t give my hands no show to get well of the sores, and we didn’t seem to make no headway, hardly; so Tom says:\n“I know how to fix it. We got to have a rock for the coat of arms and mournful inscriptions, and we can kill two birds with that same rock. There’s a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill, and we’ll smouch it, and carve the things on it, and file out the pens and the saw on it, too.”",

            "prefix-probing": "Making them pens was a distressid tough job, and so was the saw; and Jim allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all. That was going to be a job that would make a body sick, he said, and he wished he could get rid of it. It was to be on a stone, and Jim said if he had a chisel he wouldn’t mind it, but he didn’t have any, and so he stood there, looking like he wished he was dead, and Tom he stood there, looking like he was born for it. Tom said he would help him, and so he did. They took a nail and they worked at it, scraping and scratching, and it was the slowest work a body ever see. It took them days and days, and Jim he groaned and sweated over it, and Tom he just kep’ on, cheerful as a cricket, telling about all the famous prisoners that had done the same thing. He said it warn’t no escape unless you done it the regular way, and the regular way was to leave your inscription, and your coat of arms, and all that. Jim didn’t know what a coat of arms was, and he didn’t care, he just wanted to get out. But Tom he wouldn’t give up. He said it was the most important part of the whole business. So they kep’ on scraping and scratching, and by and by they got it done. It said: “Here a captive heart busted.” Jim said he didn’t know what it meant, but Tom said it was the regular thing, and it sounded good. It took them a week to do that inscription, and Jim he was wore out. He said he’d rather be in jail for life than do another one. But Tom he just laughed and said they warn’t done yet, not by a long sight. There was the rope ladder to make, and the shirt to keep a journal on, and the moat to dig, and the rats and snakes and spiders and things to tame for pets. Jim he just looked at him, his eyes big as saucers, and he didn’t say a word. He just looked like he thought Tom was crazy. And I reckon he warn’t far wrong. But Tom he was bound to do it all according to the books. He said it warn’t no fun if you didn’t do it the way the famous prisoners done it. So we went to work on the rope ladder. We had to get sheets from the house, and that was a job. We snuck in at night and took them off the beds, and Aunt Sally she never suspicioned a thing. We cut them up into strips and braided them together, and it made a powerful long ladder. It took us days and days to do that, too. Jim he done most of the work, and he grumbled about it, but he done it. He said he didn’t see no sense in a rope ladder when they could just walk out the door, but Tom he said that warn’t the regular way. The regular way was to have a rope ladder and let it down from the window. So we done it. Then there was the shirt. Tom said Jim had to keep a journal of his sufferings on a shirt, like the famous prisoners done. Jim he said he didn’t have no sufferings to write about, except having to do all this foolishness, but Tom he said that was part of the suffering. So we got a shirt and the pens we made, and Jim he had to write on it. He didn’t know how to write much, so Tom he had to help him. It was slow work, and the ink we made out of soot and grease didn’t work very good. It smeared all over the place. Jim he got ink all over himself, and he looked like a chimney sweep. He said he wished he was back in the cabin on the island, where things was simple. But Tom he just kep’ on, full of ideas. He said they had to have pets, like the famous prisoners. They had to tame rats and snakes and spiders and things. Jim he said he didn’t want no pets like that, he was scared of snakes and spiders. But Tom he said it was the regular way, and it showed you was brave. So we had to catch them. We caught rats in the smokehouse, and snakes down by the river, and spiders in the woodshed. It was a mess. We had them in boxes and jars, and they was always trying to get out. Jim he wouldn’t go near them. He said they give him the creeps. Tom he tried to tame them, but they just bit him and run away. It was a lot of trouble for nothing, if you ask me. Then there was the moat. Tom said they had to dig a moat around the cabin, like a castle. Jim he said he didn’t see no sense in digging a ditch around the place, but Tom he said it was the regular way, and it made the escape more romantic. So we got shovels and we started digging. It was hard work, and the ground was rocky. We dug for days and days, and we didn’t get very far. Jim he was wore out. He said he’d rather break rocks on the road than dig that moat. But Tom he just kep’ on, talking about castles and knights and things. He was having the time of his life, and Jim he was just suffering. I felt sorry for Jim, but I didn’t know how to stop Tom. He was so set on doing everything the regular way, according to the books. He said it warn’t no adventure if you"

We slipped down the river a mile, and hid the canoe in the willows. Then we trudged back afoot the rest of the way. When we got below the ferry we struck for the woods, because we judged we might fetch up against somebody notwithstanding the late hour. We got up against the mill, finally, and stooped under the bottom log, and crawled in, and got it, and went right along with it. It was all we could do to manage it. We cooned it along, man fashion, some of it at a time, and at the end of an hour we had got it only a hundred yards, and we warn’t feeling very splendid, it was so heavy. We laid there, panting, a minute, and then Tom says:\n\n“Ours is the swelled head, now, Huck. We’ve got to have help. I know where to get it. — Jim!”\n\nSaying this, he whispered to Jim through the hole, and Jim come a-scrambling along with his chain, and piled out, all in a shiver, and says:\n\n“Why, Mars Tom, I doan’ want no mo’ adventures.

And if you got any more of these ventures, I don’t want no part of ‘em.”\n\n“Come, come, hearken to me, Jim. Didn’t you hear a noise?”\n\n“Well, I don’t know.

Dey’s de dadblamedest creturs to ’sturb a body, en rustle roun’ over ’im, en bite his feet, when he’s tryin’ to sleep, I ever see. No, sah, gimme g’yarter-snakes, ’f I’s got to have ’m, but doan’ gimme no rats; I hain’ got no use f’r um, skasely.”\n“But, Jim, you got to have ’em—they all do. So don’t make no more fuss about it. Prisoners ain’t ever without rats. There ain’t no instance of it. And they train them, and pet them, and learn them tricks, and they get to be as sociable as flies. But you got to play music to them. You got anything to play music on?”\n“I ain’ got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o’ paper, en a juice-harp; but I reck’n dey wouldn’ take no stock in a juice-harp.”\n“Yes they would. They don’t care what kind of music ’tis. A jews-harp’s plenty good enough for a rat. All animals like music—in a prison they dote on it. Specially, painful music; and you can’t get no other kind out of a jews-harp. It always interests them; they come out to see what’s the matter with you. Yes, you’re all right; you’re fixed very well. You want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep, and early in the mornings, and play your jews-harp; play ‘The Last Link is Broken’—that’s the thing that’ll scoop a rat quicker ’n anything else; and when you’ve played about two minutes you’ll see all the rats, and the snakes, and spiders, and things begin to feel worried about you, and come. And they’ll just fairly swarm over you, and have a noble good time.”\n“Yes, dey will, I reck’n, Mars Tom, but what kine er time is Jim havin’? Blest if I kin see de pint. But I’ll do it ef I got to. I reck’n I better keep de animals satisfied, en not have no trouble in de house.”\nTom waited to think it over, and see if there wasn’t nothing else; and pretty soon he says:\n“Oh, there’s one thing I forgot. Could you raise a flower here, do you reckon?”\n“I doan know but maybe I could, Mars Tom; but it’s tolable dark in heah, en I ain’ got no use f’r no flower, nohow, en she’d be a pow’ful sight o’ trouble.”\n“Well, you try it, anyway. Some other prisoners has done it.”\n“One er dem big cat-tail-lookin’ mullen-stalks would grow in heah, Mars Tom, I reck’n, but she wouldn’t be wuth half de trouble she’d coss.”\n“Don’t you believe it. We’ll fetch you a little one and you plant it in the corner over there, and raise it. And don’t call it mullen, call it Pitchiola—that’s its right name when it’s in a prison. And you want to water it with your tears.”\n“Why, I got plenty spring water, Mars Tom.”\n“You don’t want spring water; you want to water it with your tears. It’s the way they always do.”\n“Why, Mars Tom, I lay I kin raise one er dem mullen-stalks twyste wid spring water whiles another man’s a start’n one wid tears.”\n“That ain’t the idea. You got to do it with tears.”\n“She’ll die on my han’s, Mars Tom, she sholy will; kase I doan’ skasely ever cry.”\nSo Tom was stumped. But he studied it over, and then said Jim would have to worry along the best he could with an onion. He promised he would go to the nigger cabins and drop one, private, in Jim’s coffee-pot, in the morning. Jim said he would “jis’ ’s soon have tobacker in his coffee;” and found so much fault with it, and with the work and bother of raising the mullen, and jews-harping the rats, and petting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things, on top of all the other work he had to do on pens, and inscriptions, and journals, and things, which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook, that Tom most lost all patience with him; and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for himself, and yet he didn’t know enough to appreciate them, and they was just about wasted on him. So Jim he was sorry, and said he wouldn’t behave so no more, and then me and Tom shoved for bed.",

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces repeated dialogue exchanges that are not present in the original, resulting in a loop that does not advance the conversation or narrative. This repetition replaces significant portions of the original passage and omits the natural progression of the discussion.\n- Several invented elements appear, such as the mention of a rattlesnake's rattle and a spider-web as required items, which are not part of the original sequence. These additions shift the focus away from the actual requirements discussed in the source text.\n- The ending of the passage is missing entirely, including the resolution of the conversation, Tom's final instructions, and the reflective or narrative closure.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The original contains a detailed discussion about the use of music to attract animals, including specific instructions about when and what to play, which is absent in the completion.\n- The conversation about raising a flower, the specific type of plant, and the method of watering it is omitted.\n- The original includes a section where Tom considers alternatives and makes a plan involving an onion, as well as Jim's complaints about the various tasks and Tom's reaction to them. These narrative developments are missing.\n- The final reconciliation between the characters and the transition to the next scene are not present.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes the need for a rattlesnake's rattle and a spider-web, which are not part of the original requirements.\n- The sequence of events is disrupted by the repeated dialogue, which prevents the conversation from progressing as it does in the original.\n- The completion misrepresents the characters' attitudes and responses, particularly by having Jim repeatedly agree to gather certain items and refuse others in a way that does not match the original exchange.\n- The completion omits the nuanced reasoning and justifications provided by Tom regarding the necessity of the animals and the music, as well as the specific instructions about the plant and the emotional requirements for watering it."

But while we was gone for spiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found it there, and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out, and they did; and Aunt Sally she come in, and when we got back she was a-standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doing what they could to keep off the dull times for her. So she took and dusted us both with the hickry, and we was as much as two hours catching another fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome cub, and they warn’t the likeliest, nuther, because the first haul was the pick of the flock. I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was.\nWe got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and caterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to got a hornet’s nest, but we didn’t. The family was at home. We didn’t give it right up, but stayed with them as long as we could; because we allowed we’d tire them out or they’d got to tire us out, and they done it. Then we got allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all right again, but couldn’t set down convenient. And so we went for the snakes, and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and put them in a bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was supper-time, and a rattling good honest day’s work: and hungry?—oh, no, I reckon not! And there warn’t a blessed snake up there when we went back—we didn’t half tie the sack, and they worked out somehow, and left. But it didn’t matter much, because they was still on the premises somewheres. So we judged we could get some of them again. No, there warn’t no real scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell. You’d see them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then; and they generly landed in your plate, or down the back of your neck, and most of the time where you didn’t want them. Well, they was handsome and striped, and there warn’t no harm in a million of them; but that never made no difference to Aunt Sally; she despised snakes, be the breed what they might, and she couldn’t stand them no way you could fix it; and every time one of them flopped down on her, it didn’t make no difference what she was doing, she would just lay that work down and light out. I never see such a woman. And you could hear her whoop to Jericho. You couldn’t get her to take a-holt of one of them with the tongs. And if she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think the house was afire. She disturbed the old man so that he said he could most wish there hadn’t ever been no snakes created. Why, after every last snake had been gone clear out of the house for as much as a week Aunt Sally warn’t over it yet; she warn’t near over it; when she was setting thinking about something you could touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump right out of her stockings. It was very curious. But Tom said all women was just so. He said they was made that way for some reason or other.",

We got an awful lot of spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and caterpillars, and one thing and another, and we all got stings and bites, and went home feeling pretty ornery.

The next day we went and got a lot of garter-snakes, and house-snakes, and put them in a bag, and put the bag in our room, and we was going to let them out after supper. We had a real good time, and we was going to have a real good time, but we didn’t. We had supper, and then we went to our room, and we see that the bag was open, and the snakes was gone. We didn’t know what to do, but we didn’t do nothing. We just went to bed, and we didn’t sleep very good. The next morning we got up, and we see that the snakes was all over the house.

Then we went and got fifteen more rats, and put them in the trap, and the trap under the bed again, and we was to be careful this time, and we was. We got an awful lot of spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and caterpillars, and one thing and another, and we all got stings and bites, and went home feeling pretty ornery. The next day we went and got a hornet’s nest, and we was going to put it in a box with holes in it, and carry it off, but the family got home before we got it all fixed, and we had to hide it in the woods; and we was stung so much that we couldn’t set down for two days. The next day we went and got a lot of garter-snakes, and house-snakes, and put them in a bag, and put the bag in our room, and we was going to let them out after supper. We had a real good time, and we was going to have a real good time, but we didn’t. We had supper, and then we went to our room, and we see that the bag was open, and the snakes was gone. We didn’t know what to do, but we didn’t do nothing. We just went to bed, and we didn’t sleep very good. The next morning we got up, and we see that the snakes was all over the house. There was one on the rafters, and one on the plate, and one on the floor, and one on the bed, and one on the table, and one on the chair, and one on the wall, and one on the ceiling, and one on the door, and one on the window, and one on the clock, and one on the looking-glass, and one on the lamp, and one on the stove, and one on the cupboard, and one on the shelf, and one on the floor, and one on the bed, and one on the table, and one on the chair, and one on the wall, and one on the ceiling, and one on the door, and one on the window, and one on the clock, and one on the looking-glass, and one on the lamp, and one on the stove, and one on the cupboard, and one on the shelf, and one on the floor, and one on the bed, and one on the table, and one on the chair, and one on the wall, and one on the ceiling, and one on the door, and one on the window, and one on the clock, and one on the looking-glass, and one on the lamp, and one on the stove, and one on the cupboard, and one on the shelf, and one on the floor, and one on the bed, and one on the table, and one on the chair, and one on the wall, and one on the ceiling, and one on the door, and one on the window, and one on the clock, and one on the looking-glass, and one on the lamp, and one on the stove, and one on the cupboard, and one on the shelf, and one on the floor, and one on the bed, and one on the table, and one on the chair, and one on the wall, and one on the ceiling, and one on the door, and one on the window, and one on the clock, and one on the looking-glass, and one on the lamp, and one on the stove, and one on the cupboard, and one on the shelf, and one on the floor, and one on the bed, and one on the table, and one on the chair, and one on the wall, and one on the ceiling, and one on the door, and one on the window, and one on the clock, and one on the looking-glass, and one on the lamp, and one on the stove, and one on the cupboard, and one on the shelf, and one on the floor, and one on the bed, and one on the table, and one on the",

            "prefix-probing": "In the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap and fetched it down, and unstopped the best rat-hole, and in about an hour we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones; and then we took it and put it in a safe place under Aunt Sally’s bed.  Well, that was a good start, according to Tom. He said a prisoner warn’t no sort of a prisoner without he had pets, and rats was the commonest, because they was the easiest to get. He said we’d got to tame ‘em and teach ‘em tricks, and Jim could have ‘em for company. I didn’t see no sense in it, but Tom he said it was in the books, and you couldn’t have a first-class escape without it. So we had the rats. The next thing was to get some spiders and a snake or two, because prisoners always had them too, for company and to charm. We got a sack and went out in the woods and poked around till we found a big black spider and a couple of garter snakes. Tom said garter snakes was the best kind for charming, though I reckon any snake would look about the same to a body that was scared of ‘em. We put the spider in a tin box with holes punched in the lid and the snakes in the sack, and fetched ‘em back. We hid the spider box under the bed with the rats, and the snakes we put in a basket in the corner of the room. It was getting crowded under that bed. Aunt Sally she was a mighty particular woman about her house, and I was getting powerful uneasy about all them critters being stowed away where she was bound to find ‘em sooner or later. Tom he just laughed and said it was all part of the adventure. He said the rats would gnaw through the trap and get out, and the snakes would get out of the basket, and the spider would get out of the box, and they’d all scatter around the room, and that would be exciting. Exciting warn’t the word I would have used. I was thinking more along the lines of a pure-D catastrophe. And sure enough, that night, whilst we was asleep, the rats gnawed through the wire of the trap – Tom said they always did in the books – and they got out. And the snakes, they worked their way out of the basket. And the spider, well, I reckon he just walked out of the holes in the lid. Anyway, when Aunt Sally went to make the bed in the morning, she let out a yell that would curdle milk a mile off. Rats was scattering everywhere, snakes was slithering across the floor, and I reckon the spider was somewhere too, though I didn’t see him just then. Aunt Sally she jumped up on a chair and screamed, and Uncle Silas he come running in with his gun, thinking it was burglars. When he seen what it was, he lowered the gun but he looked just as scared as Aunt Sally. We had a terrible time catching all them critters. The rats run under everything, the snakes went under the rug and behind the furniture, and Aunt Sally wouldn’t come down off the chair till every last one was gone. We caught most of the rats and put ‘em back in the trap, which Tom said we’d have to reinforce. The snakes we put back in the basket, and the spider box we put on a high shelf. Aunt Sally was powerful mad, and she wanted to know how all them things got in her room. We just mumbled something about the door being left open, but I reckon she didn’t rightly believe us. Tom he thought it was the best fun he’d had in a long time. He said it was just like the books, where the prisoner’s pets always got loose and caused a commotion. I told him I thought it was a heap more commotion than"

The old man he kept on talking, and pretty soon he says: “I’ve been thinking it over, and I reckon I better advertise him myself. I’ll put it in the St. Louis and New Orleans papers. I reckon he’s worth two hundred dollars, anyway. It’s been an uncommon long time, and I reckon he’s about given up by this time. He was a runaway nigger from down the river.” He said it all so calm, and so innocent, that it made the cold shivers run over me. I couldn’t say a word. I just set there and looked at him, and felt sick all over. Tom he looked at me, and I looked at him; and he knowed what I was thinking about. We didn’t say nothing till after breakfast. Then I says: “Tom, what are we going to do? The old man’s going to advertise Jim.” “Well,” says Tom, “I reckon we’ll have to get him out of here pretty quick. I reckon we better.” “What are we going to do?” I says. “I don’t know,” says Tom. “I reckon we’ll have to think up something.” Then he got to studying. By and by he says: “I know what we’ll do. We’ll write a nonnamous letter.” “What’s that?” I says. “Why, it’s a letter that ain’t signed,” says Tom. “You write it and send it to somebody, and they don’t know who it come from. That’s what they call a nonnamous letter. I’ve heard about them. They’re used in all kinds of cases, when you want to warn somebody, or scare somebody, or make somebody do something. They’re mighty handy.” “Well,” I says, “what are we going to do with it?” “Why,” says Tom, “we’ll write it to the old man, and tell him to look out for a runaway nigger named Jim, and that he’s hid in the woods, and that there’s a gang of cutthroats with him, and that they’re going to steal him and run him off down the river. That’ll scare the old man, and he’ll send for the neighbors, and we’ll have a grand time.” “But,” I says, “what’s the use of that? We want to get Jim out of here, not scare the old man.” “Well,” says Tom, “that’s part of the plan. You see, if we scare the old man, he’ll send for the neighbors, and they’ll all come with guns, and we’ll have a battle. That’ll be grand.” “But,” I says, “we don’t want to have a battle. We want to get Jim out.” “Well,” says Tom, “that’s what I’m telling you. We’ll have a battle, and in the excitement we’ll get Jim out. It’s the regular way. You can’t get a prisoner out of a jail without a battle. It ain’t done.” “Well,” I says, “if that’s the regular way, I reckon we’ll have to do it. But it seems to me there’s a heap of trouble about it.” “Why,” says Tom, “you don’t want to do it the easy way",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces an extended invented conversation between two characters at the breakfast table, which is not present in the original passage. This invented scene takes up a significant portion of the completion and shifts the focus away from the original narrative.\n- The completion omits a key section from the original where a plan involving anonymous letters and a historical reference is discussed. This results in the loss of an important plot development and character interaction.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the explanation of a specific plan involving sending warnings or anonymous letters, which is a central part of the original passage.\n- There is no mention of the historical example used to justify the plan, nor is there any discussion of disguises or the typical method for a prison escape as described in the original.\n- The dialogue that introduces and explains the concept of the letters and the escape method is missing.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes actions and dialogue to characters that do not occur in the original, such as the invented discussion about the runaway's supposed owner and physical description.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the original moves directly from the completion of work and the urgency of the situation to the planning of the escape, while the completion inserts unrelated dialogue and delays the introduction of the escape plan.\n- The completion misrepresents the urgency and the characters' reactions to the threat of advertising Jim, focusing instead on invented concerns and reassurances.\n\nTo improve, the LLM should avoid inventing new scenes or conversations, ensure all key planning elements and character interactions from the original are included, and maintain the correct sequence and focus of the narrative."

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents an extended conversation and planning session between the characters that does not occur in the original passage. It introduces new dialogue, reflections, and a digging scene that are not present in the source material.\n- The completion omits the entire sequence involving the preparation and delivery of a letter, which is central to the original passage.\n- The completion fails to include the content of the letter itself, which is a significant portion of the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The initial actions taken the next morning, including the preparation of a letter and the characters' concerns about surveillance, are missing.\n- The method used to deliver the letter, including the use of a specific route and the state of the person on watch, is not mentioned.\n- The actual text and warnings contained in the letter, as well as the instructions and signature, are entirely absent.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately describes the time and sequence of events, focusing on a night-time digging effort rather than the morning planning and letter delivery of the original.\n- It attributes actions and dialogue to the characters that do not occur in this part of the story, such as repeated statements about digging and escape plans.\n- The completion misrepresents the focus of the passage, shifting from a covert communication and warning to a physical escape attempt, which is not the subject of the original excerpt."

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents an extended dialogue between Aunt Sally, the narrator, and the farmers that is not present in the original passage. This includes a repetitive exchange about seeing or hearing people and a chorus of farmers insisting on taking action, which does not occur in the source text.\n- The completion omits a significant sequence from the original where the narrator describes his physical discomfort and anxiety, particularly the sensory details involving heat and butter.\n- The dramatic moment where Aunt Sally discovers the bread and butter hidden under the narrator's hat, and her emotional reaction, is missing entirely.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the narrator's internal state and physical sensations, such as confusion, fear, and the specific discomfort caused by the butter.\n- There is no mention of the tension among the men regarding when to act, nor the specific time cues and debate about waiting for a signal, which are present in the original.\n- The sequence where Aunt Sally reacts with alarm to the butter, mistakes it for a medical emergency, and the subsequent commotion is absent.\n- The resolution, where Aunt Sally expresses relief and sends the narrator to bed, is not included.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces inaccurate time cues and invented dialogue about the time approaching midnight, which is not handled in the same way in the original.\n- The sequence of events is altered: instead of focusing on the narrator's predicament and Aunt Sally's discovery, the completion shifts to a group discussion and repeated calls for action by the farmers.\n- Actions and lines are misattributed, with invented statements and responses that do not align with the original characters' behaviors or the narrative flow.\n- The completion repeats similar invented lines multiple times, which disrupts the narrative progression and does not reflect the structure of the original passage."

I couldn’t hardly get my words out, I was so distressed; but I told Tom they were coming, and every moment counted, and they were armed to the teeth. Then I looked for Jim, but couldn’t see him. Tom says:\n“He’s all right. Don’t you worry about him. But Huck, this is grand! We are right down in the thick of fun now! Lord, it’s the best doing that ever was! I wouldn’t give up for a hundred thousand dollars! S’pose we hadn’t got that hole bored? I wouldn’t care shucks. Well, Huck, if we can get away with it, we’ll have an adventure that’ll make folks talk for forty year!”\n“But Tom, please hurry! It ain’t no time for playing around. Where’s Jim?”\n“He’s right at your elbow; ready dressed. Now, we’ll hit the road!”\nSo they started for the hole. Well, I thought them farmers was right behind me, I was so scared, but Jim he grabbed me and whispered:\n“Don’t be a fool, it ain’t them. This is them. Stand still, and let’s see what they’re up to.”\nJim he was right. It was the farmers. They were fumbling at the padlock on the door. One of them says:\n“I wish we’d a got here a little sooner, and fetched it. But the desperadoes ain’t come yet. They said they would, you know. So there ain’t no hurry. They’re bound to come; that’s what they said. So, now, le’s undo the padlock, and—”\n“Condemn it, it won’t come! Here, lend me a hand, Bill. We can’t fool around all night. There, now. It’s all right. Come along.”\n“Hold on a minute; what you going to do?”\n“Do? What are we going to do? Why, we’re going to lock ourselves in, of course. They’ll come, and they’ll try the door, and they’ll find they can’t get in. Then they’ll storm the house and break for the door. And we’ll be laying for them, safe inside.

Answer, or I’ll shoot!”\nBut we didn’t answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved. Then there was a rush, and a bang, bang, bang! and the bullets fairly whizzed around us!

We could hear them because they wore boots and yelled, but we didn’t wear no boots and didn’t yell. We was in the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close on to us we dodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind them. They’d had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn’t scare off the robbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and here they come, making powwow enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so we stopped in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it warn’t nobody but us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just said howdy, and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering; and then we up-steam again, and whizzed along after them till we was nearly to the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was tied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the river, but didn’t make no more noise than we was obleeged to. Then we struck out, easy and comfortable, for the island where my raft was; and we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the bank, till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out.

I says: \"But Tom, it's dreadful bad; it looks like gangrene.\" \"Oh, shucks, Huck, what do you know about gangrene?\" \"I don't know anything at all, Tom, but it looks dreadful bad, whatever it is.\" \"Well, you see,\" Tom says, \"it's a kind of a beautiful accident, and it's a noble way to get hurt. It don't hurt bad; and I can't account for it the way it does hurt—it don't seem natural.\" He laid back and shut his eyes and moaned. Jim and me we set around and waited, and pretty soon Tom says: \"Come, hurry up! Heaps of things to do. We'll leave Jim to his folks. They won't ever bother him any more. Set him free, and we'll give him a splendid time, and he can tell us all about his adventures when he was a slave. We'll have him up to the house, and—\" He stopped, and his face was white. \"What's the matter?\" I says. \"Oh, I know!\" he says. \"We'll have to wait. I can't walk. I can't do anything. I'm shot.\" \"Yes,\" I says, \"that's what I was telling you.\" \"Oh, shucks! I know it,\" he says. \"I wish I hadn't done it. But it's no use now. We've got to wait.\" We waited a long time, and pretty soon he says: \"Come, hurry up! Heaps of things to do. We'll leave Jim to his folks. They won't ever bother him any more.

When we found that out, we was powerful sorry, but Tom was just made. He laid there and moaned, and kept on saying it was \"elegant\" and the \"best luck in the world,\" and all that kind of foolishness. But he was in considerable pain, and his leg bled a good deal. We helped him into the wigwam and tore up one of the duke's old shirts for rags.

He was thinking how good it was to be free, and how he wouldn't ever be a slave no more. And he was thinking how he had helped to set Tom free, and how he had risked his life for him. And he was thinking how Tom had got shot trying to help him. And he was thinking how he ought to do something for Tom. Pretty soon he says: \"Mars Tom, we can't go no furder. You's hurt bad.

If it was me that was shot, and you was well, you wouldn't leave me, would you?\" \"No,\" says Tom, \"of course I wouldn't.\" \"Well,\" says Jim, \"then I ain't going to leave you. We got to get a doctor.\" I looked at Jim, and I seen he was right. He was right and I was wrong. I had been thinking about myself, and about getting away, and about being free. But Jim he was thinking about Tom, and about doing what was right. I says to myself, I says, here's a nigger, which I have helped to set free, and he's risking his life for a white boy that has helped to set him free.

I said he couldn't; I had come in a canoe myself. Said he would go right along with me, then. I told him he couldn't, because the canoe would not hold two, and I had come only to get him and then paddle back.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents a lengthy, repetitive exchange between the narrator and the doctor about Sid being shot, which is not present in the original. This invented dialogue dominates the middle and end of the passage, replacing actual events and interactions.\n- The completion omits the original's sequence involving the narrator explaining the circumstances of the shooting, the request for secrecy, and the plan to surprise the family.\n- The completion does not include the doctor's skepticism about the canoe's safety, nor the process of checking for other boats, nor the instructions given to the narrator at the end.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The initial explanation about how the injury occurred, including the specific setting and the fabricated story about the dream and the gun, is missing.\n- The conversation about the narrator's family and the identification of \"the Phelpses\" is omitted.\n- The doctor's reaction to the story, including his comments about the dream, is not present.\n- The sequence involving the lantern, saddle-bags, and the doctor's inspection of the canoe is missing.\n- The discussion about the number of people the canoe can carry, and the narrator's attempt to explain, is absent.\n- The doctor's decision to look for a larger boat, his inability to find one, and his instructions to the narrator about waiting or going home are not included.\n- The directions given to the doctor for finding the raft are missing.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes confusion to the doctor about the identity of the injured person, leading to an extended, repetitive dialogue that does not occur in the original.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion focuses on confusion about the canoe and the identity of \"Sid,\" rather than the original's progression from the fabricated story, to the doctor's preparations, to the boat inspection, and the final instructions.\n- The completion introduces invented details about the narrator not having a canoe and lending it to Sid, which are not part of the original passage.\n- The completion omits the original's time references and the plan to surprise the family, which are important to the narrative structure."

I didn’t wait any longer than to shed my clothes and slap on my raftsman outfit, and I was overboard and clattering along down the river road in a minute. I was flying down past the church, and I see a nig— a man lumbering along up the road. He was going pretty good for a fat man, I says to myself; yes, he’s a fat man. I begun to slack up, for he was getting close now, and I begun to see he was a big man—long hair all down his back and black. Thinks I, it’s a nigger. Well, I was scared, and I begun to shake, not knowing what to do, but I knowed who it was now. I begun to shake worse than ever, for it was Uncle Silas, and I was coming right towards him, and he might see me and know me. I begun to sidle into the trees till I could think what to do. Then I says to myself, I’ll turn and run the other way, and get to the island that way. But I hadn’t got started yet when he see me. He sung out, “Why, who’s this?” He was tearing along at a astonishing gait. I says, to myself, this won’t do. I got to face it. I can’t get away. I can’t do it. So I says, “It’s me, Uncle Silas.” He come a-lumbering up, and says, “Why, bless my soul! if it ain’t Tom Sawyer! How did you get here?” “Why,” I says, “I come down the river, you know, and I got here about an hour ago.” “Well, I’ll be dod-durned,” he says. “I thought you was in bed, and Sid, too. The doctor said he was going to fetch you all the way home.” “Well,” I says, “he did fetch us all the way home, but we got up again.” “Why, bless my soul!” he says. “What did you get up again for?” “Why,” I says, “we was going to the island, you know, and we got up to go to the island.” “Well, I’ll be dod-durned,” he says. “I thought you was in bed, and Sid, too. The doctor said he was going to fetch you all the way home.” “Well,” I says, “he did fetch us all the way home, but we got up again.” “Why, bless my soul!” he says. “What did you get up again for?” “Why,” I says, “we was going to the island, you know, and we got up to go to the island.” “Well, I’ll be dod-durned,” he says. “I thought you was in bed, and Sid, too.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces a lengthy invented scene involving hiding in the weeds, internal deliberation, and a confrontation with a woman that does not exist in the original passage.\n- The original contains a sequence where the narrator recounts a specific explanation to a woman, followed by her reaction and a reflective moment, which is missing in the completion.\n- The ending of the original, which includes a sudden realization about the time of day and concern for another character, is entirely omitted in the completion.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the narrator's detailed recounting of the events to the woman, including the explanation for not being in the room and the specific actions taken during the incident.\n- The emotional response and forgiveness from the woman, as well as her reflections on the behavior of boys, are not present.\n- The original's closing actions—affectionate gestures and the woman's shift to a new concern—are missing.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion presents an inaccurate sequence of events, with invented dialogue and actions that do not align with the original narrative.\n- There are misattributed actions and dialogue, with the narrator interacting with characters and situations not found in the original.\n- The timing and flow of events are incorrect, with the completion focusing on confusion and confrontation rather than the original's resolution and shift in focus at the end."

Of course I judged he must be a runaway nigger, and there I was! and there I had to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night. It was a fix, I tell you! I had a couple of patients with the chills, and of course I’d of liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn’t, because the nigger might get away, and then I’d be to blame; and yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail. So there I had to stick plumb until daylight this morning; and I never see a nigger that was a better nuss or faithfuller, and yet he was risking his freedom to do it, and was all tired out, too, and I see plain enough he’d been worked main hard lately. I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars—and kind treatment, too. I had everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as he would a done at home—better, maybe, because it was so quiet; but there I was, with both of ’m on my hands, and there I had to stick till about dawn this morning; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luck would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was about, and we never had no trouble. And the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and towed her over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start.

And we done it elegant, too.” He’d got a start, and she never checked him up, just set and stared and stared, and let him clip along, and I see it warn’t no use for me to put in. “Why, Aunty, it cost us a power of work—weeks of it—hours and hours, every night, whilst you was all asleep. And we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and the shirt, and your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and case-knives, and the warming-pan, and the grindstone, and flour, and just no end of things, and you can’t think what work it was to make the saws, and pens, and inscriptions, and one thing or another, and you can’t think half the fun it was. And we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things, and nonnamous letters from the robbers, and get up and down the lightning-rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, and made the rope ladder and send it in cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and things to work with in your apron pocket—”\n“Mercy sakes!”\n“—and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on, for company for Jim; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat that you come near spiling the whole business, because the men come before we was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us and let drive at us, and I got my share, and we dodged out of the path and let them go by, and when the dogs come they warn’t interested in us, but went for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for the raft, and was all safe, and Jim was a free man, and we done it all by ourselves, and wasn’t it bully, Aunty!”",

Why, what has become of you?”\n“I hain’t been feeling very well, Aunt Sally, and I laid up.”\n“Lay up, sakes alive, what on airth for? The doctor said there warn’t nothing the matter.”\n“Well, it didn’t make no difference what the doctor said; I was feeling just that way, anyways, and so I laid up.”\n“Why, what was the matter with you, Sid? Say!”\n“Oh, not much. I just felt creaky and crawly and spiritless, and mean, and so I laid up.”\n“Well, you old stump, I think you’ve been laying for a hiding! and you’ll get it, too.
