I attempted to think positive thoughts but couldn't. My loneliness was so intense I almost wished for death. The stars were visible, and the leaves in the woods made a sad, rustling sound. I heard a distant owl's hoot, which sounded like it was mourning a deceased person, while a whippoorwill and a dog's cry seemed to lament someone who was soon to die. The wind felt like it was attempting to convey something to me, but I couldn't understand it, which sent chills through me. From deeper in the woods, I then heard a noise resembling that of a ghost trying to communicate something important it couldn't express, thus preventing it from resting peacefully in its grave and forcing it to wander nightly in sorrow. I became so dejected and frightened that I desperately wanted company. Soon after, a spider crawled onto my shoulder. I brushed it off, and it fell into the candle flame, shriveling up immediately. I understood without being told that this was an extremely bad sign that would bring me misfortune, and I was so terrified I was trembling uncontrollably. I got up and spun around three times where I stood, making the sign of the cross each time. Then, I tied a small strand of my hair with thread as a charm against witches. However, I had no faith that this would help. People do this when they've lost a horseshoe they found instead of nailing it above the door, but I had never heard that it was a method to ward off bad luck after killing a spider.",

After a while, they brought in the servants and held prayers, then everyone went to bed. I headed up to my room with a candle and set it on the table. I sat by the window, trying to think happy thoughts, but I couldn’t. I felt so lonely I almost wished I were dead. The stars were out, the leaves rustled sadly in the woods, and somewhere I heard an owl hooting about someone who had died, and a whippoorwill and a dog howling as if someone was about to die. The wind seemed to whisper to me, but I couldn’t understand it, and it made me feel cold and uneasy. Then, from deep in the woods, I heard a sound like a ghost trying to share what’s on its mind but unable to be understood, doomed to wander every night in sorrow. I got so sad and scared I wished for company. Suddenly, a spider crawled up my shoulder and I brushed it off—unfortunately, it landed in the candle and was burned up before I could stop it. I knew right away that this was a really bad omen and meant bad luck, so I was very frightened, nearly shaking out of my clothes. To protect myself, I turned around three times and crossed my chest each time, then tied a bit of my hair with thread to ward off witches. But I still didn’t feel safe, since I only knew about the hair thing for when you lose a horseshoe you found without hanging it over the door, not for killing a spider."

Then he called out, \"Who is there?\" He listened for a while longer; then he came quietly down the path and stopped right between us; we were so close we could have almost touched him. For what seemed like many minutes, there wasn't a sound, with all of us huddled together so closely. A spot on my ankle started to itch, but I didn't dare scratch it; then my ear began to itch; and next my back, exactly between my shoulder blades. It felt like I would die if I couldn't scratch. Well, I've noticed that phenomenon many times since. If you are with important people, or at a funeral, or attempting to fall asleep when you're not tired—if you are anywhere where you shouldn't scratch—you will find yourself itching all over in maybe over a thousand places. Soon after, Jim said, \"Tell me, who are you? Where are you? May I be cursed if I didn't hear something.

Tom said he slipped Jim’s hat off of his head and hung it on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn’t wake. Afterwards Jim said the witches bewitched him and put him in a trance, and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again, and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it.

Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he got so he wouldn’t hardly notice the other niggers. Niggers would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country. Strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder. Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things, Jim would happen in and say, “Hm!

Later, Jim claimed witches had bewitched him, put him in a trance, and ridden him all over the state before leaving him under the tree and hanging his hat on the branch as proof. The more Jim told the story, the wilder it became—soon he said the witches rode him to New Orleans, and eventually all over the world, wearing him out so badly his back was covered in sores. Jim was very proud of his story, and he started acting superior to the other enslaved people. People came from miles away to hear Jim talk about the witches. Whenever anyone acted like an expert on witchcraft, Jim would cut them down and everyone deferred to him. He always wore the five-cent coin Tom left as payment on a string around his neck, claiming it was a charm given to him by the devil himself, saying it could cure people or summon witches if he said the right words—which he refused to reveal. People offered Jim gifts just to see the coin, but wouldn’t touch it for fear of its connection to the devil. Jim became almost useless as a worker because he got so full of himself from his supposed supernatural experiences."

Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our hands and knees. We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked under a wall where you wouldn’t a noticed that there was a hole.

Below the village, the river stretched out, a full mile wide, looking very calm and grand. We descended the hill and located Jo Harper, Ben Rogers, and a few other boys, who were hiding in the old tannery. We untied a small boat and rowed downstream for two and a half miles to the prominent mark on the hillside, where we went ashore. We made our way to a dense thicket of bushes. Tom made everyone promise to keep our activities secret, then showed them a hidden opening in the hillside, right within the thickest part of the bushes. After lighting candles, we crawled inside on our hands and knees. We moved about two hundred yards before the cave opened up. Tom explored the various passages and soon slipped under a low rock formation where the opening was barely noticeable. We followed him along a narrow passage and entered a small chamber that was damp, clammy, and cold. We stopped there, and Tom announced, \"Now, we will establish this group of robbers and call ourselves Tom Sawyer's Gang. Anyone who wishes to join must take an oath and sign their name in blood.\" Everyone readily agreed. So, Tom produced a sheet of paper on which he had written the oath and read it aloud.

It stipulated that if someone harmed any member of the band, whichever boy was assigned to kill that person and their family must carry out the task without delay, refusing to eat or sleep until they had killed them and carved a cross symbol, the band's mark, onto their chests. No one outside the band was permitted to use that mark; if they did, they would be sued, and a second offense would result in death. Furthermore, if any member of the band betrayed the secrets, their throat was to be cut, their body burned, the ashes scattered widely, their name removed from the list with blood, never to be spoken by the gang again, but cursed and forgotten forever. Everyone declared it was a truly magnificent oath and asked Tom if he had conceived it entirely on his own.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "When Tom and I reached the top of the hill, we looked down at the village and could see a few lights shining, probably where people were sick. The sky was full of sparkling stars, and by the village, the wide, quiet, and majestic river flowed. We went down to meet Jo Harper, Ben Rogers, and a few other boys, who were hiding in the old tannery. We took a small boat and rowed about two and a half miles down the river to a big scar on the hillside, where we landed.\n\nThere, we gathered in some bushes, and Tom made everyone swear to keep a secret. He then showed us a hidden hole in the hillside in the thick part of the bushes. Lighting candles, we crawled inside on our hands and knees for about two hundred yards until the cave opened up. Tom searched the passages and soon ducked under a wall where you wouldn’t have noticed a hole. We followed a narrow path into a damp, chilly room, where we stopped. Tom announced that we’d form a band of robbers called Tom Sawyer’s Gang. Anyone wanting to join had to take an oath and sign their name in blood.\n\nEveryone agreed, so Tom pulled out a sheet with the oath written on it and read it aloud. The oath bound everyone to the group, required them never to reveal secrets, and demanded that if anyone harmed a gang member, the others would have to take revenge by killing the offender and their family and marking them with a cross on their chest. No one outside the gang could use that mark, or they’d be sued—and if they did it again, they’d be killed. Anyone in the gang who revealed secrets would have their throat cut, body burned, ashes scattered, and their name removed from the list, cursed, and forgotten forever.\n\nAll the boys said it was a fine oath and asked Tom if he had made it up himself."

That ain’t no sort of style. We are highwaymen. We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks on, and kill the people and take their watches and money.”\n“Must we always kill the people?”\n“Oh, certainly. It’s best. Some authorities think different, but mostly it’s considered best to kill them—except some that you bring to the cave here, and keep them till they’re ransomed.”\n“Ransomed? What’s that?”\n“I don’t know. But that’s what they do. I’ve seen it in books; and so of course that’s what we’ve got to do.”\n“But how can we do it if we don’t know what it is?”\n“Why, blame it all, we’ve got to do it. Don’t I tell you it’s in the books? Do you want to go to doing different from what’s in the books, and get things all muddled up?”\n“Oh, that’s all very fine to say, Tom Sawyer, but how in the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don’t know how to do it to them?—that’s the thing I want to get at. Now, what do you reckon it is?”\n“Well, I don’t know. But per’aps if we keep them till they’re ransomed, it means that we keep them till they’re dead.”\n“Now, that’s something like. That’ll answer. Why couldn’t you said that before? We’ll keep them till they’re ransomed to death; and a bothersome lot they’ll be, too—eating up everything, and always trying to get loose.”\n“How you talk, Ben Rogers. How can they get loose when there’s a guard over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?”\n“A guard! Well, that is good. So somebody’s got to set up all night and never get any sleep, just so as to watch them. I think that’s foolishness. Why can’t a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here?”\n“Because it ain’t in the books so—that’s why. Now, Ben Rogers, do you want to do things regular, or don’t you?—that’s the idea. Don’t you reckon that the people that made the books knows what’s the correct thing to do? Do you reckon you can learn ’em anything? Not by a good deal. No, sir, we’ll just go on and ransom them in the regular way.”\n“All right. I don’t mind; but I say it’s a fool way, anyhow. Say, do we kill the women, too?”\n“Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn’t let on. Kill the women? No; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that. You fetch them to the cave, and you’re always as polite as pie to them; and by-and-by they fall in love with you, and never want to go home any more.”\n“Well, if that’s the way I’m agreed, but I don’t take no stock in it. Mighty soon we’ll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and fellows waiting to be ransomed, that there won’t be no place for the robbers. But go ahead, I ain’t got nothing to say.”",

When Ben questioned what they would rob, suggesting houses or cattle, Tom corrected him, stating that stealing cattle was burglary, not robbery, and lacked style. He explained they were highwaymen who would ambush stages and carriages on the road, wearing masks, kill the occupants, and take their watches and money. Ben inquired if killing was always necessary. Tom affirmed it was usually the best approach, although some experts differed, with the exception of specific captives brought to the cave to be 'ransomed.' Ben asked for the meaning of 'ransomed.' Tom admitted he didn't know but insisted it was a necessary action because he had read about it in books. Ben challenged the idea of doing something they didn't understand, but Tom argued that deviating from the books would complicate everything and that the book writers knew the proper way. When Ben pressed for an explanation of 'ransomed,' Tom speculated it might mean keeping captives until they died. Ben found this practical and acceptable, lamenting that Tom hadn't suggested it earlier, but worried about the captives being a nuisance by eating and attempting to escape. Tom dismissed the escape concern, mentioning guards who would shoot anyone trying to get away. Ben thought the guard idea was impractical, requiring someone to stay awake constantly, and proposed it would be more sensible to simply kill the captives with a club upon arrival. Tom rejected this, reiterating that it wasn't in the books and insisting on following the established literary methods, which he believed were correct. Ben reluctantly agreed to the 'fool way' of ransoming. He then asked if women would also be killed. Tom reacted with surprise at Ben's apparent ignorance, stating that killing women was not a practice found in books. Instead, he explained, women would be brought to the cave, treated very politely, and would eventually fall in love and not wish to return home. Ben accepted this plan but expressed skepticism, predicting the cave would become overcrowded with women and captives, leaving no space for the robbers, though he ultimately deferred to Tom's decision.",

When Ben questioned whether they'd be stealing things like cattle, Tom clarified that such acts were burglary, not the kind of grand robbery they should be doing as highwaymen. He explained that highwaymen rob carriages on the road, wearing masks, and they kill the victims before taking their valuables.\n\nBen wondered if it was always necessary to kill people, and Tom insisted that it was standard practice, although some authorities disagreed. Sometimes, Tom said, captives are brought to the cave and held until they're ransomed. Ben then asked what \"ransomed\" meant, but Tom admitted he didn't know; he just knew that's what happened in books, which meant it was what they should do. When pressed on how to ransom people without knowing what it was, Tom insisted they had to stick to what was in the books, even if they didn’t fully understand it.\n\nBen suggested maybe keeping them till they're ransomed actually means keeping them until they die, which Tom accepted. Ben complained that guarding captives would be a lot of trouble, but Tom said there would be guards to prevent escape. Ben thought that was foolish and wondered why they couldn't just ransom people immediately, but Tom again insisted it had to be done the way books described.\n\nBen then asked if women should be killed too, but Tom said of course not; the books always showed that robbers treated women politely, and eventually the women would fall in love with their captors. Ben reluctantly agreed, though he thought the cave would get overcrowded with captives and women, but he went along with Tom's plan."

I went and told the widow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was “spiritual gifts.” This was too many for me, but she told me what she meant—I must help other people, and do everything I could for other people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about myself. This was including Miss Watson, as I took it. I went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn’t see no advantage about it—except for the other people; so at last I reckoned I wouldn’t worry about it any more, but just let it go. Sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make a body’s mouth water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold and knock it all down again. I judged I could see that there was two Providences, and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the widow’s Providence, but if Miss Watson’s got him there warn’t no help for him any more. I thought it all out, and reckoned I would belong to the widow’s if he wanted me, though I couldn’t make out how he was a-going to be any better off then than what he was before, seeing I was so ignorant, and so kind of low-down and ornery.",

I asked myself, if you can really get whatever you pray for, then why didn't Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork? Why couldn't the widow get her stolen silver snuffbox back? Why couldn't Miss Watson gain weight? I decided there wasn't anything to that idea. I told the widow about my thoughts, and she said what a person gets by praying for is \"spiritual gifts.\" This was too much for me, but she explained that she meant I should help other people, do everything I could for them, always look out for them, and never think about myself. I understood this included Miss Watson. I went back out into the woods and thought about it for a long time, but I couldn't see any benefit for me personally—only for other people. So, in the end, I decided I wouldn't bother thinking about it anymore and would just let it go. Sometimes the widow would take me aside and talk about Providence in a way that sounded wonderful; but maybe the next day, Miss Watson would step in and tear it all down again. I figured I could see that there were two different kinds of Providence. A poor guy would have a pretty good chance with the widow's kind of Providence, but if Miss Watson's got him, there was no hope left for him. I thought it all through and decided I would belong to the widow's Providence if it wanted me, although I couldn't understand how it would be any better off than it was before, given that I was so uneducated and kind of worthless and difficult.",

So I concluded there wasn’t much to it. I told the widow my thoughts, and she explained that prayer was for getting 'spiritual gifts,' meaning I should help others and always think of them, not myself. I figured this included Miss Watson. I thought it over for a while but couldn’t see the benefit, unless it was just for other people, so I decided not to worry about it anymore. Sometimes the widow would try to persuade me about Providence in an appealing way, but Miss Watson would contradict her the next day. It seemed to me there were two Providences: one from the widow, which gave a person some hope, and one from Miss Watson, which didn’t offer any. In the end, I decided I’d go with the widow’s Providence if it wanted me, though I couldn’t see how Providence would benefit for having someone as ignorant and lowly as me."

You want to sell all your property to me—not give it. That’s the correct idea.”\nThen he wrote something on a paper and read it over, and says:\n“There; you see it says ‘for a consideration.’ That means I have bought it of you and paid you for it.

I pleaded, 'Please take it, and don’t ask me anything—then I won’t have to tell any lies.' He thought for a moment and then said, 'Ah, I think I understand.

He suggested I let him invest it with the six thousand I already had, warning that if I took the money, I would probably spend it. I told him I didn’t want to spend the money, and in fact, I didn’t want any of it, not even the six thousand dollars — I wanted to give it all to him.

This time, he said the hair-ball was working fine and that it could reveal my entire fortune if I wanted. I told him to go ahead. The hair-ball seemed to speak to Jim, and Jim relayed its message to me. He said: 'Your father still doesn't know what he's going to do yet; sometimes he thinks about leaving, then again he thinks about staying. The best thing for you is to just relax and let him do as he pleases. There are two angels watching over him—one white and shining, the other black. The white angel gets him to do good for a while, but then the black angel comes along and ruins it. No one can say yet which angel he'll end up following. But as for you, you'll have plenty of trouble and happiness in your life. Sometimes you'll get hurt, sometimes you'll fall ill, but each time you'll recover. There are two girls coming into your life—one light and one dark. One is wealthy, the other poor. You’ll marry the poor one first, and later the rich one. You should avoid water as much as you can and not take any risks, because your fate is to be hanged.' When I lit my candle and went up to my room that night, there was Pap himself sitting there!"

His hair and bushy beard were all black, with no gray in them. His face had no normal color; where you could see it, it was deathly white, not a healthy white but a sickly, creepy kind of white like a tree frog or the belly of a fish.

Judge Thatcher and the widow tried to get the court to remove me from my father's custody so one of them could become my guardian, but the new judge, not knowing my father's reputation, said that courts should avoid breaking up families if possible and would rather not take a child away from his father. So Judge Thatcher and the widow had to stop trying. That decision made my father very happy, and he threatened to beat me badly if I didn't get money for him. I borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher, which my father immediately took to buy more alcohol. He spent the rest of the night getting drunk, making a scene, yelling, and causing trouble all over town until almost midnight, banging on a tin pan. They put him in jail, and the next day he went before the court and was sentenced to another week in jail. But he didn't mind; he said he was the boss of his son and would make things tough for me."

He invited them to examine, grasp, and shake it, proclaiming that this hand, once like that of a 'hog,' was now the hand of a man embarking on a new path, a path he would rather die than abandon. He urged them to remember his statement. He emphasized that his hand was now clean and they should shake it without hesitation. Consequently, each person present shook his hand in turn, and they all cried. The judge's wife went so far as to kiss it. Subsequently, the old man signed a pledge by making his mark.

The judge was so touched he wanted to hug him, and both the judge and his wife cried. The old man expressed that those who are struggling mostly need compassion, which the judge agreed with, and they all became emotional again.

He asked everyone to shake it, assuring them it was clean and sincere. One by one, everyone shook his hand, the judge’s wife even kissed it.

Pap was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away; I reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, I was most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in the time. But this time I found something at last; I found an old rusty wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof. I greased it up and went to work. There was an old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out. I got under the table and raised the blanket, and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out—big enough to let me through. Well, it was a good long job, but I was getting towards the end of it when I heard pap’s gun in the woods. I got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid my saw, and pretty soon pap come in.",

He also began leaving for extended periods, locking me inside. One instance, he locked me up and stayed away for three days. It was terribly isolating. I thought he must have drowned and that I'd never be able to leave. I was frightened. I decided I had to figure out a way to escape from there. I had attempted to get out of that cabin many times before, but I couldn't find a method. There wasn't a single window large enough for even a dog to pass through. I couldn't climb up the chimney; it was too narrow. The door was made of thick, solid oak boards. Pap was very careful not to leave behind a knife or anything useful in the cabin when he was gone; I bet I had searched the place thoroughly at least a hundred times; actually, I spent most of my time searching, as it was practically the only way to occupy myself. But this time, I finally discovered something; I found an old, rusty wood-saw missing its handle; it was hidden between a roof rafter and the outer boards. I lubricated it and started working. There was an old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the back of the cabin behind the table, intended to stop the wind from coming through the gaps and extinguishing the candle. I got under the table, lifted the blanket, and began sawing a piece out of the big bottom log—large enough for me to get through. It was a lengthy task, but I was nearing completion when I heard Pap's gun go off in the woods. I quickly erased any evidence of my work, let the blanket fall, and concealed my saw, and shortly after, Pap came in.",

He also began leaving for long periods and would lock me inside the cabin. Once, he left me locked up for three days. It was terribly lonely. I thought maybe he had drowned and that I’d never be freed. I was frightened. I decided I had to find a way to escape. I had tried many times to get out of that cabin but could never figure out how. There wasn’t a window big enough for even a dog to crawl through. I couldn’t climb up the chimney; it was too tight. The door was made from thick, solid oak slabs. My father was careful not to leave anything like a knife behind when he went out; I must have searched that cabin a hundred times, since searching was about the only thing to do with my time. But this time, I finally found something—a rusty old wood-saw without a handle, hidden between a rafter and the roof boards. I cleaned it and got to work. There was an old horse blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin, behind the table, to stop wind from blowing through the cracks and putting out the candle. I crawled under the table, lifted the blanket, and started sawing through a section of the big bottom log—big enough for me to squeeze through. It took a long time, but I was nearly finished when I heard my father’s gun outside in the woods. I quickly hid all evidence of my work, put the blanket back, hid the saw, and soon my dad came in."

His lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and Judge Thatcher knowed how to do it. And he said people allowed there’d be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian, and they guessed it would win this time. This shook me up considerable, because I didn’t want to go back to the widow’s any more and be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it. Then the old man got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of, and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn’t skipped any, and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round, including a considerable parcel of people which he didn’t know the names of, and so called them what’s-his-name when he got to them, and went right along with his cussing.\nHe said he would like to see the widow get me. He said he would watch out, and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place six or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till they dropped and they couldn’t find me. That made me pretty uneasy again, but only for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn’t stay on hand till he got that chance.\nThe old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got. There was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon, ammunition, and a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two newspapers for wadding, besides some tow. I toted up a load, and went back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest. I thought it all over, and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and take to the woods when I run away. I guessed I wouldn’t stay in one place, but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and hunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow couldn’t ever find me any more. I judged I would saw out and leave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would. I got so full of it I didn’t notice how long I was staying till the old man hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded.\nI got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark. While I was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of warmed up, and went to ripping again. He had been drunk over in town, and laid in the gutter all night, and he was a sight to look at. A body would a thought he was Adam—he was just all mud. Whenever his liquor begun to work he most always went for the govment, this time he says:\n“Call this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it’s like. Here’s the law a-standing ready to take a man’s son away from him—a man’s own son, which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and all the expense of raising. Yes, just as that man has got that son raised at last, and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin’ for him and give him a rest, the law up and goes for him. And they call that govment! That ain’t all, nuther. The law backs that old Judge Thatcher up and helps him to keep me out o’ my property. Here’s what the law does: The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and up’ards, and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets him go round in clothes that ain’t fitten for a hog. They call that govment! A man can’t get his rights in a govment like this. Sometimes I’ve a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all. Yes, and I told ’em so; I told old Thatcher so to his face. Lots of ’em heard me, and can tell what I said. Says I, for two cents I’d leave the blamed country and never come a-near it agin. Them’s the very words. I says look at my hat—if you call it a hat—but the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till it’s below my chin, and then it ain’t rightly a hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o’ stove-pipe. Look at it, says I—such a hat for me to wear—one of the wealthiest men in this town if I could git my rights.\n“Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. Why, looky here. There was a free nigger there from Ohio—a mulatter, most as white as a white man. He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the shiniest hat; and there ain’t a man in that town that’s got as fine clothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a silver-headed cane—the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State. And what do you think? They said he was a p’fessor in a college, and could talk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything. And that ain’t the wust. They said he could vote when he was at home. Well, that let me out. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming to? It was ’lection day, and I was just about to go and vote myself if I warn’t too drunk to get there; but when they told me there was a State in this country where they’d let that nigger vote, I drawed out. I says I’ll never vote agin. Them’s the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may rot for all me—I’ll never vote agin as long as I live. And to see the cool way of that nigger—why, he wouldn’t a give me the road if I hadn’t shoved him out o’ the way.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Pap arrived, not in a pleasant mood, which was typical for him. He claimed he had been in town, and nothing was going right. His lawyer believed he would likely win his legal case and get the money if the trial ever actually began, but there were ways to postpone it for a long time, and Judge Thatcher knew how to do that. Pap also said people expected there would be another lawsuit to remove me from his care and assign the widow as my guardian, and they thought she would win this time. This worried me significantly because I did not want to return to the widow's and be so restricted and 'civilized,' as they called it. Then the old man began to swear extensively, cursing everything and everyone he could think of, and then repeated the curses to ensure he hadn't missed anyone. Afterward, he concluded with a sort of general curse encompassing many people whose names he didn't know, referring to them as 'what's-his-name' as he went along with his ranting. He declared he'd like to see the widow try to get me. He would be alert, and if they attempted such a scheme, he knew of a place about six or seven miles away to hide me where they could search until they collapsed and still wouldn't find me. That made me uneasy again for a moment, but I quickly decided I wouldn't stay put long enough for him to get that opportunity. The old man ordered me to go to the boat and bring the supplies he had bought. These included a fifty-pound bag of cornmeal, a side of bacon, ammunition, a four-gallon jug of whiskey, and an old book and two newspapers to use as wadding, in addition to some tow fibers. I carried one load up and went back to sit on the front of the boat to rest. I thought it all through and decided I would leave with the gun and some fishing lines and escape into the woods when I ran away. I planned not to stay in one place but to travel across the country, mostly at night, hunting and fishing to stay alive, getting so far away that neither the old man nor the widow could ever find me again. I determined I would saw my way out and leave that night if Pap got drunk enough, which I was sure he would. I was so absorbed in my plans that I didn't notice how long I had been there until the old man yelled, asking if I was sleeping or had drowned. I brought all the items up to the cabin, and by then, it was nearly dark. While I was preparing supper, the old man took a drink or two, got somewhat agitated, and started complaining again. He had been drunk in town and spent the entire night in the gutter, looking dreadful. Anyone would have thought he was Adam; he was completely covered in mud. Whenever the alcohol began to affect him, he almost always attacked the government. This time he said, 'You call this a government! Just look at it and see what it's like. Here's the law standing ready to take a man's son away from him—a man's own son, for whom he's had all the trouble, anxiety, and expense of raising. Yes, just when that man has finally raised that son, and he's ready to work and start doing something for him and give him a rest, the law steps in and goes after him. And they call that a government! That's not all, either. The law supports that old Judge Thatcher and helps him keep me from my property. Here's what the law does: The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and upwards, and forces him into a miserable old cabin like this, and lets him wear clothes not even suitable for a pig. They call that a government! A man can't get his rights under a government like this. Sometimes I feel a strong urge to just leave the country permanently. Yes, and I told them so; I told old Thatcher that directly to his face. Many people heard me and can verify what I said. I declared, for two cents, I'd leave this terrible country and never come near it again. Those were my exact words. I said look at my hat—if you can even call it a hat—but the top lifts up, and the rest hangs down until it's below my chin, and then it's not really a hat at all, but more like my head was pushed through a section of stovepipe. Look at it, I said—such a hat for me to wear—me, one of the wealthiest men in this town if I could get what's mine. Oh, yes, this is a wonderful government, truly wonderful. Why, look here. There was a free Black man there from Ohio—a mulatto, almost as light-skinned as a white person. He had the cleanest shirt you ever saw, too, and the shiniest hat; and no man in that town had clothes as nice as his. And he had a gold watch and chain, and a cane with a silver handle—the most imposing old gray-haired wealthy man in the State. And what do you think? They said he was a college professor and could speak all sorts of languages and knew everything. And that's not the worst part. They said he could vote when he was back home. Well, that settled it for me. I thought, what is this country coming to? It was election day, and I was just about to go vote myself if I wasn't too drunk to get there. But when they told me there was a State in this country where they would let that Black man vote, I backed out. I said I will never vote again. Those are the exact words I said; everyone heard me; and as far as I'm concerned, the country can rot—I will never vote again as long as I live. And to see how calm that Black man was—why, he wouldn't have given me the road if I hadn't pushed him out of the way.'",

Pap said people believed there would be another court case to take Huck from him and give custody to the widow, and this time it might succeed. This worried Huck, because he didn’t want to go back to living with the widow and have to follow all her rules. Then Pap started swearing furiously at everything and everyone, even people he didn’t know, just to make sure he left no one out. He said he’d like to see the widow try to get Huck, and threatened that if anyone tried, he had a hiding place miles away where they’d never find Huck. This made Huck nervous, but he figured he wouldn't wait around for that to happen. Pap sent Huck to bring supplies—cornmeal, bacon, ammunition, a big jug of whiskey, some old papers, and tow—from the skiff to the cabin. Huck started thinking about running away into the woods, hunting and fishing by night so no one could track him. He decided if Pap got drunk that night, he would escape. After bringing in the supplies, it was evening. While Huck cooked, Pap began drinking again and became more agitated. He had been drunk in town all night and was filthy. As soon as the alcohol hit him, Pap launched into a rant against the government. He complained that the law was trying to take his son away after he had raised him, and that it kept him from getting his own money, forcing him to live in poverty. Pap claimed he had threatened to leave the country and made a scene about his tattered hat for emphasis. He went on about a free black man from Ohio, immaculately dressed and educated, who was able to vote in his home state. Pap found this outrageous and said he’d never vote again, disgusted that such things could happen."

He drank and drank, and tumbled down on his blankets by-and-by; but luck didn’t run my way. He didn’t go sound asleep, but was uneasy. He groaned and moaned and thrashed around this way and that for a long time. At last I got so sleepy I couldn’t keep my eyes open all I could do, and so before I knowed what I was about I was sound asleep, and the candle burning.\nI don’t know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was an awful scream and I was up.

He started and run round and round the cabin, hollering “Take him off! take him off! he’s biting me on the neck!” I never see a man look so wild in the eyes.

He wore out by-and-by, and laid still a while, moaning. Then he laid stiller, and didn’t make a sound. I could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and it seemed terrible still. He was laying over by the corner. By-and-by he raised up part way and listened, with his head to one side. He says, very low:\n“Tramp—tramp—tramp; that’s the dead; tramp—tramp—tramp; they’re coming after me; but I won’t go. Oh, they’re here! don’t touch me—don’t! hands off—they’re cold; let go. Oh, let a poor devil alone!”\nThen he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let him alone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the old pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying.

He kept drinking and eventually fell onto his blankets, but things didn't work out for me. He didn't enter a deep sleep; instead, he was restless. He spent a long time groaning, moaning, and thrashing back and forth. Eventually, I became so overwhelmed with sleepiness that I couldn't possibly keep my eyes open, and before I was fully aware, I had fallen fast asleep with the candle still lit. I'm not sure how long I slept, but I was abruptly jolted awake by a terrifying scream. There was Pap, looking deranged, leaping around frantically and yelling about snakes. He claimed they were crawling up his legs, then he'd jump and shriek, saying one had bitten his cheek—though I couldn't see any snakes. He began running in circles around the cabin, shouting, 'Get him off! Get him off! He's biting my neck!' I had never seen eyes look so wild. Soon he was utterly worn out and collapsed, panting; then he rolled over and over astonishingly quickly, kicking objects in every direction, striking and grasping at the empty air with his hands, all while screaming and claiming devils were holding onto him. He eventually became exhausted and lay still for a period, moaning. Then he grew quieter and made no sound. I could hear the owls and wolves in the distance in the woods, and it felt incredibly silent. He was lying near the corner. After a while, he partially sat up and listened, tilting his head to the side. He said, very quietly: 'Stomp—stomp—stomp; that's the dead; stomp—stomp—stomp; they're pursuing me; but I won't go. Oh, they're here! Don't touch me—don't! Keep your hands away—they're freezing; let go. Oh, just leave a poor wretch alone!'

He kept drinking until he eventually collapsed onto his blankets, but things didn’t go as I hoped. He never fell into a deep sleep, just kept shifting around, groaning and thrashing for ages. Eventually, I got so tired that I fell asleep myself without realizing, and the candle was still burning.\n\nI don’t recall how long I slept, but suddenly I was jerked awake by a terrible scream. Pap was up, looking crazed, flailing about and shouting about snakes crawling on him. He’d leap and scream about one biting his face, though I never saw any snakes at all. He ran around the cabin yelling for the snakes to get off, claiming one was biting his neck. I’d never seen anyone look so wild. After a while he wore himself out and fell to the floor, panting. Then he rolled around furiously, kicking at things, grabbing air, screaming about devils attacking him. Finally, he tired himself out and lay there moaning, then grew quieter until he was totally silent. I heard distant owls and wolves, and the silence around us was deep. He lay in a corner for a while; eventually, he sat up and listened carefully, tilting his head. Softly, he whispered he could hear the footsteps of the dead coming for him, but insisted he wouldn’t go, begging them to leave him alone because they were cold and frightening. Then he got down on all fours, crawled away pleading, wrapped himself in his blanket under the old table, and started crying. I could still hear his sobs through the blanket."

          "text_segment": "“Git up! What you ’bout?”\nI opened my eyes and looked around, trying to make out where I was. It was after sun-up, and I had been sound asleep. Pap was standing over me looking sour and sick, too. He says:\n“What you doin’ with this gun?”\nI judged he didn’t know nothing about what he had been doing, so I says:\n“Somebody tried to get in, so I was laying for him.”\n“Why didn’t you roust me out?”\n“Well, I tried to, but I couldn’t; I couldn’t budge you.”\n“Well, all right. Don’t stand there palavering all day, but out with you and see if there’s a fish on the lines for breakfast. I’ll be along in a minute.”\nHe unlocked the door, and I cleared out up the river-bank. I noticed some pieces of limbs and such things floating down, and a sprinkling of bark; so I knowed the river had begun to rise. I reckoned I would have great times now if I was over at the town. The June rise used to be always luck for me; because as soon as that rise begins here comes cordwood floating down, and pieces of log rafts—sometimes a dozen logs together; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the wood-yards and the sawmill.\nI went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t’other one out for what the rise might fetch along. Well, all at once here comes a canoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long, riding high like a duck. I shot head-first off of the bank like a frog, clothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe. I just expected there’d be somebody laying down in it, because people often done that to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they’d raise up and laugh at him. But it warn’t so this time. It was a drift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore. Thinks I, the old man will be glad when he sees this—she’s worth ten dollars. But when I got to shore pap wasn’t in sight yet, and as I was running her into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and willows, I struck another idea: I judged I’d hide her good, and then, ’stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I’d go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a rough time tramping on foot.\nIt was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old man coming all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and looked around a bunch of willows, and there was the old man down the path a piece just drawing a bead on a bird with his gun. So he hadn’t seen anything.\nWhen he got along I was hard at it taking up a “trot” line. He abused me a little for being so slow; but I told him I fell in the river, and that was what made me so long. I knowed he would see I was wet, and then he would be asking questions. We got five catfish off the lines and went home.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Get up! What are you doing? I woke up and looked around, trying to figure out where I was. The sun was already up, and I had been sleeping soundly. Pap was standing above me, looking both angry and unwell. He asked, \"Why do you have this gun?\" I figured he didn't remember anything he had done, so I replied, \"Someone was trying to break in, so I was waiting for them.\" \"Why didn't you wake me up?\" \"Well, I tried to, but I couldn't; I couldn't move you.\" \"Alright then. Don't just stand there talking all morning, go outside and check the fishing lines for our breakfast. I'll be right there.\" He unlocked the door, and I quickly went out and walked up the riverbank. I saw some broken branches and bits of bark floating downstream, which told me the river level was starting to increase. I thought about how much fun I could have right now if I were back in town. The river rising in June always brought me good fortune; because as soon as the water level starts to climb, logs and sections of log rafts float down—sometimes a dozen logs tied together; so all you have to do is collect them and sell them to places that buy wood, like wood yards or sawmills. I continued walking along the bank, keeping one eye on Pap and the other scanning the river for anything the rising water might bring. Suddenly, a canoe appeared; it was a nice one, too, about thirteen or fourteen feet long, sitting high on the water like a duck. I dove headfirst off the bank like a frog, fully clothed, and swam towards the canoe. I fully expected someone to be lying down inside it, as people often did that to trick others, and when someone rowed a small boat almost up to it, they would suddenly sit up and laugh at them. But that wasn't the case this time. It was genuinely a canoe that had drifted away, and I climbed in and paddled it to the shore. I thought to myself, Pap will be happy when he sees this—it's worth ten dollars. But when I reached the shore, Pap wasn't visible yet, and as I was pushing the canoe into a small creek, like a ditch, covered with vines and willow branches, I had a different idea: I decided I would hide it well, and then, instead of escaping into the woods when I ran away, I would travel down the river about fifty miles and establish a permanent camp in one spot, avoiding the difficulty of walking long distances. It was quite near the cabin, and I kept thinking I heard Pap approaching; but I managed to hide the canoe; and then I went out and peeked around a clump of willow trees, and there was Pap a little way down the path, aiming his gun at a bird. So he hadn't noticed anything. When he arrived, I was busy checking a trotline (a long fishing line with multiple hooks). He criticized me a bit for taking so long; but I told him I had fallen into the river, and that was the reason I was delayed. I knew he would see I was wet and would start asking questions. We caught five catfish from the lines and returned to the cabin.",

The sun was already up and I realized I’d been sleeping deeply. My pap was standing over me, looking sick and irritable. He asked me:\n\"What are you doing with that gun?\"\nI figured he didn’t remember anything about last night, so I replied:\n\"Someone tried to break in, so I was waiting for them.\"\n\"Why didn’t you wake me up?\"\n\"I tried, but I couldn’t do it; I couldn’t move you.\"\n\"Alright then. Stop talking and go check if we’ve caught any fish for breakfast. I’ll come in a minute.\"\nHe unlocked the door and I went out along the riverbank. I saw branches and pieces of bark floating downstream, so I realized the river was rising. If I were in town, this would have meant good luck for me—the June rise would bring floating firewood and logs downriver; I could catch them and sell them for money.\nAs I walked along, keeping an eye out for pap and for anything interesting in the water, suddenly a canoe appeared, a fine one about thirteen or fourteen feet long, floating smoothly. I dove into the water and swam for it, thinking someone might be hiding in it as a trick, but it turned out to be empty. It was just drifting, so I climbed in and paddled to shore. I thought pap would be happy to see it, since it was valuable, worth about ten dollars. But pap wasn’t around, and I decided instead to hide the canoe carefully among the vines and willows. I figured I could use it to escape down the river, about fifty miles, and make my home there, to avoid the hard life of running on foot.\nThe canoe was close to the hut, and I kept thinking pap was nearby, but I managed to hide it. When I peeked through the willows, I saw pap down the path aiming his gun at a bird. He didn’t notice anything.\nWhen he came over I was pretending to pull up a fishing line. He scolded me for being slow, but I told him I’d fallen in the river, which explained why I was wet and delayed. I knew he’d have asked if he saw me wet otherwise. We caught five catfish and returned home."

For a while, I didn't see any solution, but then Pap briefly woke up to drink another large quantity of water. He said, 'If a man is ever sneaking around here again, you make sure and wake me up, you hear? That man wasn't here for anything good. I would have shot him. Next time, you wake me up, you hear?' Then he lay back down and went back to sleep, but what he had just said gave me the exact idea I had been wanting. I thought to myself, I can arrange things now so that no one will even think about coming after me. Around twelve o'clock, we got up and walked along the riverbank. The river was rising quite fast, carrying a lot of floating debris with the increased flow. Eventually, a section of a log raft came drifting by—nine logs tied together. We used the skiff to go out, pull it to shore, and tie it up. Then we ate dinner. Most people would have waited and spent the rest of the day collecting more floating items, but that wasn't typical of Pap. Nine logs were sufficient for him at once; he had to get straight to town and sell them. So, he locked me inside, took the skiff, and set off towing the raft around three-thirty. I guessed he wouldn't return that evening. I waited until I thought he had gotten a considerable head start, then I took out my saw and continued working on that log.

While lying there, I started thinking that instead of just hoping to get far enough away before Pap and the widow realized I was gone, it’d be safer if I could come up with a plan to keep them from trying to follow me. Anything could happen otherwise. For a while, I couldn’t think of anything, but eventually Pap sat up briefly for a drink and told me that if anyone came around there again, I should wake him up—he said that man wasn’t up to any good and he would’ve shot him, so next time I should rouse him. Then he went back to sleep, but his words gave me just the idea I needed. I realized I could fix things so that nobody would think of chasing after me.\n\nAround noon, we got up and walked along the bank. The river was rising quickly, carrying lots of driftwood. After a while, a section of a log raft with nine logs tied together floated by. We took the skiff, brought it ashore, and then had dinner. Most people would have waited to see if more driftwood would come so they could collect more, but Pap wasn’t like that. Nine logs was enough for him, so he decided to head to town right away and sell them. He locked me in, took the skiff, and started off dragging the raft around half past three. I figured he wasn't coming back that night. I waited until I thought he was far enough away and then grabbed my saw to go back to work on that log. Before he reached the other side of the river, I had escaped through the hole, and Pap with his raft was just a tiny speck far off on the water."

So I went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house. I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the bottom of it with the saw, for there warn’t no knives and forks on the place—pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking. Then I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and full of rushes—and ducks too, you might say, in the season. There was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles away, I don’t know where, but it didn’t go to the river. The meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake. I dropped pap’s whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so it wouldn’t leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again.\nIt was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise. I made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by-and-by laid down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan. I says to myself, they’ll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me. And they’ll follow that meal track to the lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that killed me and took the things. They won’t ever hunt the river for anything but my dead carcass. They’ll soon get tired of that, and won’t bother no more about me. All right; I can stop anywhere I want to.

I went back and got the bag of cornmeal and my old saw from the canoe, bringing them to the house. I put the bag where it usually sat and used the saw to tear a hole in the bottom, since there weren't any knives or forks around (Pap only ever used his pocketknife for everything, including cooking). Then I carried the leaking sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows on the east side of the house, towards a shallow, five-mile-wide lake filled with tall reeds and, during certain times of the year, lots of ducks. A bayou or stream flowed out of the lake on the other side, extending for miles, though I didn't know where it went, only that it didn't connect to the river. The meal sifted out, creating a small trail all the way to the lake. I also dropped Pap's whetstone near the lake to make it seem like an accident. Afterwards, I tied up the tear in the meal sack with a piece of string to stop the leaking and took it and the saw back to the canoe.\nIt was almost dark by then. I let the canoe drift downstream under some willows hanging over the riverbank and waited for the moon to come up. I tied the canoe securely to a willow tree, ate something, and then lay down in the canoe to smoke my pipe and figure out my next steps. I figured they would follow the trail of the bloody axe to the shore and then search the river for my body. They would also follow the meal trail to the lake and then search along the stream leading from it, looking for the robbers who supposedly killed me and stole things. They would only ever search the river for my drowned body. They'd eventually get tired of looking and stop bothering about me. That was fine; I could hide anywhere I wanted. Jackson's Island seemed like a good spot; I knew that island pretty well, and no one ever went there. Plus, I could paddle over to town at night, sneak around, and get whatever I needed.

I also dropped pap’s whetstone there to make it look accidental. Then I tied the meal sack shut with a string so it wouldn’t leak anymore and took it, along with my saw, back to the canoe.\n\nBy this time it was almost dark. I took the canoe down the river, keeping under the cover of willow branches on the bank, and waited for the moon to come up. I tied up to a willow, ate something, then laid down to smoke a pipe and think through my plan.

They would also trace the meal trail to the lake and keep searching down the creek for the robbers who supposedly killed me and stole the stuff. They wouldn’t search the river for anything besides my dead body, and would soon give up and leave me alone. That suited me just fine. I'm free to go wherever I please.

It's also amazing how far sound travels across the water on nights like these! I overheard people talking down at the ferry dock. I could even hear every single word they said. One man remarked that the days were starting to get longer and the nights shorter. Another disagreed, figuring this particular night wasn't one of the short ones. They laughed, he repeated it, and they laughed again. Then they woke up a third person and told him, and they laughed, but he didn't find it funny and grumpily told them to leave him alone. The first man said he planned to tell his wife, thinking she'd appreciate it, but then claimed that wasn't nearly as good as some things he'd said in his life. I heard one man mention it was almost three o'clock and hoped daylight wouldn't be more than about a week away. After that, their voices drifted farther and farther away, and I could no longer understand what they were saying, though I could still hear the low murmur and occasional laughter, which sounded quite distant by then.",

I walked up to the northern point of the island and sat on a log, gazing out at the wide river, the dark driftwood, and across to the town three miles distant, where a few lights were twinkling. A very large lumber raft was about a mile upstream, slowly making its way down the river, with a lantern shining in its center. I watched it drift gradually closer, and when it was nearly alongside where I sat, I heard a man distinctly call out, \"Stern oars, there!

I reached the island quickly since the river’s current was moving fast; I sped past the upstream end and into the still water before guiding the canoe to shore on the Illinois side.

I was just starting to doze off again when I thought I heard a deep 'boom!' sound coming from far up the river. I roused myself, propped up on my elbow, and listened; soon I heard it again. I jumped up, went and peered through a gap in the leaves, and saw a cloud of smoke hanging over the water a long way up—about opposite the ferry landing. And there was the ferryboat, full of people, floating slowly downstream. I understood what was going on now. 'Boom!' I saw the white smoke puff out from the side of the ferryboat.

The ferry-boat was floating with the current, and I allowed I’d have a chance to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in close, where the bread did.

Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom Sawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more.

The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder of the island. I could hear the booming now and then, further and further off, and by-and-by, after an hour, I didn’t hear it no more.

I lit my pipe and smoked for a while, continuing to observe. The ferry-boat was drifting downstream with the current, and I figured I'd get a chance to see who was on board when it passed close by, just like the bread did. When it got fairly close to my position, I extinguished my pipe and moved to the spot where I had found the bread. I then lay down behind a log on the bank in a small clearing, peeking through a spot where the log branched. Soon, the boat came along, drifting so near the bank that someone could have easily extended a plank and walked ashore. Nearly everyone I knew was on the boat: Pap, Judge Thatcher, Bessie Thatcher, Jo Harper, Tom Sawyer, his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, plus many others. Everyone was discussing the supposed murder, but the captain cut in, saying, “Keep a sharp lookout; the current pulls in closest here, and maybe he’s washed ashore and tangled in the brush at the water’s edge. I certainly hope so.” I did not share that hope. They all crowded together and leaned over the rails, almost right above me, remaining quiet and watching intently. I could see them perfectly, but they couldn't see me. Then the captain shouted, “Step back!” and a cannon fired off such a loud blast right in front of me that it deafened me with the noise and nearly blinded me with smoke. For a moment, I thought I was finished. If they had loaded it with bullets, I reckon they would have found the corpse they were looking for. Well, thankfully, I saw I wasn't hurt. The boat continued drifting downstream and went out of sight around the bend of the island.

          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "However, they did not come there immediately. Instead, they circled the southern tip of the island and proceeded upstream along the Missouri side's channel, powered by steam and occasionally firing their cannon. I paddled across to that side to observe them. When they reached the northern end of the island, they ceased their firing, moved towards the Missouri bank, and returned to town. I understood I was safe at that point. No one else would continue searching for me. I retrieved my provisions from the canoe and established a pleasant campsite within the thick woods. I fashioned a rudimentary shelter from my blankets to keep my belongings dry from potential rain. I caught a catfish, sawed it open, and as dusk approached, I lit my campfire and ate dinner. Then, I set out a fishing line hoping to catch fish for breakfast. Once darkness fell, I sat by my fire, smoking and feeling quite content, but after a while, I began to feel somewhat solitary. So, I went to the riverbank and listened to the sound of the current, counted the stars, and watched the drifting logs and rafts passing by, before finally going to sleep. There isn't a better way to occupy yourself when you're feeling lonely; you don't remain that way for long; the feeling soon dissipates. This routine continued for three days and nights, unchanging. But on the following day, I ventured out to explore the southern portion of the island. I felt like its master; it was all mine, in a sense, and I wanted to learn everything about it, although my main motivation was to pass the time. I discovered numerous ripe and excellent strawberries, as well as green summer grapes and unripe raspberries. The green blackberries were just starting to appear. I figured they would all be useful later on.",

Instead, they turned around the base of the island and steamed up the channel on the Missouri side, occasionally firing their cannon. I crossed to that side to watch. Once they were even with the head of the island, they stopped firing, moved to the Missouri shore, and headed back to town. I realized then I was safe and no one else would come looking for me. So I unloaded my traps from the canoe and set up a comfortable campsite in the dense woods. I made a tent from my blankets to protect my things from the rain. I caught a catfish, cleaned it with my saw, and by evening I had built a campfire and eaten supper. I also set a fishing line to catch breakfast for the next day. When darkness fell, I sat by the fire smoking and feeling content. But after a while I started to feel lonely, so I went to the riverbank, listened to the water, counted stars, watched logs and rafts drift by, and then went to bed. Spending time this way is a good remedy for loneliness; you soon get over it. This routine lasted for three days and nights with little change. On the fourth day, I decided to explore the island. I considered myself its master, since it was all mine, so I wanted to learn about it, but mostly I was just passing time. I discovered lots of ripe strawberries, green grapes, unripe raspberries, and some blackberries just starting to develop. I figured they'd all be useful to me later on."

I had my gun along, but I hadn’t shot nothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh home. About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake, and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after it, trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.\nMy heart jumped up amongst my lungs. I never waited for to look further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast as ever I could. Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the thick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn’t hear nothing else. I slunk along another piece further, then listened again; and so on, and so on. If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of my breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too.\nWhen I got to camp I warn’t feeling very brash, there warn’t much sand in my craw; but I says, this ain’t no time to be fooling around. So I got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight, and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last year’s camp, and then clumb a tree.\nI reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn’t see nothing, I didn’t hear nothing—I only thought I heard and seen as much as a thousand things. Well, I couldn’t stay up there forever; so at last I got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast.\nBy the time it was night I was pretty hungry. So when it was good and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the Illinois bank—about a quarter of a mile. I went out in the woods and cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there all night when I hear a plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk, and says to myself, horses coming; and next I hear people’s voices. I got everything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping through the woods to see what I could find out. I hadn’t got far when I hear a man say:\n“We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about beat out. Let’s look around.”\nI didn’t wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy. I tied up in the old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "So, I wandered through the dense woods for quite some time, figuring I was getting close to the lower end of the island. I had my gun with me, but I hadn't shot anything yet; it was more for defense, though I intended to hunt some small animals near my camp. Around this time, I nearly stepped on a rather large snake, which quickly slithered away through the vegetation, and I went after it, trying to get a shot. As I hurried along, I suddenly came right upon the smoldering remains of a campfire. My heart leaped into my throat. I didn't hesitate to look around further; instead, I uncocked my gun and crept back as quickly as I could, moving on my tiptoes. Every so often, I paused among the thick bushes to listen, but my breathing was so heavy I couldn't hear anything else. I sneaked along a little further, then stopped to listen again, repeating this process. If I saw a tree stump, I mistook it for a person; if I stepped on and broke a stick, it felt as though someone had cut off half my breath, leaving me with only the shorter portion. When I got back to camp, I wasn't feeling very courageous or confident. But I told myself this was no time to be idle. So, I quickly packed all my belongings back into my canoe to hide them, extinguished the fire, and scattered the ashes to make it look like an old camp from the previous year, and then I climbed a tree. I estimate I stayed in the tree for two hours, but I didn't actually see or hear anything real – I just *imagined* I saw and heard countless things. Well, I couldn't stay up there indefinitely, so eventually, I climbed down, but I stayed deep in the woods and remained watchful constantly. All I had to eat were some berries and whatever was left from breakfast. By the time night fell, I was quite hungry. So, when it was completely dark, before the moon came up, I quietly pushed off from the shore and paddled across to the Illinois side – a distance of about a quarter of a mile. I went into the woods and cooked some supper, and I was just about decided to stay there all night when I heard a steady 'plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk,' and I thought to myself, 'horses are coming.' Next, I heard people's voices. I gathered everything into the canoe as fast as possible, and then I began creeping through the woods to find out what was happening. I hadn't gone far when I heard a man say, 'We should camp here if we can find a good spot; the horses are pretty tired. Let's look around.' I didn't wait; I immediately pushed off and paddled away slowly. I tied up again in my original spot and decided I would sleep in the canoe.",

I chased after it to try to get a shot, but as I hurried along, I unexpectedly stumbled upon the remains of a still-smoking campfire. My heart leapt into my throat. Without taking any time to look around more, I uncocked my gun and crept back as quietly as I could, stopping now and then among the thick leaves to listen. My breathing was so loud I couldn’t hear anything else. I continued moving cautiously, pausing again and again to listen. Every tree stump looked like a person to me, and every twig I snapped sounded so loud it felt like it stole half my breath. When I finally got back to my camp, I didn’t feel brave at all—I’d lost my nerve. I told myself this wasn’t the time to take chances. So I packed up all my belongings into my canoe to keep them hidden. I put out my fire, scattered the ashes to make it look old, then climbed a tree.

Quickly, I loaded my things back into the canoe and crept through the woods to investigate. I soon heard a man suggest camping because their horses were exhausted. Not waiting for anything else, I quietly pushed off again and paddled back to my usual spot, deciding I’d spend the night sleeping in the canoe."

Well, I felt better right off.\nSo I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows. The moon was shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day. I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound asleep. Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island. A little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying the night was about done. I give her a turn with the paddle and brung her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the woods. I sat down there on a log, and looked out through the leaves. I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket the river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops, and knowed the day was coming. So I took my gun and slipped off towards where I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two to listen. But I hadn’t no luck somehow; I couldn’t seem to find the place. But by-and-by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees. I went for it, cautious and slow. By-and-by I was close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground. It most give me the fan-tods. He had a blanket around his head, and his head was nearly in the fire. I set there behind a clump of bushes, in about six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady. It was getting gray daylight now. Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson’s Jim! I bet I was glad to see him.

So, I took my paddle, pushed off the shore just a little, and let the canoe drift downstream among the dark shadows. The moon was out, and outside of the shaded areas, it was almost as bright as daytime. I drifted along slowly for nearly an hour; everything was completely quiet and seemed to be asleep. By this point, I was almost at the lower end of the island. A slight, cool breeze began to blow, ruffling the water, which was like a signal that the night was almost over. I used the paddle to turn the canoe towards the bank, landed, then grabbed my gun and quietly moved into the trees at the edge of the woods. I sat down there on a log and watched the river through the leaves. I saw the moon disappear and darkness settle over the water. But soon after, I noticed a faint light above the treetops, indicating that day was approaching.

He had a blanket wrapped around his head, and his head was positioned very close to the fire. I stayed hidden there behind a cluster of bushes, only about six feet away from him, and watched him constantly. It was getting light grey now as dawn approached. Before long, he yawned, stretched, threw off the blanket, and I saw it was Jim, who belonged to Miss Watson! I was incredibly happy to see him.

I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him with his knife, and fried him.\nWhen breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot. Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved. Then when we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied. By-and-by Jim says:\n“But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat ’uz killed in dat shanty ef it warn’t you?”\nThen I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart. He said Tom Sawyer couldn’t get up no better plan than what I had. Then I says:\n“How do you come to be here, Jim, and how’d you get here?”\nHe looked pretty uneasy, and didn’t say nothing for a minute.

People would call me a low-down Abolitionist and despise me for keeping mum—but that don’t make no difference. I ain’t a-going to tell, and I ain’t a-going back there, anyways. So, now, le’s know all about it.”\n“Well, you see, it ’uz dis way.

But I noticed dey wuz a nigger trader roun’ de place considable lately, en I begin to git oneasy.

De widder she try to git her to say she wouldn’ do it, but I never waited to hear de res’. I lit out mighty quick, I tell you.\n“I tuck out en shin down de hill, en ’spec to steal a skift ’long de sho’ som’ers ’bove de town, but dey wuz people a-stirring yit, so I hid in de ole tumble-down cooper-shop on de bank to wait for everybody to go ’way. Well, I wuz dah all night. Dey wuz somebody roun’ all de time. ’Long ’bout six in de mawnin’ skifts begin to go by, en ’bout eight er nine every skift dat went ’long wuz talkin’ ’bout how yo’ pap come over to de town en say you’s killed. Dese las’ skifts wuz full o’ ladies en genlmen a-goin’ over for to see de place. Sometimes dey’d pull up at de sho’ en take a res’ b’fo’ dey started acrost, so by de talk I got to know all ’bout de killin’. I ’uz powerful sorry you’s killed, Huck, but I ain’t no mo’ now.\n“I laid dah under de shavin’s all day. I ’uz hungry, but I warn’t afeard; bekase I knowed ole missus en de widder wuz goin’ to start to de camp-meet’n’ right arter breakfas’ en be gone all day, en dey knows I goes off wid de cattle ’bout daylight, so dey wouldn’ ’spec to see me roun’ de place, en so dey wouldn’ miss me tell arter dark in de evenin’. De yuther servants wouldn’ miss me, kase dey’d shin out en take holiday soon as de ole folks ’uz out’n de way.\n“Well, when it come dark I tuck out up de river road, en went ’bout two mile er more to whah dey warn’t no houses. I’d made up my mine ’bout what I’s agwyne to do. You see, ef I kep’ on tryin’ to git away afoot, de dogs ’ud track me; ef I stole a skift to cross over, dey’d miss dat skift, you see, en dey’d know ’bout whah I’d lan’ on de yuther side, en whah to pick up my track.

          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "We then went to the location of the canoe. While Jim built a fire in a clear, grassy spot surrounded by trees, I retrieved food items like meal, bacon, coffee, the coffee-pot, frying pan, sugar, and tin cups. Jim was quite astonished by how quickly these items appeared, believing it was the result of magic. I also caught a large catfish, which Jim expertly cleaned with his knife and fried for us. When breakfast was ready, we reclined on the grass and ate the steaming hot food. Jim ate with great enthusiasm, as he was nearly starving. After we were comfortably full, we relaxed and took our ease. Eventually, Jim said, 'But look here, Huck, if you weren't the one killed in that cabin, who was?' I then explained the entire situation to him, and he thought it was a clever plan. He remarked that Tom Sawyer couldn't have devised a better scheme than mine. Then I asked, 'How did you come to be here, Jim, and how did you get here?' He seemed quite anxious and remained silent for a moment. Then he said, 'Maybe I shouldn't tell.' 'Why, Jim?' I asked. 'Well, there are reasons. But you wouldn't report me if I told you, would you, Huck?' 'I swear I wouldn't, Jim,' I replied. 'Well, I believe you, Huck. I... I ran away.' 'Jim!' I exclaimed. 'But remember, you said you wouldn't tell—you know you promised you wouldn't tell, Huck.' 'Yes, I did. I said I wouldn't, and I'll stick to it. Honest to goodness, I will. People would label me a despicable Abolitionist and scorn me for staying silent, but that doesn't matter. I'm not going to tell, and I'm certainly not going back there anyway. So, now, let me hear all about it.' 'Well, you see, it happened this way. Old Missus—that's Miss Watson—she's always nagging me and treating me pretty harshly, but she always claimed she'd never sell me down to New Orleans. But I noticed a slave trader hanging around the place quite often lately, and I started feeling uneasy. Well, late one night, I crept to the door, and it wasn't quite closed. I overheard old Missus telling the Widow she was planning to sell me down to New Orleans. She said she didn't want to, but she could get eight hundred dollars for me, and it was such a large sum of money she couldn't resist. The Widow tried to convince her not to do it, but I didn't wait to hear the rest. I got out of there extremely fast, I tell you. I took off running down the hill, expecting to steal a small boat somewhere along the shore above the town. But people were still awake, so I hid in the old dilapidated cooper shop on the riverbank to wait for everyone to leave. I was there all night. There were people around the entire time. Around six in the morning, small boats started passing by, and by about eight or nine, everyone in every boat that went by was talking about how your father came to town and said you were killed. These later boats were full of ladies and gentlemen going to see the location. Sometimes they would stop at the bank to rest before crossing, so by listening to their conversations, I learned all about the 'killing.' I was deeply saddened to hear you were dead, Huck, but I'm not anymore now. I lay there under the wood shavings all day. I was hungry, but I wasn't scared, because I knew old Missus and the Widow were going to the camp meeting right after breakfast and would be gone all day. They also knew I usually went off with the cattle around daylight, so they wouldn't expect to see me around the property, and thus wouldn't miss me until after dark that evening. The other servants wouldn't miss me because they would sneak away and take a holiday as soon as the old folks were out of the way. Well, when it got dark, I left and went up the river road for about two miles or more to a place where there were no houses. I had made up my mind about what I was going to do. You see, if I kept trying to get away on foot, dogs would track me. If I stole a small boat to cross the river, they'd notice it was missing, and they'd know roughly where I'd land on the other side and where to find my tracks. So I told myself, a raft is what I'm after; it doesn't leave any tracks. After a while, I saw a light coming around the bend. So I waded in, pushed a log ahead of me, and swam more than halfway across the river. I got among the floating debris and kept my head down low, sort of swimming against the current until the raft came along. Then I swam to the back of it and grabbed on. It clouded over and was quite dark for a little while. So I climbed up and lay down on the planks. The men were far up in the middle, where the lantern was. The river was rising, and there was a strong current, so I estimated that by four in the morning, I'd be twenty-five miles down the river. Then I'd slip in just before daylight, swim ashore, and head into the woods on the Illinois side. But I wasn't lucky. When we were almost down to the upper end of the island, a man started coming towards the back with the lantern. I saw it was useless to wait, so I slid overboard and swam towards the island. Well, I thought I could land almost anywhere, but I couldn't—the bank was too steep. I was almost at the lower end of the island before I found a suitable spot. I went into the woods and decided I wouldn't bother with rafts anymore, as long as they moved the lantern around like that. I had my pipe, a plug of tobacco, and some matches in my cap, and they weren't wet, so I was fine.",

I managed to catch a large catfish, which Jim cleaned with his knife and fried for our meal.\n\nWhen breakfast was ready, we relaxed on the grass and ate it hot. Jim really dug in, since he was nearly starving. Once we were full, we lay back and rested. After a while, Jim asked me who’d been killed in the cabin if it wasn't me. So, I explained everything to him, and he said it was clever—even Tom Sawyer couldn’t have come up with a better idea. Then I asked Jim how he ended up there.\n\nJim seemed nervous and was silent for a moment before admitting he had run away. He asked me to promise not to tell anyone, and I assured him I’d keep his secret, even if it meant people would look down on me for it — I wasn’t going to betray him or go back regardless.\n\nJim then told me that Miss Watson, who was always harsh with him but promised never to sell him down to New Orleans, had recently been inquiring with a slave trader. One night, Jim overheard her say she was going to sell him because she could get eight hundred dollars, and the money was too tempting. Jim left immediately, planning to sneak away in a skiff, but when he saw people moving about, he hid in an old cooper shop all night. The next morning, he overheard everyone talking about my supposed murder. He was sorry at first, but that feeling didn’t last.\n\nHe stayed hidden most of the day, figuring Miss Watson and the widow would be gone all day and he wouldn’t be missed until dark. That night, he slipped out and headed up the river road to a spot with no houses. He’d decided traveling by raft was safest, since dogs couldn’t track him and it wouldn’t leave a trail like a skiff would.\n\nJim saw a light approaching, waded into the river, swam with a log until he joined some driftwood, and waited for a raft to pass. When it did, he grabbed hold and climbed aboard, staying hidden as the raft floated downriver. He hoped to get far enough downriver to safely make it to the Illinois side by morning. \n\nUnfortunately, as they neared the island, someone on the raft came towards him with a lantern, so Jim slipped overboard and swam for the island. The banks were steep, but he finally found a place to land near the end. Jim decided he wouldn’t risk rafts again while people were moving around with lanterns. He still had his pipe, some tobacco, and matches that had stayed dry, so he was safe for the time being."

He said it was a sign when young chickens flew that way, and so he reckoned it was the same way when young birds done it. I was going to catch some of them, but Jim wouldn’t let me. He said it was death. He said his father laid mighty sick once, and some of them catched a bird, and his old granny said his father would die, and he did.\nAnd Jim said you mustn’t count the things you are going to cook for dinner, because that would bring bad luck. The same if you shook the table-cloth after sundown. And he said if a man owned a beehive and that man died, the bees must be told about it before sun-up next morning, or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die. Jim said bees wouldn’t sting idiots; but I didn’t believe that, because I had tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn’t sting me.\nI had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them. Jim knowed all kinds of signs. He said he knowed most everything. I said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked him if there warn’t any good-luck signs. He says:\n“Mighty few—an’ dey ain’t no use to a body. What you want to know when good luck’s a-comin’ for?

I put ten dollars in a cow. But I ain’ gwyne to resk no mo’ money in stock. De cow up ’n’ died on my han’s.”\n“So you lost the ten dollars.”\n“No, I didn’t lose it all. I on’y los’ ’bout nine of it. I sole de hide en taller for a dollar en ten cents.”\n“You had five dollars and ten cents left. Did you speculate any more?”\n“Yes. You know that one-laigged nigger dat b’longs to old Misto Bradish? Well, he sot up a bank, en say anybody dat put in a dollar would git fo’ dollars mo’ at de en’ er de year. Well, all de niggers went in, but dey didn’t have much. I wuz de on’y one dat had much.

Well, o’ course dat nigger want’ to keep me out er de business, bekase he says dey warn’t business ’nough for two banks, so he say I could put in my five dollars en he pay me thirty-five at de en’ er de year.\n“So I done it.

Dey wuz a nigger name’ Bob, dat had ketched a wood-flat, en his marster didn’ know it; en I bought it off’n him en told him to take de thirty-five dollars when de en’ er de year come; but somebody stole de wood-flat dat night, en nex day de one-laigged nigger say de bank’s busted. So dey didn’ none uv us git no money.”\n“What did you do with the ten cents, Jim?”\n“Well, I ’uz gwyne to spen’ it, but I had a dream, en de dream tole me to give it to a nigger name’ Balum—Balum’s Ass dey call him for short; he’s one er dem chuckleheads, you know.

You can't sneak up and grab them, and how could someone possibly hit them with a rock? How could I do it at night? Plus, I wasn't about to show myself on the riverbank during the day.\nRight, that makes sense. You've had to stay hidden in the woods constantly, naturally. Did you hear them firing the cannon?\nOh, yes. I knew they were looking for you. I saw them pass by here – watched them from behind the bushes.\nSome young birds came by, flying just a short distance before landing again. Jim said it was a sign that rain was coming. He mentioned that it's a sign when young chickens fly that way, so he figured the same applied to young birds. I thought about trying to catch some, but Jim stopped me. He said doing so would bring death. He told a story about his father getting very sick once, and after some people caught a bird, his old grandmother predicted his father would die, and he did.\nJim also mentioned that you shouldn't count the items you plan to cook for dinner because it's bad luck. The same goes for shaking the tablecloth after sunset. And he explained that if a man who owns a beehive dies, someone must inform the bees before sunrise the next morning, or all the bees will weaken, stop working, and die. Jim claimed that bees don't sting idiots, but I didn't believe him because I'd tested that myself many times and they never stung me.\nI had heard some of these superstitions before, but not all of them. Jim seemed to know every kind of sign. He boasted that he knew almost everything. I commented that it seemed like all the signs were about bad luck, and I asked if there weren't any good luck signs. He replied:\nVery few – and they aren't really useful to anyone. Why would you want to know when good luck is coming? Do you want to scare it away? And he added: If you have hairy arms and a hairy chest, it's a sign that you are going to be rich. Well, there's some value in a sign like that, because it's so far in the future. You see, maybe you have to be poor for a long time first, so you might get discouraged and kill yourself if you didn't know from the sign that you would be rich eventually.\nDo you have hairy arms and a hairy chest, Jim?\nWhat's the point of asking that? Can't you see I do?\nWell, are you rich?\nNo, but I was rich once, and I'm going to be rich again. Once I had fourteen dollars, but I decided to speculate and went broke.\nWhat did you speculate in, Jim?\nWell, first I got into stock.\nWhat kind of stock?\nWhy, livestock – cattle, you know. I put ten dollars into a cow. But I'm not risking any more money on livestock. The cow just up and died while I had it.\nSo you lost the ten dollars.\nNo, I didn't lose it all. I only lost about nine of it. I sold the hide and fat for a dollar and ten cents.\nYou had five dollars and ten cents left. Did you speculate any more?\nYes. You know that one-legged man who belongs to old Master Bradish? Well, he started a bank and said anyone who put in a dollar would get four dollars more at the end of the year. Well, all the enslaved people joined in, but they didn't have much money. I was the only one who had a good amount. So I held out for more than four dollars, and I said if I didn't get it, I'd start my own bank. Well, naturally, that man wanted to keep me out of the business, because he said there wasn't enough business for two banks, so he said I could deposit my five dollars and he would pay me thirty-five at the end of the year.\nSo I did it. Then I figured I'd invest the thirty-five dollars right away and keep the money moving. There was a man named Bob who had secretly caught a wood-flat (a raft of wood), and his master didn't know about it; and I bought it from him and told him to collect the thirty-five dollars when the end of the year arrived; but somebody stole the wood-flat that night, and the next day the one-legged man announced the bank was bankrupt. So none of us got any money.\nWhat did you do with the ten cents, Jim?\nWell, I was planning to spend it, but I had a dream, and the dream told me to give it to a man named Balum – Balum's Ass they call him for short; he's one of those simpletons, you know. But he's lucky, they say, and I saw I wasn't lucky. The dream said to let Balum invest the ten cents, and he would make a profit for me. Well, Balum took the money, and when he was in church he heard the preacher say that whoever gives to the poor lends to the Lord, and is guaranteed to get their money back a hundred times over. So Balum went and gave the ten cents to the poor, and waited quietly to see what would happen.\nWell, what did happen, Jim?\nNothing ever came of it. I couldn't manage to collect that money no matter what; and Balum couldn't either. I'm not lending any more money unless I see some security. 'Guaranteed to get your money back a hundred times,' the preacher says! If I could just get the ten cents back, I'd call it even and be grateful for the opportunity.\nWell, it's alright anyway, Jim, as long as you're going to be rich again sometime.\nYes; and I am rich now, when you think about it. I own myself, and I'm worth eight hundred dollars. I wish I had the money, I wouldn't want anything more.",

I saw them go by here—watched them through the bushes.\n\nA few young birds came by, flying a little at a time and landing nearby. Jim said this meant it was going to rain. He said when young chickens act like that it’s a sign of rain, so he figured it must be the same with other young birds. I thought about catching some, but Jim wouldn’t let me—he said it was bad luck. He told me his father got very sick after some people caught a bird, and his grandmother predicted his father would die, and he did.\n\nJim also said you shouldn’t count the things you’re going to cook for dinner, because that would mean bad luck. Same goes for shaking out the tablecloth after sunset. And if a man with a beehive dies, the bees have to be told by sunrise the next day, or they'll stop working and die, too. Jim said bees won’t sting fools, but I didn’t believe that because I’d tried getting stung a lot myself with no luck.\n\nI’d heard some of these superstitions before, but not all. Jim seemed to know all sorts of signs and omens. He said he knew most everything. I told him it seemed like all the signs he knew were for bad luck, so I asked if there were any that meant good luck. He replied:\n\n“Only a few—and they’re not much use. Why would you want to know when good luck is coming? Would you want to stop it? But if you have hairy arms and chest, you’ll be rich someday. That sign’s worth knowing, since it means you may be poor a long time first, and this lets you keep hope, so you don’t do something desperate because you knew you’d eventually get rich.”\n\n“Do you have hairy arms and chest, Jim?”\n\n“Why ask? Can’t you see I do?”\n\n“So, are you rich?”\n\n“No, but I was rich once, and I’ll be rich again. Once I had fourteen dollars, but I lost it trying to make investments.”\n\n“What did you invest in, Jim?”\n\n“Well, first I tried dealing in livestock.”\n\n“What kind of livestock?”\n\n“Cows, you know. I put ten dollars in a cow, but I won’t risk more money in that—the cow died on me.”\n\n“So you lost the ten dollars?”\n\n“No, not all of it. I only lost about nine. I sold the hide and tallow and got a dollar and ten cents for it.”\n\n“Did you try investing the rest?”\n\n“Yes. Do you know that one-legged man who belongs to Mr. Bradish? Well, he started a sort of bank and said if you put in a dollar he’d give you four dollars more after a year. All the other black folks put in money, but only I put in a lot. I insisted I should get more since I invested more, and if not, I’d start my own bank. He didn’t want competition, so he let me put in my five dollars and promised me thirty-five dollars at the year’s end.\n\nSo I went along. I figured when I got the thirty-five dollars I’d invest it right away. There was a guy named Bob who’d gotten a stolen wood raft, and I bought it from him and told him I’d pay him when I got my thirty-five dollars. But someone stole the raft that night, and the next day the one-legged man said the bank had failed, so none of us got our money back.”\n\n“What happened to the ten cents you had left?”\n\n“I was going to spend it, but I had a dream telling me to let a man named Balum, known as Balum’s Ass, invest it for me, because he’s supposed to be lucky, and I’m not. So Balum took the ten cents, and at church he heard the preacher say that whoever gives to the poor lends to the Lord and will be repaid a hundred times. Balum donated the ten cents, then waited to see what would happen.”\n\n“What did happen, Jim?”\n\n“Nothing ever came of it. Neither Balum nor I could ever get that money back. I won’t lend more money unless I see some security now. ‘You’re supposed to get your money back a hundred times,’ the preacher said! If I just got my ten cents back, I’d be satisfied.”\n\n“Well, it’s all right, Jim, since you’ll be rich again someday.”\n\n“Yes, and actually I’m rich now, really. I own myself, and I’m worth eight hundred dollars. I just wish I had the money—I wouldn’t want anything else.”"

Since it was still too dark to see inside, we tied up the canoe and sat there, waiting for dawn. The light started to appear before we reached the island's lower end. We then looked through the window. We could see a bed, a table, two old chairs, and many items scattered on the floor, with clothes hanging on the wall. In the far corner, something on the floor looked like a person. Jim said, \"Hello!\" When it didn't move, I called out again. Then Jim said, \"That man isn't sleeping—he's dead. Stay still—I'll go check.\" He went over, knelt down, looked closely, and said, \"It's a dead man. Yes, definitely; and he's naked. He's been shot in the back. I guess he's been dead for two or three days. Come in, Huck, but don't look at his face—it's too awful.\" I didn't look at him at all. Jim threw some old rags over him, but he didn't need to; I didn't want to see him anyway. There were piles of greasy old playing cards scattered on the floor, empty whiskey bottles, and two masks made from black cloth. All over the walls were crude drawings and words made with charcoal. There were two old, dirty printed cotton dresses, a sunbonnet, and some women's undergarments hanging on the wall, along with some men's clothes. We gathered all the clothing and put it in the canoe—it might be useful. There was an old straw hat, speckled, that belonged to a boy on the floor; I took that too. And there was a broken bottle that had contained milk, with a rag stopper for a baby to suck on. We would have taken the bottle, but it was broken. There was a worn-out old chest and an old trunk made of hair with broken hinges. They were open, but there wasn't anything valuable left inside. The way things were scattered made us think the people had left in a hurry and couldn't take most of their belongings. We collected an old tin lantern, a butcher knife without a handle, a brand-new Barlow knife that would be worth twenty-five cents in any store, several tallow candles, a tin candle holder, a gourd, a tin cup, a worn-out old bed quilt from the bed, a small bag containing needles, pins, beeswax, buttons, thread, and other similar items, a hatchet, some nails, a fishing line as thick as my little finger with enormous hooks on it, a roll of buckskin, a leather dog collar, a horseshoe, and some small bottles of medicine that had no labels. Just as we were leaving, I found a fairly good curry comb, and Jim found a worn-out old fiddle bow and a wooden leg.

Old Hank Bunker did it once, bragged about it, and less than two years later he got drunk, fell off the shot-tower, and died so badly that they had to squeeze him sideways between barn doors for a coffin, at least that's what people say, though I didn't actually see it myself—pap told me. Anyway, it all supposedly happened because he looked at the moon that way, like a fool."

We couldn’t handle him, of course; he would a flung us into Illinois. We just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded.

Jim suggested the fish must have swallowed it long ago, and layers had gradually formed around it to create the ball. I believe it was the largest fish ever caught in the Mississippi River. Jim agreed that he had never seen one bigger. This fish would have been worth a considerable amount in the nearby village market, where they sell the meat of such large fish by the pound.

And there’s a reward out for old Finn, too—two hundred dollars. You see, he come to town the morning after the murder, and told about it, and was out with ’em on the ferry-boat hunt, and right away after he up and left. Before night they wanted to lynch him, but he was gone, you see. Well, next day they found out the nigger was gone; they found out he hadn’t ben seen sence ten o’clock the night the murder was done. So then they put it on him, you see; and while they was full of it, next day, back comes old Finn, and went boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for the nigger all over Illinois with. The judge gave him some, and that evening he got drunk, and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty hard-looking strangers, and then went off with them. Well, he hain’t come back sence, and they ain’t looking for him back till this thing blows over a little, for people thinks now that he killed his boy and fixed things so folks would think robbers done it, and then he’d get Huck’s money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit. People do say he warn’t any too good to do it. Oh, he’s sly, I reckon. If he don’t come back for a year he’ll be all right. You can’t prove anything on him, you know; everything will be quieted down then, and he’ll walk in Huck’s money as easy as nothing.”\n“Yes, I reckon so, ’m. I don’t see nothing in the way of it.

I walked the whole way and I'm completely worn out.\" She responded, \"You must be hungry too, I imagine.

Eventually, however, she started discussing my father and the murder, and at that point, I was happy to let her continue talking freely. She recounted the story of Tom Sawyer and me finding the six thousand dollars (though she mistakenly said ten thousand) and talked all about my father, describing what a difficult man he was, and how tough my life was too. Finally, she got around to mentioning that I had been murdered. I asked, \"Who did it? We've heard quite a bit about these events down in Hookerville, but we don't know who the person was that killed Huck Finn.\" She said, \"Well, I expect there are plenty of people here who would like to know who killed him. Some people believe Old Man Finn did it himself.\" \"Really? Is that true?\" I asked. \"Almost everyone thought that initially. He'll never know how close he came to being lynched. But by evening, they changed their minds and decided it was done by a runaway slave named Jim.\" \"Why, he—\" I cut myself off, deciding it was best to remain silent. She continued talking without noticing I had tried to speak: \"The slave ran away the same night Huck Finn was murdered. So, there's a reward offered for him—three hundred dollars. And there's also a reward for Old Man Finn—two hundred dollars. You see, he came to town the morning after the murder, reported it, and even went out with them on the ferry-boat search, but then he suddenly left right after. Before nightfall, they wanted to lynch him, but he was already gone. The next day, they discovered the slave was missing; they learned he hadn't been seen since ten o'clock on the night of the murder. So, they blamed him then. And while they were still focused on that, the next day, Old Man Finn returned, tearfully asking Judge Thatcher for money to search for the slave throughout Illinois. The judge gave him some, and that evening Pap got drunk and was seen with two very rough-looking strangers until after midnight, and then he left with them. He hasn't returned since, and people don't expect him back until the situation calms down, because now they think he killed his son and staged it to look like robbers did it, so he could claim Huck's money without having to deal with a lengthy legal process. People say he was certainly capable of doing something like that. Yes, I believe he's clever. If he stays away for a year, he'll be fine. You won't be able to prove anything against him, you know; everything will have settled down by then, and he'll be able to collect Huck's money without any trouble at all.\" \"Yes, I suppose so, ma'am,\" I replied. \"I don't see anything that would prevent it. Have people stopped believing the slave committed the murder?\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I did it. She examined me carefully with her sharp eyes and asked, \"What's your name?\" I replied, \"Sarah Williams.\" Then she wanted to know if I lived nearby, and I told her no, that I was from Hookerville, about seven miles down the river, and that I had walked the whole way and was very tired. She guessed I was hungry too and offered me some food, but I told her I'd already stopped at a farm a couple of miles back because I was so hungry and wasn't hungry anymore. That was the reason I was late. I explained that my mother was sick and had no money, so I came to tell my uncle Abner Moore, who lives at the upper end of town—though I'd never been here before—and asked if she knew him. She said she didn't but hadn't met everyone yet since she hadn't lived here long. She told me the upper end of town was a bit of a distance and suggested I stay the night, asking me to take off my bonnet. I said no, I’d just rest a little while before moving on, because I wasn’t afraid of the dark. She insisted that I shouldn’t go alone and said her husband would be home soon and would escort me. Then she started talking about her husband, her relatives both upriver and downriver, how much better they used to live, and how maybe moving to this town had been a mistake, going on and on until I started to worry that coming to her for news about the town was a mistake. Eventually, though, she brought up my father and the murder, so I was happy to let her talk. She mentioned Tom Sawyer and me finding six thousand dollars (though she said ten), and told stories about my father and how rough he and I both were, eventually getting to the report of my own murder. I asked her who did it, saying we’d heard a lot about it in Hookerville but didn’t know who killed Huck Finn. She said plenty of people here would like to know that, that some think my father did it himself. I acted surprised, and she explained that most people thought that at first and that he almost got lynched, but before the end of the day, suspicion shifted to a runaway slave named Jim. I was about to respond but thought it best not to say anything. She kept talking, saying that Jim had run off the same night Huck Finn was killed, so there was a $300 reward out for him. There was also a $200 reward for my father. Apparently, he showed up in town the morning after the murder, talked about it, joined the search, and then left again quickly. People wanted to lynch him but he disappeared. The next day, they realized Jim was missing too and had last been seen around ten the night of the murder, so suspicion landed on him. While the town was caught up in the story, my father came back, asked Judge Thatcher for money to search for Jim, got drunk later that evening with some rough folks, and left again. He hasn't returned since, and folks expect he won't come back until things calm down, since now they believe he murdered his son and made it look like robbers did it, so he could inherit Huck’s money without a legal battle. People say he might well be capable of such a thing, being a sneaky man, and that if he stays away for a year, no one can prove anything, and he’ll get the money easily. I agreed with her, saying I didn’t see anything stopping him. I then asked if people had stopped suspecting the slave."

She mentioned she needed things readily available to throw at them when she was alone, otherwise, they wouldn't leave her in peace. She showed me a lead bar twisted into a knot, claiming she was usually accurate with it, but she'd sprained her arm a day or two before and wasn't sure if her aim would be true now. Still, she watched for an opportunity and suddenly flung it at a rat, but she missed by a lot and cried out \"Ouch!\" because it hurt her arm so much. Then she suggested I try hitting the next one.

I took the object, and the moment the next rat poked its nose out, I threw hard; if he had stayed put, he would have been severely injured.

I held out both my hands, she draped the yarn over them, and continued discussing her and her husband's affairs. However, she interrupted herself to say, \"Watch out for the rats. You should keep the lead in your lap, ready to use.\" Just then, she dropped the heavy piece into my lap, and I quickly pressed my legs together to hold it while she kept talking.

She said she always needed something nearby to throw at the rats when she was by herself, or they'd never leave her alone. She showed me a bar of lead she used for this, claiming she was usually accurate with it, but she had sprained her arm recently and wasn’t sure she could throw well at the moment. She kept watch for a rat, and soon tried to hit one but missed badly, hurting her arm and exclaiming in pain. Then she asked me to try catching the next one.

She praised my throw and thought I’d get one next time. She picked up the lead and brought it back with a skein of yarn she wanted me to help untangle. I held out my hands for her to wind the yarn around them while she talked about her and her husband’s life. Suddenly, she told me to keep an eye out for rats and to keep the lead handy, placing it in my lap. I quickly clamped my legs over it, and she kept talking.

Since the main river channel ran closer to the Missouri shore there, we weren't worried about anyone finding us. We stayed hidden there all day, watching the rafts and steamboats drift downstream along the Missouri bank, and the steamboats heading upstream struggling against the main current in the middle of the river. I recounted to Jim everything about my conversation with the woman. Jim said she was sharp, and that if she had been the one chasing us, she wouldn't just sit around watching a campfire; no, she'd go get a dog. So I asked why she didn't tell her husband to get a dog immediately. Jim bet she did think of it by the time the men were ready to go, and he believed they probably went up into town to find a dog, which is how they lost all that time. Otherwise, he was sure, we wouldn't be here on a tow-head sixteen or seventeen miles below the village; indeed, we'd still be in that same old town. I then said I didn't care what the reason was for them not catching us, just that they didn't.",

Using a hatchet, we cut down cottonwood branches and covered the raft with them to make it look like the shore had collapsed there. (A tow-head is a sandbar thickly covered with cottonwoods.) The Missouri side had hills, and there were thick woods on the Illinois side. The main river channel ran by the Missouri shore at this spot, so we weren’t worried about anyone finding us. We stayed hidden there all day, watching rafts and steamboats go down the Missouri side, while steamboats heading the other way struggled upriver. I told Jim everything about my conversation with that woman, and he said she was clever. If she were to come after us herself, she wouldn’t just sit and watch a campfire—she’d bring a dog with her. So I asked why she couldn’t just tell her husband to get a dog. Jim replied that she probably did think of it when the men got ready to leave, and he guessed they must have gone into town to get a dog, which is why it took so long; otherwise, we would’ve been caught already and taken back to town. I said I didn’t mind why they missed us, as long as they didn’t catch us."

I was just a-biling with curiosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn’t back out now, and so I won’t either; I’m a-going to see what’s going on here. So I dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft in the dark till there warn’t but one stateroom betwixt me and the cross-hall of the texas. Then in there I see a man stretched on the floor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one of them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol. This one kept pointing the pistol at the man’s head on the floor, and saying:\n“I’d like to! And I orter, too—a mean skunk!”\nThe man on the floor would shrivel up and say, “Oh, please don’t, Bill; I hain’t ever goin’ to tell.”\nAnd every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say:\n“’Deed you ain’t! You never said no truer thing ’n that, you bet you.” And once he said: “Hear him beg! and yit if we hadn’t got the best of him and tied him he’d a killed us both. And what for? Jist for noth’n. Jist because we stood on our rights—that’s what for. But I lay you ain’t a-goin’ to threaten nobody any more, Jim Turner. Put up that pistol, Bill.”\nBill says:\n“I don’t want to, Jake Packard. I’m for killin’ him—and didn’t he kill old Hatfield jist the same way—and don’t he deserve it?”\n“But I don’t want him killed, and I’ve got my reasons for it.”\n“Bless yo’ heart for them words, Jake Packard! I’ll never forgit you long’s I live!” says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering.\nPackard didn’t take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail and started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill to come. I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boat slanted so that I couldn’t make very good time; so to keep from getting run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side. The man came a-pawing along in the dark, and when Packard got to my stateroom, he says:\n“Here—come in here.”\nAnd in he come, and Bill after him. But before they got in I was up in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come. Then they stood there, with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked. I couldn’t see them, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they’d been having. I was glad I didn’t drink whisky; but it wouldn’t made much difference anyway, because most of the time they couldn’t a treed me because I didn’t breathe. I was too scared. And, besides, a body couldn’t breathe and hear such talk. They talked low and earnest. Bill wanted to kill Turner. He says:\n“He’s said he’ll tell, and he will. If we was to give both our shares to him now it wouldn’t make no difference after the row and the way we’ve served him. Shore’s you’re born, he’ll turn State’s evidence; now you hear me. I’m for putting him out of his troubles.”\n“So’m I,” says Packard, very quiet.\n“Blame it, I’d sorter begun to think you wasn’t. Well, then, that’s all right. Le’s go and do it.”\n“Hold on a minute; I hain’t had my say yit. You listen to me. Shooting’s good, but there’s quieter ways if the thing’s got to be done. But what I say is this: it ain’t good sense to go court’n around after a halter if you can git at what you’re up to in some way that’s jist as good and at the same time don’t bring you into no resks. Ain’t that so?”\n“You bet it is. But how you goin’ to manage it this time?”\n“Well, my idea is this: we’ll rustle around and gather up whatever pickins we’ve overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hide the truck. Then we’ll wait. Now I say it ain’t a-goin’ to be more’n two hours befo’ this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river. See? He’ll be drownded, and won’t have nobody to blame for it but his own self. I reckon that’s a considerble sight better ’n killin’ of him. I’m unfavorable to killin’ a man as long as you can git aroun’ it; it ain’t good sense, it ain’t good morals. Ain’t I right?”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "By this point, Jim had gone back for the raft. My curiosity was intense, and I told myself that Tom Sawyer wouldn't give up now, so I wouldn't either. I was determined to see what was happening. So, I got down on my hands and knees in the narrow hallway and quietly moved towards the back in the darkness until I was only separated from the texas cross-hall by one stateroom. Looking inside, I saw a man lying on the floor, tied up, with two men standing over him. One held a dimly lit lantern, and the other had a pistol pointed at the man's head on the floor. The one with the pistol kept saying, “I really want to! And I should, too – you nasty skunk!” The tied-up man would flinch and plead, “Oh, please don’t, Bill; I swear I’ll never tell.” Each time he said that, the man with the lantern would laugh and respond, “Indeed you won’t! You’ve never said anything more truthful than that, you can bet on it.” Another time, he added, “Listen to him beg! Yet, if we hadn’t gotten the upper hand and tied him up, he would have killed both of us. And why? For no reason at all. Just because we stood up for our rights – that’s why. But I guarantee you won’t be threatening anyone anymore, Jim Turner. Put that pistol away, Bill.” Bill replied, “I don’t want to, Jake Packard. I want to kill him – didn’t he kill old Hatfield the exact same way? Doesn’t he deserve it?” Packard insisted, “But I don’t want him killed, and I have my reasons.” The man on the floor, almost crying, said, “God bless you for saying that, Jake Packard! I’ll never forget you as long as I live!” Packard ignored this, hung his lantern on a hook, and started moving towards where I was hidden in the dark, signaling for Bill to follow. I backed away quickly on my hands and knees about two yards, but the boat was tilted, making it hard to move fast. To avoid being seen and caught, I crawled into a stateroom on the higher side. The men came feeling their way in the dark, and when Packard reached my stateroom, he said, “Here – come in here.” He came in, and Bill followed. But before they entered, I had climbed into the upper bunk, trapped, and regretting coming there. They stood there, leaning on the edge of the bunk, talking. I couldn’t see them, but I could tell where they were by the smell of the whiskey they'd been drinking. I was glad I didn’t drink whiskey, but it wouldn’t have mattered much anyway, because most of the time they couldn't have located me since I wasn’t breathing. I was too frightened. Besides, you couldn’t possibly breathe and listen to such talk. They spoke quietly and seriously. Bill still wanted to kill Turner. He said, “He said he’ll tell, and he will. Even if we gave him both our shares now, it wouldn’t change anything after this fight and how we’ve treated him. You can be sure he’ll testify for the state; mark my words. I say we end his misery.” “So do I,” Packard said very calmly. “Damn it, I was starting to think you didn’t. Okay, then, that’s settled. Let’s go do it.” “Hold on a minute; I haven’t finished talking. Listen to me. Shooting is fine, but there are quieter ways if it absolutely has to be done. But what I propose is this: it doesn’t make sense to risk getting hanged if you can achieve your goal in a way that’s just as effective and doesn’t put you in danger. Isn’t that right?” “You bet it is. But how are you going to manage it this time?” “Well, my plan is this: we’ll quickly search and collect whatever valuables we missed in the staterooms, then head for shore and hide what we took. Then we wait. Now, I estimate it won't be more than two hours before this wreck breaks apart and is swept down the river. See? He’ll drown, and he’ll have no one to blame but himself. I figure that’s a lot better than killing him. I’m against killing a man if you can avoid it; it’s not smart, it’s not moral. Am I wrong?”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "By now, Jim had already left to get the raft. I was bursting with curiosity, and thought to myself that Tom Sawyer would see this through, so I wasn't about to give up either—I had to find out what was happening. I got down on all fours and crawled through the small passageway, inching my way back in the darkness until only one stateroom separated me from the cross-hall of the texas deck. In that room, I saw a man lying on the floor, tied up hand and foot, with two other men standing over him—one holding a dim lantern, and the other a pistol. The man with the pistol kept aiming it at the prisoner’s head and threatening him: 'I want to! And I should, too—you’re a no-good skunk!' The man on the floor would shrink back and plead, 'Please don’t, Bill; I’ll never tell anyone.' Each time, the man with the lantern would laugh and say, 'You sure won’t! That’s the truest thing you’ve ever said.' At one point he added, 'Listen to him beg! If we hadn’t overpowered and tied him up, he would’ve killed us both—for nothing. Just for standing up for ourselves. But I bet you won’t be threatening anyone anymore, Jim Turner. Put the pistol away, Bill.' Bill argued back, 'I don’t want to, Jake Packard. I think we should kill him—wasn’t it the same way he killed old Hatfield? Doesn’t he deserve it?' But Packard replied, 'I don’t want him dead, and I’ve got my own reasons.' Hearing this, the man on the floor blubbered gratefully, promising to never forget Packard’s kindness. Packard ignored him, hung his lantern on a nail, and moved toward where I was hiding in the dark, signaling Bill to follow. I tried to back away as quickly as I could, but the boat was tilted and made it hard to move, so to keep from being discovered, I ducked into a stateroom on the upper side. The men fumbled through the dark, and when Packard reached the door of my stateroom, he called Bill in after him. Before they entered, I scrambled up to the upper bunk, cornered and regretting coming. They stood there with their hands on the edge of the bunk, talking quietly. I couldn’t see them, but I knew where they were from the smell of their whiskey. I was thankful I didn’t drink, but it wouldn’t have mattered—I was so scared that I barely breathed, afraid any sound would give me away, and besides, I was too frightened to breathe anyway, hearing the things they were saying. Bill wanted to kill Turner, saying he’d rat them out no matter what, even if they gave up their shares now. After the fight and the way they’d treated him, Bill was sure Turner would testify against them. 'We should put him out of his misery,' Bill insisted. Packard agreed, but told Bill to wait. 'Shooting’s one way, but there are quieter options that don’t involve getting ourselves into more trouble. Why bring a noose into it if there’s a better way without as much risk?' Bill agreed and asked how they’d manage it. Packard explained that they’d gather what loot they could from the staterooms, head for shore to hide it, then wait, since the wreck would break apart and drift down the river within a couple of hours. Turner would drown, and no one could be blamed but himself. Packard argued this was better than killing him outright, since avoiding murder made more sense and was more moral."

We’d got to find that boat now—had to have it for ourselves. So we went a-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was, too—seemed a week before we got to the stern. No sign of a boat. Jim said he didn’t believe he could go any further—so scared he hadn’t hardly any strength left, he said. But I said, come on, if we get left on this wreck we are in a fix, sure. So on we prowled again. We struck for the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along forwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the edge of the skylight was in the water. When we got pretty close to the cross-hall door, there was the skiff, sure enough! I could just barely see her. I felt ever so thankful. In another second I would a been aboard of her, but just then the door opened. One of the men stuck his head out only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was gone; but he jerked it in again, and says:\n“Heave that blame lantern out o’ sight, Bill!”\nHe flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himself and set down. It was Packard. Then Bill he come out and got in. Packard says, in a low voice:\n“All ready—shove off!”\nI couldn’t hardly hang on to the shutters, I was so weak. But Bill says:\n“Hold on—’d you go through him?”\n“No. Didn’t you?”\n“No. So he’s got his share o’ the cash yet.”\n“Well, then, come along; no use to take truck and leave money.”\n“Say, won’t he suspicion what we’re up to?”\n“Maybe he won’t. But we got to have it anyway. Come along.”\nSo they got out and went in.\nThe door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and in a half second I was in the boat, and Jim come tumbling after me. I out with my knife and cut the rope, and away we went!\nWe didn’t touch an oar, and we didn’t speak nor whisper, nor hardly even breathe. We went gliding swift along, dead silent, past the tip of the paddle-box, and past the stern; then in a second or two more we was a hundred yards below the wreck, and the darkness soaked her up, every last sign of her, and we was safe, and knowed it.\nWhen we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lantern show like a little spark at the texas door for a second, and we knowed by that that the rascals had missed their boat, and was beginning to understand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was.",

We absolutely had to find that boat – we needed it for ourselves. So, trembling and shaking, we crept along the starboard side; it was slow work, feeling like an age before we reached the back of the wreck. There was no sign of the boat. Jim said he felt too scared to go on, claiming he had almost no strength left. But I told him to keep going, warning that if we were stuck on the wreck, we'd truly be in trouble. So we started searching again. We aimed for the rear of the pilot-house (texas), found it, and then awkwardly moved forward along the skylight, holding onto the window shutters since the edge of the skylight was underwater. When we got quite near the cross-passage door, there was our small boat, just as we hoped! I could barely make it out. I felt incredibly grateful. I would have been inside it in another second, but right then, the door opened. One of the men stuck his head out, only about two feet away from me, and I thought I was finished; but he quickly pulled it back in and said, “Bill, get that cursed lantern out of sight!” He threw a bag of something into the boat, then climbed in himself and sat down. It was Packard. Then Bill came out and got in. Packard said quietly, “Ready – push off!” I could barely cling to the shutters, I was so weak. But Bill asked, “Wait – did you search him?” “No. Did you?” “No. So he still has his share of the money.” “Alright, come on then; there’s no point taking the other things and leaving the money.” “Tell me, won’t he suspect what we’re doing?” “Maybe not. But we have to have it regardless. Let’s go.” So they got out and went back inside. The door slammed shut because it was on the tilted side of the wreck; and in a fraction of a second, I was in the boat, and Jim tumbled in right after me. I pulled out my knife, cut the rope, and we were off! We didn't use the oars, nor did we speak or whisper, or barely even breathe. We glided swiftly along, completely silently, past the front part of the paddlewheel housing, and past the stern; then in just a second or two more, we were a hundred yards downstream from the wreck, and the darkness swallowed it up, every last trace, and we were safe, and we knew it. When we were three or four hundred yards further downstream, we saw the lantern appear like a tiny spark at the pilot-house door for a moment, and we understood from that that the villains had discovered their boat was missing and were starting to realize they were now in just as much difficulty as Jim Turner was.",

Jim said he didn’t think he could go any further; he was so frightened he barely had any strength left. I told him we had to keep going because if we were left on the wreck we'd be in serious trouble. So, we kept moving and reached the back of the texas cabin. Then, we scrambled forward along the skylight, grabbing from shutter to shutter, since the edge of the skylight was under water.

He compared himself to a rich man named Jim Hornback, saying he wasn't as wealthy or generous, but wouldn't trade his life on the river for all his money and living miles from town where nothing happens. I cut him off, saying, “They’re in terrible trouble, and—” He asked, “Who is?” I answered, “Why, Pap and Mom and Sis and Miss Hooker; and if you would take your ferryboat up there—” He interrupted again, “Up where? Where are they?” I told him, “On the wreck.” He asked, “What wreck?” I replied that there was only one. He seemed surprised, asking, “You don’t mean the *Walter Scott*?” I confirmed it was.

Goodness gracious, they won’t survive unless they get off quickly! How on earth did they get into such a mess?” I explained it was simple. “Miss Hooker was visiting in the town up there—” He interjected, “Yes, Booth’s Landing—continue.” I went on, explaining she was visiting at Booth’s Landing and at dusk took the horse-ferry with her enslaved woman to stay the night at a friend’s house. They lost their steering oar, drifted downstream backward for about two miles, and got stuck on the wreck. The ferryman, the enslaved woman, and the horses were all lost, but Miss Hooker managed to grab onto and get aboard the wreck.

The watchman was astonished, saying it was the most incredible story he'd ever heard. He asked what we did next. I explained that we yelled and made a fuss, but it’s so wide there that no one could hear us. So, Pap said someone had to get ashore to find help. Since I was the only one who could swim, I dove in. Miss Hooker told me that if I didn’t find help sooner, I should come here and look for her uncle, and he would sort things out. I reached the shore about a mile downstream and have been wandering around ever since, trying to get people to do something. But they told me, ‘What?

I always say—”\n\nI interrupted, “They’re in serious trouble, and—”\n\n“Who is?” he asked.\n\n“My pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker. If you’d take your ferry-boat and head upriver—”\n\n“Upriver to where? Where are they?”\n\n“They’re on the wreck.”\n\n“What wreck?”\n\n“There’s only one.”\n\n“Wait, you mean the Walter Scott?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Goodness! What are they doing there?”\n\n“They didn’t mean to be there.”\n\n“I’m sure they didn’t! There’s no chance for them unless they get off right away! How did they get in that situation?”\n\n“It happened like this. Miss Hooker was visiting the town—”\n\n“Yes, Booth’s Landing. Go on.”\n\n“She was visiting Booth’s Landing, and later in the evening, she and her servant took the horse-ferry to go stay the night with her friend, Miss-Something—I can’t remember her name. They lost their steering-oar and got caught in the current, drifting backwards a couple of miles until they hit the wreck. The ferryman, the servant, and the horses were all lost, but Miss Hooker managed to climb onto the wreck. About an hour after dark, we came by in our trading scow. It was too dark to see the wreck until we were right on top of it, and we crashed too. Everyone with us was saved except Bill Whipple. He was the best person—I almost wish I had died instead of him.”\n\n“Wow! This is the craziest story I’ve ever heard. So what did you do then?”\n\n“We shouted and called for help, but it’s so wide there that nobody could hear us. Pap said someone would have to make it to shore and get help. I was the only one who could swim, so I set out. Miss Hooker told me if I couldn’t find help soon, to come here and look for her uncle, because he’d know what to do. I made it ashore about a mile downstream and have been trying to get folks to help. But everyone said, ‘In this weather and with this current? That’s crazy; you should get the steam ferry.’ So, if you’ll just go and—”"

He imagined it would be noisy, especially with children in the 'nursery,' and the wives would probably fight a lot, adding to the chaos. Despite this, people claimed Solomon was the wisest man ever, which Jim didn't believe. He questioned why a wise person would choose to live amidst constant noise and commotion. He argued that a wise man would instead build a factory, like a boiler factory, that he could simply shut down when he wanted peace and quiet. Huck insisted that Solomon was indeed the wisest man, citing the widow Douglas as his source. Jim strongly disagreed, saying he didn't care what the widow said, Solomon wasn't wise at all and had some incredibly foolish ideas. He asked Huck if he knew about Solomon's plan to cut a baby in half. Huck confirmed he did, as the widow had told him. Jim exclaimed that it was the most ridiculous idea ever. He used an analogy to illustrate his point: imagine a tree stump is one woman, Huck is the other, Jim is Solomon, and a dollar bill is the child. Both women claim the bill. Jim asked if, like someone with common sense, he would try to find out who the bill really belonged to by asking neighbors and give it to the right person safely. No, he said, Solomon's method would be to cut the bill in half and give each woman half. He then asked what good half a dollar bill is—it's useless. And what good is half a child? He wouldn't value a million half-children. Huck responded exasperatedly that Jim had completely missed the point, missing it by a mile. Jim retorted that he knew what he was talking about and didn't need Huck to explain 'points' to him. He claimed he recognized sense when he saw it, and Solomon's actions made no sense. He argued that the dispute was about a *whole* child, and anyone who thought they could resolve a dispute over a whole child with half a child was utterly foolish. Jim dismissed further talk about Solomon, saying he knew him well enough. Huck repeated that Jim wasn't understanding the point. Jim dismissed 'the point' again, insisting the *real* point was much deeper—it lay in how Solomon was raised. He argued that a man with only one or two children would not be careless with them; he'd know their value. But a man with millions of children running around would be different—he'd cut a child in half as easily as a cat because there were plenty more. A child or two more or less meant nothing to Solomon, Jim concluded emphatically.",

I bet the wives argue a lot, and that just adds to the noise. Yet people say Solomon was the wisest man who ever lived. I don't believe that. Because, really, would a wise man want to live in a place that's always so noisy? Of course not. A wise man would build something like a boiler factory, and then he could just shut down the factory whenever he wanted to rest.\"\n\n\"But still, he was the wisest man, because the widow told me so herself.\"\n\n\"I don't care what the widow says, he wasn't wise. He had some of the craziest ideas I've ever heard of. Do you know about the child he wanted to cut in half?\"\n\n\"Yes, the widow told me all about it.\"\n\n\"Well then! Wasn't that just the strangest thing you ever heard of? Just think about it. There's the stump—that's one of the women; here's you—that's the other woman; I'm Solomon; and this dollar bill is the child. Both of you claim it. So, what do I do? Do I go ask around among the neighbors to find out who the bill really belongs to, and then give it to the right person, the sensible thing? No; I just cut the bill in half, and give each of you one half. That's what Solomon was planning to do with the baby. Now, what's the point of half a bill—you can't buy anything with it. And what's the use of half a child? I wouldn't give a darn for a million of them.\"\n\n\"But Jim, you totally missed the point—you missed it by far.\"\n\n\"Who, me? Don't talk to me about your points. I know common sense when I see it, and there isn't any sense in doing things like that. The argument wasn't about half a child, it was about a whole child, and anyone who thinks they can settle an argument about a whole child by cutting it in half doesn't know anything. Don't talk to me about Solomon, Huck, I know what he's really like.\"\n\n\"But I'm telling you, you don't understand the point.\"\n\n\"Forget the point! I know what I know. And listen, the real point goes deeper. It's about how Solomon was raised. If a man has only one or two children, is he going to be wasteful with them? No, he can't afford to. He knows how important they are. But a man with about five million kids running all over the house—it's different. He might as well cut a child in half as a cat. There's so many more. A child or two, more or less, didn't matter to Solomon, that's for sure!\""

I whooped and listened. Away down there somewheres I hears a small whoop, and up comes my spirits. I went tearing after it, listening sharp to hear it again. The next time it come, I see I warn’t heading for it, but heading away to the right of it. And the next time I was heading away to the left of it—and not gaining on it much either, for I was flying around, this way and that and t’other, but it was going straight ahead all the time.\nI did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it all the time, but he never did, and it was the still places between the whoops that was making the trouble for me. Well, I fought along, and directly I hears the whoop behind me. I was tangled good now. That was somebody else’s whoop, or else I was turned around.\nI throwed the paddle down. I heard the whoop again; it was behind me yet, but in a different place; it kept coming, and kept changing its place, and I kept answering, till by-and-by it was in front of me again, and I knowed the current had swung the canoe’s head down-stream, and I was all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering. I couldn’t tell nothing about voices in a fog, for nothing don’t look natural nor sound natural in a fog.\nThe whooping went on, and in about a minute I come a-booming down on a cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the current throwed me off to the left and shot by, amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared, the currrent was tearing by them so swift.\nIn another second or two it was solid white and still again. I set perfectly still then, listening to my heart thump, and I reckon I didn’t draw a breath while it thumped a hundred.\nI just give up then. I knowed what the matter was. That cut bank was an island, and Jim had gone down t’other side of it. It warn’t no tow-head that you could float by in ten minutes. It had the big timber of a regular island; it might be five or six miles long and more than half a mile wide.\nI kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I reckon. I was floating along, of course, four or five miles an hour; but you don’t ever think of that. No, you feel like you are laying dead still on the water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don’t think to yourself how fast you’re going, but you catch your breath and think, my! how that snag’s tearing along. If you think it ain’t dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night, you try it once—you’ll see.\nNext, for about a half an hour, I whoops now and then; at last I hears the answer a long ways off, and tries to follow it, but I couldn’t do it, and directly I judged I’d got into a nest of tow-heads, for I had little dim glimpses of them on both sides of me—sometimes just a narrow channel between, and some that I couldn’t see I knowed was there because I’d hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash that hung over the banks. Well, I warn’t long loosing the whoops down amongst the tow-heads; and I only tried to chase them a little while, anyway, because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o’-lantern. You never knowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so quick and so much.\nI had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times, to keep from knocking the islands out of the river; and so I judged the raft must be butting into the bank every now and then, or else it would get further ahead and clear out of hearing—it was floating a little faster than what I was.\nWell, I seemed to be in the open river again by-and-by, but I couldn’t hear no sign of a whoop nowheres.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "That much was fine, but the sandbar wasn't even sixty yards long. The instant I glided past its end, I shot out into the dense white fog, having no more idea where I was going than a dead person. I thought to myself, paddling is a bad idea; the next thing I know, I'll crash into the riverbank or another sandbar or something. I have to stay still and just drift. Still, it's incredibly unnerving to have to keep your hands motionless at such a moment. I yelled and listened. Far off somewhere downstream, I heard a faint call, and my spirits lifted. I sped towards it, listening intently for the sound again. The next time I heard it, I saw I wasn't heading for it, but veering off to its right. The time after that, I was heading off to its left—and not closing the distance much either, because I was spinning around this way and that, but the sound seemed to be moving straight ahead the whole time. I really wished the fool would think to make continuous noise, like beating a tin pan, constantly, but they never did, and it was the silent gaps between the calls that were causing me trouble. Anyway, I kept struggling along, and then suddenly, I heard the call *behind* me. I was completely confused now. That must be someone else's call, or I had turned myself around completely. I dropped the paddle. I heard the call again; it was still behind me but in a different spot; it kept coming and kept changing position, and I kept answering until eventually it was in front of me again. That's when I knew the current had turned the front of my canoe downstream, and I was okay if that was Jim and not just some random raftsman shouting. I couldn't distinguish voices in the fog because nothing looks or sounds normal in it. The calling continued, and in about a minute, I came rushing towards a steep clay bank with blurry, ghost-like shapes of large trees on it. The current pushed me sharply to the left and swept me past it, through a lot of submerged logs that seemed to roar because the current was tearing by them so fast. Within another second or two, it was all thick white fog and quiet again. I sat perfectly still then, listening to my heart pounding, and I doubt I took a breath while it thumped a hundred times. I just gave up then. I knew what the problem was. That steep bank was part of an island, and Jim had gone down the other side of it. It wasn't just a small sandbar you could drift past in ten minutes. It had the large trees of a proper island; it could be five or six miles long and more than half a mile wide. I stayed silent, with my ears keenly listening, for about fifteen minutes, I figure. I was drifting along, of course, at four or five miles an hour, but you never really feel that. No, you *feel* like you are lying perfectly still on the water; and if a quick glimpse of a snag passes you, you don't think about how fast *you're* going, but you gasp and think, wow! how fast that snag is moving. If you think it's not bleak and lonely being out in a fog like that by yourself at night, just try it once—you'll see. Next, for about half an hour, I called out occasionally. Finally, I heard a response a long distance away and tried to follow it, but I couldn't. Soon I decided I had gotten into a cluster of sandbars, because I caught faint, hazy glimpses of them on both sides of me—sometimes just a narrow passage between, and some I couldn't see but knew were there because I could hear the water washing against the old dead branches and debris hanging over the banks. Well, it didn't take long to lose the sounds down among the sandbars; and I only tried to chase them for a short while anyway, because it was worse than trying to catch a will-o'-the-wisp. You've never heard a sound dart around so much and change places so quickly and frequently. I had to quickly push away from the bank four or five times to avoid colliding with the sandbars. So I figured the raft must be bumping into the bank now and then, or else it would have gotten further ahead and out of hearing—it was floating a bit faster than I was. Eventually, I seemed to be back in the main river, but I couldn't hear any sign of a call anywhere anymore.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Everything was fine while I was by the tow-head, but that was less than sixty yards long. As soon as I passed it, I found myself swallowed by thick white fog, and I had no clue where I was going—just like a dead man. I realized paddling was too risky because I might hit the shore or another tow-head, so I just had to sit still and let the current carry me, though it made me nervous to do nothing. I hollered and listened for an answer. Far off, I barely heard a faint holler back, which lifted my spirits, and I followed the sound, straining to hear it again. When it came, I noticed I wasn’t heading towards it, but instead going to its right. The next time, I was off to the left, and I didn’t seem to be getting any closer, turning this way and that, while the sound kept moving straight. I wished the person would beat on a tin pan to make a constant noise, but they didn’t. The quiet moments between whoops made it harder for me. I kept at it until suddenly the whoop was behind me, and I realized I was all mixed up—maybe it was someone else’s call or maybe I got turned around. I dropped the paddle, and heard the whoop again behind me, only in a different spot. It kept coming and changing places, and I kept calling back, until eventually it was in front of me again. Then I knew the current had turned my canoe downstream, and if that was Jim’s whoop, I’d be okay—not a stranger’s. But it was impossible to recognize a voice in the fog, as nothing looked or sounded right. The whooping continued, and soon I rushed toward a steep bank with the fog-shrouded shapes of big trees. The current pushed me off to the left and sent me zipping past a bunch of snags in the water, which made a roar because the river was so quick there. In a couple seconds, I was surrounded by white fog again. I sat perfectly still, listening to my pounding heart, barely daring to breathe. Then I just gave up. I figured out what happened: that steep bank was an island, with Jim on the other side. It wasn’t a short tow-head you flew past in minutes—it was a real island, with big trees, maybe five or six miles long and over half a mile wide. I sat quietly for maybe fifteen minutes, floating four or five miles an hour, but you don’t notice that—you feel like you’re standing still. If you glimpse a snag go by, you don’t realize how fast you’re going; you just marvel at how fast the snag seems to be moving. If you think it isn’t lonely and depressing to be alone on the river in the fog at night, try it—you’ll see. After that, for about half an hour, I hollered off and on, until I finally got an answer from far away. I tried to follow it, but couldn’t, and soon realized I’d drifted into a cluster of tow-head islands; I’d catch dim glimpses of them on either side, and knew others were nearby from the sound of water against the brush. I quickly lost track of the answering whoops among the islands, and didn’t chase them long—it was worse than chasing a will-o’-the-wisp, with the sound darting and shifting endlessly. I had to push off from the banks several times to keep from smashing into them, so I guessed the raft must have been bumping into the bank too, or else it might drift ahead and out of earshot, since it moved a little faster than me. Eventually, I seemed to reach open river again, but couldn’t hear any more whoops anywhere."

Why, haven't you been talking about me coming back and all that stuff, as if I'd been gone?\" Jim insisted, \"Huck—Huck Finn, look me in the eye; look right at me.

Well, answer me this: Didn't you carry the rope out in the canoe to tie onto the sandbar?\" I said, \"No, I didn't. What sandbar? I haven't seen any sandbar.\" Jim pressed, \"You haven't seen any sandbar? Look here, didn't the rope snap loose and the raft zoom down the river, leaving you and the canoe behind in the fog?\" I asked, \"What fog?\" He insisted, \"Why, the fog!—the fog that's been around all night.

I've been sitting here talking with you all night until you fell asleep about ten minutes ago, and I guess I did the same. You couldn't have gotten drunk in that short time, so you must have been dreaming.\" Jim asked in disbelief, \"Dad fetch it, how am I gonna dream all that in ten minutes?\" I insisted, \"Well, hang it all, you did dream it, because none of it happened.\" Jim started to say, \"But, Huck, it's all just as clear to me as—\" I interrupted, \"It doesn't matter how clear it is; there's nothing to it. I know, because I've been here the whole time.\" Jim didn't speak for about five minutes, just sat there thinking deeply about it.

Let me look at you, child, let me touch you. No, you’re not dead! You’re back safe and sound, the same old Huck—thank goodness!\" I asked Jim what was wrong, and if he’d been drinking. He answered, surprised, \"Drinking? Have I had a chance to drink anything?\" I asked why he was talking so strangely then. He replied, \"How am I talking strange?\" I told him he’d been talking about me coming back, as if I’d been gone somewhere. Jim insisted, \"Huck, look me in the eye. Haven’t you been away?\" I told him I hadn’t gone anywhere, and asked where he thought I would have gone. Jim said something was wrong, questioning whether he was really himself or where exactly he was. I said he was definitely there, but thought maybe he was all mixed up.

Didn’t the rope come loose, and the raft sped down the river and left you and the canoe behind in the fog?\" I asked, \"What fog?\" Jim continued, \"The fog that was all around last night! Didn’t we yell for each other until we got separated in the islands, both of us lost? Didn’t I crash into a bunch of islands, have a terrible time, and almost drown? Isn’t that true, Huck? Isn’t it? Answer me!\" I said it was all too much for me, that I hadn’t seen any fog or islands or trouble. I said I’d been sitting with Jim all night until we both fell asleep ten minutes ago. I told him he couldn’t have gotten drunk in that time, so he must have just been dreaming. \"How could I dream all that in ten minutes?\" Jim asked. I insisted, \"You must have dreamed it, because none of it happened.\" Jim persisted that it all seemed completely real to him. I replied it didn’t matter how real it felt—it didn’t happen, since I’d been there all along. Jim was silent for a while, thinking it over. Finally he said, \"Well, maybe I did dream it, Huck; but I swear it’s the strongest dream I’ve ever had.

The calls and shouts were warnings that would reach us intermittently, and if we didn't make an effort to understand them, they would lead us into misfortune instead of protecting us. The collection of sandbars symbolized the difficulties we would face with quarrelsome and unpleasant individuals, but if we minded our own business and refrained from arguing or provoking them, we would successfully navigate through it all and emerge from the fog into the wide, clear river, which represented the free States, and would no longer have trouble. The sky had become quite dark shortly after I got onto the raft, but it was beginning to clear up again. “Okay, Jim, that interpretation is sufficient as far as it goes,” I said, “but what do these things signify?” I was referring to the leaves and debris on the raft and the broken oar, which were easily visible now. Jim looked at the trash, then at me, and back at the trash again. The dream had become so ingrained in his mind that he seemed unable to easily dismiss it and bring the facts back into perspective right away. However, once he did manage to straighten things out, he looked at me steadily without any smile and said: “What do they stand for? I’m going to tell you. When I was completely worn out from working and calling for you, and fell asleep, my heart was almost broken because you were lost, and I didn’t care anymore what happened to me or the raft. And when I woke up and found you safe and sound again, the tears came, and I could have knelt down and kissed your foot, I was so grateful. And all you were thinking about was how you could play a trick on old Jim with a lie.

The shouts were like warnings we’d receive now and then, and if we didn’t try hard to understand them, they’d lead us into trouble rather than help us avoid it. A group of sandbars symbolized the troubles we’d have with difficult and unfriendly people, but if we kept to ourselves and didn’t provoke anyone, we’d get through and eventually make it out of the fog and into the open, safe river—which stood for the free States—where we wouldn’t have to worry anymore. Soon after I’d gotten onto the raft, it had become very cloudy, but now it was clearing up.\n\nI said, 'Well, Jim, that’s a pretty good interpretation, but what about these things here?' I meant the leaves and debris on the raft and the broken oar, which we could see clearly now.\n\nJim looked at the trash, then at me, and back again. The dream was so vivid in his mind that he couldn’t immediately set it aside and see what had really happened.

She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an open camp fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end. There was a power of style about her. It amounted to something being a raftsman on such a craft as that.\nWe went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and got hot. The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on both sides; you couldn’t see a break in it hardly ever, or a light. We talked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got to it. I said likely we wouldn’t, because I had heard say there warn’t but about a dozen houses there, and if they didn’t happen to have them lit up, how was we going to know we was passing a town? Jim said if the two big rivers joined together there, that would show. But I said maybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the same old river again. That disturbed Jim—and me too. So the question was, what to do? I said, paddle ashore the first time a light showed, and tell them pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow, and was a green hand at the business, and wanted to know how far it was to Cairo. Jim thought it was a good idea, so we took a smoke on it and waited.",

The raft had four long oars (sweeps) on each end, which made us guess it probably had around thirty men on board. It carried five large shelters (wigwams) spaced far apart, an open campfire in the center, and a tall flagpole at each end. There was something really impressive about this raft. Being a raftsman on a vessel like that felt significant. We drifted downstream into a wide curve in the river, and the night became overcast and warm. The river was very wide, with thick woods lining both banks; you could rarely see any clearings or lights. We talked about the town of Cairo and wondered if we would recognize it when we reached it. I said we probably wouldn't, because I had heard there were only about twelve houses there, and if their lights weren't on, how would we know we were going past a town? Jim said the point where the two major rivers merged would be the giveaway. But I countered that we might mistake it for passing the end of an island and re-entering the same stretch of river we had been on. That possibility worried Jim, and me as well. So the problem was, what should we do? I suggested paddling to the bank as soon as we saw a light, and telling whoever was there that my father was following behind in a trading boat, that he was new to the business, and wanted to know how far it was to Cairo. Jim agreed it was a good plan, so we had a smoke to think it over and waited.",

It really meant something to be part of a crew on such a raft. As we drifted into a wide curve in the river, the night turned cloudy and became warm. The river widened out with dense forests lining both sides, so thick that you could rarely spot an opening or even a light. We discussed the town of Cairo and wondered if we would recognize it when we arrived. I mentioned that we might miss it since, based on what I'd heard, it only had about a dozen houses, and if none were lit, we wouldn't realize we were passing through a town. Jim pointed out that if the two big rivers came together at Cairo, that would be noticeable, but I said that we might just as easily mistake it for reaching the end of an island and ending up back on the same river. This uncertainty worried both Jim and me. So, we wondered what we should do. I suggested that, whenever we spotted a light on shore, we could go over and say that my father was coming behind us with a trade boat, new to the job, and wanted to know how far it was to Cairo. Jim liked this plan, so we settled in to think it over and waited."

Every little while he jumps up and says:\n“Dah she is?”\nBut it warn’t. It was Jack-o’-lanterns, or lightning bugs; so he set down again, and went to watching, same as before. Jim said it made him all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom. Well, I can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him, because I begun to get it through my head that he was most free—and who was to blame for it? Why, me. I couldn’t get that out of my conscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn’t rest; I couldn’t stay still in one place. It hadn’t ever come home to me before, what this thing was that I was doing. But now it did; and it stayed with me, and scorched me more and more. I tried to make out to myself that I warn’t to blame, because I didn’t run Jim off from his rightful owner; but it warn’t no use, conscience up and says, every time, “But you knowed he was running for his freedom, and you could a paddled ashore and told somebody.” That was so—I couldn’t get around that noway. That was where it pinched. Conscience says to me, “What had poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off right under your eyes and never say one single word? What did that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean? Why, she tried to learn you your book, she tried to learn you your manners, she tried to be good to you every way she knowed how. That’s what she done.”\nI got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead. I fidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim was fidgeting up and down past me. We neither of us could keep still. Every time he danced around and says, “Dah’s Cairo!” it went through me like a shot, and I thought if it was Cairo I reckoned I would die of miserableness.\nJim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself. He was saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when he got enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close to where Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy the two children, and if their master wouldn’t sell them, they’d get an Ab’litionist to go and steal them.\nIt most froze me to hear such talk. He wouldn’t ever dared to talk such talk in his life before. Just see what a difference it made in him the minute he judged he was about free. It was according to the old saying, “Give a nigger an inch and he’ll take an ell.” Thinks I, this is what comes of my not thinking. Here was this nigger, which I had as good as helped to run away, coming right out flat-footed and saying he would steal his children—children that belonged to a man I didn’t even know; a man that hadn’t ever done me no harm.",

Every now and then he'd leap up, asking, \"Is that her?\" But it was always just swamp lights or fireflies; so he'd sit back down and keep watching, just like before. Jim said being so near to freedom made him feel completely shaky and feverish. To be honest, hearing him say that made me feel just as shaky and feverish, because it started sinking in that he was practically free—and who was responsible for that? Me. I couldn't get that thought out of my head, no matter what I tried. It bothered me so much I couldn't settle down; I couldn't stay still in one spot. It hadn't truly registered before, the magnitude of what I was doing. But now it did; and it stayed with me, burning me more and more. I tried to convince myself I wasn't to blame, because I hadn't forced Jim to run away from his lawful owner; but it was useless, my conscience spoke up every time, saying, \"But you knew he was escaping to be free, and you could have gone ashore and told someone.\" That was undeniable—I couldn't argue with that fact. That's what really troubled me. Conscience asked me, \"What had poor Miss Watson ever done to you that you could watch her slave leave right under your nose and not say a single word? What did that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her so badly? Why, she tried to teach you to read, she tried to teach you manners, she tried to be good to you in every way she knew how.

Neither of us could keep still. Every time he bounced around yelling, \"There's Cairo!\", it felt like a physical blow, and I thought if it really was Cairo, I'd probably die from pure misery. Jim kept talking aloud the whole time I was having this internal debate. He was saying that the first thing he'd do when he got to a free state was save every penny and never spend a cent, and when he had enough, he'd buy his wife, who was owned on a farm near Miss Watson's place; and then they would both work to buy their two children, and if their owner wouldn't sell them, they'd get an Abolitionist to help steal them. Hearing him talk like that completely stunned me. He would never have dared to speak that way before in his life. Just look at how much it changed him the moment he believed he was almost free. It was just like that old saying, \"Give a N-word an inch and he'll take an ell.\" I thought, this is the consequence of my lack of foresight.

I’d never thought deeply about what I was doing before, but now it really struck me and I felt worse and worse. I tried to convince myself it wasn’t my fault, since I hadn’t helped Jim escape directly from Miss Watson, but that didn’t work—my conscience reminded me, “You knew he was escaping to freedom, and you could have paddled to shore and told someone.” And that was true, there was no denying it. My conscience kept asking, “What did Miss Watson ever do to you that you’d just let her slave slip away without a word? She tried to educate you, teach you manners, and be kind in every way she knew.” That was true, too. I started feeling so wretched and guilty that I almost wished I were dead.

Hearing him talk so openly almost shocked me—he’d never have dared to speak that way before. Just see what a difference it made once he thought he was nearly free.

Jim won’t ever forgit you, Huck; you’s de bes’ fren’ Jim’s ever had; en you’s de only fren’ ole Jim’s got now.”\nI was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he says this, it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me. I went along slow then, and I warn’t right down certain whether I was glad I started or whether I warn’t. When I was fifty yards off, Jim says:\n“Dah you goes, de ole true Huck; de on’y white genlman dat ever kep’ his promise to ole Jim.”\nWell, I just felt sick. But I says, I got to do it—I can’t get out of it. Right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns, and they stopped and I stopped. One of them says:\n“What’s that yonder?”\n“A piece of a raft,” I says.\n“Do you belong on it?”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“Any men on it?”\n“Only one, sir.”\n“Well, there’s five niggers run off to-night up yonder, above the head of the bend. Is your man white or black?”\nI didn’t answer up prompt. I tried to, but the words wouldn’t come. I tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it, but I warn’t man enough—hadn’t the spunk of a rabbit. I see I was weakening; so I just give up trying, and up and says:\n“He’s white.”\n“I reckon we’ll go and see for ourselves.”\n“I wish you would,” says I, “because it’s pap that’s there, and maybe you’d help me tow the raft ashore where the light is. He’s sick—and so is mam and Mary Ann.”\n“Oh, the devil! we’re in a hurry, boy. But I s’pose we’ve got to. Come, buckle to your paddle, and let’s get along.”\nI buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars. When we had made a stroke or two, I says:\n“Pap’ll be mighty much obleeged to you, I can tell you. Everybody goes away when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore, and I can’t do it by myself.”\n“Well, that’s infernal mean. Odd, too. Say, boy, what’s the matter with your father?”\n“It’s the—a—the—well, it ain’t anything much.”\nThey stopped pulling. It warn’t but a mighty little ways to the raft now. One says:\n“Boy, that’s a lie. What is the matter with your pap? Answer up square now, and it’ll be the better for you.”\n“I will, sir, I will, honest—but don’t leave us, please. It’s the—the—gentlemen, if you’ll only pull ahead, and let me heave you the headline, you won’t have to come a-near the raft—please do.”\n“Set her back, John, set her back!” says one. They backed water. “Keep away, boy—keep to looard. Confound it, I just expect the wind has blowed it to us. Your pap’s got the small-pox, and you know it precious well. Why didn’t you come out and say so? Do you want to spread it all over?”\n“Well,” says I, a-blubbering, “I’ve told everybody before, and they just went away and left us.”\n“Poor devil, there’s something in that. We are right down sorry for you, but we—well, hang it, we don’t want the small-pox, you see. Look here, I’ll tell you what to do. Don’t you try to land by yourself, or you’ll smash everything to pieces. You float along down about twenty miles, and you’ll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river. It will be long after sun-up then, and when you ask for help you tell them your folks are all down with chills and fever. Don’t be a fool again, and let people guess what is the matter. Now we’re trying to do you a kindness; so you just put twenty miles between us, that’s a good boy. It wouldn’t do any good to land yonder where the light is—it’s only a wood-yard. Say, I reckon your father’s poor, and I’m bound to say he’s in pretty hard luck. Here, I’ll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this board, and you get it when it floats by. I feel mighty mean to leave you; but my kingdom! it won’t do to fool with small-pox, don’t you see?”\n“Hold on, Parker,” says the other man, “here’s a twenty to put on the board for me. Good-bye, boy; you do as Mr. Parker told you, and you’ll be all right.”\n“That’s so, my boy—good-bye, good-bye. If you see any runaway niggers you get help and nab them, and you can make some money by it.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I felt bad hearing Jim say that; it really diminished him in my eyes. My conscience bothered me more intensely than ever until I finally told myself, “Stop pressuring me—it’s not too late—I’ll paddle to shore at dawn and tell.” Immediately, I felt relief, happiness, and lightness. All my worries vanished. I started looking intently for a light and hummed to myself. Eventually, one appeared. Jim exclaimed:\n“We’re safe, Huck, we’re safe! Jump up and celebrate! That’s the good old Cairo at last, I just know it!”\nI replied:\n“I’ll take the canoe and check it out, Jim. It might not be, you know.”\nHe quickly prepared the canoe, placed his old coat in the bottom for me to sit on, and handed me the paddle. As I pushed off, he said:\n“Pretty soon I’ll be shouting for joy, and I’ll say, it’s all because of Huck; I’m a free man, and I could never have been free if it hadn’t been for Huck; Huck did it. Jim will never forget you, Huck; you’re the best friend Jim has ever had; and you’re the only friend old Jim has now.”\nI was paddling away, determined to expose him, but when he said this, it seemed to completely deflate my resolve. I continued slowly then, unsure whether I was glad I had started or not. When I was about fifty yards away, Jim called out:\n“There you go, the old dependable Huck; the only white gentleman that ever kept his word to old Jim.”\nWell, I just felt awful. But I told myself, I have to do it—I can’t avoid it. Just then, a skiff with two armed men approached, and they stopped, and I stopped. One of them asked:\n“What’s that over there?”\n“Part of a raft,” I said.\n“Do you belong on it?”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“Any men on it?”\n“Only one, sir.”\n“Okay, five enslaved people ran off tonight upriver, above the bend. Is your man white or black?”\nI didn’t answer right away. I tried, but the words wouldn’t come out. I tried for a few seconds to gather my courage and say it, but I wasn’t brave enough—didn’t have the courage of a rabbit. I saw I was losing my nerve, so I gave up trying and just blurted out:\n“He’s white.”\n“I guess we’ll go and see for ourselves.”\n“I wish you would,” I said, “because it’s my father who’s there, and maybe you’d help me tow the raft ashore where the light is. He’s sick—and so are Mom and Mary Ann.”\n“Oh, damn! We’re in a hurry, boy. But I suppose we have to. Come on, get busy with your paddle, and let’s go.”\nI started paddling hard, and they began rowing. After we’d made a few strokes, I said:\n“Dad will be extremely grateful to you, I can tell you. Everyone leaves when I need help towing the raft ashore, and I can’t do it by myself.”\n“Well, that’s incredibly mean. Strange, too. Say, boy, what’s wrong with your father?”\n“It’s the—uh—the—well, it’s nothing much.”\nThey stopped rowing. It was only a very short distance to the raft now. One man said:\n“Boy, that’s a lie. What is wrong with your father? Answer truthfully now, and it will be better for you.”\n“I will, sir, I will, honestly—but please don’t leave us. It’s the—the—gentlemen, if you’ll just pull ahead, and let me throw you the tow rope, you won’t have to come anywhere near the raft—please do.”\n“Back her up, John, back her up!” one said. They reversed direction. “Stay away, boy—keep downwind. Confound it, I just expect the wind has carried it to us. Your father has smallpox, and you know it perfectly well. Why didn’t you just say so? Do you want to spread it everywhere?”\n“Well,” I said, crying hard, “I’ve told everyone before, and they just went away and left us.”\n“Poor fellow, there’s some truth in that. We are truly sorry for you, but we—well, hang it, we don’t want smallpox, you see. Look here, I’ll tell you what to do. Don’t try to land by yourself, or you’ll smash everything. You just float downstream about twenty miles, and you’ll find a town on the left side of the river. It will be long after sunrise then, and when you ask for help, tell them your family is all down with chills and fever. Don’t be foolish again, and let people guess what’s wrong. Now we’re trying to help you; so you just put twenty miles between us, that’s a good boy. It wouldn’t do any good to land over there where the light is—it’s just a wood supply yard. Say, I guess your father is poor, and I have to say he’s in pretty bad luck. Here, I’ll put a twenty-dollar gold coin on this board, and you can get it when it floats by. I feel really bad leaving you; but for heaven’s sake! You shouldn’t mess with smallpox, understand?”\n“Hold on, Parker,” the other man said, “here’s another twenty to put on the board for me. Goodbye, boy; you do what Mr. Parker told you, and you’ll be fine.”\n“That’s right, my boy—goodbye, goodbye. If you see any runaway enslaved people, get help and catch them, and you can earn some money doing that.”",

My conscience kept bothering me, and I finally told myself, “Stop it—it’s not too late. I’ll go to shore at dawn and tell.” Suddenly, I felt much better, as if all my worries disappeared. I started searching for a light on the shore, humming quietly to myself. After a while, I spotted one. Jim shouted, telling me we were safe and had reached Cairo, and that I should jump for joy. I told him I’d take the canoe to check it out, since it might not be Cairo. Jim got the canoe ready, put his old coat down for me to sit on, and handed me the paddle. As I was leaving, he told me that soon he’d celebrate and say that it was all thanks to me; he’d never forget what I’d done and I was his best—and only—friend.\n\nAs I paddled away, eager to turn him in, what he said made me lose all my determination. I slowed down and didn’t know if I was happy or not about what I was doing. When I was about fifty yards away, Jim called out that I was the only white man who had ever kept a promise to him. I felt sick to my stomach, but tried to convince myself I had to go through with it. Just then, a boat with two men and guns approached and stopped near me. They asked about the raft, if I belonged to it, and who was on it. I said just one person, and when they asked if he was black or white, I hesitated, unable to answer. I realized I couldn’t go through with it, so I lied and said he was white. The men said they’d check for themselves, and I told them it was my pap on the raft, and maybe they could help tow it to shore since he was sick, as were my mother and Mary Ann. \n\nThey complained about being in a hurry but agreed to help. As we paddled, I said my pap would be grateful, and that no one else would help tow the raft. They asked what was wrong with him. I stumbled over my answer, and they stopped rowing and pressed me to tell the truth. I pleaded with them not to leave us and told them to keep back and said they wouldn’t have to get close, hoping to throw them off. Suddenly, they realized and said my father had smallpox and that I should’ve told them right away, so as not to spread it. I started crying, saying I’d told others before and they’d just left us.\n\nFeeling sorry for me, they suggested I float downstream about twenty miles to the next town and, when I asked for help, just say my family had chills and fever, not smallpox. They told me not to go ashore right there because it was only a wood-yard. Feeling bad for me, one of them put a twenty-dollar gold coin on a board for me to collect as it floated past, saying it was dangerous to deal with smallpox. The other man added another twenty and told me to follow their instructions. They said goodbye, reminded me to report any runaway slaves, and told me I might make money by it."

Then I thought a minute, and says to myself, hold on; s’pose you’d a done right and give Jim up, would you felt better than what you do now? No, says I, I’d feel bad—I’d feel just the same way I do now. Well, then, says I, what’s the use you learning to do right when it’s troublesome to do right and ain’t no trouble to do wrong, and the wages is just the same? I was stuck. I couldn’t answer that. So I reckoned I wouldn’t bother no more about it, but after this always do whichever come handiest at the time.\nI went into the wigwam; Jim warn’t there. I looked all around; he warn’t anywhere. I says:\n“Jim!”\n“Here I is, Huck. Is dey out o’ sight yit? Don’t talk loud.”\nHe was in the river under the stern oar, with just his nose out. I told him they were out of sight, so he come aboard.

But lawsy, how you did fool ’em, Huck! Dat wuz de smartes’ dodge! I tell you, chile, I ’speck it save’ ole Jim—ole Jim ain’t going to forgit you for dat, honey.”\nThen we talked about the money. It was a pretty good raise—twenty dollars apiece. Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat now, and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free States. He said twenty mile more warn’t far for the raft to go, but he wished we was already there.\nTowards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular about hiding the raft good. Then he worked all day fixing things in bundles, and getting all ready to quit rafting.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I said, \"Goodbye, sir,\" assuring them I wouldn't let any escaped slaves get past me if I could prevent it. After they left, I boarded the raft feeling depressed and disheartened. I knew I had done something wrong, and I felt it was pointless for me to try and be good. I believed that someone who doesn't learn the right way when they are young has no chance later on; when difficult choices arise, they lack the support to stick to what's right and will ultimately fail. Then I paused to think. I asked myself, \"Wait a minute; if you had done the 'right' thing and turned Jim in, would you feel any better than you do now?\" I answered myself, \"No, I'd still feel bad—exactly the same as I do now.\" So then I thought, \"Well, what's the point of trying to learn to do right when doing right causes trouble and doing wrong is easy, and the result feels the same?\" I was stumped; I couldn't find an answer. So I decided I wouldn't worry about it anymore. From then on, I would just do whatever was easiest at the moment. I went inside the shelter, but Jim wasn't there. I looked everywhere; he was nowhere to be found. I called out, \"Jim!\" He replied, \"I'm here, Huck. Are they gone from sight yet? Don't talk loudly.\" He was hiding in the river under the back oar, with only his nose above water. I told him the men were gone, so he came back onto the raft. He said, \"I was listening to everything you said, and I slipped into the river. I was planning to swim away for sure if they came aboard. Then I was going to swim back to the raft after they left. But goodness, Huck, you really tricked them! That was the cleverest trick! I'm telling you, child, I believe that saved old Jim—old Jim won't forget you for that, dear.\" Afterward, we discussed the money we had. It was a decent amount—twenty dollars each. Jim suggested we could now afford passage on a steamboat deck, and the money would cover our travel as far as we wanted to go in the free states. He mentioned that twenty more miles wasn't a long distance for the raft, but he wished we had already reached our destination. As dawn approached, we tied up the raft. Jim was extremely careful about hiding it well. He then spent the entire day organizing our belongings into bundles, getting everything ready to stop using the raft for travel.",

I realized that it's useless for me to try to be good; if someone isn't brought up the right way from when they're young, they don't stand a chance—when they're in a tough spot, there's nothing to help them stay true, so they fail. I thought about it and asked myself, what if you'd done the right thing and turned Jim in—would you feel better? No, I told myself, I'd feel just as bad as I do now. So what's the point in trying so hard to do what's right, when doing wrong is easier and feels the same? I couldn't answer that, so I decided not to worry about it anymore and from now on, I'd just do whatever was easiest at the moment.\n\nI went into the shelter; Jim wasn't there. I looked everywhere for him, but couldn't find him. I called, \"Jim!\" and he answered quietly, \"Here I am, Huck. Are they gone yet? Don't talk loud.\" He was in the river, hiding under the back oar with just his nose above water. I told him they were gone, so he climbed aboard. Jim explained, \"I was listening to everything they said, and I slipped into the river, planning to swim to shore if they came on the raft. Then I'd swim back when they'd left. But, wow, Huck, you sure fooled them! That was a smart move. I think you just saved old Jim, and I won't ever forget it.\"\n\nAfter that, we talked about the money. We each had about twenty dollars, which was a good amount. Jim said we could now afford to travel on a steamboat as passengers, and the money would last us as long as we needed in the free states. He said we only had about twenty more miles to go by raft, but wished we were there already.\n\nBy dawn, we tied up the raft, and Jim was very careful to hide it well. Then, all day, he worked on packing things up and getting ready to stop rafting for good."

Jim was awful disappointed, but I said never mind, Cairo would be the next place, I reckoned.\nWe passed another town before daylight, and I was going out again; but it was high ground, so I didn’t go. No high ground about Cairo, Jim said. I had forgot it. We laid up for the day on a tow-head tolerable close to the left-hand bank. I begun to suspicion something. So did Jim. I says:\n“Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night.”\nHe says:\n“Doan’ le’s talk about it, Huck. Po’ niggers can’t have no luck. I awluz ’spected dat rattlesnake-skin warn’t done wid its work.”\n“I wish I’d never seen that snake-skin, Jim—I do wish I’d never laid eyes on it.”\n“It ain’t yo’ fault, Huck; you didn’ know. Don’t you blame yo’self ’bout it.”\nWhen it was daylight, here was the clear Ohio water inshore, sure enough, and outside was the old regular Muddy! So it was all up with Cairo.\nWe talked it all over. It wouldn’t do to take to the shore; we couldn’t take the raft up the stream, of course. There warn’t no way but to wait for dark, and start back in the canoe and take the chances. So we slept all day amongst the cottonwood thicket, so as to be fresh for the work, and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone!\nWe didn’t say a word for a good while. There warn’t anything to say. We both knowed well enough it was some more work of the rattlesnake-skin; so what was the use to talk about it? It would only look like we was finding fault, and that would be bound to fetch more bad luck—and keep on fetching it, too, till we knowed enough to keep still.\nBy-and-by we talked about what we better do, and found there warn’t no way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy a canoe to go back in. We warn’t going to borrow it when there warn’t anybody around, the way pap would do, for that might set people after us.\nSo we shoved out after dark on the raft.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "That night, around ten o'clock, we saw the lights of a town located in a bend to the left downstream. I went in the canoe to ask about it. Before long, I encountered a man on the river in a small skiff, setting his fishing lines. I pulled alongside him and asked, \"Excuse me, sir, is that town Cairo?\" He replied, \"Cairo? No. You must be an absolute fool.\" \"What town is it, sir?\" I inquired. He snapped, \"If you're curious, go find out yourself. If you linger here bothering me for even thirty seconds more, you'll experience something unpleasant.\" I paddled back to the raft. Jim was extremely disappointed, but I told him not to worry, assuming Cairo would be the very next place. We passed another town before dawn, and I considered going ashore to check it, but it was situated on high ground, so I decided against it. Jim had mentioned that Cairo wasn't on high ground, which I had forgotten. We stayed put for the day on a sandbar quite near the left bank. Both Jim and I started to feel suspicious. I said, \"Perhaps we passed Cairo in the fog that night.\" He responded, \"Let's not discuss it, Huck. Poor black folks never have any luck. I always suspected that rattlesnake skin wasn't finished causing trouble.\" \"I truly wish I had never seen that snake skin, Jim—I sincerely wish I had never set eyes on it.\" \"It's not your fault, Huck; you didn't know. Don't blame yourself for it.\" When daylight arrived, there was the unmistakable clear water of the Ohio River near the shore, as expected, and further out was the familiar muddy water of the Mississippi! This confirmed that we had gone past the confluence and missed Cairo entirely. We talked over our situation. Going ashore was impossible; naturally, we couldn't paddle the raft upstream against the current. The only course of action seemed to be waiting until dark, then going back upstream in the canoe and taking our chances. So, we slept all day among the cottonwood trees to be well-rested for the task, and when we returned to the raft near dusk, the canoe was gone! We didn't speak for a long while. There was nothing left to say. We both fully understood it was more bad luck stemming from the rattlesnake skin; so, what was the point of talking about it? It would only seem like we were complaining, and that would surely attract more misfortune—and continue to do so until we learned to stay silent. Eventually, we discussed what we should do next and concluded there was no option but to continue drifting downstream on the raft until we had an opportunity to buy a canoe to travel back. We weren't going to steal one when nobody was around, the way Pap would, because that might cause people to pursue us. Therefore, we pushed off on the raft after dark.",

I then asked what town it was, but he wouldn’t tell me and threatened me if I kept bothering him. I paddled back to the raft, and Jim was very disappointed. I tried to reassure him, saying Cairo was probably the next town. We passed another town before sunrise, and I almost went to ask again, but saw that it was on higher ground. Jim reminded me Cairo didn’t have high ground; I had forgotten that. We spent the day hiding on a small island near the left bank. Both Jim and I began to suspect something was wrong. I suggested we might have floated past Cairo in the fog. Jim said not to talk about it, blaming his bad luck and the cursed snake-skin we found earlier. I wished we’d never seen it, but Jim told me not to blame myself. When daylight came, we saw the clear Ohio River water close to shore and muddy Mississippi water beyond; it was obvious we had missed Cairo. After discussing our options, we knew we couldn’t row the raft upstream; the only option was to wait until nighttime, paddle back in the canoe, and hope for the best. So, we rested all day in a cottonwood thicket to be ready, but when we returned to the raft at dusk, our canoe was gone! We sat in silence, both believing it was more bad luck from that snake-skin, and decided not to talk about it out loud. Eventually, we realized our only choice was to continue drifting down the river until we could buy, rather than steal, another canoe. After dark, we set off on the raft."

She aimed right for us. Often they do that and try to see how close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks he’s mighty smart.

Well, here it came, and we thought it was going to try and pass by us very narrowly; but it didn't appear to be turning away at all.

So, I grabbed a plank that drifted near me while I was keeping myself afloat and started swimming towards the bank, pushing the plank ahead. However, I realized the current was pushing me towards the left shore, indicating I was in the middle of a river crossing. Consequently, I changed direction and went that way instead. It was one of those long, angled crossings that spanned two miles, so it took me quite a while to get across. I made a safe landing and climbed up the riverbank. I could only see a short distance, but I continued cautiously over rough terrain for a quarter-mile or more. Then, before I even noticed it, I came upon a large, old-fashioned double log-house.

He says:\n“Ain’t they no Shepherdsons around?”\nThey said, no, ’twas a false alarm.\n“Well,” he says, “if they’d a ben some, I reckon I’d a got one.”\nThey all laughed, and Bob says:\n“Why, Buck, they might have scalped us all, you’ve been so slow in coming.”\n“Well, nobody come after me, and it ain’t right I’m always kept down; I don’t get no show.”\n“Never mind, Buck, my boy,” says the old man, “you’ll have show enough, all in good time, don’t you fret about that.

There were three tall men pointing guns at me, which, I must say, made me recoil slightly. The oldest was gray-haired and around sixty, while the other two were thirty or older. All of them were handsome and well-built. Beside them was a lovely old lady with gray hair, and behind her stood two young women I couldn't clearly see. The older gentleman spoke, saying, \"Okay, I think it's alright. Come on in.\" Once I was inside, the old gentleman locked the door, then barred and bolted it. He told the young men to bring their guns, and they all moved into a large parlor with a new rag rug on the floor. They positioned themselves in a corner safely out of view from the front windows, as there were no windows on the side. They held the candle up and examined me closely. They all declared, \"He's definitely not a Shepherdson; there's nothing about him that resembles a Shepherdson.\" The old man then said he hoped I didn't mind being checked for weapons, explaining he meant no harm, just wanted to be certain. He didn't search my pockets but simply felt the outside of my clothes and confirmed I had no arms. He told me to relax and feel at home, and to tell them all about myself. However, the old lady chimed in, saying, \"Oh, bless your heart, Saul, the poor child is completely soaked; and don't you think he might be hungry?\" \"You're right, Rachel—I forgot,\" he replied. So the old lady said, \"Betsy\" (referring to an enslaved woman), \"hurry and get him something to eat as quickly as you can, the poor thing. And one of you girls, go and wake up Buck and tell him—oh, here he is now. Buck, take this young stranger, help him get out of his wet clothes, and put him in some of yours that are dry.\" Buck looked to be around my age—thirteen or fourteen or so, although he was a bit bigger than me. He was only wearing a shirt and had very messy hair. He came in yawning and rubbing one eye with his fist, dragging a gun in his other hand. He asked, \"Were there any Shepherdsons around?\" They told him no, it was a false alarm. \"Well,\" he said, \"if there had been some, I'm sure I would have gotten one.\" Everyone laughed, and Bob commented, \"Goodness, Buck, they could have scalped us all, you were so slow coming.\" \"Well, nobody came to get me, and it's not fair that I'm always held back; I don't get a chance,\" Buck retorted. \"Don't worry, Buck, my boy,\" the old man said, \"you'll have plenty of chances in due time, don't fret about it.

That’s exactly where he was!”\n“Alright, if you knew his location, why did you ask me?”\n“Goodness, it’s a riddle, don’t you understand? Say, how long do you plan on staying here? You absolutely must stay forever. We can have an absolutely fantastic time – they aren’t holding school right now. Do you happen to own a dog?

He urged me to guess, saying it was easy, but I insisted I couldn't since I didn't know the story.

There warn’t no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heaps of parlors in towns has beds in them. There was a big fireplace that was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes they wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown, same as they do in town.

By one of the parrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other; and when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn’t open their mouths nor look different nor interested.

There was no bed in the parlor, not even a hint of one, although many parlors in towns do have beds. There was a large fireplace with a brick bottom, and these bricks were kept clean and red by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes they painted them with a red water-based paint called Spanish-brown, just as they did in town. They had large brass fire dogs capable of holding a substantial log. A clock sat in the center of the mantelpiece, with a painting of a town on the lower part of the glass front and a round area in the middle representing the sun, allowing you to see the pendulum swinging behind it. It was lovely to hear the clock tick; occasionally, after a traveling peddler had serviced and adjusted it, it would strike up to a hundred and fifty times before running down. They considered it priceless. To the side of the clock stood a large, unusual parrot on each side, made of a material similar to chalk and brightly painted. Next to one parrot was a cat made of ceramic, and by the other, a ceramic dog; when you pressed them, they would squeak from underneath without opening their mouths or changing expression. Behind these ornaments were a pair of large fans made from wild turkey wings. On the table in the middle of the room was an attractive ceramic basket filled with artificial apples, oranges, peaches, and grapes, which were more vibrantly colored than real fruit, but you could tell they weren't real because chipped areas revealed the white chalk-like material underneath.

The parlor didn’t have a bed, unlike many town parlors, and everything was tidy. The large fireplace had a brick hearth, kept clean and red by washing and scrubbing, and sometimes coated with a reddish paint called Spanish-brown, just as in the town. Sturdy brass andirons stood ready to hold heavy logs. Above the fireplace sat a clock on the mantel, featuring a painted town scene and a spot for the sun on its glass. You could watch the pendulum swing and listen to the pleasant ticking. After a peddler would clean and fix it, the clock would chime so much it seemed like it would never stop, but the family wouldn’t sell it for any amount.

Carefully stacked at each corner of the table were books, including a large illustrated family Bible, Pilgrim’s Progress—a challenging but interesting read about a man leaving his family—Friendship’s Offering with poetry and beautiful writings that I mostly skipped, a collection of speeches by Henry Clay, Dr. Gunn’s Family Medicine offering lots of health advice, a hymn book, and many others. The room also had good-quality, split-bottom chairs that were sturdy and not sagging or broken, unlike old baskets."

          "text_segment": "They had pictures hung on the walls—mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes, and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called “Signing the Declaration.” There was some that they called crayons, which one of the daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen years old. They was different from any pictures I ever see before—blacker, mostly, than is common. One was a woman in a slim black dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule, and underneath the picture it said “Shall I Never See Thee More Alas.” Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath the picture it said “I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.” There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath the picture it said “And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.” These was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn’t somehow seem to take to them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the fan-tods. Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done what they had lost. But I reckoned that with her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard. She was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it done, but she never got the chance. It was a picture of a young woman in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up towards the moon—and the idea was to see which pair would look best, and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung flowers on it. Other times it was hid with a little curtain. The young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me.\nThis young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the Presbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her own head. It was very good poetry. This is what she wrote about a boy by the name of Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded:\nODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC’D\n\nAnd did young Stephen sicken,\n    And did young Stephen die?\nAnd did the sad hearts thicken,\n    And did the mourners cry?\n\nNo; such was not the fate of\n    Young Stephen Dowling Bots;\nThough sad hearts round him thickened,\n    ’Twas not from sickness’ shots.\n\nNo whooping-cough did rack his frame,\n    Nor measles drear with spots;\nNot these impaired the sacred name\n    Of Stephen Dowling Bots.\n\nDespised love struck not with woe\n    That head of curly knots,\nNor stomach troubles laid him low,\n    Young Stephen Dowling Bots.\n\nO no. Then list with tearful eye,\n    Whilst I his fate do tell.\nHis soul did from this cold world fly\n    By falling down a well.\n\nThey got him out and emptied him;\n    Alas it was too late;\nHis spirit was gone for to sport aloft\n    In the realms of the good and great.\nIf Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was fourteen, there ain’t no telling what she could a done by-and-by. Buck said she could rattle off poetry like nothing. She didn’t ever have to stop to think. He said she would slap down a line, and if she couldn’t find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down another one, and go ahead. She warn’t particular; she could write about anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful. Every time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died, she would be on hand with her “tribute” before he was cold. She called them tributes. The neighbors said it was the doctor first, then Emmeline, then the undertaker—the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once, and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person’s name, which was Whistler. She warn’t ever the same after that; she never complained, but she kinder pined away and did not live long. Poor thing, many’s the time I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been aggravating me and I had soured on her a little. I liked all that family, dead ones and all, and warn’t going to let anything come between us. Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was alive, and it didn’t seem right that there warn’t nobody to make some about her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two myself, but I couldn’t seem to make it go somehow. They kept Emmeline’s room trim and nice, and all the things fixed in it just the way she liked to have them when she was alive, and nobody ever slept there. The old lady took care of the room herself, though there was plenty of niggers, and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there mostly.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Their walls were adorned with pictures, mostly portraits of historical figures like Washington and Lafayette, battle scenes, images of Highland Mary, and a depiction of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Some were described as 'crayons,' created by one of their daughters who had passed away when she was just fifteen. These pieces were unlike any I had seen before, generally darker than typical artwork. One showed a woman in a fitted black dress, cinched high under the arms, with sleeves that puffed out strangely, wearing a large, dark bonnet shaped like a scoop shovel with a black veil. Her slender white ankles were bound with black ribbons, and her tiny black slippers were sharp and pointed. She leaned thoughtfully on her right elbow against a tombstone beneath a weeping willow tree, holding a white handkerchief and a small purse in her other hand which hung by her side. Below this picture were the words, 'Shall I Never See Thee More Alas.' Another featured a young woman whose hair was styled straight up and tied in a knot at the top of her head in front of a comb resembling a chair back. She was depicted crying into a handkerchief while holding a dead bird on its back with its feet pointing upwards in her other hand. This picture was captioned, 'I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.' There was also one showing a young lady gazing up at the moon from a window, with tears streaming down her face. In one hand, she held an open letter displaying black sealing wax on one edge, and she was pressing a locket on a chain against her mouth. The caption beneath read, 'And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.' I suppose these were considered good pictures, but they had a way of making me feel uneasy and anxious whenever I felt a bit down. Everyone was saddened by her death because she had planned to create many more such pictures, and looking at her finished work, you could tell what a loss it was. However, I personally thought, given her inclination, she was probably having a better time in the graveyard. She was working on what they considered her most important picture when she fell ill. Her daily and nightly prayer was to live long enough to finish it, but she never got the chance. This picture depicted a young woman in a long white dress standing on the railing of a bridge, seemingly ready to jump. Her hair was down her back, and she was looking up at the moon with tears on her face. It strangely showed two arms folded across her chest, two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up towards the moon. The idea was that she would decide which pair of arms looked best and then erase the others, but as I mentioned, she died before she could make up her mind. This picture was kept above the head of her bed in her room. On her birthday each year, they would hang flowers on it. At other times, it was covered by a small curtain. The young woman in the picture had a somewhat pretty, sweet face, but having so many arms made her look like a spider, in my opinion. This young girl, when she was alive, kept a scrapbook where she would paste clippings about obituaries, accidents, and stories of suffering that she found in the Presbyterian Observer. Afterward, she would compose poetry about them from her own imagination. Her poetry was considered very good. Here is the poem she wrote about a boy named Stephen Dowling Bots who fell into a well and drowned: ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC’D Did young Stephen fall ill, And did young Stephen die? And did the sad hearts gather, And did the mourners weep? No; that was not the fate of Young Stephen Dowling Bots; Though sad hearts gathered around him, It wasn't from illness's effects. No whooping-cough afflicted him, Nor measles with their spots; These did not harm the respected name Of Stephen Dowling Bots. Unrequited love did not strike with sorrow That head of curly hair, Nor did stomach problems bring him low, Young Stephen Dowling Bots. Oh no. Then listen with tearful eyes, While I tell you his destiny. His soul departed this cold world By falling down a well. They pulled him out and drained him; Alas, it was too late; His spirit had left to soar high In the realms of the good and great. If Emmeline Grangerford could write poetry like that before she was fourteen, there's no telling what she might have accomplished later on. Buck said she could produce poetry effortlessly. She never had to pause to think. He said she would quickly write a line, and if she couldn't find something to rhyme with it, she would just cross it out, write another one, and continue. She wasn't picky; she could write about any topic you suggested, as long as it was sad. Every time someone died—man, woman, or child—she would be ready with her 'tribute' even before the body was cold. She called them tributes. The neighbors had a saying: first the doctor, then Emmeline, then the undertaker. The undertaker only arrived before Emmeline once, and that was because she struggled to find a rhyme for the deceased person's name, which was Whistler. She was never quite the same after that; she never complained, but she seemed to decline and didn't live much longer. Poor girl, many times I made myself go up to her old room, take out her worn scrapbook, and read it when her pictures had gotten on my nerves and made me feel a bit resentful towards her. I was fond of that whole family, including the deceased members, and I wasn't going to let anything create distance between us. Poor Emmeline wrote poetry about all the dead people while she was alive, and it didn't seem right that no one was there to write something about her now that she was gone. So, I tried hard to compose a verse or two myself, but I just couldn't make it work. They kept Emmeline's room neat and tidy, with everything arranged just the way she liked it when she was alive, and no one ever slept there. The old lady, Mrs. Grangerford, took care of the room herself, even though they had many enslaved people. She spent a good deal of time sewing and mostly reading her Bible in that room.",

Another drawing featured a young lady with her hair tied up high, crying into a handkerchief and holding a dead bird in the other hand, with the words, 'I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.' A third showed a lady looking sadly out a window at the moon, tears on her cheeks, holding an open letter sealed with black wax, and pressing a locket to her lips. The caption for this was, 'And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.' I suppose they were fine pictures, but I couldn’t ever get comfortable with them—they always unsettled me when I was feeling down. Everyone was saddened by her death because she had planned to create even more of these pictures, and you could see from her work what had been lost. Still, I thought maybe, given her temperament, she was happier in the cemetery. The picture she was working on when she fell ill was supposed to be her masterpiece. She prayed night and day to finish it, but didn’t live to see it done. It was of a young woman in a white gown, standing on a bridge rail, ready to jump, with her hair down her back, looking up at the moon, and crying.

She was never quite the same after that; she didn’t complain, but faded away and didn’t live much longer. Many times, when her pictures annoyed me and I was irritated with her, I’d go up to her old room and read her scrapbook. I liked the Grangerfords, living and dead, and wouldn’t let anything come between us. Poor Emmeline wrote poems for all the dead people, and it didn’t feel right that no one wrote one for her when she died. I tried to come up with a poem myself but couldn’t manage it.

He was well born, as the saying is, and that’s worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn’t no more quality than a mudcat himself. Col. Grangerford was very tall and very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it anywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you, as you may say. His forehead was high, and his hair was black and straight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it; and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it. He carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it. There warn’t no frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn’t ever loud. He was as kind as he could be—you could feel that, you know, and so you had confidence. Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first, and find out what the matter was afterwards. He didn’t ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners—everybody was always good-mannered where he was. Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine most always—I mean he made it seem like good weather. When he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was enough; there wouldn’t nothing go wrong again for a week.\nWhen him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got up out of their chairs and give them good-day, and didn’t set down again till they had set down. Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where the decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him, and he held it in his hand and waited till Tom’s and Bob’s was mixed, and then they bowed and said, “Our duty to you, sir, and madam;” and they bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank, all three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, and give it to me and Buck, and we drank to the old people too.\nBob was the oldest and Tom next—tall, beautiful men with very broad shoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes. They dressed in white linen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, and wore broad Panama hats.\nThen there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall and proud and grand, but as good as she could be when she warn’t stirred up; but when she was, she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks, like her father. She was beautiful.\nSo was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind. She was gentle and sweet like a dove, and she was only twenty.\nEach person had their own nigger to wait on them—Buck too. My nigger had a monstrous easy time, because I warn’t used to having anybody do anything for me, but Buck’s was on the jump most of the time.\nThis was all there was of the family now, but there used to be more—three sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died.\nThe old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers. Sometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten or fifteen mile around, and stay five or six days, and have such junketings round about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the woods daytimes, and balls at the house nights. These people was mostly kinfolks of the family. The men brought their guns with them. It was a handsome lot of quality, I tell you.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Colonel Grangerford was undoubtedly a gentleman, refined in every aspect, as was his entire family. He was, as the saying goes, well-born, a quality valued as much in a man as in a horse, according to Widow Douglas, who was universally acknowledged as being of the highest social standing in our town. My own father also affirmed this, despite having no more inherent nobility than a mudcat himself. Colonel Grangerford was exceptionally tall and thin, with a rather pale complexion lacking any trace of color. He was cleanly shaven daily across his slender face. His lips and nostrils were remarkably thin, his nose high, his eyebrows heavy, and his eyes intensely black, set so deeply that they seemed to peer out from within hollows. His forehead was high, and his straight black hair hung to his shoulders. His hands were long and slender. Every day, he wore a fresh, spotless suit of linen so white it was blinding, and on Sundays, he donned a blue tail-coat with brass buttons. He carried a mahogany cane topped with silver. There was absolutely nothing frivolous about him, nor was he ever loud. He possessed an undeniable kindness, which inspired confidence. His occasional smiles were pleasant to behold, but when he stood erect like a flagpole and the intensity flared in his eyes, one immediately felt the urge to retreat to safety, investigating the cause later. He never had to instruct anyone on proper behavior; everyone was always well-mannered in his presence. Everyone also enjoyed having him around; he was generally cheerful, making it feel like good weather. When he became stern, it was brief but impactful, ensuring perfect order for a week. In the mornings, when he and his wife came downstairs, the whole family rose from their chairs to greet them and remained standing until they were seated. Then, Tom and Bob went to the sideboard, mixed a glass of bitters for him, and waited to mix their own. After their drinks were ready, they bowed and offered a formal greeting to both the Colonel and his wife, who acknowledged them with a slight bow and a thank you. All three then drank. Bob and Tom would add a small amount of water to the sugar and spirits at the bottom of their glasses for Buck and me, and we would also drink a toast to the older couple. Bob was the eldest son, followed by Tom – both tall, handsome men with broad shoulders, dark complexions, long black hair, and black eyes. They dressed entirely in white linen, like their father, and wore wide-brimmed Panama hats. Next was Miss Charlotte, twenty-five years old, tall, proud, and dignified, though she could be very kind when calm. However, when angered, her expression was severe enough to make you shrivel, just like her father's. She was beautiful. Her sister, Miss Sophia, was also beautiful but in a different manner. She was twenty and had the gentle, sweet nature of a dove. Each person had their own enslaved attendant; Buck had one too. My attendant had a very easy time, as I wasn't accustomed to being served, but Buck's attendant was constantly busy. This was the extent of the immediate family then, but they had previously had three other sons who were killed, and a daughter named Emmeline who died. The Colonel owned numerous farms and over a hundred enslaved people. Sometimes, many guests would arrive on horseback from ten or fifteen miles away and stay for five or six days, enjoying various social gatherings, including river excursions, dances, daytime picnics in the woods, and evening balls at the house. These guests were mostly relatives. The men always brought their firearms. They were, truly, a fine assembly of people of high standing.",

He came from a good family, as people would say, and according to the Widow Douglas, that kind of background was just as important in a man as it is in a horse. Everyone agreed she belonged to the highest social class in town, and even my father insisted on that, despite not being high-class himself. Colonel Grangerford was very tall and slim, had a pale, almost grayish complexion, and no trace of red in his skin. He shaved his lean face every morning, had very thin lips and nostrils, a prominent nose, bushy eyebrows, and deep-set, jet-black eyes that seemed to look at you from deep inside his head. He had a high forehead, straight black hair down to his shoulders, and long, thin hands. Every day, he wore a clean shirt and a full white linen suit so bright it hurt your eyes, and on Sundays, he dressed in a blue tailcoat with shiny brass buttons. He carried a mahogany walking stick topped with silver. He wasn’t frivolous or loud at all. He was as kind as anyone could be—you could just sense it, and so people trusted him. Sometimes he’d smile, which was wonderful, but if he straightened up and his eyes flashed beneath his thick eyebrows, you knew something was wrong and wanted to get away until you found out what it was. He never needed to remind anyone to behave—everyone was polite in his presence. Everyone liked having him around; he brought a cheerful atmosphere, like good weather. If he ever did become cross, it was brief but made a real impression—afterward, everything would go smoothly for a week. In the mornings, when he and his wife came down, the whole family stood to greet them and wouldn’t sit until they had. Then Tom and Bob mixed drinks at the sideboard, offered one to the Colonel, and waited to mix their own. After exchanging polite toasts, they sipped together; then Tom and Bob prepared diluted drinks for me and Buck, and together we toasted the old couple. Bob was the oldest son, with Tom next—both tall, handsome, broad-shouldered, with tan faces and long black hair and eyes, always dressed in white linen and Panama hats. Miss Charlotte, their 25-year-old sister, was also tall, proud, striking, and could be intimidating like her father, but she was very kind when calm. Her younger sister, Miss Sophia, was beautiful in her own gentle and sweet way, only twenty. Each family member had their own servant—Buck included. My servant did very little, since I wasn’t used to being waited on, but Buck’s was always busy. The family was smaller now, since three of the sons had died, as had Emmeline. The Colonel owned several farms and over a hundred slaves. Often, lots of relatives would visit from miles away—staying for days, enjoying parties, river outings, picnics in the woods by day, and balls at night. The visitors, mostly family, always brought guns and were quite distinguished in appearance."

We was crossing the road. Buck says:\n“Quick! Jump for the woods!”\nWe done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves. Pretty soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road, setting his horse easy and looking like a soldier. He had his gun across his pommel. I had seen him before. It was young Harney Shepherdson. I heard Buck’s gun go off at my ear, and Harney’s hat tumbled off from his head. He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was hid. But we didn’t wait. We started through the woods on a run. The woods warn’t thick, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet, and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun; and then he rode away the way he come—to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn’t see.

They always take advantage.”\nMiss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was telling his tale, and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped.

They were considered just as high-class, well-bred, wealthy, and distinguished as the Grangerford clan. Both the Shepherdsons and the Grangerfords utilized the same steamboat dock, located about two miles upstream from our place. Consequently, when I occasionally accompanied some of our people there, I would sometimes see several Shepherdsons arriving on their fine horses. One day, while Buck and I were deep in the woods hunting, we heard the sound of a horse approaching just as we were crossing the road. Buck immediately instructed me, \"Quick! Get into the woods!\" We did as he said, then cautiously peeked out from behind the trees through the leaves. Soon after, a handsome young man came riding by at a gallop. He sat his horse easily and had a military bearing, with his gun resting across the front of his saddle. I recognized him; it was young Harney Shepherdson. I heard Buck's gun fire right beside my ear, and Harney's hat flew off his head. He quickly grabbed his own gun and rode directly towards our hiding spot. However, we didn't wait around. We took off running through the woods. Since the woods weren't very dense, I was able to look back over my shoulder to try and avoid any shots, and I saw Harney aim his gun at Buck twice before he turned around and rode back the way he came – I guessed he was going to retrieve his hat, but I couldn't be sure. We didn't stop running until we reached home. My grandfather's eyes flashed for a moment – it seemed to be mostly from satisfaction, I thought – then his expression softened somewhat, and he said gently, \"I don't approve of shooting from concealment. Why didn't you confront him in the road, my boy?\" Buck replied, \"The Shepherdsons don't do that, father. They always take the unfair advantage.\" Miss Charlotte held her head high like a queen as Buck recounted the event, her nostrils flaring and her eyes sparking.

Suddenly, Buck fired his gun next to my ear, knocking Harney's hat off. Harney snatched his gun and rode straight toward where we were hiding, but we didn’t hang around—we ran off through the woods. The trees weren't dense, so as I ran, I glanced back to avoid bullets and saw Harney aim his gun at Buck twice. Then he turned back, probably to retrieve his hat, though I couldn’t be sure. We didn’t stop running until we were safely home. When we got there, the old gentleman looked at us with flashing eyes—mostly out of excitement, I thought—then calmed down and gently asked, \"I don’t approve of shooting from hiding.

He never did anything to me personally.\" So I pressed, \"Well, why did you want to kill him then?\" Buck replied, \"Oh, for no personal reason—it's just because of the feud.\" I was unfamiliar with the term and asked, \"What's a feud?\" He sounded surprised, \"What kind of place were you raised in? You don't know what a feud is?\" \"No, never heard of it before—tell me about it,\" I urged. Buck explained, \"Okay, a feud works like this: One man gets into a dispute with another man and kills him; then that man's brother kills the first man; then the other brothers from both sides start going after each other; then the cousins get involved—and eventually, everyone ends up dead, and there's no feud left. But it's a pretty slow process and takes a long time.\" I asked if this particular feud had been going on for a while. Buck exclaimed, \"You bet! It began about thirty years ago, or somewhere around then. There was some kind of problem, followed by a lawsuit to settle it; and the suit didn't go in favor of one of the men, so he went ahead and shot the man who won the suit—which, naturally, he would do.

He said, \"Oh, yes, my dad knows, I think, and some of the other older folks; but even they don't remember what the initial argument was about.\" Curious about the casualties, I asked, \"Have many people been killed, Buck?\" He confirmed, \"Yes; quite a good number of funerals. But they don't always kill. My dad got some buckshot in him; but he doesn't mind it much because he doesn't weigh a lot anyway. Bob's been cut up a bit with a knife, and Tom's been injured once or twice.\" I inquired about recent deaths, \"Has anyone been killed this year, Buck?\" He replied, \"Yes; we killed one of theirs, and they killed one of ours. About three months ago, my cousin Bud, who was fourteen years old, was riding through the woods on the other side of the river. He didn't have a weapon with him, which was really foolish. In a lonely spot, he heard a horse coming up behind him and saw Old Baldy Shepherdson chasing him with his gun in his hand and his white hair flying. Instead of jumping off and running into the bushes, Bud thought he could outrun him. So they raced, neck and neck, for five miles or more, with the old man gaining the whole time. Finally, Bud realized it was no use, so he stopped and turned around so he'd get shot in the front, you know. The old man rode up and shot him dead. But he didn't get to enjoy his success for long, because our family killed him within a week.\" I commented, \"I imagine that old man was a coward, Buck.\" Buck strongly disagreed, \"I don't think he was a coward at all. Not in the slightest. There isn't a coward among any of the Shepherdsons—not one. And there aren't any cowards among the Grangerfords either. Why, that old man held his own in a fight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords, and he came out the winner. They were all on horseback; he got off his horse and hid behind a small pile of wood, keeping his horse in front of him to block bullets. But the Grangerfords stayed on their horses, circling around the old man, shooting at him, and he shot back at them. He and his horse both went home pretty beat up and hurt, but the Grangerfords had to be carried home—and one of them was dead, and another died the next day. No, sir; if someone is looking for cowards, they shouldn't waste any time with the Shepherdsons, because they don't produce that kind of person.\"",

Buck said that the man hadn’t done anything to him at all. So I wanted to know why he wanted to kill him, and Buck said it was just because of the feud. I asked what a feud was, and Buck was surprised I didn’t know. He explained that a feud starts when one man has a fight with another and kills him, then the dead man’s brother kills the first man, and so it goes, with their brothers and then cousins getting involved, until so many are killed that there’s no one left to keep the feud going. He said it could last a long time. I asked if this feud had been going on for long, and Buck said it had been for about thirty years. There was a disagreement about something and a lawsuit, which one side lost; so that loser shot the winner, which Buck thought was a natural thing to do. I asked what the original disagreement was about—maybe land? Buck didn’t know. He didn’t know who did the first shooting, whether it was a Grangerford or a Shepherdson, because it happened so long ago. Some of the older folks might remember, but even they’d forgotten what started it. I wanted to know if many people had been killed, and Buck answered that there had been a good number of funerals, but sometimes people just got wounded, like his father who had some buckshot in him and his brothers who had been hurt with knives or other ways. I asked if anyone had been killed this year. Buck said yes, both sides had lost one recently. He told me his cousin Bud, only fourteen, had been riding alone without a weapon and was chased by old Baldy Shepherdson, who caught up and shot Bud dead when he couldn’t outrun him. But Baldy was killed by Buck’s family a week later. I wondered if Baldy was a coward, but Buck insisted none of the Shepherdsons or the Grangerfords were cowards. He described a fight where Baldy fought three Grangerfords by himself and won. Baldy had used his horse for cover and shot at the Grangerfords until they had to be carried home, badly wounded or dead, though Baldy and his horse were also injured. Buck finished by saying that if anyone was looking for cowards, they wouldn’t find any among the Shepherdsons or the Grangerfords."

It was pretty ornery preaching—all about brotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it was a good sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such a powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and preforeordestination, and I don’t know what all, that it did seem to me to be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet.\nAbout an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in their chairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull. Buck and a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep. I went up to our room, and judged I would take a nap myself. I found that sweet Miss Sophia standing in her door, which was next to ours, and she took me in her room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I liked her, and I said I did; and she asked me if I would do something for her and not tell anybody, and I said I would. Then she said she’d forgot her Testament, and left it in the seat at church between two other books, and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her, and not say nothing to nobody. I said I would. So I slid out and slipped off up the road, and there warn’t anybody at the church, except maybe a hog or two, for there warn’t any lock on the door, and hogs likes a puncheon floor in summer-time because it’s cool. If you notice, most folks don’t go to church only when they’ve got to; but a hog is different.\nSays I to myself, something’s up; it ain’t natural for a girl to be in such a sweat about a Testament. So I give it a shake, and out drops a little piece of paper with “Half-past two” wrote on it with a pencil. I ransacked it, but couldn’t find anything else. I couldn’t make anything out of that, so I put the paper in the book again, and when I got home and upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me. She pulled me in and shut the door; then she looked in the Testament till she found the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad; and before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and said I was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody. She was mighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted up, and it made her powerful pretty. I was a good deal astonished, but when I got my breath I asked her what the paper was about, and she asked me if I had read it, and I said no, and she asked me if I could read writing, and I told her “no, only coarse-hand,” and then she said the paper warn’t anything but a book-mark to keep her place, and I might go and play now.",

The sermon wasn't great, mostly boring talk about brotherly love. But everyone claimed it was wonderful and discussed faith, good deeds, grace, predestination, and all sorts of other things endlessly on the way home. To me, it felt like one of the most unpleasant Sundays I'd experienced. About an hour after lunch, everyone was resting or napping around the house. Buck and a dog were asleep on the grass in the sun. I decided to go up to my room to take a nap too. As I got there, I saw the lovely Miss Sophia standing at her doorway, which was right next to ours. She pulled me gently into her room, closed the door quietly, and asked if I liked her. I said I did. Then she asked if I would do something for her secretly. I said I would. She explained that she'd left her Testament Bible at church, stuck between two other books on the seat, and asked if I would slip out unnoticed, go get it for her, and not mention it to anyone. I told her I would. So, I quietly went outside and headed up the road. The church was deserted, except maybe for a hog or two, since there was no lock on the door and pigs enjoy the cool wooden floor in the summertime. Most people only go to church when they feel obligated to, but hogs seem to appreciate it for other reasons. I thought to myself, something's strange; it's not normal for a girl to be so worried about a Bible. So, I gave it a shake, and a small piece of paper with \"Half-past two\" written on it in pencil fell out. I checked the rest of the book but didn't find anything else. I didn't understand the note at all, so I put the paper back inside. When I got home and upstairs, Miss Sophia was waiting for me at her door. She quickly pulled me inside and shut the door. Then she looked through the Testament until she found the paper. As soon as she read it, she looked relieved and happy. Before I knew it, she hugged me tightly, told me I was the best boy ever, and reminded me not to tell anyone. For a moment, her face was very red, and her eyes sparkled, which made her look really beautiful. I was quite surprised, but once I caught my breath, I asked her what the paper was about. She asked if I had read it, and I said no. She then asked if I could read cursive writing. I told her I could only read print (\"coarse-hand\").

He oughter know a body don’t love water-moccasins enough to go around hunting for them. What is he up to, anyway? So I says:\n“All right; trot ahead.”\nI followed a half a mile; then he struck out over the swamp, and waded ankle deep as much as another half-mile.

He should know no one likes water-moccasins enough to go looking for them. What was he planning? So I replied, \"Alright; lead the way.\" I followed for half a mile; then he headed across the swamp, wading ankle-deep for another half-mile. We reached a small, dry area that was very thick with trees, bushes, and vines. He said, \"Just push in there a few steps, Master George; that's where they are. I've seen them before; I don't care to see them anymore.\" Then he quickly splashed away and left, and the trees hid him from view. I cautiously entered the area a bit and found a small open space, about the size of a bedroom, surrounded by vines. A man was lying there asleep—and, by golly, it was my old Jim! I woke him up, expecting him to be totally surprised to see me again, but he wasn't. He was so happy he almost cried, but not surprised. He said he had swum along behind me that night and heard me yell every time, but didn't dare answer because he didn't want anyone to capture him and make him a slave again. He said, \"I got hurt a little and couldn't swim fast, so I was quite a ways behind you towards the end. When you landed, I thought I could catch up to you on land without having to shout, but when I saw that house, I started moving slowly. I was too far away to hear what they said to you—I was afraid of the dogs. But when it was all quiet again, I knew you were in the house, so I went into the woods to wait for daybreak. Early in the morning, some of the enslaved people going to the fields came along. They took me and showed me this place, where the dogs can't track me because of the water. They bring me food every night and tell me how you're getting along.\" \"Why didn't you tell my Jack to bring me here sooner, Jim?\" \"Well, there was no point disturbing you, Huck, until we could actually do something—but we're all set now. I've been buying pots and pans and food whenever I got a chance, and fixing up the raft at night when—\" \"What raft, Jim?\" \"Our old raft.\" \"Are you saying our old raft wasn't completely destroyed?\" \"No, it wasn't. It was pretty torn up—one end was. But there wasn't major damage, only most of our belongings were lost. If we hadn't dived so deep and swum so far underwater, and if the night hadn't been so dark, and if we hadn't been so scared and foolish, as they say, we would have seen the raft. But it's just as well we didn't, because now it's all repaired, almost good as new, and we've got new things to replace what was lost.\" \"Wow, how did you get the raft back, Jim—did you catch it?\" \"How could I catch it when I was out in the woods? No; some of the enslaved people found it caught on a snag around here in the bend. They hid it in a small creek among the willows. They were arguing so much about which one of them it belonged to that I heard about it pretty soon. So I came and settled the argument by telling them it didn't belong to any of them, but to you and me. And I asked them if they were going to steal a young white gentleman's property and get a beating for it. Then I gave them ten cents each, and they were very pleased. They wished more rafts would come along and make them rich again. These enslaved people are very good to me, and whatever I want them to do for me, I don't have to ask them twice, dear. That Jack is a good worker, and pretty smart.\" \"Yes, he is. He never told me you were here; he just told me to come, and he'd show me a lot of water-moccasins.

De women folks has gone for to stir up de relations, en ole Mars Saul en de boys tuck dey guns en rode up de river road for to try to ketch dat young man en kill him ’fo’ he kin git acrost de river wid Miss Sophia. I reck’n dey’s gwyne to be mighty rough times.”\n“Buck went off ’thout waking me up.”\n“Well, I reck’n he did! Dey warn’t gwyne to mix you up in it. Mars Buck he loaded up his gun en ’lowed he’s gwyne to fetch home a Shepherdson or bust. Well, dey’ll be plenty un ’m dah, I reck’n, en you bet you he’ll fetch one ef he gits a chanst.”\nI took up the river road as hard as I could put. By-and-by I begin to hear guns a good ways off. When I come in sight of the log store and the woodpile where the steamboats lands, I worked along under the trees and brush till I got to a good place, and then I clumb up into the forks of a cottonwood that was out of reach, and watched. There was a wood-rank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree, and first I was going to hide behind that; but maybe it was luckier I didn’t.\nThere was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open place before the log store, cussing and yelling, and trying to get at a couple of young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of the steamboat landing; but they couldn’t come it. Every time one of them showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at. The two boys was squatting back to back behind the pile, so they could watch both ways.\nBy-and-by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling. They started riding towards the store; then up gets one of the boys, draws a steady bead over the wood-rank, and drops one of them out of his saddle. All the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started to carry him to the store; and that minute the two boys started on the run. They got half way to the tree I was in before the men noticed. Then the men see them, and jumped on their horses and took out after them. They gained on the boys, but it didn’t do no good, the boys had too good a start; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree, and slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the men again. One of the boys was Buck, and the other was a slim young chap about nineteen years old.\nThe men ripped around awhile, and then rode away. As soon as they was out of sight I sung out to Buck and told him. He didn’t know what to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first. He was awful surprised. He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the men come in sight again; said they was up to some devilment or other—wouldn’t be gone long. I wished I was out of that tree, but I dasn’t come down. Buck begun to cry and rip, and ’lowed that him and his cousin Joe (that was the other young chap) would make up for this day yet. He said his father and his two brothers was killed, and two or three of the enemy. Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in ambush. Buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for their relations—the Shepherdsons was too strong for them. I asked him what was become of young Harney and Miss Sophia. He said they’d got across the river and was safe. I was glad of that; but the way Buck did take on because he didn’t manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him—I hain’t ever heard anything like it.\nAll of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three or four guns—the men had slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their horses! The boys jumped for the river—both of them hurt—and as they swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and singing out, “Kill them, kill them!” It made me so sick I most fell out of the tree. I ain’t a-going to tell all that happened—it would make me sick again if I was to do that. I wished I hadn’t ever come ashore that night to see such things. I ain’t ever going to get shut of them—lots of times I dream about them.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I don't want to talk much about what happened the next day. I'll make it brief. I woke up around dawn and was about to turn over and go back to sleep when I noticed how unusually quiet it was—nobody seemed to be moving. That wasn't typical. Then I saw that Buck was already up and gone. So I got up, feeling curious, and went downstairs—still nobody around; everything was completely silent. It was the same outside. I thought to myself, what's going on? Down by the woodpile, I found my servant, Jack, and asked him, \"What's all this about?\" He replied, \"Don't you know, Master George?\" I said, \"No, I don't.\" He then explained, \"Well, then, Miss Sophia has run away! Yes, she has. She ran off sometime during the night—nobody knows exactly when; she ran off to marry that young Harney Shepherdson, you know—at least, that's what they suspect. The family discovered it about half an hour ago—maybe a little more—and I'm telling you, they wasted no time. You've never seen such a rush to get guns and horses ready! The women have gone to rouse the relatives, and old Master Saul and the boys took their guns and rode up the river road to try and catch that young man and kill him before he can get across the river with Miss Sophia. I expect things are going to get really violent.\" I mentioned, \"Buck left without waking me up.\" Jack said, \"Well, I bet he did! They weren't going to involve you in it. Master Buck loaded his gun and swore he was going to bring home a Shepherdson or die trying. Well, there will be plenty of them there, I reckon, and you can be sure he'll get one if he has the chance.\"\n\nI ran up the river road as fast as I could. After a while, I started hearing gunshots from a distance. When I came in sight of the log store and the woodpile where the steamboats land, I crept along under the trees and bushes until I found a good spot, and then I climbed up into the branches of a tall cottonwood tree that was out of reach and watched. There was a four-foot high stack of wood a little way in front of the tree, and at first, I thought about hiding behind that; but perhaps it was better that I didn't.\n\nThere were four or five men riding back and forth wildly on their horses in the open area before the log store, cursing and shouting, trying to get at two young fellows who were hiding behind the woodpile next to the steamboat landing; but they couldn't manage it. Every time one of them showed himself on the river side of the woodpile, he got shot at. The two boys were crouched back to back behind the pile so they could keep an eye on both directions.\n\nEventually, the men stopped riding around and yelling. They started riding towards the store; then one of the boys stood up, took careful aim over the woodpile, and shot one of the men out of his saddle. All the men jumped off their horses, grabbed the injured man, and started carrying him to the store; and at that moment, the two boys took off running. They got halfway to the tree I was in before the men noticed. Then the men saw them, jumped back on their horses, and chased after them. They were catching up to the boys, but it didn't help, the boys had too much of a head start; they reached the woodpile that was in front of my tree, and slipped in behind it, giving them the advantage over the men again. One of the boys was Buck, and the other was a thin young man about nineteen years old.\n\nThe men circled around for a bit, and then rode away. As soon as they were out of sight, I called out to Buck and told him I was there. At first, he didn't know what to make of my voice coming from the tree. He was really surprised. He told me to watch carefully and let him know when the men came back into view; he said they were planning something sneaky—they wouldn't be gone long. I wished I was out of that tree, but I didn't dare come down. Buck started crying and swearing, and said that he and his cousin Joe (that was the other young man) would get revenge for this day. He said his father and his two brothers were killed, as well as two or three of the enemy. He said the Shepherdsons ambushed them. Buck said his father and brothers should have waited for their relatives—the Shepherdsons were too strong for them. I asked him what happened to young Harney and Miss Sophia. He said they had gotten across the river and were safe. I was happy about that; but the way Buck carried on because he didn't manage to kill Harney that day when he shot at him—I've never heard anything like it.\n\nSuddenly, bang! bang! bang! three or four guns went off—the men had crept around through the woods and come in from behind without their horses! The boys scrambled towards the river—both of them were hurt—and as they swam downstream with the current, the men ran along the bank shooting at them and shouting, \"Kill them, kill them!\" It made me so sick I almost fell out of the tree. I'm not going to tell everything that happened—it would make me sick again if I did that. I wish I had never come ashore that night to see such things. I'm never going to forget them—I dream about them often.",

I woke up around dawn and was about to fall back asleep, but I noticed how unusually quiet everything was. Buck was gone when I looked for him, which was odd. I got up and went downstairs, but no one was around; the house was completely silent, as was outside. I wondered what was happening. I found Jack near the wood-pile and asked him what was going on. He told me Miss Sophia had run away overnight, most likely to marry Harney Shepherdson. The family had discovered this only about half an hour earlier and reacted immediately: guns and horses were hurriedly gathered, the women went to alert relatives, and the men, including Buck, armed themselves and chased after Harney down the river road, hoping to catch him before he and Miss Sophia could cross the river. Jack said it would probably get very rough. It turned out Buck had left without waking me because they didn’t want me involved. Buck had taken his gun and was determined to get one of the Shepherdsons. I rushed up the river road and soon started hearing gunshots in the distance. Carefully making my way to a hidden spot, I climbed a cottonwood tree to watch. In front of the log store by the steamboat landing, several men on horseback were yelling and cursing, trying to get at two young men hiding behind a woodpile, but whenever one tried, he was shot at. The two boys, crouched back-to-back, kept watch in both directions. After a while, the men rode towards the store, but one of the boys shot and hit one of them, who was then helped away by the others. The two boys took the chance to run, making it halfway to my tree before being noticed, but they managed to reach cover behind another woodpile. One of the boys was Buck, the other a slim nineteen-year-old. The men eventually gave up and left. I called to Buck from the tree, startling him, and he told me to warn them if the men returned. Buck was crying and furious, saying he and his cousin Joe would get revenge. He told me his father and brothers had been killed, as well as a few Shepherdsons, who attacked them from hiding. He thought his family should have waited for reinforcements because they were outnumbered. When I asked about Harney and Miss Sophia, Buck said they’d escaped safely across the river, which made me relieved, though Buck was upset he hadn’t managed to kill Harney earlier. Suddenly, more gunfire erupted—the men had sneaked around on foot. The boys tried to escape to the river, both hurt, while the men chased and shot at them from the bank, shouting for them to be killed. The violence made me feel sick, and I can’t bring myself to describe all of it—it haunts me whenever I think about it or dream at night."

Sometimes I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen little gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so I reckoned the trouble was still a-going on. I was mighty downhearted; so I made up my mind I wouldn’t ever go anear that house again, because I reckoned I was to blame, somehow. I judged that that piece of paper meant that Miss Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half-past two and run off; and I judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way she acted, and then maybe he would a locked her up, and this awful mess wouldn’t ever happened.\nWhen I got down out of the tree, I crept along down the river bank a piece, and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, and tugged at them till I got them ashore; then I covered up their faces, and got away as quick as I could. I cried a little when I was covering up Buck’s face, for he was mighty good to me.\nIt was just dark now. I never went near the house, but struck through the woods and made for the swamp. Jim warn’t on his island, so I tramped off in a hurry for the crick, and crowded through the willows, red-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country. The raft was gone! My souls, but I was scared! I couldn’t get my breath for most a minute. Then I raised a yell. A voice not twenty-five foot from me says:\n“Good lan’! is dat you, honey? Doan’ make no noise.”\nIt was Jim’s voice—nothing ever sounded so good before. I run along the bank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me, he was so glad to see me. He says:\n“Laws bless you, chile, I ’uz right down sho’ you’s dead agin.

Then we hung up our signal lantern, and judged that we was free and safe once more. I hadn’t had a bite to eat since yesterday, so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk, and pork and cabbage and greens—there ain’t nothing in the world so good when it’s cooked right—and whilst I eat my supper we talked, and had a good time. I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds, and so was Jim to get away from the swamp. We said there warn’t no home like a raft, after all.

Occasionally, I could hear gunshots in the distance from the woods, and twice I saw small groups of armed men on horseback race past the log store; this made me think the conflict was still happening. I was very disheartened and decided I would never go near that house again, because I felt I was somehow responsible. I figured that note meant Miss Sophia was planning to meet Harney somewhere at 2:30 and run away; I believed I should have told her father about the paper and her strange behavior, and maybe then he would have locked her up, preventing this terrible situation from ever occurring.\n\nWhen I got down from the tree, I crept along the riverbank for a while and found the two bodies lying at the water's edge.

Then we set out the lines. Next we slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool off; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee deep, and watched the daylight come. Not a sound anywheres—perfectly still—just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs a-cluttering, maybe.

As soon as night was nearly over, we would stop navigating and tie up, almost always in the calm water behind a sandbar or small island. Then we'd cut down young cottonwood and willow branches to conceal the raft. Afterward, we would set out our fishing lines. Next, we'd slip into the river for a swim to cool off and feel refreshed.

You could see small dark shapes drifting far away, such as trading scows and similar vessels, and long black lines that were rafts. Sometimes you could hear a sweep oar creaking, or jumbled voices, because it was so quiet and sounds carried so far. After a while, you could spot a disturbance on the water's surface—a ripple or streak that showed there was a hidden snag (a submerged log) in a swift current that broke over it. And you would see the mist curl up from the water, and the eastern sky would turn red, as would the river. You might make out a log cabin at the edge of the woods on the far bank of the river, probably a woodyard, likely piled so poorly by dishonest dealers that you could throw a dog through it anywhere. Then a pleasant breeze would spring up, fanning you from that side, so cool, fresh, and sweet-smelling due to the woods and flowers. But sometimes it wasn't like that, because they might have left dead fish lying around, like gars and other species, and they certainly could smell quite bad. And then you'd have the full day, with everything bright in the sun, and the songbirds singing heartily! A little smoke wouldn't attract attention now, so we would take some fish off the lines and cook a hot breakfast. And afterward, we would observe the quiet isolation of the river, and just take it easy, and eventually drift off to sleep.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "A few days and nights passed by quickly and peacefully; it felt as though time flowed like the river—slow, calm, and pleasant. This is how we spent those days: the river was huge, sometimes over a mile wide. We traveled at night and hid during the day. Right before morning, we would stop moving and tie up the raft, usually in the still water behind a small island. Then we’d cut young cottonwood and willow branches to cover and hide the raft. After that, we’d set out our fishing lines. Then we’d slip into the river for a swim to feel refreshed and cool. Sitting in the shallow water on the sandy river bottom, we’d watch the sunrise. Everything was so quiet, the world seemed to be asleep—except for the occasional sound of bullfrogs. The first thing we’d see was a faint line across the water, which was the trees on the far shore; nothing else was visible at first. Then the sky would get lighter, spreading across the horizon; the river would go from black to gray; now and then, we could spot dark shapes far off—trading boats and rafts. Sometimes we heard oar blades or voices, because the silence let sounds carry. We’d notice a streak on the water, which told us there was a snag in the current, breaking the water and causing that mark. Mist would rise off the water, and the eastern sky would turn red. We might spot a log cabin at the edge of the woods on the far bank, probably a woodyard, with the wood piled up poorly. A nice breeze would often blow across the river, cool and fresh from the woods and flowers, though sometimes it smelled bad from dead fish left behind. As the day began in full, the sun made everything look bright and cheerful, and birds sang loudly. By then, we could cook some fish for breakfast without worrying about our fire being seen, and afterwards, we’d gaze at the vast, empty river and relax, eventually drifting off to sleep."

Next you’d see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on it chopping, because they’re most always doing it on a raft; you’d see the axe flash and come down—you don’t hear nothing; you see that axe go up again, and by the time it’s above the man’s head then you hear the k’chunk!—it had took all that time to come over the water. So we would put in the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness. Once there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beating tin pans so the steamboats wouldn’t run over them. A scow or a raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and laughing—heard them plain; but we couldn’t see no sign of them; it made you feel crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air. Jim said he believed it was spirits; but I says:\n“No; spirits wouldn’t say, ‘Dern the dern fog.’”\nSoon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about the middle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted her to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and talked about all kinds of things—we was always naked, day and night, whenever the mosquitoes would let us—the new clothes Buck’s folks made for me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn’t go much on clothes, nohow.\nSometimes we’d have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest time. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybe a spark—which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on the water you could see a spark or two—on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts. It’s lovely to live on a raft. We had the sky up there, all speckled with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened. Jim he allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I judged it would have took too long to make so many. Jim said the moon could a laid them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn’t say nothing against it, because I’ve seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it could be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them streak down. Jim allowed they’d got spoiled and was hove out of the nest.\nOnce or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out of her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful pretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and her powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by-and-by her waves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle the raft a bit, and after that you wouldn’t hear nothing for you couldn’t tell how long, except maybe frogs or something.\nAfter midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or three hours the shores was black—no more sparks in the cabin windows. These sparks was our clock—the first one that showed again meant morning was coming, so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "We would eventually wake up and look around to see what caused the noise. Sometimes it was a steamboat chugging upstream, so far off towards the opposite bank that you could only tell if it had a stern wheel or side wheels, but nothing else. After that, there would be nothing to hear or see for about an hour—just complete isolation. Next, you might spot a raft gliding by far away in the distance, perhaps with a person on it chopping wood, as they often do on rafts. You'd see the axe flash and come down, but wouldn't hear anything; then you'd see the axe go up again, and by the time it was above the person's head, you'd finally hear the 'k'chunk!' sound—it took that long for the sound to travel across the water. That's how we'd spend the day, relaxing and listening to the quiet. One time, there was a thick fog, and the rafts and other vessels passing by were banging on tin pans to warn steamboats not to run them over. A scow or raft passed so close that we could clearly hear the people talking, cussing, and laughing, yet we couldn't see any sign of them. It gave you a creepy feeling, like spirits were carrying on in the air. Jim thought they were spirits, but I argued, 'No, spirits wouldn't say things like 'Dern the dern fog.' As soon as night fell, we would push off from shore. Once we were about in the middle of the river, we'd stop paddling and let the current carry us wherever it wanted. Then we'd light our pipes, dangle our legs in the water, and talk about various things. We were always naked, day and night, unless the mosquitoes were too bad; the new clothes Buck's family made for me were too nice to be comfortable, and I didn't care much for clothes anyway. Sometimes we'd have the entire river to ourselves for a long stretch of time. Across the water, there were the banks and islands, and maybe a tiny light, which was a candle in a cabin window. Occasionally, you could see a light or two on the water itself, from a raft or a scow, and perhaps hear fiddle music or singing coming from one of those boats. Living on a raft is wonderful. We had the sky above, full of stars, and we'd lie on our backs looking up at them, discussing whether they were created or just happened. Jim believed they were made, but I thought they just happened, figuring it would take too long to make so many. Jim suggested the moon might have laid them, which seemed somewhat plausible to me, so I didn't disagree, especially since I'd seen a frog lay almost as many eggs, proving it was possible. We also used to watch shooting stars streak across the sky. Jim believed they had gone bad and were thrown out of the nest. Once or twice at night, we would see a steamboat silently moving in the dark, and every so often it would shoot a huge cloud of sparks from its chimneys, which would rain down onto the river and look incredibly beautiful. Then it would round a bend, its lights would vanish, its engine noise would stop, and the river would become still again. Eventually, its waves would reach us, long after the boat was gone, causing the raft to rock slightly. After that, you wouldn't hear anything for an unknown amount of time, except maybe frogs or other sounds. After midnight, the people on shore went to bed, and for two or three hours, the riverbanks were dark with no lights in the cabin windows. These lights served as our clock; the first one that reappeared meant morning was approaching, so we'd immediately find a place to hide and tie up.",

Then, for about an hour, everything would be completely quiet and empty—just pure loneliness. Eventually, a raft might drift by in the distance with a man on it chopping wood, as men on rafts usually do; you’d see the axe rise and fall and catch the glint of the blade, but you wouldn’t hear anything until, after a delay, the sound of the chop would reach you—it took that long to travel across the water. The days passed like this: lounging around, listening to the silence. Once, a dense fog rolled in, and the rafts passing by beat on tin pans so steamboats wouldn’t hit them. Sometimes a raft or a scow would go by so near we could hear the men talking, swearing, and laughing clearly without being able to see them at all—it was as if ghosts were making noise in the mist. Jim thought they might actually be spirits; but I told him, “No, spirits don’t say ‘Darn the fog.’” As soon as it got dark, we’d set out; when we got to the middle of the river, we’d just let the current take us wherever it would.

I was a favorite among the women, both young and old, because I was really giving the drinkers a hard time, and I was making good money, sometimes five or six dollars a night – charging ten cents per person, but children and Black people got in free – and the business was constantly getting better. However, somehow a rumor circulated last night that I had a habit of secretly drinking from a private bottle. A Black person woke me up this morning and informed me that people were quietly gathering with their dogs and horses. They were planning to arrive soon, give me about a thirty-minute head start, and then chase me down if possible. If they caught me, they would definitely tar and feather me and carry me out of town on a wooden rail. I didn't even wait for breakfast; I wasn't hungry.'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "One of the men looked to be about seventy years old or older. He was bald, with very gray facial hair, and he wore a battered, floppy hat. His clothing consisted of a greasy blue wool shirt, ragged blue jeans tucked into his boots, and a single home-made suspender. He carried an old, long-tailed blue jean coat with shiny brass buttons on his arm. Both he and the other man had large, shabby looking carpetbags with them.\n\nThe other man was around thirty, and his clothes were just as shabby. After breakfast, we all rested and chatted, and soon learned that these two fellows were not previously acquainted.\n\nThe older, bald man asked the younger one what had gotten him in trouble. The younger replied that he had been selling a product to remove tartar from teeth—which did work, but usually removed the enamel too. He had stayed in town one night too many, and as he was trying to sneak away, he met the older man on the trail. The older man warned him that people were after him and asked for help to escape. The younger man said he was also expecting trouble, so they decided to leave together. \n\nThen the older man told his story: he had been running a small temperance meeting for a week, popular with women for being harsh on the local drunks. He made five or six dollars each night by charging ten cents admission, though kids and black people got in free. Business was increasing, but a rumor spread that he secretly drank from his own jug. That morning, a black man woke him up to warn him that people were secretly gathering with dogs and horses to chase him out. They would give him half an hour to escape, then try to catch him, and if they did, they’d tar and feather him and parade him on a rail. He said he didn’t wait for breakfast since he wasn’t hungry."

I don’t blame you, gentlemen—far from it; I don’t blame anybody. I deserve it all. Let the cold world do its worst; one thing I know—there’s a grave somewhere for me. The world may go on just as it’s always done, and take everything from me—loved ones, property, everything; but it can’t take that. Some day I’ll lie down in it and forget it all, and my poor broken heart will be at rest.” He went on a-wiping.\n“Drot your pore broken heart,” says the baldhead; “what are you heaving your pore broken heart at us f’r? We hain’t done nothing.”\n“No, I know you haven’t. I ain’t blaming you, gentlemen. I brought myself down—yes, I did it myself. It’s right I should suffer—perfectly right—I don’t make any moan.”\n“Brought you down from whar? Whar was you brought down from?”\n“Ah, you would not believe me; the world never believes—let it pass—’tis no matter. The secret of my birth—”\n“The secret of your birth! Do you mean to say—”\n“Gentlemen,” says the young man, very solemn, “I will reveal it to you, for I feel I may have confidence in you. By rights I am a duke!”\nJim’s eyes bugged out when he heard that; and I reckon mine did, too. Then the baldhead says: “No! you can’t mean it?”\n“Yes. My great-grandfather, eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater, fled to this country about the end of the last century, to breathe the pure air of freedom; married here, and died, leaving a son, his own father dying about the same time. The second son of the late duke seized the titles and estates—the infant real duke was ignored. I am the lineal descendant of that infant—I am the rightful Duke of Bridgewater; and here am I, forlorn, torn from my high estate, hunted of men, despised by the cold world, ragged, worn, heart-broken, and degraded to the companionship of felons on a raft!”\nJim pitied him ever so much, and so did I. We tried to comfort him, but he said it warn’t much use, he couldn’t be much comforted; said if we was a mind to acknowledge him, that would do him more good than most anything else; so we said we would, if he would tell us how. He said we ought to bow when we spoke to him, and say “Your Grace,” or “My Lord,” or “Your Lordship”—and he wouldn’t mind it if we called him plain “Bridgewater,” which, he said, was a title anyway, and not a name; and one of us ought to wait on him at dinner, and do any little thing for him he wanted done.\nWell, that was all easy, so we done it. All through dinner Jim stood around and waited on him, and says, “Will yo’ Grace have some o’ dis or some o’ dat?” and so on, and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to him.",

What kind of work do you usually do?” The younger man listed his various trades: \"A trained printer, I also dabble a bit in patent medicines, and I'm a theater actor—tragedy, you know. I get into mesmerism and phrenology when I have the chance, sometimes teach a singing-geography school for variety, and occasionally give lectures. Basically, I do lots of things—pretty much anything convenient, as long as it's not hard labor. What's your specialty?\" The older man responded, \"I've done a fair amount of healing in my time.

Preaching is also what I do, along with running camp meetings and doing missionary work.\" There was silence for a moment, then the younger man sighed and said, \"Oh dear!\" The bald man asked, \"What are you sighing about?\" The younger man replied sadly, \"To think I've lived to lead such a life and be brought down to this kind of company.\" He started wiping the corner of his eye with a cloth. The bald man retorted sharply and somewhat stuck up, \"Damn it, isn't our company good enough for you?\" The younger man answered, \"Yes, it is good enough for me; it's exactly what I deserve, because who brought me so low when I was so high up? I did it myself. I don't blame you gentlemen—not at all; I don't blame anyone. I deserve everything that's happened. Let the cruel world do its worst; I know one thing—there's a grave waiting for me somewhere. The world can continue as it always has, and take everything from me—loved ones, possessions, everything; but it can't take that. One day I'll lie down in it and forget everything, and my poor broken heart will finally rest.\" He kept wiping his eyes. The bald man snapped, \"To hell with your 'poor broken heart'! Why are you showing off your 'poor broken heart' to us? We didn't do anything.\" \"No, I know you didn't,\" the younger man admitted. \"I'm not blaming you, gentlemen. I ruined myself—yes, I did it myself. It's only right that I suffer—perfectly right—I'm not complaining at all.\" \"Brought you down from where? Where were you brought down from?\" the bald man pressed. \"Ah, you wouldn't believe me; the world never does—let it go—it doesn't matter. The secret of my birth...\" the younger man hinted. \"The secret of your birth! Are you saying...?\" the bald man interrupted. \"Gentlemen,\" the younger man said very seriously, \"I will tell you, because I feel I can trust you. By rights, I am a duke!\" Jim's eyes popped out when he heard that, and I guess mine did too. Then the bald man said, \"No! You can't mean that?\" \"Yes,\" the younger man confirmed. \"My great-grandfather, who was the oldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater, fled to this country around the late 1700s to live freely. He married here and died, leaving a son, whose own father died about the same time. The second son of the late duke illegally seized the titles and estates—the infant who was the real duke was ignored. I am a direct descendant of that infant—I am the rightful Duke of Bridgewater! And here I am, abandoned, stripped of my high rank, hunted by people, scorned by the world, in rags, worn out, heartbroken, and reduced to keeping company with criminals on a raft!\" Jim felt extremely sorry for him, and so did I. We tried to comfort him, but he said it wasn't much help and he couldn't really be comforted. He said if we were willing to acknowledge his status, that would do him more good than almost anything else. So we agreed to, if he would tell us how. He instructed us that we should bow when we spoke to him and say \"Your Grace,\" or \"My Lord,\" or \"Your Lordship.\" He added that he wouldn't mind if we just called him \"Bridgewater,\" which he said was a title anyway, not a name. Also, one of us should wait on him during dinner and do any little things he needed. Well, that seemed easy enough, so we did it. Throughout dinner, Jim stood around and served him, asking things like, \"Will Your Grace like some of this or some of that?\" and so on, and you could see it made him very happy.",

The older man replied that he was open to it and asked what kind of work the young man usually did. The young man listed a variety of occupations—he said he was a printer by trade, also sold patent medicines, acted in theater (mainly tragedy), dabbled in mesmerism and phrenology, taught singing and geography when he could, gave lectures, and generally did any job that didn’t feel like traditional work. He then asked the older man about his line of work. The older man answered that he’d done a lot as a doctor, specializing in healing by laying on hands for things like cancer and paralysis; he claimed some fortune-telling ability (if someone else would provide him with background details), and said that preaching, working at camp meetings, and missionary work were also part of his experience.\n\nThere was a silence for a bit, after which the young man sighed and lamented his current circumstances, regretting having fallen so low in life and ending up among such company. The bald older man indignantly asked if he thought their company wasn’t good enough for him. The young man replied that he deserved his circumstances, since it was his own fault that he had fallen; he didn’t blame anyone else, but expressed a melodramatic sense of loss, saying the world could take everything but not his grave, where he would finally find peace. The older man scoffed and asked why he was lamenting to them, since they’d done nothing to harm him. The young man insisted again he didn’t blame them and accepted full responsibility for his situation.\n\nCurious, the older man asked what high position the young man had fallen from. The young man, with an air of secrecy, claimed he couldn’t reveal it easily. Then, he dramatically revealed his supposed secret: he claimed that he was by rights a duke—the rightful Duke of Bridgewater—because his great-grandfather, the eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater, had fled to America, where he died, leaving a baby son who was ignored when the title and estates were claimed by another. He claimed to be the direct descendant of the rightful heir, now reduced to misery.\n\nJim and the narrator were surprised and felt sorry for him, trying to comfort him, but the young man said he would feel better if they treated him with the respect owed to his supposed title. He instructed them to address him as \"Your Grace,\" \"My Lord,\" or \"Your Lordship,\" or simply \"Bridgewater,\" and to have one of them wait on him at meals.\n\nThey agreed to do as he asked.

Yes, gentlemen, you see before you, in blue jeans and misery, the wanderin’, exiled, trampled-on, and sufferin’ rightful King of France.”\nWell, he cried and took on so that me and Jim didn’t know hardly what to do, we was so sorry—and so glad and proud we’d got him with us, too. So we set in, like we done before with the duke, and tried to comfort him. But he said it warn’t no use, nothing but to be dead and done with it all could do him any good; though he said it often made him feel easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his rights, and got down on one knee to speak to him, and always called him “Your Majesty,” and waited on him first at meals, and didn’t set down in his presence till he asked them. So Jim and me set to majestying him, and doing this and that and t’other for him, and standing up till he told us we might set down. This done him heaps of good, and so he got cheerful and comfortable. But the duke kind of soured on him, and didn’t look a bit satisfied with the way things was going; still, the king acted real friendly towards him, and said the duke’s great-grandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good deal thought of by his father, and was allowed to come to the palace considerable; but the duke stayed huffy a good while, till by-and-by the king says:\n“Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h-yer raft, Bilgewater, and so what’s the use o’ your bein’ sour? It’ll only make things oncomfortable. It ain’t my fault I warn’t born a duke, it ain’t your fault you warn’t born a king—so what’s the use to worry? Make the best o’ things the way you find ’em, says I—that’s my motto. This ain’t no bad thing that we’ve struck here—plenty grub and an easy life—come, give us your hand, Duke, and le’s all be friends.”\nThe duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it.

Yes, gentlemen, you see before you, in blue jeans and misery, the wandering, exiled, mistreated, and suffering rightful King of France.\" Well, he cried so hard and made such a fuss that Jim and I hardly knew what to do; we felt so sorry for him—and also so glad and proud we had him with us. So we started, as we had with the duke before, trying to comfort him. But he said it was useless, that nothing but being dead and finished with everything could help him; though he said it often made him feel better for a while if people treated him properly, kneeling to speak to him, always calling him \"Your Majesty,\" serving him first at meals, and not sitting down in front of him until he gave permission. So Jim and I started treating him like royalty, doing various things for him, and standing until he allowed us to sit. This did him a lot of good, and so he became cheerful and comfortable. But the duke became rather annoyed with him and didn't look at all happy with how things were going; nevertheless, the king was very friendly towards him, and said the duke's ancestors and all the past Dukes of Bilgewater were highly regarded by his father and were often allowed at the palace; but the duke remained annoyed for some time, until eventually the king said: \"It's likely we'll be together for a long time on this raft, Bilgewater, so what's the point of you being angry? It will only make things uncomfortable. It's not my fault I wasn't born a duke, and it's not your fault you weren't born a king—so why worry? Make the best of things as you find them, I say—that's my motto. What we've found here isn't bad—plenty of food and an easy life—come on, shake my hand, Duke, and let's all be friends.\" The duke did, and Jim and I were quite glad to see it. It removed all the tension, and we felt really good about it, because it would have been awful to have any unfriendliness on the raft; because what you need most on a raft is for everyone to get along and feel good and kind towards each other.",

Later that day, he spoke up: “Listen here, Bilgewater, I feel real sorry for you, but you’re not the only one who’s had problems like that.” The duke was surprised, but the old man insisted, saying he also had been unfairly thrown from a high position and, through tears, claimed to have a secret about his birth. He asked if he could trust the duke, and the duke swore absolute loyalty. The old man then dramatically revealed, “Bilgewater, I am the lost Dauphin!” Jim and I were shocked, and the duke questioned him in disbelief. The old man pressed on, claiming to be the missing heir to the French throne—Louis the Seventeenth, son of Louis the Sixteenth and Marie Antoinette. The duke joked that he must be ancient then, but the old man swore that hardship had aged him so much. As he carried on crying about his misfortunes, Jim and I didn’t know what to do—we felt bad for him but also proud to have him aboard. We tried to comfort him, as we’d done with the duke, and he said he’d feel better if treated according to his rights: everyone should address him as “Your Majesty,” kneel when speaking, serve him first, and not sit down without his permission. Jim and I complied, and soon the old man cheered up, but the duke grew resentful and seemed unhappy with the new situation. The old man remained friendly, telling the duke his family had been welcome at the palace in the past, but the duke stayed grumpy until the old man pointed out that they would likely be together for a long time and that it was better to make the best of things. He suggested they become friends, and when the duke agreed, Jim and I were relieved—peace on the raft was important, and we were all happier when everyone got along."

Pa, he ’lowed he’d break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben, who’s got a little one-horse place on the river, forty-four mile below Orleans.

My father decided he would pack everything up and go down to live with Uncle Ben, who has a small farm on the river, forty-four miles below New Orleans. My father was quite poor and had some debts, so after he paid everything off, all he had left was sixteen dollars and our slave, Jim. That wasn't enough money to travel fourteen hundred miles, by deck passage or any other way. Well, when the river flooded one day, my father had a bit of luck; he found this piece of a raft. So we planned to go down to New Orleans on it.\" My father's luck didn't last; one night, a steamboat ran over the front corner of the raft, and we all fell overboard and dove under the paddlewheel. Jim and I came up fine, but my father was drunk, and Ike was only four years old, so they never resurfaced. For the next day or two, we had considerable trouble because people kept coming out in small boats trying to take Jim away from me, saying they believed he was a runaway slave.

I had to come up with a story, so I said, \"My family lived in Pike County, Missouri, where I was born, but now it's just me, my dad, and my brother Ike.

For the next couple of days, we had a lot of trouble because people kept coming out in boats trying to take Jim away from me, thinking he was a runaway slave.

          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "After they finished breakfast, the king pulled out a worn-out deck of cards, and he and the duke played the card game 'seven-up' for a while, betting five cents per game. When they grew tired of this, they decided they needed to 'map out a strategy,' as they put it. The duke reached into his carpet bag and pulled out several small printed flyers, reading them aloud. One advertised the 'renowned Dr. Armand de Montalban, from Paris,' who would 'lecture on the Science of Phrenology' at a specific location on a certain date, charging ten cents for admission and 'providing character analyses charts for twenty-five cents each.' The duke claimed this was one of his identities. Another flyer listed him as the 'globally recognized Shakespearean tragedian, Garrick the Younger, from Drury Lane, London.' Other flyers presented various other names and advertised impressive feats, such as finding water and gold using a 'divining rod,' 'breaking witch spells,' and similar abilities. Eventually, he remarked, 'But acting is my favorite. Have you ever performed on stage, Your Majesty?' The king replied, 'No.' 'Well, you will, within the next three days, Exiled Greatness,' said the duke. 'In the first decent town we encounter, we'll rent a hall and stage the sword fight from Richard III and the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet. How does that sound to you?' 'I'm completely on board for anything that makes money, old man; but you see, I don't know anything about acting and haven't seen much of it. I was too young when my father used to have performances at the palace. Do you think you can teach me?' 'Absolutely!' 'Alright. I'm really eager for something new anyway. Let's start right now.' So the duke proceeded to explain who Romeo and Juliet were, stating that he typically played Romeo, which meant the king could be Juliet. 'But if Juliet is a young girl, duke, my bald head and white beard might look quite strange playing her,' the king noted. 'No, don't concern yourself; these country folks won't even consider that. Besides, you'll be in costume, and that makes all the difference; Juliet is on a balcony, enjoying the moonlight before bed, wearing her nightgown and ruffled nightcap. Here are the costumes for the roles.' He took out a couple of outfits made from curtain fabric, claiming they were medieval armor for Richard III and the other character, and a long white cotton nightshirt with a matching ruffled nightcap. The king was satisfied; then the duke took out his script book and read the parts with exaggerated flair, pacing and acting simultaneously to demonstrate how it should be done; afterward, he gave the book to the king and instructed him to memorize his lines.",

Eventually, they grew bored with the card game and decided to come up with a new scheme, referring to this as 'laying out a campaign.' The duke rummaged through his carpetbag and pulled out several printed handbills, which he read aloud. One handbill announced that the renowned Dr. Armand de Montalban from Paris would give a lecture on phrenology at a certain time and place for ten cents admission, and would provide character charts for twenty-five cents each. The duke claimed this character was him. Another handbill described him as the famous Shakespearean actor, Garrick the Younger, from Drury Lane in London. There were other handbills where he assumed other identities, boasting various miraculous abilities, such as locating water and gold with a divining rod or breaking witch spells. After a while, the duke said his favorite act was performing plays and asked the king if he'd ever been on stage. The king replied he hadn’t. The duke assured him he'd get a chance soon, promising that when they reached a good-sized town, they would rent a hall and perform scenes like the sword fight from Richard III and the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet. The king eagerly agreed, though he admitted he knew nothing about acting, as he hadn't seen many plays since he was a child in his father's palace. He asked the duke if he could teach him, to which the duke confidently replied yes. They decided to start rehearsing right away. The duke then explained the roles of Romeo and Juliet, saying he was used to playing Romeo, so the king should play Juliet. The king was concerned that his bald head and white whiskers would look odd for Juliet’s character, but the duke reassured him that the rural audience wouldn’t notice, especially since he'd be in costume—a nightgown and a ruffled nightcap, as Juliet was supposed to be on a balcony in the moonlight before bedtime. The duke showed the costumes, which included curtain-calico outfits for the Shakespearean knights and a nightshirt with a cap for Juliet. The king was content with this arrangement. The duke then energetically demonstrated how to act out the scenes, reading from a book while strutting and performing the parts, then handed the book to the king so he could memorize his lines."

There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with branches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles of watermelons and green corn and such-like truck.\nThe preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they was bigger and held crowds of people. The benches was made out of outside slabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into for legs. They didn’t have no backs. The preachers had high platforms to stand on at one end of the sheds. The women had on sun-bonnets; and some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a few of the young ones had on calico. Some of the young men was barefooted, and some of the children didn’t have on any clothes but just a tow-linen shirt. Some of the old women was knitting, and some of the young folks was courting on the sly.\nThe first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn. He lined out two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it, there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; then he lined out two more for them to sing—and so on. The people woke up more and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end some begun to groan, and some begun to shout. Then the preacher begun to preach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side of the platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the front of it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and shouting his words out with all his might; and every now and then he would hold up his Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way and that, shouting, “It’s the brazen serpent in the wilderness! Look upon it and live!” And people would shout out, “Glory!—A-a-men!” And so he went on, and the people groaning and crying and saying amen:\n“Oh, come to the mourners’ bench! come, black with sin! (amen!) come, sick and sore! (amen!) come, lame and halt and blind! (amen!) come, pore and needy, sunk in shame! (a-a-men!) come, all that’s worn and soiled and suffering!—come with a broken spirit! come with a contrite heart! come in your rags and sin and dirt! the waters that cleanse is free, the door of heaven stands open—oh, enter in and be at rest!” (a-a-men! glory, glory hallelujah!)\nAnd so on.

There must have been a thousand people gathered from all around, up to twenty miles away. The woods were crowded with teams and wagons, tied up everywhere, their animals eating from troughs and trying to avoid the flies. Makeshift shelters built from poles and tree branches served as stands where they sold lemonade, gingerbread, watermelons, green corn, and other goods.\n\nThe preaching took place under similar, but larger, shelters that could hold big groups of people. The benches were made from rough slabs of logs with holes for legs, and had no backs. The preachers stood on raised platforms at one end. The women wore sunbonnets and a variety of dresses—some made from linsey-woolsey, others from gingham, and a few young women wore calico. Some young men were barefoot, and some children wore nothing but a coarse linen shirt. A few old women were knitting and some of the younger people were secretly flirting.\n\nAt the first shelter we passed, the preacher was starting a hymn. He would recite two lines, everyone would sing them together—there was a powerful effect because of all the voices. He continued in this way, two lines at a time. As the singing continued, it grew louder and more enthusiastic, and soon some people began to groan and others to shout. When the preacher started his sermon, he was very passionate—pacing the platform, leaning forward, gesturing with his arms, and shouting at the top of his voice. Every now and then he’d raise and open his Bible, waving it as he cried, \"It’s the brazen serpent in the wilderness! Look upon it and live!\" to which the congregation responded, \"Glory! Amen!\"\n\nHe kept exhorting everyone, and the people grew more emotional so that soon you couldn’t even hear the preacher over all the shouting and crying. Some individuals pushed through the crowd with tears streaming down their faces to reach the front, known as the mourners’ bench. When all the mourners had reached it, they sang, shouted, and threw themselves on the straw in a frenzy of emotion."

He expressed gratitude for being robbed the night before and put ashore from a steamboat with no money, calling it the most fortunate event of his life because he was now a changed man and truly happy for the first time. He declared that, despite his poverty, he would immediately start working his way back to the Indian Ocean to dedicate the rest of his life to guiding pirates onto the right path. He believed he was uniquely suited for this task because he knew all the pirate crews in that ocean. He admitted it would take a long time to get there without money, but he would make it. Every time he persuaded a pirate to reform, he would tell them not to thank him or give him credit, but to attribute it all to those kind people at the Pokeville camp meeting, whom he called true brothers and benefactors of humanity, and to the dear preacher, the best friend a pirate ever had. Then he broke down crying, and everyone else cried too. Someone shouted, \"Let's take up a collection for him!\" A few people jumped up to do it, but another person yelled, \"Let *him* pass the hat around!\" Everyone agreed, including the preacher. So, the king walked through the entire crowd with his hat, wiping his eyes, blessing, praising, and thanking the people for their kindness to the poor pirates far away. Every so often, very pretty girls with tears on their faces would step up and ask if they could kiss him to remember him by.

He explained that he had been robbed and left onshore from a steamboat with no money, but he was actually thankful for it; he said it was the best thing that ever happened to him because he was now a changed man, finally happy. Even though he was poor, he planned to go straight back to the Indian Ocean and dedicate his life to converting pirates to goodness, since he knew all the pirate crews so well. Although it would be a hard journey without money, he would make it, and every time he reformed a pirate, he would tell them not to thank him, but to thank the kind people of the Pokeville camp-meeting and the preacher, who was a true friend to pirates. Then he began to cry, and so did the audience. Someone called for a collection to be taken up for him, and quickly a few people started, but another suggested the king himself should pass the hat around, which everyone, including the preacher, agreed with. As the king went through the crowd collecting money, he wiped his eyes, blessed, praised, and thanked the people for their kindness to distant pirates. Occasionally, emotional young women asked if they could kiss him as a keepsake, and he always let them; sometimes he even hugged and kissed them several times. He was invited to stay a week, and people offered him their homes, feeling honored. However, he declined, saying the camp-meeting was ending, and he couldn't do any good there, besides he was eager to get back to the Indian Ocean to start reforming pirates.

And he had got in ten dollars’ worth of advertisements for the paper, which he said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance—so they done it. The price of the paper was two dollars a year, but he took in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them paying him in advance; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as usual, but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the price as low as he could afford it, and was going to run it for cash. He set up a little piece of poetry, which he made, himself, out of his own head—three verses—kind of sweet and saddish—the name of it was, “Yes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart”—and he left that all set up and ready to print in the paper, and didn’t charge nothing for it. Well, he took in nine dollars and a half, and said he’d done a pretty square day’s work for it.\nThen he showed us another little job he’d printed and hadn’t charged for, because it was for us. It had a picture of a runaway nigger with a bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and “$200 reward” under it. The reading was all about Jim, and just described him to a dot. It said he run away from St. Jacques’ plantation, forty mile below New Orleans, last winter, and likely went north, and whoever would catch him and send him back he could have the reward and expenses.\n“Now,” says the duke, “after to-night we can run in the daytime if we want to. Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and foot with a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we captured him up the river, and were too poor to travel on a steamboat, so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down to get the reward. Handcuffs and chains would look still better on Jim, but it wouldn’t go well with the story of us being so poor. Too much like jewelry.

He had earned four dollars by setting type and printing two small jobs—horse bills—for local farmers. He had also secured ten dollars' worth of advertisements for the newspaper, offering to place them for four dollars if paid in advance, which they were. Although the newspaper's annual cost was two dollars, he secured three subscriptions for fifty cents each by demanding prepayment. He told these subscribers, who typically paid with things like firewood and onions, that he had just acquired the business, was offering the lowest possible price, and was now operating on a cash basis. He composed and set up a short, somewhat sad, three-verse poem of his own creation titled, “Yes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart.” He left it ready for printing without charging for it. Overall, he collected nine dollars and fifty cents, which he considered a respectable day's earnings.\nThen he presented another small item he had printed at no cost, explaining it was for our group's use. It was a wanted poster for a runaway slave featuring a drawing of a Black man with a bundle over his shoulder and a “$200 reward” notice underneath. The description in the text matched Jim precisely, stating he had run away from St. Jacques’ plantation, located forty miles below New Orleans, the previous winter and was likely heading north. The poster offered the reward and covered expenses for anyone who caught and returned him.\n“Now,” the duke said, “after tonight, we can travel during the day if we wish. Whenever we spot someone approaching, we can tie Jim hand and foot with rope, place him in the temporary shelter, display this handbill, and claim we apprehended him further upriver. We’ll say we were too poor to travel by steamboat, so we obtained this small raft on credit from friends to take him south to collect the reward. Handcuffs and chains would look more convincing on Jim, but that wouldn't align with our story of being impoverished. They’d look too much like expensive items.

Though the newspaper subscription was supposed to be two dollars a year, he accepted only fifty cents each from three people, as long as they paid in advance; normally, they would have paid with things like firewood or onions, but he claimed he’d just bought the business, lowered the price as much as he could, and needed cash. The duke wrote and typeset a short, somewhat melancholy poem titled “Yes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart,” and got it ready for printing in the paper at no charge. He earned nine and a half dollars from the day’s work and felt it was a fair effort.\n\nHe then showed Huck and the king another piece he had printed for them, which he hadn’t charged for—a handbill with a drawing of a runaway slave carrying a bundle and an offer of a $200 reward. The text described Jim exactly, claiming he had escaped from St. Jacques’ plantation near New Orleans last winter and probably headed north. Anyone who caught him and returned him could claim the reward and expenses.\n\n“Now,” the duke explained, “after tonight we can travel during the day if we want.

He struck a heroic pose, one leg forward, arms high, head thrown back looking skyward; then he started passionately reciting—shouting, gesturing wildly, puffing out his chest, and truly putting on the best display of acting I’d ever seen. This is the speech—I picked it up easily while he was helping the king learn it:\n\nTo be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin\nThat makes calamity of so long life;\nFor who would fardels bear, till Birnam Wood do come to Dunsinane,\nBut that the fear of something after death\nMurders the innocent sleep,\nGreat nature’s second course,\nAnd makes us rather sling the arrows of outrageous fortune\nThan fly to others that we know not of.\nThere’s the respect must give us pause:\nWake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst;\nFor who would bear the whips and scorns of time,\nThe oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,\nThe law’s delay, and the quietus which his pangs might take.\nIn the dead waste and middle of the night, when churchyards yawn\nIn customary suits of solemn black,\nBut that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns,\nBreathes forth contagion on the world,\nAnd thus the native hue of resolution, like the poor cat i’ the adage,\nIs sicklied o’er with care.\nAnd all the clouds that lowered o’er our housetops,\nWith this regard their currents turn awry,\nAnd lose the name of action.\n’Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished.\nBut soft you, the fair Ophelia:\nOpe not thy ponderous and marble jaws.\nBut get thee to a nunnery—go!\n\nThe old man really enjoyed the speech, and before long, he had it down so well he could perform it excellently. He seemed made for the part, and once he was comfortable and in the mood, it was wonderful to watch how animated and dramatic he became while performing it."

For the next couple of days while they drifted downstream, the raft was extremely active because the only things happening were sword-fighting and rehearsing, as the duke termed it. One morning, after traveling quite a distance down into the state of Arkansas, they spotted a small town situated in a large bend of the river. They moored the raft about three-quarters of a mile upstream from the town, concealing it within the mouth of a creek that was enclosed like a tunnel by cypress trees. Then, everyone except Jim took the canoe and paddled downstream to check if the town offered a suitable opportunity for their performance. They had excellent fortune. A circus was scheduled to be in town that afternoon, and people from the surrounding countryside were already starting to arrive in all sorts of old, rickety wagons and on horseback. Since the circus would depart before evening, their own show would have a good chance of drawing an audience. The duke rented the local courthouse, and they proceeded to put up their posters around town. The posters announced the following: A Shaksperean Revival!!! A Wonderful Attraction! For One Night Only! Featuring the world-famous tragic actors, David Garrick the younger, from London's Drury Lane Theatre, and Edmund Kean the elder, from London's Royal Haymarket Theatre (located at Whitechapel, Pudding Lane, Piccadilly) and various Royal Continental Theatres. They would perform their magnificent Shaksperean production titled The Balcony Scene from Romeo and Juliet!!! Mr. Garrick would play Romeo and Mr. Kean would play Juliet, supported by the entire cast! The show boasted new costumes, new scenery, and new props! Also featured: The exciting, expertly performed, and frightening Broad-sword conflict from Richard III.!!! Richard III would be played by Mr. Garrick, and Richmond by Mr. Kean. Additionally, by special request, they would present Hamlet’s Famous Soliloquy!! Performed by the celebrated Kean! Advertised as having been performed by him for 300 consecutive nights in Paris!

            "Huck noted that the stores and houses were predominantly old, unpainted wooden structures, elevated on stilts to protect against river flooding. Their gardens appeared neglected, primarily cultivating weeds, sunflowers, and accumulating debris like ash-piles and old discarded items.",

            "Nearly every awning-post had a loafer leaning against it, usually with hands in pockets, except when retrieving tobacco or scratching.",
            "Huck described their conversations, highlighting the frequent requests to borrow chewing tobacco, often accompanied by false claims about having just given away their last piece.",

          "text_segment": "Then we went loafing around the town. The stores and houses was most all old shackly dried-up frame concerns that hadn’t ever been painted; they was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts, so as to be out of reach of the water when the river was overflowed. The houses had little gardens around them, but they didn’t seem to raise hardly anything in them but jimpson weeds, and sunflowers, and ash-piles, and old curled-up boots and shoes, and pieces of bottles, and rags, and played-out tin-ware. The fences was made of different kinds of boards, nailed on at different times; and they leaned every which-way, and had gates that didn’t generly have but one hinge—a leather one. Some of the fences had been whitewashed, some time or another, but the duke said it was in Clumbus’s time, like enough. There was generly hogs in the garden, and people driving them out.\nAll the stores was along one street. They had white domestic awnings in front, and the country people hitched their horses to the awning-posts. There was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings, and loafers roosting on them all day long, whittling them with their Barlow knives; and chawing tobacco, and gaping and yawning and stretching—a mighty ornery lot. They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella, but didn’t wear no coats nor waistcoats, they called one another Bill, and Buck, and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and talked lazy and drawly, and used considerable many cuss words. There was as many as one loafer leaning up against every awning-post, and he most always had his hands in his britches-pockets, except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw of tobacco or scratch. What a body was hearing amongst them all the time was:\n“Gimme a chaw ’v tobacker, Hank.”\n“Cain’t; I hain’t got but one chaw left. Ask Bill.”\nMaybe Bill he gives him a chaw; maybe he lies and says he ain’t got none. Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world, nor a chaw of tobacco of their own. They get all their chawing by borrowing; they say to a fellow, “I wisht you’d len’ me a chaw, Jack, I jist this minute give Ben Thompson the last chaw I had”—which is a lie pretty much everytime; it don’t fool nobody but a stranger; but Jack ain’t no stranger, so he says:\n“You give him a chaw, did you? So did your sister’s cat’s grandmother. You pay me back the chaws you’ve awready borry’d off’n me, Lafe Buckner, then I’ll loan you one or two ton of it, and won’t charge you no back intrust, nuther.”\n“Well, I did pay you back some of it wunst.”\n“Yes, you did—’bout six chaws. You borry’d store tobacker and paid back nigger-head.”\nStore tobacco is flat black plug, but these fellows mostly chaws the natural leaf twisted. When they borrow a chaw they don’t generly cut it off with a knife, but set the plug in between their teeth, and gnaw with their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in two; then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it when it’s handed back, and says, sarcastic:\n“Here, gimme the chaw, and you take the plug.”\nAll the streets and lanes was just mud; they warn’t nothing else but mud—mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places, and two or three inches deep in all the places. The hogs loafed and grunted around everywheres. You’d see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way, where folks had to walk around her, and she’d stretch out and shut her eyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her, and look as happy as if she was on salary. And pretty soon you’d hear a loafer sing out, “Hi! so boy! sick him, Tige!” and away the sow would go, squealing most horrible, with a dog or two swinging to each ear, and three or four dozen more a-coming; and then you would see all the loafers get up and watch the thing out of sight, and laugh at the fun and look grateful for the noise. Then they’d settle back again till there was a dog fight. There couldn’t anything wake them up all over, and make them happy all over, like a dog fight—unless it might be putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him, or tying a tin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death.\nOn the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank, and they was bowed and bent, and about ready to tumble in. The people had moved out of them. The bank was caved away under one corner of some others, and that corner was hanging over. People lived in them yet, but it was dangersome, because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house caves in at a time. Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the river in one summer. Such a town as that has to be always moving back, and back, and back, because the river’s always gnawing at it.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "We then strolled around the town. Most of the stores and houses were old, unstable, dried-up wooden structures that had never been painted; they were raised three or four feet off the ground on posts to stay above the water when the river overflowed. The houses had small gardens around them, but they didn't seem to grow much besides jimpson weeds, sunflowers, piles of ash, old curled-up boots and shoes, broken bottle pieces, rags, and worn-out tin items. The fences were constructed from various types of boards, nailed on at different times, leaning in all directions, and usually had gates with only one hinge, often made of leather. Some fences had been whitewashed at some point, but the duke suggested it was likely a very long time ago. Pigs were often found in the gardens, with people trying to chase them away. All the stores were located on a single street. They had white canvas awnings in front, and the local country people tied their horses to the awning posts. Under the awnings were empty dry goods boxes where idle men ('loafers') sat all day, whittling them with their knives, chewing tobacco, and yawning, gaping, and stretching – a truly unpleasant group. They typically wore yellow straw hats nearly as wide as umbrellas but didn't wear coats or vests. They called each other simple names like Bill, Buck, Hank, Joe, and Andy, spoke in a slow, drawling manner, and used a considerable number of swear words. There was generally at least one loafer propped against every awning post, his hands usually in his pockets, except when he took them out to share some chewing tobacco or scratch himself. What you constantly heard among them was: 'Give me a chew of tobacco, Hank.' 'Can't; I only have one chew left. Ask Bill.' Maybe Bill would give him a chew, or maybe he would lie and say he had none. Some of these lazy fellows never have any money or their own tobacco. They get all their chewing tobacco by borrowing; they'll say to someone, 'I wish you'd lend me a chew, Jack, I just this minute gave Ben Thompson the last chew I had' – which is almost always a lie; it only fools a stranger, but Jack isn't a stranger, so he'll say: 'You gave him a chew, did you? So did your sister's cat's grandmother. You pay me back the chews you've already borrowed from me, Lafe Buckner, then I'll lend you a ton or two, and I won't charge you any back interest either.' 'Well, I did pay you back some of it once.' 'Yes, you did – about six chews. You borrowed store tobacco and paid back 'nigger-head' (meaning, less valuable natural leaf).' Store tobacco is flat black plug, but these men mostly chewed the twisted natural leaf. When they borrow a chew, they don't usually cut it off with a knife, but put the plug between their teeth and gnaw and pull at it with their hands until it breaks in two; then sometimes the owner of the tobacco looks sadly at it when it's returned and says sarcastically: 'Here, give me the chew, and you keep the plug.' All the streets and alleys were nothing but mud – mud as black as tar and almost a foot deep in some spots, and two or three inches deep everywhere else. The pigs roamed and grunted everywhere. You might see a muddy sow and her litter of pigs slowly coming down the street and plop herself right in the way, forcing people to walk around her. She'd stretch out, close her eyes, and wave her ears while the pigs nursed, looking as happy as if she were being paid. And pretty soon you'd hear a loafer shout, 'Hey! Get him, Tige!' and away the sow would go, squealing horribly, with a dog or two hanging onto each ear and dozens more following; then you'd see all the loafers stand up and watch the commotion disappear from view, laughing at the fun and looking grateful for the noise. They would then sit back down until a dog fight occurred. Nothing could wake them up and make them completely happy like a dog fight – unless perhaps it was putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting it on fire, or tying a tin can to its tail and watching it run itself to exhaustion. By the river, some houses were built sticking out over the bank; they were bowed and bent, looking ready to collapse. The people who lived there had moved out. Under one corner of some other houses, the bank had caved away, leaving that corner hanging over the edge. People still lived in them, but it was dangerous because sometimes a section of land as wide as a house collapses into the river at once. Occasionally, a strip of land a quarter of a mile deep will start caving in and continue until it has all fallen into the river in a single summer. A town like that constantly has to move back further and further inland because the river is always eating away at the bank.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "After that, we wandered idly through the town. Most of the shops and houses were old, rickety wooden buildings that had never been painted. They were built three or four feet off the ground on stilts to avoid floodwaters from the river. The houses had small yards, but little seemed to grow there except weeds like jimson, sunflowers, piles of ashes, discarded old boots and shoes, broken bottles, rags, and worn-out tinware. The fences were patched together from different types of boards, nailed on at different times, leaning every which way, with gates that usually only had one leather hinge. Some of the fences looked like they’d been whitewashed a long time ago, maybe as far back as Columbus, as the duke joked. Hogs were often rummaging in the gardens, and people tried to shoo them out.\n\nAll the shops were located along the same street. They had white fabric awnings in front, and country folk tied their horses to the awning posts. Empty boxes were stacked under the awnings, where idlers lounged all day, carving with their pocketknives, chewing tobacco, yawning, stretching, and generally looking lazy. They usually wore wide brimmed straw hats, nearly as broad as umbrellas, but no coats or waistcoats. They called each other by names like Bill, Buck, Hank, Joe, and Andy, spoke in slow, lazy drawls, and used plenty of curse words. There was almost always one loafer leaning against every awning post, hands stuffed in his pockets unless he was offering someone a chew of tobacco or scratching himself. What you’d constantly hear among them was:\n\n“Give me some tobacco, Hank.”\n“I can’t, I only have one piece left. Ask Bill.”\nMaybe Bill would give some, or deny he had any. Some loafers never had a penny or their own stash of tobacco—they always borrowed, sometimes lying about having given their last chew to someone else. The locals never fell for it. If someone like Jack was asked, he’d reply sarcastically, insisting the borrower repay what he already owed before asking for more, joking about charging interest. Sometimes the borrower claimed he had paid back some chaws before, but Jack would retort that he repaid only with inferior tobacco.\n\n“Store” tobacco was flat, black plug, but most of these fellows chewed twisted leaves. When they borrowed, they didn’t usually cut it—they’d just bite into the plug and pull it apart with their hands, returning the remainder sometimes to the owner, who would jokingly offer to swap the chewed piece for the untouched plug.\n\nThe streets and lanes were nothing but mud—thick, black, tar-like mud, nearly a foot deep in places, and at least a couple of inches everywhere. Hogs wandered around, grunting. You’d often see a muddy sow and her piglets lying right down in the street, blocking the way and nursing contentedly, looking completely satisfied. Eventually, a loafer would yell, “Sick ’em, Tige!” and dogs would go after the sow, making her squeal and run off pursued by barking dogs, while all the loafers watched, laughed, and enjoyed the commotion. They’d settle back until the next dog fight happened, which was about the only thing that could stir them up—except maybe lighting a stray dog’s tail on fire or tying a tin can to it and watching him run.\n\nSome houses on the riverbank jutted over the edge, bent and sagging, nearly ready to collapse, with people having already moved out. Some other houses had part of their foundations hanging over where the river had washed away the bank underneath—dangerous, but still inhabited. Sometimes whole strips of land, even as wide as a house, would collapse into the river at once; on occasion, a quarter mile of land could cave in during one summer. A town like that had to keep moving back from the river, which was always eroding the banks away."

You prepared to die?”\nThen he rode on. I was scared, but a man says:\n“He don’t mean nothing; he’s always a-carryin’ on like that when he’s drunk.

Families coming from the countryside brought their meals with them and ate them in their wagons. There was a lot of whiskey being consumed, and I witnessed three fights. Eventually, someone yelled out, \"Here comes old Boggs! He's arrived from the country for his customary monthly intoxication; here he is, fellows!\" All the idle men seemed pleased; I presumed they were used to being entertained by Boggs. One of them commented, \"I wonder who he intends to confront aggressively this time. If he had actually harmed everyone he's threatened over the past two decades, he would have a considerable reputation now.\" Another remarked, \"I wish old Boggs would threaten me, because then I'd know I wouldn't die for a thousand years.\" Boggs came riding furiously on his horse, whooping and yelling like a Native American, and shouting, \"Clear the path there! I'm on the attack, and the cost of coffins is going to rise.\" He was drunk and wobbling in his saddle; he was over fifty years old and had a very red face. Everyone shouted and laughed at him and insulted him, and he insulted them back, promising to deal with them and put them in their place when he had time, but he couldn't wait now because he had come to town specifically to kill old Colonel Sherburn, following his principle of doing the main job first and minor things afterward. He noticed me, rode closer, and asked, \"Where did you come from, boy? Are you ready to die?\" Then he continued on. I was frightened, but a man told me, \"He doesn't mean anything by it; he always carries on like that when he's drunk.

Families brought their meals from the countryside and ate them in their wagons. There was plenty of whisky being drunk, and I witnessed three fights. Suddenly, someone shouted that old Boggs was arriving from the country for his usual monthly drinking spree. The loafers looked excited, probably because Boggs's antics were a regular source of entertainment for them. One joked about wondering who Boggs would threaten this time, saying that if Boggs had actually beaten up everyone he’d threatened over the past twenty years, he’d have quite a reputation by now. Another quipped that he wished Boggs would threaten him, because that would mean he’d have nothing to worry about for a thousand years. Boggs then came riding down the street on his horse, shouting and hollering wildly, saying everyone should clear the way because he was on the warpath and that the price of coffins was about to go up. He was clearly drunk, swaying in his saddle. He was over fifty, with a bright red face. People in the street jeered and yelled at him, and he shouted back, claiming he’d deal with them all later, but right now he was in town to kill Colonel Sherburn, declaring that his motto was to take care of meat before side dishes. When he noticed me, he rode over and asked where I’d come from and whether I was ready to die, then continued on his way. I was frightened, but a man reassured me that Boggs didn’t mean any harm and that he always acted that way when he was drunk—he was actually the kindest old fool in Arkansas and had never hurt anyone, whether drunk or sober."

Sherburn run his eye slow along the crowd; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to out-gaze him, but they couldn’t; they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky. Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed; not the pleasant kind, but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread that’s got sand in it.\nThen he says, slow and scornful:\n“The idea of you lynching anybody! It’s amusing. The idea of you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a man! Because you’re brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come along here, did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a man? Why, a man’s safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind—as long as it’s daytime and you’re not behind him.\n“Do I know you? I know you clear through. I was born and raised in the South, and I’ve lived in the North; so I know the average all around. The average man’s a coward. In the North he lets anybody walk over him that wants to, and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it. In the South one man all by himself, has stopped a stage full of men in the daytime, and robbed the lot. Your newspapers call you a brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other people—whereas you’re just as brave, and no braver. Why don’t your juries hang murderers? Because they’re afraid the man’s friends will shoot them in the back, in the dark—and it’s just what they would do.\n“So they always acquit; and then a man goes in the night, with a hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal. Your mistake is, that you didn’t bring a man with you; that’s one mistake, and the other is that you didn’t come in the dark and fetch your masks. You brought part of a man—Buck Harkness, there—and if you hadn’t had him to start you, you’d a taken it out in blowing.\n“You didn’t want to come. The average man don’t like trouble and danger. You don’t like trouble and danger. But if only half a man—like Buck Harkness, there—shouts ‘Lynch him! lynch him!’ you’re afraid to back down—afraid you’ll be found out to be what you are—cowards—and so you raise a yell, and hang yourselves on to that half-a-man’s coat-tail, and come raging up here, swearing what big things you’re going to do. The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that’s what an army is—a mob; they don’t fight with courage that’s born in them, but with courage that’s borrowed from their mass, and from their officers. But a mob without any man at the head of it is beneath pitifulness. Now the thing for you to do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole. If any real lynching’s going to be done, it will be done in the dark, Southern fashion; and when they come they’ll bring their masks, and fetch a man along. Now leave—and take your half-a-man with you”—tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this.",

After a moment, Sherburn let out a laugh, not a pleasant one, but the kind that feels as unpleasant as eating bread with sand in it. Then, speaking slowly and with contempt, he said: 'The very idea of *you* lynching someone is hilarious. The notion that you thought you had enough courage to lynch a *man*! Just because you're brave enough to tar and feather poor, friendless, outcast women who pass through here, did that make you believe you had the nerve to confront a *man*? Why, a *man* is safe from ten thousand of your sort—as long as it's daylight and you're not behind him. Do I know you? I know you completely. I was born and raised in the South and have lived in the North, so I understand the typical person everywhere. The average man is a coward. In the North, he lets anyone walk all over him and then goes home to meekly accept it. In the South, a single man has stopped a stagecoach full of men in broad daylight and robbed them all. Your newspapers constantly call you brave, making you think you *are* braver than anyone else—when in fact you are just *as* brave, no more. Why don't your juries convict murderers? Because they fear the killer's friends will shoot them in the back in the dark—and that is exactly what they *would* do. So they always acquit; and then a *true* man goes at night, with a hundred masked cowards supporting him, and lynches the criminal. Your mistake is that you didn't bring a real man with you; that's one error. The other is that you didn't come in the dark and wear masks. You brought only *part* of a man—Buck Harkness, standing right there—and without him to initiate things, you would have just amounted to hot air. You didn't actually want to come. The average person dislikes trouble and danger, and *you* dislike trouble and danger. But if even just *half* a man, like Buck Harkness, shouts 'Lynch him! lynch him!', you're too afraid to back down—afraid you'll be exposed as the cowards you are—so you join the shouting, follow that half-man's lead, and charge up here boasting about what you'll accomplish. The most pathetic thing is a mob; an army is just a mob. They don't fight with inherent courage, but with bravery borrowed from their collective mass and from their officers. But a mob without any *real* man leading it is utterly contemptible. Now, the best thing for *you* to do is to tuck your tails, go home, and hide in a hole. If a proper lynching is going to happen, it will be done secretly, at night, in the Southern manner; and when they come, they'll wear masks and bring a *man* along. Now *leave*—and take your half-a-man with you,",

Sherburn slowly swept his gaze over the people, and whenever his eyes met someone’s, they tried to stare back but always looked away, feeling ashamed. After a moment, Sherburn let out a laugh—not a kind or pleasant one, but the sort that makes you uncomfortable, like biting into gritty bread.\nThen he spoke, slowly and with contempt:\n\"The thought of you lynching someone? It’s laughable. You really think you have the courage to lynch a man? Just because you’re bold enough to tar and feather lonely, defenseless women, you think you’ve got the guts to touch a man? A man is perfectly safe among thousands of you as long as it’s daytime and you’re not sneaking behind him.\nDo I know you? I know your type well. I was born and raised in the South, and I’ve spent time in the North, so I know what most people are like. Most men are cowards. Up North, people let others push them around and then go home to pray for the humility to endure it. Down South, a single man has stopped a coach full of people during the day and robbed everyone. Your newspapers keep telling you that you’re brave until you start believing it; but you’re not any braver than anyone else, just the same. Why don't your juries execute murderers? Because they're afraid the killer’s friends might shoot them later—and honestly, they would do just that.\nSo the juries always let the murderer go, and then, at night, a man gathers a hundred masked cowards to lynch the criminal. Your mistakes tonight were not bringing a real man with you, and not coming at night with your masks. You only have part of a man—like Buck Harkness here—and if he hadn’t encouraged you, you’d have just talked tough and done nothing.\nYou didn’t want to come here. Most people avoid trouble and danger. You avoid it too. But if someone who’s not even a real man—like Buck Harkness—yells ‘Lynch him!’ you’re all too scared to back down, afraid people will see you’re cowards, so you all start shouting and come storming over here, pretending you’re going to do something big. Mobs are the saddest thing; armies are just mobs—they fight with borrowed courage from their numbers and leaders. But a mob without a single real man to lead it is even worse. What you all should do now is hang your heads and go home to hide. If there’s going to be a real lynching, it’ll happen at night, southern style, with masks and a real man leading. Now get out—take your half-a-man with you.\" And as he said this, he tossed his gun up across his arm and cocked it."

The ring-master couldn’t ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he ever could think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what I couldn’t noway understand. Why, I couldn’t a thought of them in a year. And by-and-by a drunk man tried to get into the ring—said he wanted to ride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was. They argued and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn’t listen, and the whole show come to a standstill. Then the people begun to holler at him and make fun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so that stirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the benches and swarm towards the ring, saying, “Knock him down! throw him out!” and one or two women begun to scream. So, then, the ring-master he made a little speech, and said he hoped there wouldn’t be no disturbance, and if the man would promise he wouldn’t make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse. So everybody laughed and said all right, and the man got on. The minute he was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around, with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and the drunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air every jump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears rolled down. And at last, sure enough, all the circus men could do, the horse broke loose, and away he went like the very nation, round and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side, and then t’other one on t’other side, and the people just crazy. It warn’t funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger. But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle, a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a-going like a house afire too. He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable as if he warn’t ever drunk in his life—and then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them. He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he was, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly hum—and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to the dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and astonishment.\nThen the ring-master he see how he had been fooled, and he was the sickest ring-master you ever see, I reckon. Why, it was one of his own men! He had got up that joke all out of his own head, and never let on to nobody. Well, I felt sheepish enough to be took in so, but I wouldn’t a been in that ring-master’s place, not for a thousand dollars. I don’t know; there may be bullier circuses than what that one was, but I never struck them yet. Anyways, it was plenty good enough for me; and wherever I run across it, it can have all of my custom every time.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The circus acts throughout the performance were absolutely incredible, and the clown's antics kept the audience roaring with laughter. The ringmaster couldn't say a word to him without getting a rapid-fire, witty retort, and I just couldn't figure out how he could come up with so many funny and perfectly timed jokes so quickly. I wouldn't have been able to think of them in a whole year. Eventually, a man who seemed drunk tried to enter the ring, claiming he wanted to ride and could ride as well as anyone. They argued with him and tried to prevent him, but he wouldn't listen, bringing the entire show to a halt. The crowd started yelling and mocking him, which angered him, and he began to rant and rave. This riled up the people, and many men started climbing down from the benches and moving towards the ring, shouting to 'Knock him down! Throw him out!' and a few women started screaming. The ringmaster then gave a short speech, saying he hoped there wouldn't be any trouble and that if the man promised to behave, he could ride if he believed he could stay on the horse. Everyone laughed and agreed, and the man got on. The moment he was mounted, the horse went wild, bucking and jumping around, with two circus men holding the bridle trying to control it, and the seemingly drunk man clinging to the horse's neck, his legs flying up with every leap. The whole audience was on their feet, yelling and laughing until tears streamed down their faces. Finally, despite the circus men's efforts, the horse broke free and galloped furiously around the ring, with the man stretched out on its back, holding onto its neck, first one leg nearly touching the ground on one side, then the other. The crowd was going wild. It didn't seem funny to me, though; I was shaking with fear for his safety. But soon, he managed to struggle into a riding position, grabbing the bridle while swaying back and forth. The next second, he sprang up, dropped the bridle, and stood upright on the horse's back! And the horse was still running incredibly fast. He just stood there, moving around as smoothly and comfortably as if he were completely sober, and then he started taking off his clothes and throwing them. He threw them off so quickly that they seemed to fill the air; he shed a total of seventeen suits. Then, there he stood, thin and good-looking, wearing the most flashy and beautiful costume you ever saw. He took a whip to the horse, making it really move, and then he jumped off, bowed, and danced away to the dressing room, with everyone just shouting with delight and amazement.\nThe ringmaster then realized he had been completely fooled, and I bet he was the most embarrassed ringmaster you ever saw. It turned out the man was one of his own performers! He had come up with the whole trick himself and hadn't told anyone. Well, I felt quite foolish for being taken in like that, but I wouldn't have traded places with that ringmaster for a thousand dollars. I don't know; there might be better circuses out there, but I haven't seen them yet. Anyway, that one was more than good enough for me, and I'll always attend it whenever I have the chance.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Throughout the circus show, the performers did amazing feats, and the clown kept everyone laughing so much it was almost too much to handle. The ringmaster would barely get a word out before the clown would fire back with some of the funniest remarks I'd ever heard; I couldn't believe how he came up with so many quick and clever responses—it would have taken me a year to think of just a few. Then, at one point, a drunken man tried to get into the ring, claiming that he could ride as well as anyone. Although the circus people tried to keep him out, he refused to listen, causing the whole show to stop. The audience started to shout and mock him, which only made him angrier and more disruptive. This caused a commotion, and men started coming down from the stands towards the ring, yelling to knock the man down and throw him out, and some women even screamed. Eventually, the ringmaster made a speech, hoping there wouldn't be trouble, and said if the man promised not to cause more problems, he could try riding, if he thought he could stay on the horse. The crowd laughed and agreed, and the drunk man mounted the horse. As soon as he was on, the horse started bucking and jumping wildly, with two circus men trying to control it and the drunken man barely holding on, his legs flailing while the crowd stood up shouting and laughing until people were crying from laughter. Despite the best efforts of the staff, the horse broke free and raced around the ring with the drunk man clinging on, nearly falling off each side while the crowd went wild. I didn't find it funny, though—it made me so nervous to watch him in danger. But soon the man managed to sit upright, grabbed the bridle, and then suddenly stood up on the horse, even while it galloped at full speed. He balanced there, completely steady, as if he wasn't drunk at all, and then began to throw off layer after layer of his clothing—shedding seventeen outfits in all—until he revealed himself to be slim and elegantly dressed. He rode the horse impressively, hopped off, took a bow, and danced out, leaving the audience ecstatic. Only then did the ringmaster realize he’d been tricked—it was his own circus performer pretending to be drunk, pulling off the prank solo without telling anybody. I felt pretty gullible for being fooled, but I wouldn't have wanted to be in the ringmaster's shoes for anything. Maybe there are even better circuses out there, but I've never seen them, and this one was good enough for me; whenever they're in town, they've got my business for sure."

He felt he understood their preferences. So, the following morning, he obtained large sheets of wrapping paper and black paint, designed some flyers, and posted them all over the village.

And—but never mind the rest of his outfit; it was just wild, but it was awful funny. The people most killed themselves laughing; and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes, they roared and clapped and stormed and haw-hawed till he come back and done it over again, and after that they made him do it another time. Well, it would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut.\nThen the duke he lets the curtain down, and bows to the people, and says the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more, on accounts of pressing London engagements, where the seats is all sold already for it in Drury Lane; and then he makes them another bow, and says if he has succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them, he will be deeply obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come and see it.\nTwenty people sings out:\n“What, is it over? Is that all?”\nThe duke says yes. Then there was a fine time. Everybody sings out, “Sold!” and rose up mad, and was a-going for that stage and them tragedians.

That night, the place was packed with men very quickly. When no more people could fit inside, the duke stopped selling tickets, went around to the back, came onto the stage, stood in front of the curtain, and gave a short speech. He praised the upcoming tragedy highly, saying it was the most exciting one ever performed. He continued to brag about the play and about the renowned actor who would play the main role, Edmund Kean the Elder (who was actually the king). Finally, when he had raised everyone's expectations sufficiently, he raised the curtain. The next moment, the king came prancing out on his hands and knees, completely naked. He was painted all over in stripes and rings of various colors, looking as vibrant as a rainbow. I won't describe the rest of his costume; it was wild but incredibly funny. The audience nearly died laughing. When the king finished his act and went backstage, they roared, clapped, stomped their feet, and laughed loudly until he came back and did it again. After that, they made him do it one more time. Honestly, watching that old fool perform his antics would make even a cow laugh. Then, the duke lowered the curtain, bowed to the audience, and announced that the great tragedy would only be performed for two more nights. He claimed this was because of urgent commitments in London, where seats for it were already completely sold out at the Drury Lane theatre. He bowed again and said that if he had succeeded in entertaining and educating them, he would be very grateful if they would mention it to their friends and encourage them to come see it. Twenty people shouted out, \"What? Is that all? Is it over?\" The duke confirmed it was. Then there was chaos. Everyone shouted, \"We've been ripped off!\" and stood up angrily, heading towards the stage and the actors. But a tall, respectable-looking man jumped onto a bench and yelled, \"Hold on! Just a moment, gentlemen.\" They stopped to listen. \"We have been tricked—tricked very badly. But I don't think we want to be the laughing stock of this entire town forever, constantly hearing about this,\" he said. \"No. What we should do is leave here quietly, promote this show positively, and trick the rest of the town into seeing it! Then we'll all be in the same boat. Doesn't that make sense?\" (\"You bet it does!—the judge is right!\" everyone shouted.) \"All right, then—don't say a word about being cheated.

When he had everyone eager to see what would happen next, he lifted the curtain, and the king crawled out on all fours, completely naked. He was covered in brightly colored paint, striped and spotted like a rainbow. The rest of his costume doesn't matter; it was outrageous but very funny. The audience laughed nearly to tears, and when the king finished his act and left the stage, they cheered and laughed so much that he had to return and repeat the act two more times. Even a cow would have found the performance ridiculous. Then the duke lowered the curtain, bowed to the crowd, and announced that the great tragedy would be performed only two more nights because of supposed important commitments in London, where all the seats were already sold at Drury Lane.

About twenty people shouted, wanting to know if the show was really over, surprised at its brevity. The duke said yes, and then chaos broke out. Everyone realized they had been tricked, shouted that they had been fooled, stood up angrily, and were about to rush the stage. But then a well-dressed man stood up and stopped them, arguing that, although they had been thoroughly duped, it would be better to keep quiet and convince the rest of the town to come the next night, so everyone would have been fooled equally and nobody would have to bear the shame alone.

Well, it is their turn, and I’d give something to know how much they’d take for it. I would just like to know how they’re putting in their opportunity. They can turn it into a picnic if they want to—they brought plenty provisions.”\nThem rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in that three nights. I never see money hauled in by the wagon-load like that before. By-and-by, when they was asleep and snoring, Jim says:\n“Don’t it s’prise you de way dem kings carries on, Huck?”\n“No,” I says, “it don’t.”\n“Why don’t it, Huck?”\n“Well, it don’t, because it’s in the breed. I reckon they’re all alike.”\n“But, Huck, dese kings o’ ourn is reglar rapscallions; dat’s jist what dey is; dey’s reglar rapscallions.”\n“Well, that’s what I’m a-saying; all kings is mostly rapscallions, as fur as I can make out.”\n“Is dat so?”\n“You read about them once—you’ll see. Look at Henry the Eight; this’n ’s a Sunday-school Superintendent to him. And look at Charles Second, and Louis Fourteen, and Louis Fifteen, and James Second, and Edward Second, and Richard Third, and forty more; besides all them Saxon heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise Cain. My, you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom. He was a blossom. He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head next morning. And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs. ‘Fetch up Nell Gwynn,’ he says. They fetch her up. Next morning, ‘Chop off her head!’ And they chop it off. ‘Fetch up Jane Shore,’ he says; and up she comes, Next morning, ‘Chop off her head’—and they chop it off. ‘Ring up Fair Rosamun.’ Fair Rosamun answers the bell. Next morning, ‘Chop off her head.’ And he made every one of them tell him a tale every night; and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand and one tales that way, and then he put them all in a book, and called it Domesday Book—which was a good name and stated the case. You don’t know kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old rip of ourn is one of the cleanest I’ve struck in history. Well, Henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country. How does he go at it—give notice?—give the country a show? No. All of a sudden he heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard, and whacks out a declaration of independence, and dares them to come on. That was his style—he never give anybody a chance. He had suspicions of his father, the Duke of Wellington. Well, what did he do? Ask him to show up? No—drownded him in a butt of mamsey, like a cat. S’pose people left money laying around where he was—what did he do? He collared it. S’pose he contracted to do a thing, and you paid him, and didn’t set down there and see that he done it—what did he do? He always done the other thing. S’pose he opened his mouth—what then? If he didn’t shut it up powerful quick he’d lose a lie every time. That’s the kind of a bug Henry was; and if we’d a had him along ’stead of our kings he’d a fooled that town a heap worse than ourn done. I don’t say that ourn is lambs, because they ain’t, when you come right down to the cold facts; but they ain’t nothing to that old ram, anyway. All I say is, kings is kings, and you got to make allowances. Take them all around, they’re a mighty ornery lot. It’s the way they’re raised.”\n“But dis one do smell so like de nation, Huck.”\n“Well, they all do, Jim. We can’t help the way a king smells; history don’t tell no way.”\n“Now de duke, he’s a tolerble likely man in some ways.”\n“Yes, a duke’s different. But not very different. This one’s a middling hard lot for a duke. When he’s drunk, there ain’t no near-sighted man could tell him from a king.”\n“Well, anyways, I doan’ hanker for no mo’ un um, Huck. Dese is all I kin stan’.”\n“It’s the way I feel, too, Jim. But we’ve got them on our hands, and we got to remember what they are, and make allowances. Sometimes I wish we could hear of a country that’s out of kings.”\nWhat was the use to tell Jim these warn’t real kings and dukes?

The king and the duke found it absolutely hilarious how they had tricked those people. The duke said, \"Idiots, fools! I knew the first household would keep quiet and let the rest of the town get taken in, and I knew they'd lie in wait for us on the third night, figuring it was their turn for revenge. Well, it *is* their turn, and I'd love to know how much trouble it's costing them. I really want to know how they're making the most of their chance. They can turn it into a party if they want to—they brought plenty of supplies.\"\n\nThose scoundrels made four hundred and sixty-five dollars in those three nights. I'd never seen so much money brought in at once before. Later, when they were asleep and snoring, Jim asked, \"Huck, doesn't it surprise you how those kings act?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"it doesn't.\"\n\n\"Why not, Huck?\"\n\n\"Well, it doesn't because it's part of their nature. I figure they're all the same.\"\n\n\"But, Huck, these kings of ours are real villains; that's just what they are; they're real villains.\"\n\n\"Well, that's what I'm saying; most kings are villains, as far as I can tell.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\"\n\n\"Read about them sometime—you'll see.

Man, you should have seen old Henry the Eighth when he was in his prime. He was something else. He used to marry a new wife every day and cut off her head the next morning. And he'd do it as easily as ordering breakfast. 'Bring me Nell Gwynn,' he'd say. They'd bring her. Next morning, 'Cut off her head!' And they'd cut it off. 'Bring me Jane Shore,' he'd say; and up she'd come. Next morning, 'Cut off her head'—and they'd cut it off. 'Call for Fair Rosamond.' Fair Rosamond would answer the call. Next morning, 'Cut off her head.' And he made each one of them tell him a story every night; and he kept that up until he'd collected a thousand and one stories that way, and then he put them all in a book and called it Domesday Book—which was a good name for it. You don't know kings, Jim, but I do; and this old scoundrel of ours is one of the better ones I've read about. Anyway, Henry decided he wanted to pick a fight with this country. How did he do it—warn them? Give the country a chance? No. Suddenly, he threw all the tea into Boston Harbor and issued a declaration of independence, daring them to fight. That was his style—he never gave anyone a chance. He was suspicious of his father, the Duke of Wellington. Well, what did he do? Ask him to appear? No—drowned him in a barrel of wine, like a cat. Suppose people left money lying around near him—what did he do? He took it. Suppose he agreed to do something, and you paid him, and didn't stay there to make sure he did it—what did he do? He always did the opposite. Suppose he opened his mouth—what then? If he didn't shut it really fast, he'd tell a lie every time. That's the kind of character Henry was; and if we'd had him with us instead of our kings, he'd have fooled that town a lot worse than ours did. I'm not saying ours are innocent, because they aren't, if you look at the plain facts; but they're nothing compared to that old monster, anyway. All I'm saying is, kings are kings, and you have to make allowances. Overall, they're a pretty unpleasant bunch. It's how they are brought up.\"\n\n\"But this one really does smell bad, Huck.\"\n\n\"Well, they all do, Jim. We can't change how a king smells; history doesn't say how.\"\n\n\"Now the duke, he's a reasonably decent man in some ways.\"\n\n\"Yes, a duke is different. But not much different. This one's a fairly tough character for a duke. When he's drunk, someone with poor eyesight couldn't tell him from a king.\"\n\n\"Well, anyway, I don't want any more of them, Huck. These are all I can handle.\"\n\n\"That's how I feel too, Jim. But we're stuck with them, and we have to remember what they are and be understanding. Sometimes I wish we could hear about a country that doesn't have kings.\"\n\nThere was no point in telling Jim these weren't real kings and dukes.

He was suspicious of his dad, the Duke of Wellington, so he drowned him in wine. Left money out? He’d take it. Hired him for something and didn’t watch? He’d do something else. Opened his mouth?

I say they all do, and you can’t help it. History doesn’t show a solution. Jim says the duke is a bit better, but I say he’s not much different, maybe just a little less harsh. When he’s drunk, you can’t tell him apart from a king. Jim says he doesn’t want to deal with any more kings or dukes, and I feel the same, but we’re stuck with them and have to just deal with it.

After a while, he said, \"What's making me feel so awful this time is because I heard something just now over on the bank that sounded like a thud or a slam, and it reminded me of the time I treated my little 'Lizabeth so terribly. She was only about four years old and caught scarlet fever and had a very difficult time, but she got better. One day she was standing around, and I told her, I said, 'Close the door.' She didn't do it; she just stood there, sort of smiling up at me. It made me angry, and I said again, much louder, I said, 'Don't you hear me?—close the door!' She just stayed there, still smiling in that way. I was furious! I said, 'I promise I'll make you remember!' And with that, I gave her a slap on the side of the head that sent her sprawling. Then I went into the other room and was gone for about ten minutes. When I came back, the door was still open, and that child was standing almost right in it, looking down and sad, with tears running down her face. My, but I was angry! I was about to go after the child, but just then—it was a door that opened inwards—just then, the wind came along and slammed it shut behind the child, ker-blam!—and my goodness, the child didn't move! My breath nearly left me, and I felt so—so—I don't know how I felt. I crept out, all shaky, and crept around and opened the door gently and slowly. I poked my head in behind the child, softly and quietly, and then all of a sudden I shouted 'pow!' as loud as I could yell. She didn't budge! Oh, Huck, I burst out crying and grabbed her up in my arms and said, 'Oh, the poor little thing! May the Lord God Almighty forgive poor old Jim, because he will never forgive himself as long as he lives!' Oh, she was completely deaf and mute, Huck, completely deaf and mute—and I had been treating her like that!\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I fell asleep, and Jim didn’t wake me when it was supposed to be my turn. He did that a lot. When I woke up at dawn, Jim was sitting with his head between his knees, quietly moaning and grieving. I didn’t say anything or let on that I noticed, because I understood why—he was thinking about his wife and children far away, missing them deeply, since he’d never been separated from them before. I truly believe he cared for his family just as much as white people care for theirs. It might not seem usual to some, but I think it’s true. Many nights, when he thought I was asleep, he would mourn and softly lament, talking about ‘Poor little ’Lizabeth! Poor little Johnny! It’s so hard; I guess I’ll never see you again!’ Jim was a truly good man.\n\nThis time, I started talking to him about his wife and children, and eventually he said:\n\n‘I feel especially bad now because I heard a sound from the bank like something hitting or slamming, and it reminded me of when I treated my little ’Lizabeth so badly. She was only about four and had scarlet fever very badly, but she got better. One day, she was standing around, and I told her, ‘Close the door.’ She didn’t do it, just stood there smiling at me, which made me angry, so I repeated loudly, ‘Didn’t you hear me? Close the door!’ But she just kept standing there, still smiling. I got furious and said, ‘I’ll make you mind!’ Then I slapped her on the head, knocking her down. I left the room for about ten minutes, and when I came back, the door was still open and she was standing there in it, looking down and crying. I was still mad and going to scold her, but just then the wind slammed the door shut behind her—she didn’t even move! I was startled and got really scared. I crept up quietly and stuck my head in behind her, then suddenly yelled as loud as I could—she still didn’t react. Oh, Huck, I broke down crying, grabbed her and said, ‘Oh, poor little girl! Please, Lord, forgive old Jim, because I’ll never forgive myself.’ She was completely deaf and mute, Huck—completely deaf and mute, and I’d been treating her so poorly!’"

Jim he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn’t take but a few hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope. You see, when we left him all alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all by himself and not tied it wouldn’t look much like he was a runaway nigger, you know. So the duke said it was kind of hard to have to lay roped all day, and he’d cipher out some way to get around it.\nHe was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it. He dressed Jim up in King Lear’s outfit—it was a long curtain-calico gown, and a white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his theater paint and painted Jim’s face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead, dull, solid blue, like a man that’s been drownded nine days. Blamed if he warn’t the horriblest looking outrage I ever see. Then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so:\nSick Arab—but harmless when not out of his head.\nAnd he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five foot in front of the wigwam. Jim was satisfied. He said it was a sight better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling all over every time there was a sound. The duke told him to make himself free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone. Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he wouldn’t wait for him to howl. Why, he didn’t only look like he was dead, he looked considerable more than that.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The following day, as evening approached, we moored our raft at a small sandbar in the middle of the river. There were villages on either side, and the duke and the king began formulating plans to swindle the residents of these towns. Jim spoke to the duke, expressing his hope that their scheme wouldn't take many hours, as it was extremely difficult and tiring for him to be tied up inside the makeshift shelter all day. He explained that we had to tie him when we left him alone so that if someone stumbled upon him by himself, he would appear to be a runaway slave. The duke admitted that being roped up all day was tough and promised to figure out a way around the problem. The duke was quite clever and quickly devised a solution. He dressed Jim in a King Lear costume, which consisted of a long calico curtain gown, a white wig made of horsehair, and a beard. Then, using his theatrical makeup, he painted Jim's face, hands, ears, and neck entirely a dead, dull, solid blue color, resembling someone who had drowned days earlier. Frankly, he was the most terrifying sight I had ever witnessed. Next, the duke took a piece of wood and wrote a sign that read: 'Sick Arab—but harmless when not out of his head.' He attached this sign to a thin stick and placed it about four or five feet in front of the wigwam. Jim was content with this new arrangement. He said it was far better than being tied up constantly and shaking with fear at every noise. The duke instructed him to move around freely. If anyone came snooping, he was to leap out of the wigwam, behave erratically, and let out a couple of wild animal-like howls, which the duke believed would scare them away. While that was a reasonable plan, I figured most people wouldn't wait for him to howl. He didn't just look dead; he looked significantly worse than that.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The next evening, we stopped at a small willow-covered island in the middle of the river, with villages on either side. The duke and the king began plotting how to trick the people in those towns. Jim asked the duke if it would take long, because he found it very hard and exhausting to be tied up in the wigwam all day. We had to tie him up whenever we left him alone, so if anyone came by, they'd think he was a captured runaway slave. The duke agreed that it was rough to stay tied all day, and promised he would figure out an easier way. Being clever, the duke soon came up with an idea. He dressed Jim in a costume from King Lear—a long, calico gown, a white wig and beard made of horse hair—and used theater paint to cover Jim’s face, hands, ears, and neck with a dull blue, making him look like someone who had drowned a long time ago. He looked so frightening and strange, it was shocking. Then the duke wrote a sign that said: “Sick Arab—but harmless when not out of his head,” nailed it to a stick, and put the stick up a few feet in front of Jim’s shelter. Jim was pleased, saying it was much better than being tied up every day and living in fear of every little noise. The duke told Jim to relax, and if anyone got too close, he should run out making wild noises like an animal to scare them off, which would probably work. Still, anyone passing by wouldn’t likely stick around even before Jim made a sound, because he looked more than just dead—he looked downright ghastly."

Jump out and he’p the gentleman, Adolphus”—meaning me, I see.\nI done so, and then we all three started on again. The young chap was mighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather. He asked the king where he was going, and the king told him he’d come down the river and landed at the other village this morning, and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there. The young fellow says:\n“When I first see you I says to myself, ‘It’s Mr. Wilks, sure, and he come mighty near getting here in time.’ But then I says again, ‘No, I reckon it ain’t him, or else he wouldn’t be paddling up the river.’ You ain’t him, are you?”\n“No, my name’s Blodgett—Elexander Blodgett—Reverend Elexander Blodgett, I s’pose I must say, as I’m one o’ the Lord’s poor servants. But still I’m jist as able to be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arriving in time, all the same, if he’s missed anything by it—which I hope he hasn’t.”\n“Well, he don’t miss any property by it, because he’ll get that all right; but he’s missed seeing his brother Peter die—which he mayn’t mind, nobody can tell as to that—but his brother would a give anything in this world to see him before he died; never talked about nothing else all these three weeks; hadn’t seen him since they was boys together—and hadn’t ever seen his brother William at all—that’s the deef and dumb one—William ain’t more than thirty or thirty-five. Peter and George were the only ones that come out here; George was the married brother; him and his wife both died last year. Harvey and William’s the only ones that’s left now; and, as I was saying, they haven’t got here in time.”\n“Did anybody send ’em word?”\n“Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because Peter said then that he sorter felt like he warn’t going to get well this time. You see, he was pretty old, and George’s g’yirls was too young to be much company for him, except Mary Jane, the red-headed one; and so he was kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and didn’t seem to care much to live. He most desperately wanted to see Harvey—and William, too, for that matter—because he was one of them kind that can’t bear to make a will. He left a letter behind for Harvey, and said he’d told in it where his money was hid, and how he wanted the rest of the property divided up so George’s g’yirls would be all right—for George didn’t leave nothing. And that letter was all they could get him to put a pen to.”\n“Why do you reckon Harvey don’t come? Wher’ does he live?”\n“Oh, he lives in England—Sheffield—preaches there—hasn’t ever been in this country. He hasn’t had any too much time—and besides he mightn’t a got the letter at all, you know.”\n“Too bad, too bad he couldn’t a lived to see his brothers, poor soul. You going to Orleans, you say?”\n“Yes, but that ain’t only a part of it. I’m going in a ship, next Wednesday, for Ryo Janeero, where my uncle lives.”\n“It’s a pretty long journey. But it’ll be lovely; wisht I was a-going. Is Mary Jane the oldest? How old is the others?”\n“Mary Jane’s nineteen, Susan’s fifteen, and Joanna’s about fourteen—that’s the one that gives herself to good works and has a hare-lip.”\n“Poor things! to be left alone in the cold world so.”\n“Well, they could be worse off. Old Peter had friends, and they ain’t going to let them come to no harm. There’s Hobson, the Babtis’ preacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley, and—well, there’s a lot of them; but these are the ones that Peter was thickest with, and used to write about sometimes, when he wrote home; so Harvey ’ll know where to look for friends when he gets here.”\nWell, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied that young fellow. Blamed if he didn’t inquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town, and all about the Wilkses; and about Peter’s business—which was a tanner; and about George’s—which was a carpenter; and about Harvey’s—which was a dissentering minister; and so on, and so on. Then he says:\n“What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?”\n“Because she’s a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn’t stop there. When they’re deep they won’t stop for a hail. A Cincinnati boat will, but this is a St. Louis one.”\n“Was Peter Wilks well off?”\n“Oh, yes, pretty well off. He had houses and land, and it’s reckoned he left three or four thousand in cash hid up som’ers.”\n“When did you say he died?”\n“I didn’t say, but it was last night.”\n“Funeral to-morrow, likely?”\n“Yes, ’bout the middle of the day.”\n“Well, it’s all terrible sad; but we’ve all got to go, one time or another. So what we want to do is to be prepared; then we’re all right.”\n“Yes, sir, it’s the best way. Ma used to always say that.”",

The young fellow replied: “When I first saw you, I said to myself, ‘That’s Mr. Wilks for sure, and he almost made it here in time.’ But then I thought again, ‘No, I don’t think it’s him, otherwise he wouldn’t be paddling up the river.’ You aren’t him, are you?” “No, my name is Blodgett—Elexander Blodgett—Reverend Elexander Blodgett, I suppose I should say, being one of the Lord’s humble servants. But still, I can feel just as sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arriving in time, if he missed anything important because of it—which I hope isn’t the case.” “Well, he won’t miss any property by it, because he’ll get all that; but he did miss seeing his brother Peter die—which he might not care about, you can’t tell—but his brother would have given anything in the world to see him before he passed away; he talked about nothing else for the past three weeks; they hadn’t seen each other since they were boys—and he had never met his brother William at all—that’s the one who is deaf and mute—William is only about thirty or thirty-five. Peter and George were the only ones who moved out here; George was the married brother; he and his wife both died last year. Harvey and William are the only brothers left now; and, as I mentioned, they didn’t get here in time.” “Did someone send them a message?” “Oh, yes; about a month or two ago, when Peter first became ill; because Peter said then that he had a feeling he wasn’t going to recover this time. You see, he was quite old, and George’s young daughters weren’t much company for him, except for Mary Jane, the one with red hair; and so he felt rather lonely after George and his wife died, and didn’t seem to have much will to live. He desperately wanted to see Harvey—and William, too, for that matter—because he was the type of person who couldn’t stand making a will. He left a letter for Harvey, and said in it where his money was hidden, and how he wanted the rest of the property divided so George’s daughters would be provided for—because George didn’t leave anything. And that letter was the only thing they could convince him to sign.” “Why do you think Harvey hasn’t come? Where does he live?” “Oh, he lives in England—Sheffield—he’s a preacher there—he has never been to this country. He hasn’t had a lot of time—and besides, he might not have received the letter at all, you know.” “That’s too bad, too bad he couldn’t have lived to see his brothers, the poor man. You’re going to New Orleans, you say?” “Yes, but that’s only part of my trip. I’m boarding a ship next Wednesday for Rio de Janeiro, where my uncle lives.” “That’s a rather long journey. But it will be wonderful; I wish I were going. Is Mary Jane the oldest? How old are the others?” “Mary Jane is nineteen, Susan is fifteen, and Joanna is about fourteen—that’s the one who is devoted to charity work and has a hare-lip.” “Poor girls! To be left alone in the world like that.” “Well, their situation could be worse. Old Peter had friends, and they won’t let anything bad happen to them. There’s Hobson, the Baptist preacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley, and—well, there are many of them; but these are the ones Peter was closest to, and used to write about sometimes in his letters home; so Harvey will know where to find friends when he arrives.” The old man continued asking questions until he had gotten all the information possible from that young fellow. I’ll be darned if he didn’t ask about everyone and everything in that entire town, and all about the Wilks family; and about Peter’s profession—which was a tanner; and about George’s—which was a carpenter; and about Harvey’s—which was a dissenting minister; and so on and so on. Then he said: “Why did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat landing?” “Because it’s a large New Orleans boat, and I was afraid she might not stop there. When they are heavily loaded, they won’t stop just for a hail. A Cincinnati boat will, but this one is from St. Louis.” “Was Peter Wilks wealthy?” “Oh, yes, reasonably well-off. He owned houses and land, and it’s estimated he left three or four thousand dollars in cash hidden somewhere.” “When did you say he passed away?” “I didn’t say, but it was last night.” “The funeral is tomorrow, likely?” “Yes, around the middle of the day.” “Well, it’s all terribly sad; but we all have to face it, sooner or later. So what we need to do is be prepared; then we’re okay.” “Yes, sir, that’s the best approach. My mother always used to say that.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The king told me to steer the boat onto the shore, which I did. He then asked a young man where he was headed, and the young man replied that he was headed to the steamboat going to Orleans. The king invited him aboard and said his servant (meaning me) would help with the luggage. I helped him, and the three of us continued on. The young man thanked us, mentioning how hard it was to carry his bags in such weather. He asked the king where he was going, and the king replied that he had come from another village that morning and was going upriver a few miles to visit an old friend on a farm. The young man mistook the king for someone named Mr. Wilks but then decided he must be wrong, as Mr. Wilks wouldn’t be paddling upriver. He asked if the king was Mr. Wilks, but the king said his name was Reverend Alexander Blodgett, though he was sorry Mr. Wilks might have missed something important. The young man explained that Mr. Wilks hadn’t missed any inheritance but had missed seeing his dying brother Peter, though his brother really wanted to see him before he died. Mary Jane, Susan, and Joanna are Peter's nieces, with Mary Jane being nineteen, Susan fifteen, and Joanna about fourteen and charitable despite having a cleft lip. The family isn't alone since Peter had many friends in town who will look after the girls. The king kept asking the young man about the Wilks family, their jobs, and town affairs, eventually learning that Peter was fairly wealthy and died last night, with the funeral scheduled for midday tomorrow. They discussed how sad it all was and agreed that it's important to be prepared for death, as everyone must face it eventually."

They hugged each other, leaning their chins on each other’s shoulders, crying for several minutes—more than I’d ever seen anyone cry before. And, unbelievably, everyone else was just as emotional. The atmosphere was so tearful and sorrowful, I had never seen anything like it. Then, one took a place on either side of the coffin, knelt down, bowed their heads, and pretended to pray. This act deeply moved the crowd, who all broke down into loud sobs, including the poor girls. Almost every woman went up to the girls, wordlessly kissed them on the forehead, placed a hand on their heads, gazed upwards with tears streaming down, and then broke down sobbing, making way for the next woman to do the same. To me, the whole scene was completely revolting."

And everybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes, and most shook the hands off of them frauds, saying all the time:\n“You dear good souls!—how lovely!—how could you!”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The Duke proposed, \"Listen, I have another idea. Let's go upstairs, count this money, and then give it to the girls.\" The King reacted with great enthusiasm, saying, \"My heavens, Duke, let me hug you! That's the most brilliant idea anyone has ever had. You truly have the most amazing mind I've ever encountered. This is the perfect strategy, absolutely no doubt about it. Let them bring their suspicions now if they wish—this will completely silence them.\" Once we went upstairs, everyone gathered around the table. The King counted the money, arranging it into twenty neat stacks of three hundred dollars each. Everyone gazed at it with eager anticipation and licked their lips. They then put it back into the bag, and I saw the King preparing to make another speech. He began, \"Friends, my poor brother lying there was incredibly generous towards those left behind in this time of sorrow. He was generous to these poor young children whom he loved and protected, and who are now orphaned. And we who knew him know that he would have been even more generous if he hadn't been concerned about upsetting his dear William and me. Isn't that true? There's no question about it in my mind. So then, what kind of brothers would we be to interfere with his wishes at a time like this? And what kind of uncles would we be to steal—yes, steal—from such poor, sweet children that he loved so much, at this moment? If I know William—and I believe I do—he—well, I'll just ask him.\" He turned and started making many hand signals to the Duke. The Duke looked at him blankly and confused for a while. Then, suddenly, he seemed to grasp the King's meaning and jumped towards the King, making loud joyful sounds, and hugged him vigorously about fifteen times before stopping. The King then announced, \"I knew it; I believe that reaction will convince anyone how he feels about it. Here, Mary Jane, Susan, Joanna, take the money—take all of it. It is a gift from the one lying there, cold but content.\" Mary Jane rushed to hug the King, while Susan and the girl with the cleft lip rushed to hug the Duke. There followed a scene of such hugging and kissing as I had never witnessed. Everyone crowded around with tears in their eyes, practically shaking the hands off those fakes, repeatedly saying, \"You dear, kind souls!—how wonderful!—how could you be so good!\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The duke said, \"Hey, I've got another idea: let's go upstairs, count the money, and then give it to the girls.\" The king replied, excitedly, \"That's the best idea ever! You're brilliant. No one will suspect a thing after this.\" Once upstairs, everyone gathered around a table while the king counted the money into twenty neat stacks of three hundred dollars each. Everyone stared hungrily at the piles before they were put back into the bag. The king then began to address the crowd, saying that their late brother had been very generous to his nieces, and if he wasn't afraid of upsetting his brothers, he would have done even more. He then argued that no decent brothers or uncles would stand in the way or steal from the girls. He pretended to confer with the duke, who acted overjoyed and hugged him repeatedly. The king then told the girls to take all the money, calling it a gift from their deceased uncle. Mary Jane hugged the king, while Susan and Joanna hugged the duke. Everyone else cried and shook the men's hands, praising them for their kindness and generosity."

He's asking me to invite everyone to the funeral—wants me to make them all feel welcome. But he didn't need to worry—that's exactly what I was already doing.\" He then resumed his speech, completely composed, and continued inserting 'funeral orgies' into his remarks every now and then, just as before.

The hare-lip she got to pumping me about England, and blest if I didn’t think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes. She says:\n“Did you ever see the king?”\n“Who? William Fourth? Well, I bet I have—he goes to our church.” I knowed he was dead years ago, but I never let on. So when I says he goes to our church, she says:\n“What—regular?”\n“Yes—regular. His pew’s right over opposite ourn—on t’other side the pulpit.”\n“I thought he lived in London?”\n“Well, he does. Where would he live?”\n“But I thought you lived in Sheffield?”\nI see I was up a stump. I had to let on to get choked with a chicken bone, so as to get time to think how to get down again. Then I says:\n“I mean he goes to our church regular when he’s in Sheffield. That’s only in the summer time, when he comes there to take the sea baths.”\n“Why, how you talk—Sheffield ain’t on the sea.”\n“Well, who said it was?”\n“Why, you did.”\n“I didn’t nuther.”\n“You did!”\n“I didn’t.”\n“You did.”\n“I never said nothing of the kind.”\n“Well, what did you say, then?”\n“Said he come to take the sea baths—that’s what I said.”\n“Well, then, how’s he going to take the sea baths if it ain’t on the sea?”\n“Looky here,” I says; “did you ever see any Congress-water?”\n“Yes.”\n“Well, did you have to go to Congress to get it?”\n“Why, no.”\n“Well, neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea bath.”\n“How does he get it, then?”\n“Gets it the way people down here gets Congress-water—in barrels. There in the palace at Sheffield they’ve got furnaces, and he wants his water hot. They can’t bile that amount of water away off there at the sea. They haven’t got no conveniences for it.”\n“Oh, I see, now. You might a said that in the first place and saved time.”\nWhen she said that I see I was out of the woods again, and so I was comfortable and glad. Next, she says:\n“Do you go to church, too?”\n“Yes—regular.”\n“Where do you set?”\n“Why, in our pew.”\n“Whose pew?”\n“Why, ourn—your Uncle Harvey’s.”\n“His’n? What does he want with a pew?”\n“Wants it to set in. What did you reckon he wanted with it?”\n“Why, I thought he’d be in the pulpit.”\nRot him, I forgot he was a preacher. I see I was up a stump again, so I played another chicken bone and got another think. Then I says:\n“Blame it, do you suppose there ain’t but one preacher to a church?”\n“Why, what do they want with more?”\n“What!—to preach before a king? I never did see such a girl as you. They don’t have no less than seventeen.”\n“Seventeen! My land! Why, I wouldn’t set out such a string as that, not if I never got to glory. It must take ’em a week.”\n“Shucks, they don’t all of ’em preach the same day—only one of ’em.”\n“Well, then, what does the rest of ’em do?”\n“Oh, nothing much. Loll around, pass the plate—and one thing or another. But mainly they don’t do nothing.”\n“Well, then, what are they for?”\n“Why, they’re for style. Don’t you know nothing?”\n“Well, I don’t want to know no such foolishness as that. How is servants treated in England? Do they treat ’em better ’n we treat our niggers?”\n“No! A servant ain’t nobody there. They treat them worse than dogs.”\n“Don’t they give ’em holidays, the way we do, Christmas and New Year’s week, and Fourth of July?”\n“Oh, just listen! A body could tell you hain’t ever been to England by that. Why, Hare-l—why, Joanna, they never see a holiday from year’s end to year’s end; never go to the circus, nor theater, nor nigger shows, nor nowheres.”\n“Nor church?”\n“Nor church.”\n“But you always went to church.”\nWell, I was gone up again. I forgot I was the old man’s servant. But next minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was different from a common servant and had to go to church whether he wanted to or not, and set with the family, on account of its being the law.

The harelip girl started asking me a lot of questions about England, and honestly, there were times I felt like I was barely keeping my story straight. She asked, \"Have you ever seen the king?\" I replied, \"Which one? William the Fourth? Absolutely – he attends our church.\" I knew he had died years ago, but I pretended otherwise. When I said he attended our church, she questioned, \"Regularly?\" I confirmed, \"Yes, regularly. His family pew is directly across from ours, on the other side of the pulpit.\" She seemed confused, \"But I thought he lived in London?\" I responded, \"Well, he does. Where else would he live?\" She pressed, \"But I thought *you* lived in Sheffield?\" I realized I was in a tough spot. To gain time to think of a way out, I pretended to choke on a chicken bone. After recovering, I explained, \"What I meant is, he attends our church regularly when he's in Sheffield. That's only during the summer, when he visits to take the sea baths.\" She challenged, \"But that doesn't make sense – Sheffield isn't by the sea.\" I asked, \"Well, who claimed it was?\" She insisted, \"You did.\" I denied it, \"No, I didn't either.\" \"You did!\" she repeated. \"I didn't.\" \"You did.\" \"I never said anything like that.\" \"Fine, then what *did* you say?\" I stated, \"I said he came to take the sea baths – that's precisely what I said.\" \"Okay, then how is he supposed to take sea baths if it's not located by the sea?\" I then asked her, \"Look here, have you ever encountered Congress water?\" She replied, \"Yes.\" \"And did you have to travel to Congress to get it?\" \"Of course not.\" \"Well, in the same way, William the Fourth doesn't have to go to the sea to take a sea bath.\" \"Then how does he get it?\" she asked. \"He gets it the way people here get Congress water – delivered in barrels. At the palace in Sheffield, they have furnaces, and he likes his water hot. They couldn't possibly boil that much water way off at the coast. They don't have the proper facilities there.\" \"Oh, I understand now,\" she said. \"You could have explained that initially and saved us time.\" When she said that, I knew I was safe again and felt relieved and happy. Next, she asked, \"Do you attend church as well?\" \"Yes, regularly,\" I replied. \"Where do you sit?\" \"Why, in our family pew.\" \"*Whose* pew?\" \"Why, *ours* – your Uncle Harvey's.\" \"*His*? What does *he* need a pew for?\" \"He needs it to sit in. What did you *imagine* he needed it for?\" \"Well, I assumed he'd be in the pulpit.\" Curse it, I had forgotten he was supposed to be a preacher. I was trapped again, so I faked another chicken bone incident to give myself time to think. Then I said, \"Honestly, do you really think there's only one preacher in an English church?\" She asked, \"Why would they need more?\" \"What! – To preach before a king? You're the most naive girl I've ever met. They have no fewer than seventeen!\" \"Seventeen! Goodness gracious! I wouldn't listen to that many sermons, even if it meant getting to heaven. It must take them a week.\" \"Nonsense, they don't *all* preach on the same day – just *one* of them does.\" \"Okay, then what do the rest of them do?\" \"Oh, not much. They just lounge around, help pass the collection plate, and so on. But mostly, they don't do anything.\" \"Alright, then what purpose do they serve?\" \"Why, they're for *show*. Don't you know anything?\" \"Well, I certainly don't *want* to know such silliness. How are servants treated in England? Are they treated better than we treat our enslaved people?\" \"No! A servant is nobody there. They treat them worse than dogs.\" \"Don't they get holidays, the way we do, like Christmas, New Year's week, and the Fourth of July?\" \"Oh, listen to yourself! Anyone can tell you've never been to England from that question. Why, Hare-l – why, Joanna, they never get a holiday from one year to the next; they never go to the circus, or the theater, or minstrel shows, or anywhere.\" \"Not even church?\" \"Not even church.\" \"But *you* always went to church.\" Well, I was caught out again. I had forgotten I was supposed to be the old man's servant. But the next moment, I launched into some sort of explanation about how a valet was different from a typical servant and was legally required to go to church with the family, whether he wanted to or not.

I told her I had—meaning King William IV—and that he went to our church, even though I knew he had died years before. She wondered if he attended every week, and I said yes, explaining that his seat was right across from ours in church. When she questioned how that made sense since he lived in London and I supposedly lived in Sheffield, I got nervous and pretended to choke so I had time to think. I finally said he only went to our church during the summer when he visited for the sea baths. She pointed out that Sheffield isn't by the sea, and I denied saying it was. When she pressed me, I argued that people can get sea water delivered in barrels, just like they get Congress water, and so the king gets sea baths at the palace that way. She accepted this explanation, so I felt relieved. Next, she asked if I went to church, and where we sat. I told her we sat in our own pew, meaning her Uncle Harvey’s. She was confused because she thought a preacher would be in the pulpit, not in a pew. I had forgotten I was claiming her uncle was a preacher, so I stalled again, then said there were many preachers at the church—seventeen in all—but only one preached each week, the others mostly did nothing and were there for appearances. She thought that was silly. Then she asked if servants in England were treated better than enslaved people here, and I said no, that servants in England are treated even worse. She asked if they get holidays, but I told her they never got time off or went anywhere fun, not even church. She thought that was odd since I’d said I went to church. Realizing my mistake, I quickly made up a story that valets were different from regular servants and had to go to church with the family by law, but I could see she wasn’t entirely convinced."

Seeing it was just a dictionary, I did as she asked, putting my hand on it and saying it. She seemed somewhat more satisfied then and said she would believe some parts but declared emphatically she would not believe the rest. Mary Jane entered with Susan behind her and asked Joe what she wouldn't believe. Mary Jane told her it was neither right nor kind to speak that way to a stranger so far from his home and family, asking how she would like to be treated similarly. Joe (addressing Mary Jane as Maim) replied that this was always her way, always rushing in to help someone before they were actually hurt. She claimed she hadn't harmed him, only suggested he had likely exaggerated some things, and she wouldn't accept all of it. She insisted that was all she had said and believed he could handle such a minor comment. Mary Jane countered that the significance of the comment, whether big or small, didn't matter; he was a stranger in their house, and her comment was unkind. She added that if Joe were in his position, she would feel ashamed, so she shouldn't say things that would make another person feel that way. Joe began to say, 'But, Mam, he said...' Mary Jane interrupted, stating that what he said made no difference; that wasn't the point. The crucial thing was for Joe to treat him kindly and avoid saying things that would remind him he wasn't in his own country among his own people. I thought to myself, this is a sweet girl that I am allowing that wicked man (the King or Duke) to rob of her money! Then Susan entered the fray energetically, and I swear, she gave Hare-lip (presumably Joe) a severe tongue-lashing! I thought again, and this is another person I'm letting him steal money from! Then Mary Jane took another turn, speaking gently and sweetly as was her nature, but by the time she finished, poor Hare-lip had almost nothing left to say for herself. So, she cried out in protest. The other girls then told Joe, 'All right, then, you must apologize to him.' She did apologize, and she did it beautifully. Her apology was so lovely to hear, I wished I had told her a thousand lies just so she would have to apologize again. I thought to myself once more, this is yet another person I am letting him rob.

Mary Jane walked in with Susan and defended me, saying it wasn’t right to question a stranger like that or make him feel unwanted. The other girl, Hare-lip (Joanna), argued back, saying she was just being cautious and didn’t believe all my stories, but meant no harm. Mary Jane insisted it didn’t matter what I’d said—it mattered that Hare-lip acted kindly. I started to feel guilty, thinking how these good-hearted girls didn’t deserve to have their money stolen. Then Susan supported Mary Jane, scolding Hare-lip, and finally, Hare-lip apologized to me so sincerely I almost wished I could keep hearing her talk.

Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane? No—I dasn’t do it. Her face would give them a hint, sure; they’ve got the money, and they’d slide right out and get away with it. If she was to fetch in help I’d get mixed up in the business before it was done with, I judge. No; there ain’t no good way but one. I got to steal that money, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won’t suspicion that I done it. They’ve got a good thing here, and they ain’t a-going to leave till they’ve played this family and this town for all they’re worth, so I’ll find a chance time enough. I’ll steal it and hide it; and by-and-by, when I’m away down the river, I’ll write a letter and tell Mary Jane where it’s hid.

Once I was by myself, I began reviewing the whole situation. I asked myself, should I approach that doctor in secret and expose these impostors? No, that wouldn't work. He might reveal my identity, and then the king and the duke would make things difficult for me. Should I go privately and tell Mary Jane? No, I wouldn't dare. Her reaction would surely tip them off; they have the money, and they'd quickly leave and get away with it. If she were to involve others, I reckon I'd get mixed up in the mess before it was resolved. No, there's only one sensible course of action. I have to steal that money, somehow; and I have to steal it in a way that they won't suspect me. They've got a profitable scheme going here, and they aren't going to leave until they've exploited this family and this town for everything they're worth, so I'll find an opportunity in due course. I'll steal it and hide it; and eventually, when I'm far down the river, I'll write a letter and tell Mary Jane where it's hidden. But I ought to hide it tonight if I can, because maybe the doctor hasn't eased up as much as he seems to have; he could still frighten them away from here.",

Once I was alone, I started thinking the situation through. I asked myself if I should secretly go to the doctor and expose these scammers. But no, that wouldn’t work—the doctor might reveal who told him, and then the king and the duke would come after me. Then I considered telling Mary Jane in private. But that wouldn't do either; the look on her face would probably tip them off, and since they already had the money, they'd just take off and get away with it. If she called for help, I’d probably get caught up in everything before it was over. So, the only real option I could see was to steal the money myself—and do it in a way so that they wouldn’t suspect me. The king and the duke had a good setup going, and they wouldn’t leave until they’d gotten everything they could out of the family and the town, so I figured I’d have time to find an opportunity. I planned to steal the money and hide it, and then, once I was far away down the river, I’d send Mary Jane a letter telling her where it was. But I thought I’d better stash it tonight if I could, because there was a chance the doctor wasn’t as relaxed as he seemed—he might still drive the king and the duke away."

Upstairs the hall was dark, but I found the duke’s room, and started to paw around it with my hands; but I recollected it wouldn’t be much like the king to let anybody else take care of that money but his own self; so then I went to his room and begun to paw around there. But I see I couldn’t do nothing without a candle, and I dasn’t light one, of course. So I judged I’d got to do the other thing—lay for them and eavesdrop. About that time I hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the bed; I reached for it, but it wasn’t where I thought it would be; but I touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane’s frocks, so I jumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still.\nThey come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done was to get down and look under the bed. Then I was glad I hadn’t found the bed when I wanted it. And yet, you know, it’s kind of natural to hide under the bed when you are up to anything private. They sets down then, and the king says:\n“Well, what is it? And cut it middlin’ short, because it’s better for us to be down there a-whoopin’ up the mournin’ than up here givin’ ’em a chance to talk us over.”\n“Well, this is it, Capet. I ain’t easy; I ain’t comfortable. That doctor lays on my mind. I wanted to know your plans. I’ve got a notion, and I think it’s a sound one.”\n“What is it, duke?”\n“That we better glide out of this before three in the morning, and clip it down the river with what we’ve got. Specially, seeing we got it so easy—given back to us, flung at our heads, as you may say, when of course we allowed to have to steal it back. I’m for knocking off and lighting out.”\nThat made me feel pretty bad. About an hour or two ago it would a been a little different, but now it made me feel bad and disappointed, The king rips out and says:\n“What! And not sell out the rest o’ the property? March off like a passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous’n’ dollars’ worth o’ property layin’ around jest sufferin’ to be scooped in?—and all good, salable stuff, too.”\nThe duke he grumbled; said the bag of gold was enough, and he didn’t want to go no deeper—didn’t want to rob a lot of orphans of everything they had.\n“Why, how you talk!” says the king. “We sha’n’t rob ’em of nothing at all but jest this money. The people that buys the property is the suff’rers; because as soon ’s it’s found out ’at we didn’t own it—which won’t be long after we’ve slid—the sale won’t be valid, and it’ll all go back to the estate. These yer orphans ’ll git their house back agin, and that’s enough for them; they’re young and spry, and k’n easy earn a livin’. They ain’t a-goin to suffer. Why, jest think—there’s thous’n’s and thous’n’s that ain’t nigh so well off. Bless you, they ain’t got noth’n’ to complain of.”\nWell, the king he talked him blind; so at last he give in, and said all right, but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay, and that doctor hanging over them. But the king says:\n“Cuss the doctor! What do we k’yer for him? Hain’t we got all the fools in town on our side? And ain’t that a big enough majority in any town?”",

The upstairs hallway was dark, but I located the duke's room and started feeling around with my hands. However, I remembered it wasn't likely the king would trust anyone but himself with the money, so I then went to his room and began searching there. I quickly realized I couldn't find anything without a candle, and of course, I dared not light one. So, I concluded I had to do the alternative – wait for them and listen in. Just then, I heard their footsteps approaching and planned to quickly get under the bed. I reached for it, but it wasn't where I expected; instead, I touched the curtain that concealed Mary Jane's dresses. I instantly slipped behind it and nestled among the gowns, standing perfectly still. They entered and closed the door. The very first thing the duke did was kneel down and check under the bed. I was certainly relieved then that I hadn't found the bed when I needed to hide. Yet, you know, it's a natural instinct to hide under the bed when you're involved in something secretive. They sat down, and the king said, \"Alright, what is it? And keep it reasonably brief, because it's better for us to be downstairs putting on a show of grief than up here giving people a chance to gossip about us.\" The duke replied, \"Well, here it is, Capet. I'm uneasy; I'm not comfortable. That doctor is bothering me. I wanted to know your plans. I have an idea, and I think it's a good one.\" \"What is it, duke?\" asked the king. \"That we should quietly leave here before three in the morning and hurry down the river with what we have. Especially considering how easily we got it – essentially given back to us, practically thrown at us, you could say, when we fully expected to have to steal it back. I'm in favor of stopping now and leaving.\" That news made me feel quite bad. An hour or two earlier it might have felt slightly different, but now it made me feel miserable and disheartened. The king exploded, saying, \"What! And not sell off the rest of the property? Just walk away like a bunch of fools and leave property worth eight or nine thousand dollars just sitting there begging to be taken? – and all of it good, marketable stuff, too.\" The duke grumbled, saying the bag of gold was enough and he didn't want to get any deeper – didn't want to completely rob a lot of orphans of everything they owned. \"Why, listen to you!\" said the king. \"We won't be robbing them of anything at all except just this money. The people who *buy* the property are the ones who will suffer; because as soon as it's discovered that we didn't own it – which won't be long after we've left – the sale won't be valid, and it will all return to the estate. These orphans will get their house back again, and that's sufficient for them; they are young and energetic and can easily earn a living. They are not going to suffer. Why, just think – there are thousands and thousands who are not nearly as well off. Believe me, they have nothing to complain about.\" Well, the king argued until the duke had no response; so finally, he agreed, saying alright, but adding that he believed staying was utterly foolish, especially with that doctor watching them. But the king said, \"To heck with the doctor! What do we care about him? Don't we have all the fools in town on our side? And isn't that a large enough majority in any town?\"",

I tucked the money-bag under the lid, just beyond where his hands were crossed, which gave me the creeps because they were so cold. Then I ran back across the room and hid behind the door. The person coming was Mary Jane. She went to the coffin very softly, knelt down, and looked in. Then she raised her handkerchief, and I saw she started to cry, even though I couldn't hear her, and her back was turned to me. I quietly slipped out, and as I passed the dining room, I decided to make sure the watchers hadn't seen me. So I looked through the crack, and everything was fine. They hadn't stirred.",

It was completely silent everywhere. I peeked through a gap in the dining-room door and saw that the men who were supposed to be watching the corpse were all fast asleep in their chairs. The door to the parlor, where the body was, was open, and there were candles burning in both rooms. I went by, saw there was nobody in the parlor except Peter's remains, so I kept moving; but the front door was locked and the key wasn't there. At that moment, I heard someone coming downstairs behind me. I ran into the parlor for a quick look around, and the only hiding spot for the bag I could see was in the coffin. The coffin lid was open about a foot, so I could see the dead man's face inside, covered by a wet cloth, and he was wrapped in a shroud. I slipped the money-bag under the lid, just beyond his folded hands, which gave me chills because they were so cold, and then I dashed back across the room to hide behind the door. The person coming was Mary Jane. She quietly went over to the coffin, knelt down, and looked inside; then she raised her handkerchief, and I realized she had started crying, although I couldn't hear her since her back was to me. I slipped out, and as I went past the dining-room, I made sure the men watching the corpse hadn't woken up; I looked through the crack, and saw everything was still fine. They hadn't moved."

I see the coffin lid was the way it was before, but I dasn’t go to look in under it, with folks around.\nThen the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls took seats in the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an hour the people filed around slow, in single rank, and looked down at the dead man’s face a minute, and some dropped in a tear, and it was all very still and solemn, only the girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent, and sobbing a little. There warn’t no other sound but the scraping of the feet on the floor and blowing noses—because people always blows them more at a funeral than they do at other places except church.\nWhen the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the last touches, and getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable, and making no more sound than a cat. He never spoke; he moved people around, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done it with nods, and signs with his hands. Then he took his place over against the wall. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever see; and there warn’t no more smile to him than there is to a ham.\nThey had borrowed a melodeum—a sick one; and when everything was ready a young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and colicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only one that had a good thing, according to my notion. Then the Reverend Hobson opened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was only one dog, but he made a most powerful racket, and he kept it up right along; the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait—you couldn’t hear yourself think. It was right down awkward, and nobody didn’t seem to know what to do. But pretty soon they see that long-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say, “Don’t you worry—just depend on me.” Then he stooped down and begun to glide along the wall, just his shoulders showing over the people’s heads. So he glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more and more outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had gone around two sides of the room, he disappears down cellar. Then in about two seconds we heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or two, and then everything was dead still, and the parson begun his solemn talk where he left off. In a minute or two here comes this undertaker’s back and shoulders gliding along the wall again; and so he glided and glided around three sides of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his mouth with his hands, and stretched his neck out towards the preacher, over the people’s heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, “He had a rat!” Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his place. You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people, because naturally they wanted to know. A little thing like that don’t cost nothing, and it’s just the little things that makes a man to be looked up to and liked. There warn’t no more popular man in town than what that undertaker was.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "By morning, when I went downstairs, the living room was closed off, and the people who had been watching overnight were gone. Only the family, Mrs. Bartley, and our group were left. I watched their faces closely, trying to see if anything unusual had occurred, but I couldn't tell. Around midday, the undertaker arrived with his assistant. They placed the coffin on two chairs in the center of the room, then arranged all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more from the neighbors until the hall, living room, and dining room were completely filled. I saw that the lid on the coffin was still positioned as it had been before, but with people around, I didn't dare lift it to look inside. Then, people began arriving in large numbers. The 'beats' and the girls took seats in the first row near the head of the coffin. For about half an hour, people slowly filed past, one by one, pausing for a moment to look down at the dead man's face. Some shed a tear. It was extremely quiet and serious, with the only sounds coming from the girls and the 'beats' who held handkerchiefs to their eyes, kept their heads bowed, and occasionally sobbed softly. The only other noises were the sound of feet shuffling on the floor and people blowing their noses – a common occurrence at funerals, even more so than in other places besides church. Once the room was completely full, the undertaker moved around in his black gloves with his smooth, comforting manner. He made final adjustments, ensuring everyone and everything was properly arranged and comfortable, making no more noise than a cat. He didn't speak but directed people with nods and hand gestures, squeezing in latecomers and creating paths. Then, he positioned himself against the wall. He was the quietest, most smoothly moving, and most secretive man I had ever seen; there was no more expression on his face than there is on a piece of ham. They had borrowed a melodeon, one that wasn't in good condition. When everything was ready, a young woman sat down and played it; it sounded quite squeaky and off-key. Everyone joined in the singing, and in my opinion, only Peter managed to sound decent. Then, Reverend Hobson began speaking slowly and solemnly. Just as he started, an incredibly loud commotion erupted from the cellar, the likes of which I'd never heard. It was just one dog, but it was making a tremendous racket, and it wouldn't stop. The preacher had to stand there by the coffin and wait; you couldn't even hear yourself think. It was incredibly awkward, and no one seemed to know what to do. But soon, they saw the tall undertaker signal to the preacher as if to say, 'Don't worry – leave it to me.' Then he bent down and began gliding along the wall, only his shoulders visible above people's heads. He continued gliding, and the noise and disturbance grew worse and worse. Finally, after going around two sides of the room, he disappeared into the cellar. About two seconds later, we heard a thud, and the dog let out an amazing howl or two before everything went completely silent. The preacher then resumed his serious talk from where he had stopped. In a minute or two, the undertaker's back and shoulders reappeared, gliding along the wall again. He glided along three sides of the room, then stood up, cupped his hands around his mouth, and stretched his neck out towards the preacher over everyone's heads, saying in a somewhat rough whisper, 'He had a rat!' Then he sank back down and glided back along the wall to his spot. You could see that this was a great relief to the people, as they naturally wanted to know what caused the disturbance. A small action like that costs nothing, but it's precisely these small things that earn a man respect and affection. There wasn't a more popular man in town than that undertaker.",

Some dropped tears, and the room was very quiet and serious, except for the girls and the ‘family’ sniffling, bowing their heads, and softly crying.

It was so loud the preacher had to stop, and nobody knew what to do. Soon, we saw the tall undertaker signal the preacher to trust him. He moved stealthily along the walls, just his shoulders visible above the crowd, working his way around the room as the noise continued. Eventually, he went down to the cellar. After a moment, we heard a loud thump, the dog gave a final howl, and then everything went silent. The minister resumed his speech.\n\nA minute later, the undertaker returned the same way, gliding along the wall, then stretched his neck toward the preacher and whispered, “He had a rat!” After that, he returned quietly to his place. People were clearly relieved and satisfied, since everyone had wondered what caused the commotion. That small act didn’t cost anything, but it’s little details like that which make people respect and like a man. No one in town was more well-liked than that undertaker."

A couple of nigger traders come along, and the king sold them the niggers reasonable, for three-day drafts as they called it, and away they went, the two sons up the river to Memphis, and their mother down the river to Orleans. I thought them poor girls and them niggers would break their hearts for grief; they cried around each other, and took on so it most made me down sick to see it. The girls said they hadn’t ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold away from the town. I can’t ever get it out of my memory, the sight of them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other’s necks and crying; and I reckon I couldn’t a stood it all, but would a had to bust out and tell on our gang if I hadn’t knowed the sale warn’t no account and the niggers would be back home in a week or two.\nThe thing made a big stir in the town, too, and a good many come out flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the children that way.

However, private purchases were permitted before the official sale. So, around noon the day after the funeral, the girls' initial happiness was shattered. Two enslaved people traders appeared, and the King sold the enslaved family members to them for what was termed 'three-day drafts' (promises of payment) at a seemingly low price. The family was immediately separated: the two sons were taken upriver to Memphis, and their mother was transported downriver to New Orleans. I believed the poor girls and the enslaved people would be utterly heartbroken by the separation; they wept and grieved together so intensely that it nearly made me feel ill to witness it. The girls confessed they had never imagined the family would be divided or sold away from the area. The image of those sorrowful girls and the enslaved individuals clinging to one another and weeping is something I can never forget. I doubt I could have endured the scene without revealing the King and Duke's deception, had I not known that the sale was invalid and the enslaved people would be returned in about a week or two. This event also caused significant upset in the town, with many people openly stating that separating the mother and children was outrageous. It did slightly harm the King and Duke's credibility, but the King stubbornly pressed forward with his plan, despite everything the Duke tried to say or do, and I can tell you, the Duke was extremely worried.",

The day after the funeral, around midday, the girls were hit hard for the first time. Two slave traders arrived and the king sold the slaves to them cheaply, agreeing to payment arrangements they called three-day drafts. The traders took the two sons up the river to Memphis and their mother down the river to Orleans. I really thought the poor girls and the slaves would die from heartbreak—they clung to each other, weeping and lamenting, and it made me feel sick to watch. The girls said they never imagined the family would be split up or sold away from their home. I’ll never forget seeing those unhappy girls and slaves holding each other and sobbing; I don’t think I could have endured it at all and would have confessed about our entire scheme, except that I knew the sale wasn’t real and the slaves would be home again in a week or two. The whole business caused an uproar in town, and many people declared it was disgraceful to separate a mother from her children like that. It damaged the con men’s reputations, but the old king stubbornly kept going ahead no matter what the duke said or did, though the duke was clearly very nervous about it."

Then the duke says:\n“What, all of them?”\n“No—leastways, not all at once—that is, I don’t think I ever see them all come out at once but just one time.”\n“Hello! When was that?”\n“It was the day we had the funeral. In the morning. It warn’t early, because I overslept. I was just starting down the ladder, and I see them.”\n“Well, go on, go on! What did they do? How’d they act?”\n“They didn’t do nothing. And they didn’t act anyway much, as fur as I see. They tiptoed away; so I seen, easy enough, that they’d shoved in there to do up your majesty’s room, or something, s’posing you was up; and found you warn’t up, and so they was hoping to slide out of the way of trouble without waking you up, if they hadn’t already waked you up.”\n“Great guns, this is a go!” says the king; and both of them looked pretty sick and tolerable silly. They stood there a-thinking and scratching their heads a minute, and the duke he bust into a kind of a little raspy chuckle, and says:\n“It does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand. They let on to be sorry they was going out of this region! And I believed they was sorry, and so did you, and so did everybody. Don’t ever tell me any more that a nigger ain’t got any histrionic talent. Why, the way they played that thing it would fool anybody. In my opinion, there’s a fortune in ’em. If I had capital and a theater, I wouldn’t want a better lay-out than that—and here we’ve gone and sold ’em for a song. Yes, and ain’t privileged to sing the song yet. Say, where is that song—that draft?”\n“In the bank for to be collected. Where would it be?”\n“Well, that’s all right then, thank goodness.”\nSays I, kind of timid-like:\n“Is something gone wrong?”\nThe king whirls on me and rips out:\n“None o’ your business! You keep your head shet, and mind y’r own affairs—if you got any. Long as you’re in this town don’t you forgit that—you hear?” Then he says to the duke, “We got to jest swaller it and say noth’n’: mum’s the word for us.”\nAs they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again, and says:\n“Quick sales and small profits! It’s a good business—yes.”\nThe king snarls around on him and says:\n“I was trying to do for the best in sellin’ ’em out so quick. If the profits has turned out to be none, lackin’ considable, and none to carry, is it my fault any more’n it’s yourn?”\n“Well, they’d be in this house yet and we wouldn’t if I could a got my advice listened to.”\nThe king sassed back as much as was safe for him, and then swapped around and lit into me again.

And then waltzed in and cussed himself awhile, and said it all come of him not laying late and taking his natural rest that morning, and he’d be blamed if he’d ever do it again.

Early in the morning, the king and the duke came up to the attic where I was sleeping and woke me. Their expressions showed they were facing a problem. The king immediately asked if I had been in his room the night before last. I replied, \"No, your majesty,\" which is what I always called him when only our group was around. He then asked if I had been in there yesterday or last night. I said no again. He pressed me to tell the honest truth, with no lies. I assured him, \"Honor bright, your majesty, I'm telling the truth. I haven't been near your room since Miss Mary Jane showed it to you and the duke.\" The duke then asked if I had seen anyone else go into the room. I responded, \"No, your grace, not that I recall.\" He told me to stop and think. I paused and realized this was my opportunity. I said, \"Well, I did see the enslaved people go in there several times.\" Both of them flinched slightly and looked surprised, as if they hadn't considered that possibility, and then as if they had. The duke asked, \"What, all of them?\" I clarified, \"No—at least, not all at once. I don't think I ever saw them all come out at once except just one time.\" \"Oh! When was that?\" they asked. I explained, \"It was the day of the funeral, in the morning. It wasn't early because I had overslept. I was just starting down the ladder and saw them.\" \"Well, hurry, tell us! What did they do? How did they act?\" they urged. I said, \"They didn't really do anything. And they didn't act much differently, as far as I could tell. They tiptoed away. It was obvious enough that they had slipped in there to clean your majesty's room, assuming you were awake, found you weren't, and were hoping to sneak out without waking you, if they hadn't already.\" \"Good heavens, this is a mess!\" the king exclaimed. Both of them looked quite unwell and rather foolish. They stood there thinking and scratching their heads for a moment. Then the duke let out a sort of small, harsh chuckle and said, \"It's incredible how smartly those enslaved people played their hand. They pretended to be sad about leaving this area! And I believed they were sad, and so did you, and so did everyone else. Never tell me again that an enslaved person doesn't have acting ability. The way they pulled that off would deceive anyone. In my opinion, they'd be worth a fortune in a theater. If I had money and a theater, I wouldn't want a better setup than that—and here we've gone and sold them for next to nothing. Yes, and we haven't even collected that small amount yet. Speaking of that, where is that money—that draft?\" The king replied, \"It's in the bank, ready to be collected. Where else would it be?\" \"Well, that's a relief then, thank goodness,\" said the duke. I asked, somewhat timidly, \"Is something wrong?\" The king spun around and snapped at me, \"None of your concern! You keep your mouth shut and mind your own business—if you have any. Don't forget that as long as you're in this town—do you hear?\" Then he turned to the duke and said, \"We just have to accept it and say nothing. Silence is best for us.\" As they started down the ladder, the duke chuckled again and said, \"Quick sales and tiny profits! It's a fine business—yes.\" The king snarled back at him, \"I was trying to do what was best by selling them so quickly. If the profits turned out to be next to nothing, and none to keep, is it my fault any more than yours?\" The duke retorted, \"Well, they'd still be in this house, and we wouldn't have this problem, if you had listened to my advice.\" The king argued back as much as he safely could, then turned on me again. He severely reprimanded me for not coming and telling him that I had seen the enslaved people acting that way coming out of his room—he said any fool would have known something was wrong. And then he began cursing himself for a while, saying it all happened because he didn't sleep in and get his natural rest that morning, and swore he'd never do it again. So they went off arguing. And I felt extremely glad that I had managed to shift the blame onto the enslaved people, and yet hadn't caused them any harm by it (since they were already gone).",

The king asked if I’d been in his room two nights before. I said \"No, your majesty,\" which is how I addressed him when it was just our group. He asked if I’d been in his room yesterday or last night, and I denied it again. He pressed me to tell the truth, and I insisted I was honest and said I hadn't been near his room since Mary Jane had shown him and the duke around.\n\nThe duke asked if I’d seen anyone else go in. I replied that, as far as I could remember, I hadn't, but he urged me to think harder. After thinking it over, I said I had seen the slaves enter the room several times. Both the king and the duke looked surprised, but also like they understood. The duke asked if all the slaves went in together. I clarified that not all at once—they hadn’t all come out together except maybe one time, the morning of the funeral, which I described because I had overslept and was just coming down the ladder when I saw them. They, I said, didn’t do anything strange except tiptoe away quietly, which made me think they’d just snuck in to tidy up the king’s room, found he wasn’t up yet, and were trying to avoid getting in trouble for possibly waking him.\n\nThe king commented with dismay, and both of them looked sick and pretty foolish. The duke started to laugh and said the slaves had played their roles well, pretending to be upset about being sold. The duke even said they could've made a fortune with their acting skills if he’d had a theater and the money. He lamented that now they had sold them for almost nothing. He asked about the payment—the \"song\"—and the king said the money was in the bank. The duke seemed relieved.\n\nI timidly asked if something was wrong, and the king turned on me, telling me it was none of my business and that I should mind my own affairs. He reminded me not to forget my place while in town. Then he told the duke they should keep quiet about the situation.\n\nAs they left, the duke joked about quick sales and small profits. The king defended his decision to sell the slaves quickly, arguing that he did his best. The duke retorted that if his advice had been followed, things might have turned out differently. Afterwards, the king scolded me for not telling him about seeing the slaves leaving his room, saying anyone should have realized something was off. He then blamed himself for sleeping in and swore never to do it again. They left, arguing.

          "text_segment": "By-and-by it was getting-up time. So I come down the ladder and started for down-stairs; but as I come to the girls’ room the door was open, and I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk, which was open and she’d been packing things in it—getting ready to go to England. But she had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap, and had her face in her hands, crying. I felt awful bad to see it; of course anybody would. I went in there and says:\n“Miss Mary Jane, you can’t a-bear to see people in trouble, and I can’t—most always. Tell me about it.”\nSo she done it. And it was the niggers—I just expected it. She said the beautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for her; she didn’t know how she was ever going to be happy there, knowing the mother and the children warn’t ever going to see each other no more—and then busted out bitterer than ever, and flung up her hands, and says:\n“Oh, dear, dear, to think they ain’t ever going to see each other any more!”\n“But they will—and inside of two weeks—and I know it!” says I.\nLaws, it was out before I could think! And before I could budge she throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it again, say it again, say it again!\nI see I had spoke too sudden and said too much, and was in a close place. I asked her to let me think a minute; and she set there, very impatient and excited and handsome, but looking kind of happy and eased-up, like a person that’s had a tooth pulled out. So I went to studying it out. I says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks, though I ain’t had no experience, and can’t say for certain; but it looks so to me, anyway; and yet here’s a case where I’m blest if it don’t look to me like the truth is better and actuly safer than a lie. I must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time or other, it’s so kind of strange and unregular. I never see nothing like it. Well, I says to myself at last, I’m a-going to chance it; I’ll up and tell the truth this time, though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see where you’ll go to. Then I says:\n“Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways where you could go and stay three or four days?”\n“Yes; Mr. Lothrop’s. Why?”\n“Never mind why yet. If I’ll tell you how I know the niggers will see each other again inside of two weeks—here in this house—and prove how I know it—will you go to Mr. Lothrop’s and stay four days?”\n“Four days!” she says; “I’ll stay a year!”\n“All right,” I says, “I don’t want nothing more out of you than just your word—I druther have it than another man’s kiss-the-Bible.” She smiled and reddened up very sweet, and I says, “If you don’t mind it, I’ll shut the door—and bolt it.”\nThen I come back and set down again, and says:\n“Don’t you holler. Just set still and take it like a man. I got to tell the truth, and you want to brace up, Miss Mary, because it’s a bad kind, and going to be hard to take, but there ain’t no help for it. These uncles of yourn ain’t no uncles at all; they’re a couple of frauds—regular dead-beats. There, now we’re over the worst of it, you can stand the rest middling easy.”\nIt jolted her up like everything, of course; but I was over the shoal water now, so I went right along, her eyes a-blazing higher and higher all the time, and told her every blame thing, from where we first struck that young fool going up to the steamboat, clear through to where she flung herself on to the king’s breast at the front door and he kissed her sixteen or seventeen times—and then up she jumps, with her face afire like sunset, and says:\n“The brute! Come, don’t waste a minute—not a second—we’ll have them tarred and feathered, and flung in the river!”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Eventually, it was time to wake up. So I climbed down the ladder and headed downstairs. As I passed the girls' room, the door was open, and I saw Mary Jane sitting by her old hair trunk, which was open for packing clothes—getting ready for her trip to England. But she had stopped, holding a folded dress in her lap, her face in her hands, crying. It made me feel terribly sad to see that; of course, anyone would. I went in there and said, \"Miss Mary Jane, you can't stand to see people in trouble, and neither can I, most of the time. Tell me about it.\"\n\nSo, she did. And it was about the enslaved people—just as I had expected. She said her wonderful trip to England was almost ruined for her; she didn't know how she could ever be happy there, knowing the mother and children would never see each other again. Then she burst out crying more bitterly than ever, threw up her hands, and said, \"Oh, dear, dear, to think they are *never* going to see each other again!\"\n\n\"But they *will*—within two weeks—and I *know* it!\" I said. Good heavens, it just came out before I could think! And before I could move, she threw her arms around my neck and told me to say it again, say it again, say it again!\n\nI realized I had spoken too quickly and revealed too much, putting myself in a difficult situation. I asked her to let me think for a minute; and she sat there, very impatient, excited, and beautiful, but looking somewhat happy and relieved, like a person who has had a tooth pulled out. So I started to figure things out. I said to myself, I suppose someone who suddenly tells the truth when they are in a tight spot is taking a considerable risk, although I have no experience and cannot say for certain; but it seems that way to me, anyway; and yet here is a case where I'll be blessed if it doesn't look to me like the truth is better and actually *safer* than a lie. I must remember this and think it over sometime or other, it's so strange and unusual. I never saw anything like it. Well, I finally said to myself, I am going to take the chance; I will go ahead and tell the truth this time, although it does seem very much like sitting down on a barrel of powder and igniting it just to see where you will end up. Then I said, \"Miss Mary Jane, is there a place a little way out of town where you could go and stay for three or four days?\"\n\n\"Yes; Mr. Lothrop’s. Why?\"\n\n\"Never mind why yet. If I tell you how I know the enslaved people will see each other again within two weeks—here in this house—and *prove* how I know it—will you go to Mr. Lothrop's and stay four days?\"\n\n\"Four days!\" she said; \"I'll stay a year!\"\n\n\"All right,\" I said, \"I don't want anything more from *you* than just your word—I would rather have it than another man's sworn promise.\" She smiled and blushed sweetly, and I said, \"If you don't mind, I'll close—and bolt—the door.\"\n\nThen I came back and sat down again, and said, \"Do not shout. Just sit still and take it like a strong person. I have to tell you the truth, and you need to brace yourself, Miss Mary, because it's a bad kind, and going to be hard to accept, but there is no help for it. These uncles of yours are not uncles at all; they are a couple of frauds—absolute swindlers. There, now we are past the worst of it, you can handle the rest fairly easily.\"\n\nIt completely jolted her, of course; but I was past the dangerous part now, so I went right on, her eyes blazing higher and higher all the time, and told her every single thing, from where we first met that foolish young man going up to the steamboat, clear through to where she threw herself onto the king's chest at the front door and he kissed her sixteen or seventeen times—and then she jumped up, her face red like a sunset, and said, \"The brute! Come, do not waste a minute—not a *second*—we'll have them tarred and feathered, and thrown in the river!\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Soon it was time to get up, so I climbed down the ladder and started heading downstairs. As I passed the girls’ room, I saw that the door was open. Mary Jane was sitting beside her old hair trunk, which was open while she packed her things in it, getting ready to leave for England. But now she had stopped packing—a folded dress resting in her lap—as she cried, hiding her face in her hands. Seeing her like that made me feel terrible, and I think anybody would have felt the same. I went in and said,\n\n\"Miss Mary Jane, you can’t stand to see people in trouble, and neither can I, usually. Please, tell me what’s wrong.\"\n\nSo she told me: it was about the enslaved family. I’d figured as much. She explained that her excitement for the beautiful England trip was ruined; she couldn’t imagine being happy there knowing the mother and children would never see each other again. Then she started crying even harder, throwing up her hands as she said,\n\n\"Oh dear, oh dear, to think they’ll never see each other again!\"\n\n\"But they will—within two weeks—I guarantee it!\" I blurted out.\n\nThat slipped out before I’d had a chance to think! And instantly, she jumped up and threw her arms around my neck, begging me to say it again and again.\n\nI realized I’d said too much and was now in a risky situation. I asked her to give me a moment to think, and she sat there—impatient, excited, and very pretty—but also relieved, like someone who’s just had a painful tooth pulled. I thought about it: sometimes telling the truth when you’re in a tough spot might be risky, but in this case, it seemed not just better but actually safer than lying. I filed this strange idea away in my mind for later. Finally, I decided to take the risk and tell her the truth, even though it felt like sitting on a powder keg and lighting the fuse just to see what would happen. So I said,\n\n\"Miss Mary Jane, is there anywhere nearby where you could stay for three or four days?\"\n\n\"Yes, at Mr. Lothrop’s place. Why?\"\n\n\"Never mind why for now. If I can explain how I know the family will be together again within two weeks—right here in this house—and prove it, will you go to Mr. Lothrop’s and stay four days?\"\n\n\"Four days! I’d stay a year!\" she replied.\n\n\"Good,\" I said, \"I don’t need anything from you but your word—that’s worth more to me than someone else’s oath on the Bible.\" She smiled and blushed sweetly, so I continued, \"If you don’t mind, I’ll close and lock the door.\"\n\nI came back and sat down again.\n\n\"Now, don’t shout. Just stay calm and take this like a grown-up. I have to tell you the truth, and you’ll need to brace yourself, Miss Mary, because it’s hard to hear. But there’s no help for it: those two uncles of yours aren’t your real uncles at all—they’re imposters, total swindlers. Now, that’s the worst part—so you can handle the rest easier.\"\n\nOf course, this shocked her, but since I was already so far in, I told her the whole story—the details from the time we met the young fool going to the steamboat all the way up to the scene at the front door when she hugged the king and he kissed her a bunch of times. Then she suddenly jumped up, her face burning with anger, and declared:\n\n\"That brute! Come on, don’t waste even a second—we’ll tar and feather them and throw them in the river!\""

You tell me what to do, and whatever you say I’ll do it.”\n“Well,” I says, “it’s a rough gang, them two frauds, and I’m fixed so I got to travel with them a while longer, whether I want to or not—I druther not tell you why; and if you was to blow on them this town would get me out of their claws, and I’d be all right; but there’d be another person that you don’t know about who’d be in big trouble. Well, we got to save him, hain’t we? Of course. Well, then, we won’t blow on them.”\nSaying them words put a good idea in my head. I see how maybe I could get me and Jim rid of the frauds; get them jailed here, and then leave. But I didn’t want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard to answer questions but me; so I didn’t want the plan to begin working till pretty late to-night. I says:\n“Miss Mary Jane, I’ll tell you what we’ll do, and you won’t have to stay at Mr. Lothrop’s so long, nuther. How fur is it?”\n“A little short of four miles—right out in the country, back here.”\n“Well, that’ll answer. Now you go along out there, and lay low till nine or half-past to-night, and then get them to fetch you home again—tell them you’ve thought of something. If you get here before eleven put a candle in this window, and if I don’t turn up wait till eleven, and then if I don’t turn up it means I’m gone, and out of the way, and safe. Then you come out and spread the news around, and get these beats jailed.”\n“Good,” she says, “I’ll do it.”\n“And if it just happens so that I don’t get away, but get took up along with them, you must up and say I told you the whole thing beforehand, and you must stand by me all you can.”\n“Stand by you! indeed I will. They sha’n’t touch a hair of your head!” she says, and I see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said it, too.\n“If I get away I sha’n’t be here,” I says, “to prove these rapscallions ain’t your uncles, and I couldn’t do it if I was here. I could swear they was beats and bummers, that’s all, though that’s worth something. Well, there’s others can do that better than what I can, and they’re people that ain’t going to be doubted as quick as I’d be. I’ll tell you how to find them. Gimme a pencil and a piece of paper. There—‘Royal Nonesuch, Bricksville.’ Put it away, and don’t lose it. When the court wants to find out something about these two, let them send up to Bricksville and say they’ve got the men that played the Royal Nonesuch, and ask for some witnesses—why, you’ll have that entire town down here before you can hardly wink, Miss Mary. And they’ll come a-biling, too.”\nI judged we had got everything fixed about right now. So I says:\n“Just let the auction go right along, and don’t worry. Nobody don’t have to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction on accounts of the short notice, and they ain’t going out of this till they get that money; and the way we’ve fixed it the sale ain’t going to count, and they ain’t going to get no money. It’s just like the way it was with the niggers—it warn’t no sale, and the niggers will be back before long. Why, they can’t collect the money for the niggers yet—they’re in the worst kind of a fix, Miss Mary.”\n“Well,” she says, “I’ll run down to breakfast now, and then I’ll start straight for Mr. Lothrop’s.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I replied, 'Certainly. But do you mean before you go to Mr. Lothrop’s, or—' 'Oh,' she exclaimed, realizing her mistake, and sat back down. 'Don't pay attention to what I said—please don't—you won't, will you?' she pleaded, laying her soft hand on mine in a way that made me feel I would die for her. 'I wasn't thinking, I was just so upset,' she said. 'Now, please continue, and I won't interrupt again. You tell me what to do, and I promise I'll do whatever you say.' 'Okay,' I said, 'those two con men are dangerous people, and I'm stuck traveling with them for a while longer, whether I like it or not—I'd rather not explain why. If you were to expose them, this town would rescue me from them, and I'd be safe. But there's another person you don't know about who would be in serious trouble. We have to save him, don't we? Of course. So, we won't expose them.' Saying that gave me a good idea. I saw how Jim and I might be able to get away from the con men by having them jailed here and then leaving. But I didn't want to run the raft during the day with only myself to answer questions, so I decided the plan shouldn't start until quite late tonight. I said, 'Miss Mary Jane, here's what we'll do, and you won't have to stay at Mr. Lothrop’s house for too long either. How far away is it?' 'Just under four miles—out in the countryside, behind us.' 'That'll work,' I said. 'Now, go out there and stay hidden until nine or nine-thirty tonight. Then, get them to bring you home—tell them you suddenly remembered something. If you get back before eleven, put a candle in this window. If I'm not here by then, wait until eleven. If I'm still not here at eleven, it means I've gotten away safely. Then, you can go out and tell everyone what happened, and get those scoundrels arrested.' 'Good,' she said, 'I'll do it.' 'And if I happen not to get away, but get caught along with them,' I added, 'you must immediately say I told you the whole story beforehand, and you must support me in every way you can.' 'Support you! Of course I will. They won't harm a single hair on your head!' she declared, and I saw her nostrils flare and her eyes flash as she said it. 'If I get away, I won't be here,' I explained, 'to prove these rascals aren't your uncles, and I couldn't prove that specific point even if I was here. I could only swear they are frauds and loafers, but that's something. However, others can do that better than I can, and they are people who won't be doubted as quickly as I would. I'll tell you how to find them.' I asked for a pencil and paper. 'Here,' I wrote, 'Royal Nonesuch, Bricksville.' 'Put it away and don't lose it. When the court needs information about these two, have them send word to Bricksville, say they have the men who performed the Royal Nonesuch, and ask for witnesses. Why, you'll have that whole town here before you can blink, Miss Mary. And they'll arrive furious, too.' I felt like we had arranged everything properly now. So I said, 'Just let the auction happen and don't worry. No one has to pay for what they buy until a full day after the auction because of the short notice, and the goods won't leave until they are paid for. The way we've planned it, the sale won't count, and they won't get any money. It's just like with the enslaved people—that wasn't a real sale, and they'll be back before long. The con men can't even collect the money for them yet—they are in a really bad situation, Miss Mary.' 'Alright,' she said, 'I'll go down for breakfast now, and then I'll head straight to Mr. Lothrop’s.'",

Don’t pay attention to what I said—please ignore it—will you?\" Then she gently put her hand on mine in such a way that I felt I would rather die than upset her. \"I wasn’t thinking clearly, I was just so worked up,\" she added. \"Now, go ahead, I won’t interrupt again. Just tell me what to do and I’ll follow your instructions.\"\n\nI replied, \"Those two crooks are a rough crowd, and I’m stuck traveling with them for a while, whether I like it or not—I’d rather not explain why. If you were to expose them, the people here would probably help me get away from them and I’d be safe, but there’s another person involved, someone you don’t know, who would get into serious trouble. We need to protect him, right? Of course we do. That means we can’t turn them in right now.\"\n\nAs I said that, I had an idea. Maybe I could get Jim and myself away from the con men—maybe even get them arrested, and then we could leave. But I didn’t want to take the raft out in daytime without anyone besides me to answer questions, so I didn’t want the plan to start until late tonight. I told her,\n\n\"Miss Mary Jane, here’s what we should do, and you won’t have to stay at Mr. Lothrop’s very long, either. How far is it?\"\n\n\"A little under four miles, out in the country,\" she replied.\n\n\"That’ll work.

That’s when you should tell everyone what happened and help get those crooks arrested.\"\n\n\"All right, I’ll do it,\" she said.\n\n\"Now, if things go wrong and I end up getting caught with them, you have to say that I told you everything in advance, and help me as much as you can.\"\n\n\"Help you? Absolutely. I won’t let them hurt you one bit!\" she replied fiercely, and I could see she meant it by the way her eyes flashed.\n\n\"If I get away, I won’t be here to prove those scoundrels aren’t your uncles, and I couldn’t do it even if I was here. I could swear they’re crooks, and that’s something, but there are others who could do it better than me—people others will believe more easily. I’ll tell you how to find them. Give me a pencil and some paper. There—write down ‘Royal Nonesuch, Bricksville.’ Keep it safe and don’t lose it. When the authorities want more information about those two, tell them to send a message to Bricksville that they’ve caught the ‘Royal Nonesuch’ performers and need witnesses. The whole town will come here quickly, Miss Mary, and they’ll come angry.\"\n\nI thought we had everything set up nicely now. So I said, \"Just let the auction go on and don’t worry. Nobody has to pay for their purchases until a day after the auction because of the short notice, so they won’t leave until they get their money. And with the way we’ve planned it, the sale won’t count and they won’t get any money. Same with the slaves—it wasn’t a real sale, and they’ll be back soon. They haven’t even collected the money for them; the crooks are really in a tough spot, Miss Mary.\"\n\nShe said, \"All right, I’ll get some breakfast now, and then I’ll go straight to Mr. Lothrop’s.\""

Do you reckon you can go and face your uncles when they come to kiss you good-morning, and never—”\n“There, there, don’t! Yes, I’ll go before breakfast—I’ll be glad to. And leave my sisters with them?”\n“Yes; never mind about them. They’ve got to stand it yet a while. They might suspicion something if all of you was to go. I don’t want you to see them, nor your sisters, nor nobody in this town; if a neighbor was to ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something. No, you go right along, Miss Mary Jane, and I’ll fix it with all of them. I’ll tell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles and say you’ve went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change, or to see a friend, and you’ll be back to-night or early in the morning.”\n“Gone to see a friend is all right, but I won’t have my love given to them.”\n“Well, then, it sha’n’t be.” It was well enough to tell her so—no harm in it. It was only a little thing to do, and no trouble; and it’s the little things that smooths people’s roads the most, down here below; it would make Mary Jane comfortable, and it wouldn’t cost nothing. Then I says: “There’s one more thing—that bag of money.”\n“Well, they’ve got that; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think how they got it.”\n“No, you’re out, there. They hain’t got it.”\n“Why, who’s got it?”\n“I wish I knowed, but I don’t. I had it, because I stole it from them; and I stole it to give to you; and I know where I hid it, but I’m afraid it ain’t there no more. I’m awful sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I’m just as sorry as I can be; but I done the best I could; I did honest. I come nigh getting caught, and I had to shove it into the first place I come to, and run—and it warn’t a good place.”\n“Oh, stop blaming yourself—it’s too bad to do it, and I won’t allow it—you couldn’t help it; it wasn’t your fault. Where did you hide it?”\nI didn’t want to set her to thinking about her troubles again; and I couldn’t seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach. So for a minute I didn’t say nothing; then I says:\n“I’d ruther not tell you where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, if you don’t mind letting me off; but I’ll write it for you on a piece of paper, and you can read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop’s, if you want to. Do you reckon that’ll do?”\n“Oh, yes.”\nSo I wrote: “I put it in the coffin. It was in there when you was crying there, away in the night. I was behind the door, and I was mighty sorry for you, Miss Mary Jane.”\nIt made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by herself in the night, and them devils laying there right under her own roof, shaming her and robbing her; and when I folded it up and give it to her I see the water come into her eyes, too; and she shook me by the hand, hard, and says:\n“Good-bye. I’m going to do everything just as you’ve told me; and if I don’t ever see you again, I sha’n’t ever forget you and I’ll think of you a many and a many a time, and I’ll pray for you, too!”—and she was gone.\nPray for me! I reckoned if she knowed me she’d take a job that was more nearer her size. But I bet she done it, just the same—she was just that kind. She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notion—there warn’t no back-down to her, I judge. You may say what you want to, but in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see; in my opinion she was just full of sand. It sounds like flattery, but it ain’t no flattery. And when it comes to beauty—and goodness, too—she lays over them all. I hain’t ever seen her since that time that I see her go out of that door; no, I hain’t ever seen her since, but I reckon I’ve thought of her a many and a many a million times, and of her saying she would pray for me; and if ever I’d a thought it would do any good for me to pray for her, blamed if I wouldn’t a done it or bust.",

What was the reason?”“Well, it's because you're not one of those people who can hide their feelings. I don't need a better indicator than your face. Someone can sit down and read it clearly, like large print. Do you really think you can face your uncles when they come to kiss you good-morning without revealing anything—”“There, there, don't! Yes, I'll go before breakfast—I'll be happy to. And should I leave my sisters with them?”“Yes; don't worry about them. They have to put up with it for a little while longer. They might suspect something if all of you were to leave.

It was only a small thing to do, and no trouble; and it's often the small things that make people's lives smoother here on earth; it would make Mary Jane feel comfortable, and it wouldn't cost anything.

Do you think that will work?”“Oh, yes.”So I wrote: “I put it in the coffin. It was in there when you were crying there, late in the night. I was behind the door, and I felt terrible for you, Miss Mary Jane.”It made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by herself in the night, with those dreadful people staying right under her own roof, shaming and robbing her; and when I folded it up and gave it to her, I saw tears come into her eyes, too; and she shook my hand, hard, and said, “Good-bye. I'm going to do everything exactly as you've told me; and if I never see you again, I will never forget you and I'll think of you many, many times, and I'll pray for you, too!”—and she was gone.Pray for me! I figured if she really knew me, she'd find something more appropriate to pray for. But I bet she did it anyway, just the same—she was exactly that kind of person. She had the courage to pray for Judas if she decided to—there was no backing down for her, I judge. You can say whatever you want, but in my opinion, she had more strength of character than any girl I've ever met; in my opinion, she was just full of courage. It sounds like flattery, but it's not flattery. And when it comes to beauty—and goodness, too—she's better than all of them. I haven't seen her since that time I saw her walk out of that door; no, I haven't seen her since, but I reckon I've thought of her millions and millions of times, and of her saying she would pray for me; and if I ever thought it would do any good for me to pray for her, I swear I would have done it or burst.",

I'll tell Miss Susan to let your uncles know you left for a few hours to get some rest or visit a friend, and you'll be back tonight or tomorrow morning.\"\n\nShe agreed, \"Going to see a friend is fine, but I don't want my love sent to them.\"\n\n\"No worries, it won't be.\"\n\nTelling her this made things easier; it was just a small thing to do and wasn't any trouble, but little things can make a big difference and make people feel better. Then I added, \"There's one more thing—the bag of money.\"\n\n\"They have it now. I feel foolish about how they got it.\"\n\n\"Actually, they don't have it.\"\n\n\"Who does, then?\"\n\n\"I wish I knew, but I don't. I had it because I stole it from them, intending to give it to you. I know where I hid it, but I'm afraid it's not there anymore. I'm really sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I did my best, honestly. I almost got caught so I shoved it into the first place I found and had to run. It wasn't a good hiding spot.\"\n\nShe told me to stop blaming myself and said it wasn't my fault. Then, she asked where I hid it.\n\nI didn't want to make her think about her problems again, or tell her just where the money was, as it would remind her of the body in the coffin with the money on it. So I paused, and then said, \"I'd rather write it down for you, Miss Mary Jane, if that's all right. You can read it on your way to Mr. Lothrop's. Will that do?\"\n\n\"Yes, that will be fine.\"\n\nSo I wrote: \"I put it in the coffin. It was there when you were crying last night. I was behind the door and felt sorry for you, Miss Mary Jane.\"\n\nRemembering her crying alone at night, with those scoundrels just underneath her roof, made me tear up too. When I folded up the note and handed it to her, I could see tears in her eyes as well. She shook my hand hard and said:\n\n\"Goodbye. I'll do exactly as you've told me; and if I never see you again, I'll never forget you and will think of you often, and I'll pray for you too!\" Then she left.\n\nPray for me! If she knew what I was really like, she'd have picked an easier task. But I'm sure she did, because that's just how she is. She'd even have the strength to pray for Judas if she wanted to—she never backed down. Say what you will, but in my view, she was the bravest girl I'd ever met, and that's the truth. Speaking of beauty and kindness, she was above everyone. I haven't seen her since she walked out that door, but I've thought of her countless times and of her saying she'd pray for me. And if I thought it would have helped her at all, I would've prayed for her too, no matter what."

It’s a new kind, Miss Mary Jane said.”\n“How’s it a new kind?”\n“Because it’s mixed up with other things.”\n“What other things?”\n“Well, measles, and whooping-cough, and erysiplas, and consumption, and yaller janders, and brain-fever, and I don’t know what all.”\n“My land! And they call it the mumps?”\n“That’s what Miss Mary Jane said.”\n“Well, what in the nation do they call it the mumps for?”\n“Why, because it is the mumps. That’s what it starts with.”\n“Well, ther’ ain’t no sense in it. A body might stump his toe, and take pison, and fall down the well, and break his neck, and bust his brains out, and somebody come along and ask what killed him, and some numskull up and say, ‘Why, he stumped his toe.’ Would ther’ be any sense in that? No. And ther’ ain’t no sense in this, nuther.

And you can’t get away with that tooth without fetching the whole harrow along, can you? Well, these kind of mumps is a kind of a harrow, as you may say—and it ain’t no slouch of a harrow, nuther, you come to get it hitched on good.”\n“Well, it’s awful, I think,” says the hare-lip. “I’ll go to Uncle Harvey and—”\n“Oh, yes,” I says, “I would. Of course I would. I wouldn’t lose no time.”\n“Well, why wouldn’t you?”\n“Just look at it a minute, and maybe you can see. Hain’t your uncles obleegd to get along home to England as fast as they can? And do you reckon they’d be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that journey by yourselves? You know they’ll wait for you. So fur, so good. Your uncle Harvey’s a preacher, ain’t he? Very well, then; is a preacher going to deceive a steamboat clerk? is he going to deceive a ship clerk?—so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard? Now you know he ain’t. What will he do, then? Why, he’ll say, ‘It’s a great pity, but my church matters has got to get along the best way they can; for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus-unum mumps, and so it’s my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months it takes to show on her if she’s got it.’ But never mind, if you think it’s best to tell your uncle Harvey—”\n“Shucks, and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good times in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Jane’s got it or not? Why, you talk like a muggins.”\n“Well, anyway, maybe you’d better tell some of the neighbors.”\n“Listen at that, now. You do beat all for natural stupidness. Can’t you see that they’d go and tell? Ther’ ain’t no way but just to not tell anybody at all.”\n“Well, maybe you’re right—yes, I judge you are right.”\n“But I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey she’s gone out a while, anyway, so he won’t be uneasy about her?”\n“Yes, Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that.

When I found Susan and the girl with the harelip, I asked, \"What's the name of those people across the river you sometimes visit?\" They replied, \"There are several families, but mostly the Proctors.\" \"That's it!\" I said, \"I almost forgot. Well, Miss Mary Jane told me to tell you she went over there in a terrible rush because one of them is sick.\" \"Which one?\" \"I don't know; I kind of forget, but I think it's—\" \"Good heavens, I hope it's not Hanner?\" \"I'm sorry to say it is,\" I told them, \"Hanner is the one.\" \"My goodness, she was so healthy last week! Is she very ill?\" \"That's putting it mildly. Miss Mary Jane said they stayed up with her all night and don't think she has many hours left.\" \"Just imagine! What's wrong with her?\" I couldn't think of a plausible illness immediately, so I said, \"Mumps.\" \"Mumps, are you kidding? People don't stay up all night for mumps.\" \"They don't, do they? Well, let me tell you, they certainly do for these mumps. These mumps are different. It's a new type, Miss Mary Jane explained.\" \"How is it a new type?\" \"Because it's combined with other illnesses.\" \"What other illnesses?\" \"Oh, measles, whooping cough, erysipelas, consumption, yellow jaundice, brain fever, and all sorts of other things.\" \"My word! And they call it mumps?\" \"That's what Miss Mary Jane said.\" \"Why on earth do they call it mumps then?\" \"Well, because that's how it starts. It is the mumps.\" \"That makes no sense at all. Someone could stub their toe, drink poison, fall down a well, break their neck, and splatter their brains, and if someone came along and asked what killed them, some idiot might say, 'Oh, he just stubbed his toe.' Would that make any sense? No. And this makes no sense either. Is it contagious?\" \"Is it contagious? My dear girl, what are you saying? Is a harrow contagious in the dark? If you don't get caught on one spike, you're sure to get caught on another, right? And you can't escape that spike without dragging the whole harrow along, can you? Well, this kind of mumps is like a harrow, you could say—and it's a pretty serious harrow once you get properly snagged.\" \"Well, I think it's awful,\" said the girl with the harelip. \"I'll go tell Uncle Harvey and—\" \"Oh, yes,\" I interrupted, \"I would definitely do that. Absolutely. Don't waste any time.\" \"Well, why shouldn't we?\" \"Just think about it for a moment, and maybe you'll understand. Aren't your uncles supposed to get home to England as quickly as possible? And do you really think they'd be cruel enough to leave you to make that whole trip alone? You know they'll wait for you. So far, so good. Your Uncle Harvey is a preacher, right? Okay, then; is a preacher going to lie to a steamboat clerk? Is he going to lie to a ship clerk so they'll let Miss Mary Jane board? You know he won't. So what will he do? Why, he'll say, 'It's a great shame, but my church duties will have to manage as best they can; because my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus-unum mumps, and therefore it is my solemn duty to stay here and wait the three months it takes for it to show up if she's caught it.' But never mind, if you truly think it's best to tell your Uncle Harvey—\" \"Ridiculous! Stay here messing around when we could be having a good time in England while we wait to find out if Mary Jane has it or not? You're talking like a fool.\" \"Well, fine, but maybe you should tell some of the neighbors.\" \"Listen to that! You are just unbelievably naturally stupid. Can't you see that they would go and tell? There's no way but to simply not tell anyone at all.\" \"Well, maybe you're right—yes, I think you are right.\" \"But I guess we should tell Uncle Harvey she's gone out for a bit, anyway, so he won't worry about her?\" \"Yes, Miss Mary Jane wanted you to do that. She said, 'Tell them to give Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss, and say I've run across the river to see Mr.'—Mr.—what was the name of that rich family your Uncle Peter used to admire so much?—I mean the one that—\" \"Why, you must mean the Apthorps, right?\" \"Of course; bother those kinds of names, you can hardly ever remember them, it seems, half the time. Yes, she said, say she has rushed over to ask the Apthorps to please come to the auction and buy this house, because she believed her Uncle Peter would have preferred them to have it over anyone else; and she plans to stay with them until they agree to come, and then, if she's not too tired, she'll come home; and if she is, she'll be home in the morning regardless. She said not to mention the Proctors, but only the Apthorps—which will be completely true, because she is going there to discuss them buying the house; I know it, because she told me herself.\" \"All right,\" they said, and hurried off to find their uncles, give them the love and kisses, and deliver the message. Everything was fine now. The girls wouldn't say anything because they were eager to go to England; and the king and the duke preferred Mary Jane was busy with the auction rather than near Doctor Robinson.

When I found Susan and the hare-lip, I asked them what was the name of the folks living across the river that they visited sometimes. They answered that there were a few, but mostly the Proctors. I said that was the name I’d almost forgotten, and I told them that Mary Jane asked me to tell them she’d gone over there in a great hurry because someone was sick. When they asked who, I pretended not to know for sure, but finally said it was Hanner. They were surprised, saying Hanner was just fine last week, and asked if it was serious. I replied it was very bad, that they had stayed up with her all night and didn’t expect her to last much longer. They asked what illness she had, and I couldn’t think of anything good, so I said mumps. They skeptically responded that people don’t stay up with mumps, but I insisted these were a new, worse kind of mumps mixed with lots of other illnesses. When they questioned why it was still called mumps, I said that was just what Mary Jane said since it starts with mumps. They thought the explanation made no sense and worried about whether it was contagious. I replied with a metaphor about a harrow: if you touch one tooth, you'll catch the whole thing, and said these new mumps were just like that, once you catch them there’s no escape. The hare-lip said it was terrible and talked about going to Uncle Harvey, but I warned that if her uncles heard Mary Jane had been exposed to such a sickness, they'd have to stay in town instead of returning to England. After some discussion, we decided not to tell anyone except perhaps their uncle that Mary Jane was out for a while so he wouldn’t worry. I reminded them of Mary Jane’s message: to send love and kisses to Uncle Harvey and William and say she went to see the Apthorps across the river, asking them to come buy the house at the auction—the family Uncle Peter always liked best. She would stay with them until they agreed, and come home later or in the morning. She didn’t want anyone to mention the Proctors, just the Apthorps, and that was partly true because she was going there for the auction’s sake. The girls agreed and went to tell their uncles Mary Jane’s message. I felt successful, knowing I’d handled the situation well, maybe as well as Tom Sawyer could have, though I lacked his flair."

Soon after, he began to speak, and I immediately noticed he spoke like an Englishman – different from the king's imitation, although the king's wasn't bad. I can't recall the old gentleman's exact words or mimic his voice, but he turned to the crowd and said something like this: 'This is an unexpected surprise, and I must be honest, I am not well-prepared to handle this situation, as my brother and I have suffered misfortunes. He has a broken arm, and our luggage was mistakenly left behind at a town upriver last night. I am Harvey Wilks, Peter Wilks' brother, and this is his brother, William, who cannot hear or speak – and now can barely make signs since he can only use one hand. We are who we say we are, and I can prove it in a day or two when I retrieve our luggage. Until then, I will say no more and will go to the hotel to wait.'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "A very distinguished-looking older man and a handsome younger man, whose right arm was in a sling, were being escorted through the crowd. The people around them were shouting and laughing boisterously, keeping up the commotion. I couldn't see what was so funny, and I figured the duke and the king would have a hard time finding it amusing either. I expected them to grow pale, but they didn’t show any sign of fear. The duke acted as if he didn't suspect anything, wandering around in high spirits, as content as a jug of buttermilk bubbling away; meanwhile, the king just stared down sorrowfully at the newcomers, as though it pained his very soul to think there were such cheats and scoundrels out there. He played his part well. Several of the leading citizens gathered around the king to show their support for him. The older gentleman who had just arrived looked extremely confused. Soon he began to speak, and I immediately noticed he had a real English accent—not quite like the king’s, even though the king was pretty good at faking one. I can’t recall the gentleman's exact words or mimic his accent, but he addressed the crowd saying something along these lines: \n\n“This is a surprise I wasn't expecting, and I admit honestly and openly that I'm not well prepared to deal with it right now; my brother and I have run into some troubles—he's broken his arm, and our luggage was mistakenly dropped off at a town upstream during the night. I am Harvey, Peter Wilks' brother, and this is his brother William, who can neither hear nor speak—and now that he only has one usable hand, he can't even use sign language very well. We are indeed who we claim to be, and I can prove it in a couple of days when I recover our baggage. Until then, I'll say nothing more and will just wait at the hotel.”"

These included the doctor; a sharp-looking lawyer named Levi Bell, who had just arrived by steamboat with an old-fashioned carpet-bag and was talking quietly to the doctor while glancing and nodding towards the king; and a large, strong man who had been listening to the earlier conversation and was now listening to the king.

After the king finished, the burly man asked, “If you’re Harvey Wilks, when did you arrive here?” The king replied, “The day before the funeral.” “What time?” came the next question. “In the evening, about an hour or two before sunset,” the king answered. “How’d you get here?” “I came down from Cincinnati on the Susan Powell.” The man pressed further: “Then how were you at the Point in the morning in a canoe?” “I wasn’t up at the Point this morning,” answered the king.

If they do, won't those accomplices get away with the bag of gold Peter Wilks left? It seems probable. If these men are not fakes, they should have no problem with us getting the money and letting us hold onto it until they prove their identity – is that fair?' Everyone agreed to this. I figured this put our group in a difficult spot right from the start. However, the king simply looked sad and said, 'Gentlemen, I wish the money were here, as I have no desire to hinder an honest and complete investigation of this unfortunate matter; but, sadly, the money is not here; you can send someone to check if you wish.' 'Where is it, then?' 'Well, when my niece gave it to me to look after for her, I took and hid it inside the straw mattress of my bed. I didn't want to deposit it in the bank for the short time we'd be here, and I considered the bed a safe place, not being used to enslaved people and thinking they were honest, like servants in England. The enslaved people stole it the morning after I went downstairs; and when I sold them, I hadn't yet noticed the money was gone, so they completely got away with it. My servant here can tell you about it, gentlemen.' The doctor and several others reacted with 'Shucks!', and I saw that no one entirely believed him. One man asked if I had seen the enslaved people steal it. I said no, but I saw them quietly leaving the room and hurrying away, and I didn't think much of it then, only assuming they were afraid they had woken up my master and were trying to get away before he caused them trouble.

If these men aren’t fakes, they shouldn’t mind sending for the money and letting us hold onto it until they’ve proved themselves. Isn’t that fair?”\n\nEveryone agreed, and it seemed they had us in a difficult spot immediately. But the king just looked sad and replied:\n\n“Gentlemen, I wish the money really was there, because I want everything about this unpleasant matter to be thoroughly investigated. Unfortunately, it’s not. You can send someone to look if you like.”\n\n“Where is it, then?” someone asked.\n\n“Well, when my niece gave it to me for safekeeping, I hid it inside the mattress, thinking it was safer there than at a bank, as we’d only be here a few days. We trusted the servants, expecting them to be honest like in England. But the black servants must have stolen it the morning after I hid it, while I was downstairs, and when I sold them, I hadn’t yet realized the money was gone, so they had already got away. My servant here can confirm this.”\n\nThe doctor and a few others dismissed this as nonsense, and I could tell nobody completely trusted his story. Someone asked me if I saw the servants steal the money. I said no, but I did see them sneaking out of the room and leaving in a hurry.

I’ll take the order and send it, along with your brother’s, and then they’ll know it’s all right.”\nSo they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted his head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something; and then they give the pen to the duke—and then for the first time the duke looked sick. But he took the pen and wrote. So then the lawyer turns to the new old gentleman and says:\n“You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names.”\nThe old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn’t read it. The lawyer looked powerful astonished, and says:\n“Well, it beats me”—and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket, and examined them, and then examined the old man’s writing, and then them again; and then says: “These old letters is from Harvey Wilks; and here’s these two handwritings, and anybody can see they didn’t write them” (the king and the duke looked sold and foolish, I tell you, to see how the lawyer had took them in), “and here’s this old gentleman’s hand writing, and anybody can tell, easy enough, he didn’t write them—fact is, the scratches he makes ain’t properly writing at all. Now, here’s some letters from—”\nThe new old gentleman says:\n“If you please, let me explain. Nobody can read my hand but my brother there—so he copies for me. It’s his hand you’ve got there, not mine.”\n“Well!” says the lawyer, “this is a state of things. I’ve got some of William’s letters, too; so if you’ll get him to write a line or so we can com—”\n“He can’t write with his left hand,” says the old gentleman. “If he could use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own letters and mine too. Look at both, please—they’re by the same hand.”\nThe lawyer done it, and says:\n“I believe it’s so—and if it ain’t so, there’s a heap stronger resemblance than I’d noticed before, anyway. Well, well, well! I thought we was right on the track of a solution, but it’s gone to grass, partly. But anyway, one thing is proved—these two ain’t either of ’em Wilkses”—and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke.",

The king interrupted, reaching out his hand and asking if this was the old friend his poor deceased brother had mentioned so often. The lawyer and the king shook hands, and the lawyer smiled, looking pleased. They talked briefly, then moved aside to speak quietly. Finally, the lawyer announced, \"That will resolve it. I'll take the order and send it with your brother's, and then they'll be satisfied it's legitimate.\" So they got paper and a pen, and the king sat down, twisted his head, chewed his tongue, and scrawled something illegible. Then they gave the pen to the duke. For the first time, the duke looked visibly ill, but he took the pen and wrote. The lawyer then turned to the newly arrived older gentleman and requested, \"Would you and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names?\" The older gentleman wrote, but his handwriting was completely unreadable. The lawyer appeared greatly surprised and said, \"Well, that beats everything!\" He pulled out several old letters from his pocket, examined them, then the old man's writing, and then the letters again. He then stated, \"These old letters are from Harvey Wilks. And here are these two handwritings (referring to the king and duke), and anyone can see they didn't write them.\" (Huck noted that the king and duke looked completely exposed and foolish, seeing how the lawyer had outsmarted them). \"And here is this old gentleman's writing (William's), and anyone can easily tell he didn't write them either. In fact, the marks he makes aren't properly considered writing at all. Now, here are some letters from—\" The new old gentleman interrupted, \"If you please, allow me to explain. No one can read my handwriting but my brother here, so he transcribes for me. The handwriting you have there is his, not mine.\" \"Well!\" exclaimed the lawyer, \"this is quite a situation! I also have some of William's letters, so if you'll have him write a line or so, we can compare—\" \"He cannot write with his left hand,\" the old gentleman said. \"If he could use his right hand, you would see that he wrote both his own letters and mine. Please look at both; they are by the same hand.\" The lawyer did so and commented, \"I believe you're right. And even if it's not exact, there's a much stronger resemblance than I'd noticed before. Well, well, well! I thought we were close to finding the answer, but it's become complicated again. But at least one thing is proven: these two (gesturing towards the king and duke) are neither of them Wilkses.\"",

The lawyer shook hands with the king, looked pleased, and they chatted for a bit, eventually stepping aside to speak more privately. At last, the lawyer said that he’d take the order and send it off with the brother’s, so everything would be settled. They provided paper and pen; the king sat down, appeared to concentrate, and awkwardly wrote something. Then the duke was given the pen—looking uncomfortable for the first time—but he wrote, too. The lawyer then asked the new old man and his brother to each write something and sign. The old man wrote, but it was illegible. The lawyer, clearly surprised, pulled out old letters from his pocket to compare the handwriting, quickly realizing that neither the king nor the duke had written the genuine letters. He also noticed the old man’s writing wasn’t like the others and barely counted as writing. The new old man then explained nobody except his brother could read his handwriting, so his brother always copied for him—it was his brother’s writing on the letters, not his own. The lawyer, surprised, said he had letters from William as well, and asked him to write, but the old man said William couldn’t write with his left hand, and if he had the use of his right, it would show both letters were indeed his work. After examining further, the lawyer agreed there was a strong resemblance and admitted they had lost their lead. However, he concluded that one thing was clear—the king and duke were definitely not Wilkses, as he indicated with a nod in their direction."

Anyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says:\n“Mf! It’s a very tough question, ain’t it! Yes, sir, I k’n tell you what’s tattooed on his breast.

And frankly, a direct question like that, without any warning, was designed to make almost *anyone* collapse, because how could *he* possibly know what was tattooed on the man? He turned a little pale; he couldn't help it. The room became extremely quiet, and everyone leaned forward slightly, staring at him. I said to myself, \"Now he'll surrender – there's no point continuing.\" Well, did he? It's almost impossible to believe, but he didn't.

This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever was in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different from what I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time if I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to save me and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in the world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks. If they didn’t find them—\nI couldn’t bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn’t think about nothing else.

But they sailed into digging anyway by the flicker of the lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house, a half a mile off, to borrow one.\nSo they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and the rain started, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightning come brisker and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but them people never took no notice of it, they was so full of this business; and one minute you could see everything and every face in that big crowd, and the shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave, and the next second the dark wiped it all out, and you couldn’t see nothing at all.\nAt last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid, and then such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was, to scrouge in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way, it was awful. Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so, and I reckon he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited and panting.\nAll of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare, and somebody sings out:\n“By the living jingo, here’s the bag of gold on his breast!”\nHines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist and give a big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I lit out and shinned for the road in the dark there ain’t nobody can tell.",

If they didn't find them— I couldn't bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn't think about anything else. It kept getting darker and darker, and it would have been a perfect time to slip away from the crowd; but that big, strong man had me by the wrist—Hines—and trying to escape him was like trying to escape Goliath.

And when they got to the grave, they found they had about a hundred times more shovels than they needed, but nobody had remembered to bring a lantern. But they went ahead and started digging anyway by the flickering light of the lightning, and sent a man to the closest house, half a mile away, to borrow one. So they dug and dug intensely; and it got terribly dark, and the rain started, and the wind swished and rustled, and the lightning came faster and faster, and the thunder boomed; but those people paid no attention to it, they were so completely focused on this matter; and one moment you could see everything and every face in that large crowd, and the shovelfuls of dirt flying up out of the grave, and the next second the darkness completely hid it all, and you couldn't see anything at all. Finally, they got the coffin out and began to unscrew the lid, and then there was such a crowding, shouldering, and shoving to push in and get a look, like you've never seen; and in the dark, like that, it was awful. Hines hurt my wrist terribly by pulling and tugging so hard, and I guess he completely forgot I existed, he was so excited and out of breath. All of a sudden, the lightning unleashed a perfect sheet of bright white light, and somebody shouted out: \"By the living jingo, here's the bag of gold on his chest!\" Hines let out a yell, like everyone else, and dropped my wrist and made a big lunge to force his way in and get a look, and the way I took off and scrambled for the road in the dark is beyond description.",

As we passed my house, I regretted sending Mary Jane out of town; if she were here, I could signal her for help, and she’d rescue me and expose the frauds.\n\nWe moved down the road by the river, behaving like a pack of wild animals. To make things even creepier, the sky was growing darker, flashes of lightning were starting up, and the wind rustled through the leaves. This was the worst trouble I’d ever been in—dangerous and overwhelming. I was shocked because everything was turning out differently than I’d planned. Instead of having a way to quietly save myself and enjoy the fun, with Mary Jane ready to help if I got into a tight spot, now my only hope was those tattoo marks. If nobody found them…\n\nI couldn’t stand thinking about it, but I couldn’t think about anything else either. It kept getting darker, and it would have been the perfect moment to escape the crowd, but the big fellow Hines had me by the wrist—there was no getting away, like trying to escape Goliath. He dragged me along so fast with excitement that I had to run to keep up.\n\nWhen we reached the graveyard, everyone surged in like a flood. At the grave, they realized there were far too many shovels, but no one had brought a lantern. Still, they started digging by the flashes of lightning and sent someone to borrow a lantern from a house half a mile away.\n\nThey dug like mad, though the darkness deepened, rain started falling, and the wind howled. Lightning got brighter and thunder boomed, but the crowd was so absorbed in the task they ignored the storm. Now and then, a lightning flash showed every face in the crowd and dirt flying from the grave, only for darkness to swallow everything again the next instant.\n\nEventually, they got the coffin out and began to unscrew the lid. Everyone crowded in, pushing and shoving to get a look. In the pitch dark, it was terrifying. Hines squeezed my wrist painfully as he pulled and shoved, completely forgetting about me in his excitement.\n\nSuddenly, lightning lit up everything, and someone shouted, \"By the living jingo, here’s the bag of gold on his breast!\"\n\nHines yelled with excitement, released my wrist and shoved through the crowd to see. In that moment, I dashed for the road as fast as I could in the darkness—how I managed it, no one could say."

No light there; the house all dark—which made me feel sorry and disappointed, I didn’t know why. But at last, just as I was sailing by, flash comes the light in Mary Jane’s window! and my heart swelled up sudden, like to bust; and the same second the house and all was behind me in the dark, and wasn’t ever going to be before me no more in this world. She was the best girl I ever see, and had the most sand.\nThe minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the tow-head, I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow, and the first time the lightning showed me one that wasn’t chained I snatched it and shoved. It was a canoe, and warn’t fastened with nothing but a rope. The tow-head was a rattling big distance off, away out there in the middle of the river, but I didn’t lose no time; and when I struck the raft at last I was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp if I could afforded it. But I didn’t. As I sprung aboard I sung out:\n“Out with you, Jim, and set her loose! Glory be to goodness, we’re shut of them!”\nJim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms spread, he was so full of joy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in my mouth and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was old King Lear and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it most scared the livers and lights out of me. But Jim fished me out, and was going to hug me and bless me, and so on, he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the king and the duke, but I says:\n“Not now; have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast!

As I neared our house, I fixed my gaze upon it, searching. There was no light; the house was entirely dark, which made me feel unexpectedly sad and disappointed. But then, just as I was passing, a light suddenly appeared in Mary Jane's window! My heart instantly surged, almost to the point of bursting. In that same moment, the house and everything associated with it was behind me in the dark, and I knew I would never see it before me again in this life. She was the finest girl I had ever known, and the bravest.\nThe moment I was far enough upstream from town to see that I could reach the sandbar, I began searching intently for a boat to borrow. The first time lightning revealed one that wasn't secured, I quickly grabbed it and pushed off. It was a canoe tied only with a rope. The sandbar was quite a distance away, out in the middle of the river, but I didn't waste any time. When I finally got to the raft, I was so exhausted I would have just lain down to catch my breath if I could have afforded it. But I didn't. As I jumped aboard, I yelled:\n\"Get up, Jim, and untie us! Thank goodness, we're rid of them!\"\nJim quickly got up and was coming towards me with his arms spread wide, overflowing with joy. But when I caught sight of him in the lightning, my heart leaped into my throat, and I fell backward into the water. For a moment, I had forgotten it was Jim and had been terrified, mistaking him for the King and the Duke, and it scared me half to death. But Jim pulled me out and was ready to hug me and express his gratitude, so happy I was back and that we were free of the con artists. But I said:\n\"Not now! Save that for breakfast!

'Yes,' the duke replied, slowly, deliberately, and sarcastically, 'We did.' After another brief pause, the king drawled, 'At least, *I* did.'

If not for that trick, they would have locked us up until the Englishmen’s baggage arrived, and then—straight to prison for us! The trick worked and sent them off to the graveyard, and the gold helped us even more; if those worked-up people hadn’t dropped everything to go after it, we’d have spent the night with nooses around our necks—nooses made to last, too—longer than we’d want!\"\n\nThere was a moment of silence as they thought, then the king, almost absent-mindedly, said, \"Hmm! And we thought the slaves stole it!\" That comment made me really uncomfortable.\n\n\"Yes,\" responded the duke, slow and sarcastic, \"We did.\"\n\nAfter a brief pause, the king drawled, \"At least, I did.\"\n\nThe duke replied in the same tone, \"On the contrary, I did.\"\n\nThe king, getting defensive, said, \"Hold on there, Bilgewater, what do you mean by that?\"\n\nThe duke quickly shot back, \"Maybe I should be asking what you meant.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" the king replied sarcastically. \"Maybe you were asleep and didn’t know what was happening.\"\n\nThe duke, now getting annoyed, said, \"Oh, quit this foolishness; do you take me for an idiot? Don’t you think I know who hid that money in the coffin?\""

There, now!”\n“Well, then, I b’lieve you. But answer me only jest this one more—now don’t git mad; didn’t you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide it?”\nThe duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he says:\n“Well, I don’t care if I did, I didn’t do it, anyway. But you not only had it in mind to do it, but you done it.”\n“I wisht I never die if I done it, duke, and that’s honest. I won’t say I warn’t goin’ to do it, because I was; but you—I mean somebody—got in ahead o’ me.”\n“It’s a lie! You done it, and you got to say you done it, or—”\nThe king began to gurgle, and then he gasps out:\n“’Nough!—I own up!”\nI was very glad to hear him say that; it made me feel much more easier than what I was feeling before. So the duke took his hands off and says:\n“If you ever deny it again I’ll drown you. It’s well for you to set there and blubber like a baby—it’s fitten for you, after the way you’ve acted. I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble everything—and I a-trusting you all the time, like you was my own father. You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot of poor niggers, and you never say a word for ’em. It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to believe that rubbage. Cuss you, I can see now why you was so anxious to make up the deffisit—you wanted to get what money I’d got out of the Nonesuch and one thing or another, and scoop it all!”\nThe king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:\n“Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffisit; it warn’t me.”\n“Dry up! I don’t want to hear no more out of you!” says the duke. “And now you see what you got by it. They’ve got all their own money back, and all of ourn but a shekel or two besides. G’long to bed, and don’t you deffersit me no more deffersits, long ’s you live!”\nSo the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort, and before long the duke tackled his bottle; and so in about a half an hour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got, the lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other’s arms. They both got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn’t get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag again. That made me feel easy and satisfied. Of course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble, and I told Jim everything.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“Yes, absolutely! I know you're aware because you were the one who did it!” “That’s a lie!” the Duke lunged at him. The King yelled, “Get off! Let go of my throat! I take back everything I said!” The Duke replied, “Okay, but first you have to admit that you *did* hide that money there, planning to sneak away from me eventually, come back, dig it up, and keep it all for yourself.” “Hold on a minute, Duke—just answer this one question honestly: if you didn’t put the money there, just say so, and I’ll believe you and retract everything I accused you of.” “You old crook, I didn’t, and you know perfectly well I didn’t. There!” “Alright, then I believe you. But please, answer just this one last thing—now, *don’t* get angry; didn’t you *think* about stealing the money and hiding it?” The Duke was silent for a moment, then said, “Well, I don’t care if I *did* think about it, I certainly didn’t *do* it. But you didn’t just think about doing it, you actually *did* it.” “I hope I drop dead if I did it, Duke, I swear. I won’t claim I wasn’t *going* to do it, because I *was*; but you—I mean, someone else—got there before me.” “That’s a lie! You did it, and you have to *admit* you did it, or—” The King started making choked sounds and then gasped, “Enough!—I admit it!” I was really relieved to hear him say that; it made me feel a lot better than I had been. So the Duke let go and said, “If you ever deny it again, I’ll drown you. It’s *right* for you to sit there and cry like a baby—it suits you, after how you’ve behaved. I’ve never seen anyone so greedy, wanting to grab everything—and I was trusting you completely, like you were my own father. You should have been ashamed of yourself for standing by and listening while it was blamed on a bunch of poor Black people, without saying a word to defend them. It makes me feel stupid to think I was foolish enough to *believe* that nonsense. Damn you, I see now why you were so eager to cover the difference—you wanted to get your hands on the money I got from the Nonesuch and other places, and take it *all*!” The King said softly, still whimpering, “But Duke, it was you who said we should cover the difference; it wasn’t me.” “Shut up! I don’t want to hear anything *more* from you!” said the Duke. “And *now* you see what you *got* out of it. They got all their money back, and all of *ours* except for a dollar or two *extra*. Go on to bed, and don’t you dare cost *me* any more money as long as you live!” So the King snuck into the hut and found comfort in his bottle, and before long the Duke started on *his* bottle too; and about half an hour later they were best friends again, and the drunker they got, the more affectionate they became, and ended up snoring in each other’s arms. They both got very drunk, but I noticed the King didn’t get drunk enough to forget to remember *not* to deny hiding the money bag again. That made me feel calm and satisfied. Of course, once they were snoring, Jim and I had a long talk, and I told him everything.",

Let go of my throat! I take back what I said!\" \nThe duke replied, \"Then admit that you hid that money with plans to leave me behind, so you could come back later and dig it up for yourself.\" \n\"Hold on, duke—answer me this one question honestly. If you didn't hide the money, say so, and I'll believe you and take back everything I accused you of.\" \n\"You old rascal, I didn't hide it, and you know it. There you have it!\" \n\"All right, I believe you. Just answer one more thing—don't get mad—did you ever plan to steal and hide the money?\"\nThe duke was silent for a bit, then admitted, \"Well, maybe I thought about it, but I didn't actually do it. But you're the one who not only thought about it, you actually did it.\"\n\"I swear I didn't, duke, and that's the truth. I won't say I wasn't going to do it, because I was; but you—or someone else—beat me to it.\"\n\"That's a lie! You did it, and you have to confess it, or—\"\nThe king started to choke, and then gasped, \"Enough! I confess!\"\nHearing him say that made me feel a lot better. The duke released him and warned, \"If you deny it again, I'll drown you. And you can sit there and cry like a baby if you want—that's what you deserve, after the way you've acted. I never saw someone so greedy, wanting everything for yourself while I trusted you like family. You should be ashamed for letting them blame a bunch of poor slaves while you said nothing. I can't believe I was so naive to believe your lies. Now I understand why you were so eager to 'make up the deficit'—you just wanted to get all the money from me and the other schemes and take it all for yourself!\"\nThe king, still sniffling, replied timidly, \"But duke, you were the one who said to make up the deficit; it wasn't me.\"\n\"Shut up! I don't want to hear anything else from you!\" said the duke. \"Now you see what's happened—they've gotten all their money back, and ours too, except maybe a coin or two. Go to bed, and don't ever talk to me about deficits again as long as you live!\"\nSo the king sneaked into the tent and turned to his bottle, and not long after, the duke did the same. In about half an hour, they were getting along as if nothing was wrong, and the more they drank, the friendlier they got, ending up falling asleep in each other's arms. They were quite drunk, but I noticed the king didn't forget his promise not to deny hiding the money again, which made me feel relieved and content. Of course, once they fell asleep, we had a long conversation, and I told Jim everything."

The second they were fully occupied with their fight, I took off running at full speed, sprinting down the river road like a deer because I saw this as our opportunity. I decided right then that it would be a long time before they ever saw me and Jim again. I arrived at the riverbank out of breath but incredibly happy, and yelled out: \"Untie the raft, Jim! We're safe now!\" But there was no reply, and no one came out of the shelter. Jim was gone! I shouted once, then again, and a third time. I ran wildly through the woods, yelling and screaming; but it was pointless—old Jim was gone. Then I sat down and wept; I couldn't help it.",

He blamed us for everything and nothing we did seemed to satisfy him; he criticized even the smallest things. It was obvious something was about to happen. I was really relieved when noon arrived and the king still hadn’t shown up, since at least it meant things might change—and maybe for the better. So the duke and I went into town to look for the king, and eventually we found him in the back room of a dingy little bar, very drunk, surrounded by some loafers who were mocking him for fun while he cursed and threatened them as best he could, though he was too drunk to stand or fight back. The duke started yelling at him, calling him a fool, and the king started shouting back. As soon as they got into their argument, I took off and ran down the river road as fast as I could, realizing this was my opportunity; I decided it would be a long time before they ever saw me or Jim again. I arrived breathless but thrilled, and called out, \"Let’s go, Jim! We’re safe now!\" But there was no reply, nobody came out of the wigwam. Jim was gone. I yelled again and again, searching all around, but it was useless—Jim was gone. Then I sat down and cried; I just couldn’t help myself."

That’s just the way: a person does a low-down thing, and then he don’t want to take no consequences of it. Thinks as long as he can hide it, it ain’t no disgrace. That was my fix exactly.

At one point, I told myself it would be infinitely better for Jim to be enslaved back home where his family was, if he absolutely had to be a slave, and therefore I should write to Tom Sawyer and ask him to inform Miss Watson where Jim was. But I quickly abandoned that idea for two reasons: she would be furious and disgusted by his perceived wickedness and ingratitude for running away, and would immediately sell him further down the river; and even if she didn't, everyone naturally looks down on an ungrateful enslaved person, and they would constantly make Jim feel it, causing him to feel miserable and dishonored. And then consider my own situation! It would become widely known that Huck Finn assisted an enslaved person in gaining freedom; and if I ever encountered anyone from that town again, I would feel so ashamed I'd be ready to humble myself completely. That's how it is: someone does something despicable and then wants to avoid the consequences. They think that as long as they can hide it, it isn't truly shameful. That was exactly my dilemma.

So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in. I slept the night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast, and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore. I landed below where I judged was Phelps’s place, and hid my bundle in the woods, and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.",

I completely gave up on the idea of trying to reform myself. I pushed the whole concept out of my mind, resolving instead to return to being bad, which felt natural to me since I was raised that way, unlike being good. To start, I decided I would go and steal Jim away from slavery again. If I could even think of something worse to do, I would do that too, because since I was already committed to this path and fully invested, I might as well go all the way.\n\nThen I started thinking about how to accomplish it, turning over quite a number of possibilities in my head until I finally settled on a plan that seemed right. So I noted the location of a woody island a bit down the river, and as soon as it was truly dark, I quietly paddled out with my raft and headed for it, hiding it there before settling down. I slept soundly through the night, woke up before dawn, ate breakfast, put on my best clothes, tied up some other clothes and various things into a bundle, took the canoe, and set off for shore. I landed downstream from where I estimated the Phelps' place was, hid my bundle in the woods, then filled the canoe with water and loaded rocks into it to sink it where I could easily find it again later.

I just pushed it all out of my mind and decided to go back to being bad, since that's what I was used to, not being good. To begin, I made up my mind to help Jim escape from slavery again; and if I could come up with something even worse, I'd do that too, because once I was committed, I figured I might as well go all the way. After that, I started planning how to do it, thinking about many possible ways. Eventually, I came up with a plan that I liked. So, I got my bearings on a wooded island further down the river, and when it got dark, I snuck out with my raft and hid it there before going to sleep. I slept all night, woke up before dawn, ate breakfast, put on my best clothes, bundled up some other things, took the canoe, and headed for shore. I landed downstream from where I thought Phelps’s place was, hid my bundle in the woods, filled the canoe with water, loaded it with rocks, and sank it where I could find it later, about a quarter mile below a small steam sawmill by the bank."

But I didn’t mind, because I didn’t want to see nobody just yet—I only wanted to get the lay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from the village, not from below. So I just took a look, and shoved along, straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was the duke.

A man up and offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat, and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after him. We didn’t have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the country till we tired him out. We never got him till dark; then we fetched him over, and I started down for the raft. When I got there and see it was gone, I says to myself, ‘they’ve got into trouble and had to leave; and they’ve took my nigger, which is the only nigger I’ve got in the world, and now I’m in a strange country, and ain’t got no property no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;’ so I set down and cried.

I kept a close watch but saw no one around, despite it being clearly daytime. This didn't bother me, as I didn't want to encounter anyone just yet; I merely wished to get my bearings in the area. My original plan involved approaching from the village, not from this lower direction. So, I simply took a quick look and continued straight towards town. As fate would have it, the very first person I saw upon arriving was the Duke. He was putting up posters for the Royal Nonesuch show—advertising a performance for three nights—just as he had done before. Those swindlers certainly had their nerve! I was right in front of him before I had a chance to avoid him. He appeared surprised and said, \"Hello! Where did you come from?\" Then, with a tone of eager relief, he asked, \"Where's the raft? Is she hidden safely?\" I replied, \"Why, that's precisely what I was about to ask you, your grace.\" His expression became less cheerful, and he inquired, \"Why would you have that idea, asking me?\" I explained (falsely), \"Well, when I saw the King in that tavern yesterday, I realized we wouldn't be able to get him home for hours until he sobered up.

But as we were pulling the sheep towards the boat, and the man left me holding the rope while he went behind the sheep to push it, it was too strong for me, broke free, and ran. We chased after it. We didn't have a dog, so we had to pursue it all over the countryside until we exhausted it. We didn't catch it until dark. Then we brought it across, and I headed down to the raft. When I got there and saw it was gone, I thought to myself, 'They must have gotten into trouble and had to leave, and they've taken my nigger, who is the only nigger I have in the world. Now I'm in a strange place, with no possessions left, nor anything else, and no way to earn a living.' So I sat down and cried. I slept in the woods all night. But what *did* happen to the raft, then? And Jim—poor Jim!\" The Duke responded, \"I'll be damned if *I* know—that is, what became of the raft. That old fool (the King) had made a deal and gotten forty dollars, and when we found him in the tavern, the idle men there had played coin games with him and taken every cent except what he'd spent on whiskey. And when I got him home late last night and found the raft gone, we said, 'That little rogue has stolen our raft and left us high and dry, and run off down the river.'\" I countered, \"I wouldn't abandon *my* nigger, would I?—the only nigger I had in the world, and my only property.\" \"We never considered that,\" the Duke admitted. \"The fact is, I suppose we had come to regard him as *our* nigger; yes, we did think of him that way—goodness knows he caused us enough trouble. So when we saw the raft was gone and we were completely broke, there was nothing else for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch for money again. And I've been hard up ever since.

The very first person I met there was the duke, who was putting up a poster for another three-night showing of the Royal Nonesuch, just like before. Those con artists had some nerve! I bumped into him before I could avoid it. He looked surprised and asked, \"Hello! Where did you come from?\" Then, sounding glad and hopeful, \"Where’s the raft? Is it in a safe spot?\" I replied, \"Well, that’s exactly what I was going to ask you, your grace.\" His face changed, and he said, \"Why would you ask me that?\" I explained, \"When I saw the king in the saloon yesterday, I realized we wouldn’t get him home for hours because he’d need to sober up first. So, I started wandering around town to kill time. A man offered me ten cents to help him ferry a sheep across the river. I agreed, but when we tried to load the sheep into the boat, it broke free, and we had to chase it all over the place. It took till dark to catch it, and finally, after we got it across, I headed back to the raft—only to find it gone. I thought, 'They must have gotten into trouble and left, taking my only companion, Jim. Now I’m stranded in a strange place, with no property and no way to make a living.' So, I sat down and cried, then slept in the woods. But what really happened to the raft—and to Jim?\" The duke said he didn’t know where the raft had gone. He explained that the king had made a deal and gotten forty dollars, but lost almost all of it playing games with loafers at the saloon, except what he spent on whiskey. Late that night, when he got the king back and saw the raft was missing, they both thought, 'That kid’s stolen our raft and run off down the river.' I protested, saying I’d never abandon Jim, my only companion and property. The duke admitted they hadn’t thought of that, and realized they’d started thinking of Jim as theirs—after all the trouble they’d gone to because of him. With the raft missing and no money left, they decided to try their luck with another performance of the Royal Nonesuch. The duke had stuck around ever since, parched and broke. Then he asked me for the ten cents I’d earned."

I’d seen all I wanted to of them, and wanted to get entirely shut of them.",

I didn't turn to look, but I had a feeling he was watching me, though I was confident I could outlast him. I went straight out into the country for about a mile before stopping; then I went back through the woods towards the Phelps' place. I decided I should start my plan immediately without delay, because I wanted to silence Jim until these men could get away. I wanted to avoid any conflict with their sort. I had seen all I wanted to of them and wished to be entirely rid of them.",

Still, I was sure I could outlast him if he tried to follow. I walked about a mile straight out before turning back through the woods toward the Phelps' place. I figured I should get started on my plan right away, so I could keep Jim quiet until those men could get away. I didn’t want anything to do with those people—I had seen enough of their type and wanted to be rid of them completely."

As a general thing it makes a body wish he was dead, too, and done with it all.\nPhelps’ was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations, and they all look alike. A rail fence round a two-acre yard; a stile made out of logs sawed off and up-ended in steps, like barrels of a different length, to climb over the fence with, and for the women to stand on when they are going to jump on to a horse; some sickly grass-patches in the big yard, but mostly it was bare and smooth, like an old hat with the nap rubbed off; big double log-house for the white folks—hewed logs, with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and these mud-stripes been whitewashed some time or another; round-log kitchen, with a big broad, open but roofed passage joining it to the house; log smoke-house back of the kitchen; three little log nigger-cabins in a row t’other side the smoke-house; one little hut all by itself away down against the back fence, and some outbuildings down a piece the other side; ash-hopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut; bench by the kitchen door, with bucket of water and a gourd; hound asleep there in the sun; more hounds asleep round about; about three shade trees away off in a corner; some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence; outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch; then the cotton fields begins, and after the fields the woods.\nI went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper, and started for the kitchen.

          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Upon arriving, the scene was completely still and quiet, like a Sunday, hot and intensely sunny. The farmhands had gone to the fields. There was a faint, constant buzzing sound from insects and flies in the air, which made the place feel so deserted, as if everyone was dead and gone. If a breeze came along and rustled the leaves, it made you feel sad and mournful, because it seemed like spirits whispering – spirits who had been dead for many, many years – and you always felt they were talking about you. Generally, this feeling made a person wish they were dead too, and just have it all over with. The Phelps' place was one of those small, one-horse cotton farms, and they all looked similar. There was a rail fence surrounding a two-acre yard. A stile, made from logs sawed off and stood upright in steps of different lengths, was there to climb over the fence and for women to stand on when mounting a horse. The large yard had a few weak patches of grass, but it was mostly bare and smooth, like an old, worn-out hat. The main house for the white family was a big double-log structure built with squared timbers, the gaps filled with mud or mortar and whitewashed at some point. The kitchen, a round-log building, was connected to the house by a large, open but roofed walkway. A log smoke-house was located behind the kitchen. On the other side of the smoke-house were three small log cabins in a row for the enslaved people. One small hut stood alone further back by the rear fence, with some other outbuildings a short distance away on the other side. By the small hut was an ash-hopper and a big kettle for boiling soap. Near the kitchen door was a bench with a water bucket and a gourd. A hound was sleeping there in the sun, and more hounds were asleep scattered around. About three shade trees stood off in a corner. Some currant and gooseberry bushes were located in one spot by the fence. Outside the fence was a garden and a watermelon patch, followed by the cotton fields, and then the woods. I went around the property, climbed over the back stile near the ash-hopper, and started walking towards the kitchen. After going a little way, I heard the faint, mournful hum of a spinning wheel rising and falling. At that point, I knew for certain that I wished I was dead, because that is the most lonesome sound in the entire world.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "When I arrived, everything was silent and had the quiet, restful feeling of a Sunday. The sun was hot and bright, and the workers had all gone to work in the fields. The only sounds were the soft buzzing of insects, which made the place feel empty and as if everyone had died or left. If a breeze happened to move through and stir the leaves, it felt sad, almost as if ghosts were quietly talking—ghosts from long ago—and you always imagine they're talking about you. Usually, feelings like this make you wish you were dead too, so everything would be over.\n\nThe Phelps' place was a small cotton plantation, much like many others. There was a rail fence enclosing a two-acre yard; a set of steps made from upturned logs, looking like differently sized barrels, to get over the fence and for women to stand on when mounting a horse; some scraggly patches of grass, but most of the yard was bare and worn smooth, like a hat that's lost its nap. There was a large double log house for the family, made of hewn logs sealed with mud or mortar, the mortar having been whitewashed at some point. The kitchen was also made of logs and was attached to the house by a wide, roofed but open passage, with a separate log smokehouse behind it. On the other side of the smokehouse was a row of three small log cabins for the enslaved people, one separate small hut near the back fence with some additional outbuildings nearby. There's an ash-hopper and a large kettle for boiling soap by the little hut; a bench sits near the kitchen door, with a bucket of water and a gourd for drinking; a hound sleeping in the sun, and more dogs around as well; a few shade trees off in a corner; a patch of currant and gooseberry bushes by the fence; outside the fence was a garden and a watermelon patch, and beyond that, the cotton fields began, which led into the woods.\n\nI went around and climbed over the back steps by the ash-hopper and headed toward the kitchen. After I had gone a little way, I heard the faint sound of a spinning-wheel, rising and falling in the distance. That sound made me feel even more sure that I wished I were dead—it was the loneliest sound I ever heard."

And such another powwow as they made! In a quarter of a minute I was a kind of a hub of a wheel, as you may say—spokes made out of dogs—circle of fifteen of them packed together around me, with their necks and noses stretched up towards me, a-barking and howling; and more a-coming; you could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres.\nA nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling-pin in her hand, singing out, “Begone you Tige! you Spot! begone sah!” and she fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling, and then the rest followed; and the next second half of them come back, wagging their tails around me, and making friends with me. There ain’t no harm in a hound, nohow.\nAnd behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger boys without anything on but tow-linen shirts, and they hung on to their mother’s gown, and peeped out from behind her at me, bashful, the way they always do. And here comes the white woman running from the house, about forty-five or fifty year old, bareheaded, and her spinning-stick in her hand; and behind her comes her little white children, acting the same way the little niggers was doing.

When I reached the halfway point, first one dog and then another got up and came towards me. Naturally, I stopped, faced them, and remained still. And what a noise they made! Within seconds, I was like the center of a wheel, with dogs forming the 'spokes' – about fifteen of them crowded tightly around me, stretching their necks and noses upwards, barking and howling. More were arriving; you could see them leaping over fences and coming around corners from all directions. An enslaved woman burst out of the kitchen with a rolling pin, shouting, 'Get away, Tige! You Spot! Go away, sir!' She struck several of the dogs, sending them yelping and scattering, with the rest following suit. But almost instantly, about half of them returned, wagging their tails around me and acting friendly. There's really no harm in a hound, after all. Following the woman came a small enslaved girl and two small enslaved boys wearing nothing but coarse linen shirts. They clung to their mother's skirt and shyly peeked out at me from behind her, as children often do. And then the white mistress, around forty-five or fifty years old, came running from the house, bareheaded and holding her spinning stick. Her own young white children followed her, behaving just like the enslaved children. She was smiling so broadly she could barely stand, and she said: 'It's you, at last, isn't it?' I blurted out a 'Yes, ma'am' before I could think. She grabbed me and hugged me tightly, then gripped both my hands and shook them vigorously. Tears filled her eyes and flowed down her face. She couldn't seem to hug and shake me enough, repeating, 'You don't resemble your mother as much as I thought you would, but goodness gracious, I don't care about that! I'm absolutely overjoyed to see you! My dear, it's like I could just eat you up! Children, this is your cousin Tom! Say hello to him.'",

Her young white children followed her, acting shy just like the Black children. She was so happy she could barely stand, and said, “It’s you, at last!

So then she started for the house, leading me by the hand, and the children tagging after. When we got there she set me down in a split-bottomed chair, and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me, holding both of my hands, and says:\n“Now I can have a good look at you; and, laws-a-me, I’ve been hungry for it a many and a many a time, all these long years, and it’s come at last!

Where’d she get aground?”\nI didn’t rightly know what to say, because I didn’t know whether the boat would be coming up the river or down. But I go a good deal on instinct; and my instinct said she would be coming up—from down towards Orleans. That didn’t help me much, though; for I didn’t know the names of bars down that way. I see I’d got to invent a bar, or forget the name of the one we got aground on—or—Now I struck an idea, and fetched it out:\n“It warn’t the grounding—that didn’t keep us back but a little. We blowed out a cylinder-head.”\n“Good gracious! anybody hurt?”\n“No’m. Killed a nigger.”\n“Well, it’s lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt. Two years ago last Christmas your uncle Silas was coming up from Newrleans on the old Lally Rook, and she blowed out a cylinder-head and crippled a man. And I think he died afterwards. He was a Baptist. Your uncle Silas knowed a family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well. Yes, I remember now, he did die. Mortification set in, and they had to amputate him. But it didn’t save him. Yes, it was mortification—that was it. He turned blue all over, and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection. They say he was a sight to look at. Your uncle’s been up to the town every day to fetch you. And he’s gone again, not more’n an hour ago; he’ll be back any minute now. You must a met him on the road, didn’t you?—oldish man, with a—”\n“No, I didn’t see nobody, Aunt Sally. The boat landed just at daylight, and I left my baggage on the wharf-boat and went looking around the town and out a piece in the country, to put in the time and not get here too soon; and so I come down the back way.”\n“Who’d you give the baggage to?”\n“Nobody.”\n“Why, child, it’ll be stole!”\n“Not where I hid it I reckon it won’t,” I says.\n“How’d you get your breakfast so early on the boat?”\nIt was kinder thin ice, but I says:\n“The captain see me standing around, and told me I better have something to eat before I went ashore; so he took me in the texas to the officers’ lunch, and give me all I wanted.”",

Once inside, she seated me in a chair with a woven seat and sat on a small low stool in front of me, holding both my hands. She said, \"Now I can really look at you; and, oh my goodness, I've longed for this many, many times over all these long years, and it's finally happened! We've been expecting you for two days or more. What held you up?—Did the boat get stuck?\" \"Yes, ma'am—she—\" \"Don't say 'yes, ma'am'—say 'Aunt Sally'. Where did she get stuck?\" I wasn't sure how to answer because I didn't know if the boat would be traveling upstream or downstream. But I often rely on my gut feeling, and my instinct told me it would be coming upstream—from down towards New Orleans. That didn't help much, though, as I didn't know the names of any sandbars in that area. I realized I had to either invent a bar name or claim I couldn't remember the name of the one we grounded on—or—Then I got an idea and blurted it out: \"It wasn't the grounding—that only delayed us a little.

Once inside, she sat me in a split-bottom chair, took a seat on a small stool in front of me, held my hands, and said, “Now I can really look at you. I’ve longed for this for years, and finally it’s happening! We’ve expected you for days. What delayed you? Did your boat get stuck?” I replied, “Yes, ma’am, it—” but she corrected me: “Don’t call me ma’am, call me Aunt Sally. Where did the boat get stuck?” I hesitated, unsure whether the boat should be coming up or down river, and didn’t know the local sandbars’ names. I realized I’d have to invent a name or pretend to forget it, but then I said, “It wasn’t getting stuck that held us up, but rather we blew out a cylinder-head.” “Goodness! Was anyone hurt?” “No, ma’am. Just a black man was killed.” “Well, that’s lucky; other people could’ve been hurt. Two years ago at Christmas, your uncle Silas was coming up from New Orleans on the Lally Rook and it blew a cylinder-head, injuring a man who later died. He was a Baptist, and your uncle knew his family through Baton Rouge connections. Yes, I recall now—he died, got mortification, and had to have a limb amputated, but still died. Turned blue and died hoping for heaven. He was quite a sight. Your uncle’s been going to town every day to fetch you, and left again only an hour ago. He’ll be back soon. You must have met him—he’s an older man with—” “No, Aunt Sally, I didn’t see anyone. The boat arrived at dawn, and I left my luggage on the wharf-boat to explore the town and countryside so I didn’t get here too early. I came in the back way.” “Who did you leave your baggage with?” “Nobody.” “Child, it might get stolen!” “Not where I hid it,” I assured her. “How’d you get breakfast so early on the boat?” That was tricky, but I answered, “The captain saw me and suggested I eat before going ashore. He took me to the officers’ mess and let me eat as much as I wanted.”"

Well, I sh’d reckon you won’t!”\n“No’m, I’m honest about it; I won’t ever do it again—till you ask me.”\n“Till I ask you! Well, I never see the beat of it in my born days! I lay you’ll be the Methusalem-numskull of creation before ever I ask you—or the likes of you.”\n“Well,” he says, “it does surprise me so. I can’t make it out, somehow.

I’ve a good mind to just—Tell me, what did you mean by kissing me?”\nLooking somewhat meek, he said:\n“I didn’t mean anything by it, ma’am. I didn’t intend any harm. I—I—thought you would like it.”\n“Why, you complete fool!” She picked up the spinning stick, and it looked like it was all she could do to resist hitting him with it. “What on earth made you think I’d like that?”\n“Well, I don’t really know.

Who exactly are ‘they’?”\nIt was everything she could do to keep from exploding. Her eyes flashed, and her fingers twitched as if she wanted to scratch him. She said:\n“Who is ‘everybody’?

Well, I certainly *hope* you won’t!”\n“No, ma’am, I’m being truthful; I won’t ever do it again—unless you ask me to.”\n“Unless I *ask* you! Well, I have never seen the like of it in all my born days! I guarantee you’ll be the most ancient idiot in existence before I ever ask you—or someone like you.”\n“Well,” he said, “that truly surprises me so much. I just can’t figure it out. They said you would, and I thought you would. But—” He paused and looked around slowly, as if he wished he could find a friendly face somewhere, settling finally on the old gentleman’s, and said, “Didn’t *you* think she’d like me to kiss her, sir?”\n“Why, no; I—I—well, no, I don’t believe I did.”\nThen he looked around the same way at me and said:\n“Tom, didn’t *you* think Aunt Sally would welcome me with open arms and say, ‘Sid Sawyer—’”\n“Good grief!” she burst out, interrupting him and lunging towards him, “You cheeky young scamp, to trick someone like that—.” She was about to hug him, but he held her off, saying:\n“No, not until you’ve asked me first.”\nSo she didn’t hesitate, but asked him; and hugged him and kissed him over and over again, and then turned him over to the old man, who received his share of the affection.

Where?”\n“In that hut down by the ash-hopper. Why, looky here. When we was at dinner, didn’t you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles?”\n“Yes.”\n“What did you think the vittles was for?”\n“For a dog.”\n“So’d I. Well, it wasn’t for a dog.”\n“Why?”\n“Because part of it was watermelon.”\n“So it was—I noticed it. Well, it does beat all that I never thought about a dog not eating watermelon. It shows how a body can see and don’t see at the same time.”\n“Well, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he locked it again when he came out. He fetched uncle a key about the time we got up from table—same key, I bet. Watermelon shows man, lock shows prisoner; and it ain’t likely there’s two prisoners on such a little plantation, and where the people’s all so kind and good. Jim’s the prisoner. All right—I’m glad we found it out detective fashion; I wouldn’t give shucks for any other way. Now you work your mind, and study out a plan to steal Jim, and I will study out one, too; and we’ll take the one we like the best.”\nWhat a head for just a boy to have! If I had Tom Sawyer’s head I wouldn’t trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clown in a circus, nor nothing I can think of. I went to thinking out a plan, but only just to be doing something; I knowed very well where the right plan was going to come from. Pretty soon Tom says:\n“Ready?”\n“Yes,” I says.\n“All right—bring it out.”\n“My plan is this,” I says. “We can easy find out if it’s Jim in there. Then get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from the island. Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the old man’s britches after he goes to bed, and shove off down the river on the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me and Jim used to do before. Wouldn’t that plan work?”\n“Work? Why, cert’nly it would work, like rats a-fighting. But it’s too blame’ simple; there ain’t nothing to it. What’s the good of a plan that ain’t no more trouble than that? It’s as mild as goose-milk. Why, Huck, it wouldn’t make no more talk than breaking into a soap factory.”\nI never said nothing, because I warn’t expecting nothing different; but I knowed mighty well that whenever he got his plan ready it wouldn’t have none of them objections to it.\nAnd it didn’t. He told me what it was, and I see in a minute it was worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a man as mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides. So I was satisfied, and said we would waltz in on it. I needn’t tell what it was here, because I knowed it wouldn’t stay the way, it was. I knowed he would be changing it around every which way as we went along, and heaving in new bullinesses wherever he got a chance. And that is what he done.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "We stopped talking and began thinking. After a while, Tom exclaimed, \"Hold on, Huck, how could we be so foolish not to realize it earlier! I'm sure I know where Jim is.\" \"No! Where?\" I asked. \"In that small building near the ash pile. Think about it. When we were having dinner, didn't you notice a Black man bringing food in there?\" \"Yes,\" I replied. \"What did you imagine the food was for?\" he pressed. \"For a dog,\" I said. \"Me too,\" Tom agreed. \"Well, it wasn't for a dog.\" \"Why not?\" I asked. \"Because part of it was watermelon.\" \"That's right—I saw that. Wow, it's amazing I never considered that a dog wouldn't eat watermelon. It just shows how you can look at something and not truly see it,\" I remarked. \"Also,\" Tom continued, \"the Black man unlocked the padlock to go in and locked it again when he came out. He brought Uncle Silas a key around the time we finished eating—probably the same key, I bet. Watermelon indicates a person, and a lock means a prisoner; and it's unlikely there are two prisoners on such a small farm, especially where everyone seems so nice. Jim is the prisoner. Excellent—I'm glad we discovered it like detectives; I wouldn't appreciate finding out any other way. Now you use your brain and devise a method to free Jim, and I'll come up with one too; then we'll choose the one we like best.\" I was astonished at how sharp Tom was for his age! If I had Tom Sawyer's intellect, I wouldn't trade it for being a duke, or a steamboat captain, or a circus performer, or anything else I could think of. I started planning, but mainly just to be doing something; I knew perfectly well where the truly effective plan would originate. Soon after, Tom asked, \"Ready?\" \"Yes,\" I answered. \"All right—tell me yours.\" \"My plan is this,\" I began. \"We can easily confirm if it's Jim in there. Then, tomorrow night, get my canoe and bring my raft over from the island. On the first dark night that comes, steal the key from the old man's pants after he's asleep, and float down the river on the raft with Jim, hiding during the day and traveling at night, just like Jim and I used to do. Wouldn't that plan work?\" \"Work? Of course, it would work, like a fight among rats. But it's too simple; there's nothing exciting about it. What's the point of a plan that's no more difficult than that? It's as uneventful as 'goose-milk.' Honestly, Huck, it wouldn't cause any more buzz than breaking into a soap factory.\" I didn't respond, because I expected precisely that kind of reaction; but I was quite certain that when Tom had his plan ready, it wouldn't have any of those drawbacks. And it didn't. He explained his idea, and I saw immediately it was fifteen times better than mine for creativity, would also set Jim free just as well, and might even get us all killed in the process. So I was content and said we would proceed with it. I don't need to describe his plan here, because I knew it wouldn't remain the same. I knew he would constantly alter it as we went along, adding new complicated flourishes whenever he had the opportunity. And that's exactly what he did.",

Look, at dinner didn’t you see a Black man bring some food into that hut?\"\n\"I did.\"\n\"Who did you think the food was meant for?\"\n\"A dog.\"\n\"Me too. But it wasn’t for a dog.\"\n\"How do you know?\"\n\"Because there was watermelon in it.\"\n\"You’re right, there was. Funny I never thought about dogs not eating watermelon. Goes to show you can see things and not really notice.\"\n\"And the man used a key to unlock the door when he went in, and locked it again when he left. He brought Uncle a key right as we finished eating—I bet it was the same one. Watermelon means it’s for a man, the lock means it’s a prisoner; I doubt such a tiny plantation would have two prisoners, specially when everyone here is so kind. So Jim must be the prisoner. I’m glad we figured this out like detectives; any other way wouldn’t have been as fun. Now, let’s both come up with a plan to rescue Jim and pick the best one.\"\n\nTom was so clever for a boy! If I had his brains, I wouldn’t trade them for anything—not even to be a duke or circus clown or steamboat mate. I started trying to make a plan, but only for show, since I already knew Tom would think of the real one. Soon Tom asked if I was ready. \n\n\"Yes,\" I answered.\n\"Alright, let’s hear your idea.\"\n\"Here’s mine: First, let’s make sure Jim’s really there. Then tomorrow night, I’ll bring my canoe and get my raft from the island. On the first dark night, we take the old man’s key after he’s asleep, and then escape down the river with Jim, hiding during the day and traveling at night like Jim and I did before. Think that would work?\"\n\"Work? Sure, but it’s too easy—there’s nothing to it! Where’s the fun in a plan with no hassle? Why, Huck, it wouldn’t get more attention than robbing a soap factory.\"\n\nI didn’t say anything, since that was what I expected from Tom, but I knew his plan, once he came up with it, wouldn’t be so plain. And I was right. When he told me, I could tell right away it was way fancier than mine, and would free Jim just as well—or maybe get us all killed, too. But I was satisfied and agreed to go along. I won’t bother to say just what Tom’s plan was, since I knew he’d keep changing it as we went along and add all sorts of new ideas—and that’s exactly how it went."

The niggers was just getting through breakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim’s nigger was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was leaving, the key come from the house.\nThis nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was all tied up in little bunches with thread. That was to keep witches off. He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and making him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of strange words and noises, and he didn’t believe he was ever witched so long before in his life. He got so worked up, and got to running on so about his troubles, he forgot all about what he’d been a-going to do. So Tom says:\n“What’s the vittles for? Going to feed the dogs?”\nThe nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when you heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:\n“Yes, Mars Sid, a dog. Cur’us dog, too. Does you want to go en look at ’im?”\n“Yes.”\nI hunched Tom, and whispers:\n“You going, right here in the daybreak? That warn’t the plan.”\n“No, it warn’t; but it’s the plan now.”\nSo, drat him, we went along, but I didn’t like it much. When we got in we couldn’t hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure enough, and could see us; and he sings out:\n“Why, Huck! En good lan’! ain’ dat Misto Tom?”\nI just knowed how it would be; I just expected it. I didn’t know nothing to do; and if I had I couldn’t a done it, because that nigger busted in and says:\n“Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?”\nWe could see pretty well now. Tom he looked at the nigger, steady and kind of wondering, and says:\n“Does who know us?”\n“Why, dis-yer runaway nigger.”\n“I don’t reckon he does; but what put that into your head?”\n“What put it dar? Didn’ he jis’ dis minute sing out like he knowed you?”\nTom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way:\n“Well, that’s mighty curious. Who sung out? When did he sing out? what did he sing out?” And turns to me, perfectly ca’m, and says, “Did you hear anybody sing out?”\nOf course there warn’t nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says:\n“No; I ain’t heard nobody say nothing.”\nThen he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before, and says:\n“Did you sing out?”\n“No, sah,” says Jim; “I hain’t said nothing, sah.”\n“Not a word?”\n“No, sah, I hain’t said a word.”\n“Did you ever see us before?”\n“No, sah; not as I knows on.”\nSo Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, and says, kind of severe:\n“What do you reckon’s the matter with you, anyway? What made you think somebody sung out?”\n“Oh, it’s de dad-blame’ witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I do. Dey’s awluz at it, sah, en dey do mos’ kill me, dey sk’yers me so. Please to don’t tell nobody ’bout it sah, er ole Mars Silas he’ll scole me; ’kase he say dey ain’t no witches. I jis’ wish to goodness he was heah now—den what would he say! I jis’ bet he couldn’ fine no way to git aroun’ it dis time. But it’s awluz jis’ so; people dat’s sot, stays sot; dey won’t look into noth’n’en fine it out f’r deyselves, en when you fine it out en tell um ’bout it, dey doan’ b’lieve you.”\nTom give him a dime, and said we wouldn’t tell nobody; and told him to buy some more thread to tie up his wool with; and then looks at Jim, and says:\n“I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger. If I was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, I wouldn’t give him up, I’d hang him.” And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good, he whispers to Jim and says:\n“Don’t ever let on to know us. And if you hear any digging going on nights, it’s us; we’re going to set you free.”\nJim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it; then the nigger come back, and we said we’d come again some time if the nigger wanted us to; and he said he would, more particular if it was dark, because the witches went for him mostly in the dark, and it was good to have folks around then.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Early the next morning, at daybreak, we got up and went down to the slave quarters. We wanted to pet the dogs and speak to the enslaved man who was feeding Jim, if Jim was indeed the one being held there. The enslaved workers were just finishing their breakfast and heading out to the fields. The man responsible for feeding Jim was filling a tin pan with bread, meat, and other food items. As the others departed, the key arrived from the main house. This enslaved man had a kind, simple face, and his hair was tied in small bunches with thread, which he did to keep witches away. He told us the witches had been terribly tormenting him lately, making him see and hear all sorts of strange things and sounds, and he felt he had never been so affected by witchcraft before in his life. He got so upset and went on about his troubles for so long that he completely forgot what he was doing. So Tom asked, \"What's the food for? Are you feeding dogs?\" The enslaved man's smile spread slowly across his face, like ripples from a tossed stone, and he said, \"Yes, Master Sid, a dog. A peculiar dog, too. Would you like to go and see him?\" Tom said, \"Yes.\" I nudged Tom and whispered, \"You're going in there now, in daylight? That wasn't the plan.\" He replied, \"No, it wasn't, but it is the plan now.\" So, annoyed with him, we went along, though I wasn't happy about it. Once inside, we could barely see anything because it was so dark, but Jim was certainly there and could see us. He called out, \"Why, Huck! Goodness gracious! Isn't that Master Tom?\" I knew this would happen; I fully expected it. I didn't know what to do, and even if I had, I couldn't have done it, because the enslaved man quickly interjected, saying, \"Well, good gracious! Does he know you gentlemen?\" We could see much better now. Tom looked steadily and somewhat bewildered at the enslaved man and asked, \"Does who know us?\" \"Why, this runaway slave here.\" \"I don't think he does; but what made you think that?\" \"What made me think it? Didn't he just call out as if he knew you?\" Tom, acting puzzled, said, \"Well, that's very strange. Who called out? When did they call out? What did they say?\" He then turned to me, perfectly calm, and asked, \"Did you hear anyone call out?\" Of course, there was only one thing I could say, so I replied, \"No, I didn't hear anyone say anything.\" Then he turned to Jim, examining him as if he'd never seen him before, and asked, \"Did you call out?\" \"No, sir,\" Jim replied, \"I haven't said anything, sir.\" \"Not a word?\" \"No, sir, I haven't said a word.\" \"Have you ever seen us before?\" \"No, sir, not that I know of.\" So Tom turned to the enslaved man, who looked frantic and distressed, and asked somewhat sternly, \"What do you think is wrong with you? What made you imagine someone called out?\" \"Oh, it's those terrible witches, sir,\" he cried, \"and I wish I were dead, I truly do. They're always bothering me, sir, and they almost kill me, they scare me so much. Please don't tell anyone about it, sir, or old Master Silas will scold me, because he says there are no witches. I just wish to goodness he was here now – then what would he say! I bet he wouldn't be able to explain his way out of it this time. But it's always the same; people who are stubborn stay stubborn; they won't investigate things for themselves, and when you find something out and tell them about it, they don't believe you.\" Tom gave him a dime and said we wouldn't tell anyone. He also advised him to buy more thread to tie up his hair. Then, looking at Jim, Tom remarked, \"I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this slave. If I were to catch a slave ungrateful enough to run away, I wouldn't hand him over, I'd hang him myself.\" While the enslaved man stepped to the door to examine the dime and bite it to test its authenticity, Tom whispered to Jim, \"Never let on that you know us. And if you hear any digging at night, it's us; we're going to free you.\" Jim only had time to grab our hands and squeeze them before the enslaved man returned. We told him we would come again sometime if he wanted us to, and he agreed, especially if it was dark, because the witches bothered him mostly at night, and it was good to have people around then.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "At dawn, we got up and went down to the cabins where the slaves lived so we could play with the dogs and try to befriend the slave who was feeding Jim—assuming Jim was the one being fed. The slaves were just finishing their breakfast before heading to the fields. Jim's feeder was loading a tin pan with bread, meat, and other food. As the other slaves left, a key arrived from the house.\n\nThis particular slave had a friendly but silly expression, with his hair tied up in little clumps with thread to ward off witches. He explained that witches had been bothering him badly at night, making him see and hear strange things, and he’d never felt so bewitched before. He got so caught up telling us about his troubles that he forgot what he was doing. So Tom asked him:\n\n“Who’s the food for? Are you feeding the dogs?”\n\nThe slave slowly grinned and replied, “Yes, Master Sid. A dog. An odd dog, too. Want to see him?”\n\nTom agreed, and I nudged him, whispering that this wasn’t supposed to be the plan. He replied that it was the plan now, so we went along, though I felt uneasy. Inside the cabin, it was so dark we could barely see, but Jim was there and recognized us, exclaiming, “Huck! And good lord, isn’t that Mr. Tom?”\n\nI knew something like this would happen and was at a loss for what to do, especially since the slave burst in, asking, “Good gracious! Does he know you two?”\n\nWhen our eyes adjusted, Tom looked at the slave with curiosity and questioned, “Who knows us?”\n\n“This runaway slave!” he replied.\n\n“I don’t think so; why do you say that?”\n\nThe slave said, “Didn’t he just now call out like he recognized you?”\n\nTom, acting puzzled, replied by asking me if I’d heard anyone call out. I said no. Then he asked Jim if he had spoken, and Jim denied it. Tom questioned further, but Jim insisted he hadn’t said a word or seen us before.\n\nTom then turned sternly to the slave and asked why he thought he’d heard someone call out. The slave blamed witches, saying they tormented him each night, scaring him with visions and sounds. He begged us not to tell anyone, because old Master Silas insisted there were no witches and would scold him. But if Master Silas saw this, he’d have to admit witches were real. The slave complained that people who make up their mind never change it, and no one ever believes you when you tell them the truth.\n\nTom gave him a dime and promised not to tell, suggesting he buy more thread for his hair. Then, looking at Jim, Tom wondered aloud if Uncle Silas might hang this slave for running away, saying that if he caught a slave who’d run off, he wouldn’t return him—he’d hang him! While the slave stepped outside to inspect and bite the dime, Tom quickly whispered to Jim not to act like he knew them, and if he heard digging at night, it would be them trying to free him.\n\nJim quickly squeezed our hands in thanks before the slave returned, and we told him we might visit again. He said he’d like that, especially at night, since the witches mostly bothered him in the dark and it helped to have people around then."

Now look at just that one thing of the lantern. When you come down to the cold facts, we simply got to let on that a lantern’s resky.

Tom explained that we needed some light to dig, but a lantern would be too bright and could cause trouble. What we really needed was a lot of those decaying wood pieces called fox-fire, which give off a soft glow in the dark. We gathered an armful and hid it in the weeds, then sat down to rest. Tom said, sounding quite annoyed: 'Darn it, this whole situation is just ridiculously easy and awkward. That makes it incredibly hard to come up with a challenging plan. There’s no watchman to drug – and there really *ought* to be a watchman. There isn’t even a dog to give a sleeping potion to. And Jim is just chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the leg of his bed. Honestly, all you have to do is lift the bed frame and slip the chain off. And Uncle Silas trusts everyone; he sends the key with the simple-minded slave and doesn’t send anyone to watch him. Jim could have gotten out that window already, except there would be no point trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg. Good grief, Huck, this is the most foolish setup I’ve ever seen. You have to invent *all* the difficulties yourself. Well, we can’t change it; we just have to do the best we can with what we have. Anyway, there’s one upside – there’s more credit in getting him out by overcoming lots of difficulties and dangers that weren't provided for you by the people who should have provided them, forcing you to create them all yourself. Just look at that lantern issue. Frankly, we simply have to pretend that a lantern is risky. We could probably work with a full parade of torches if we wanted to, I think.

You always come up with the most childish ways to do things. Haven’t you read any books at all? Not about heroes like Baron Trenck, Casanova, Benvenuto Cellini, or Henri IV? No one ever heard of such a simple, unadventurous way of freeing a prisoner! No, according to all the best stories, the correct method is to saw the bed leg in half, leave it that way, swallow the sawdust so it’s not found, and put dirt and grease on the cut so even the sharpest guard can’t tell it’s been tampered with and thinks the leg is solid. Then, on the night you’re ready, you kick the leg, it breaks off, you slip off your chain, and you’re free. All you have to do next is tie your rope ladder to the walls, climb down (and break your leg in the moat because a rope ladder is always nineteen feet too short), and your horses and loyal followers will be waiting to scoop you up, throw you on a saddle, and whisk you away to your homeland, be it Languedoc or Navarre or wherever.

Haven’t you ever read any adventure stories? Like Baron Trenck, Casanova, Benvenuto Cellini, Henri IV, or any of those daring heroes? Who ever heard of freeing a prisoner in such an unexciting way? No, the proper method, according to all the great stories, is to saw right through the bed-leg, leave it that way, swallow the sawdust so it can’t be found, and disguise the cut with some dirt and grease so even the sharpest jailer wouldn’t notice. Then, on the night of the escape, you just give the bed-leg a kick, the bed comes down, you slip off the chain, and off you go. All that’s left is to tie your rope ladder to the wall, climb down—probably breaking your leg because the ladder is much too short—and then your loyal friends whisk you away on horseback to your homeland, wherever that is. It’s spectacular, Huck. I just wish this cabin had a moat. Maybe, if we have enough time on the night we’re escaping, we can dig one.\""

What does the prisoner care whose—”\nHe broke off there, because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing. So we cleared out for the house.\nAlong during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the clothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in it, and we went down and got the fox-fire, and put that in too. I called it borrowing, because that was what pap always called it; but Tom said it warn’t borrowing, it was stealing. He said we was representing prisoners; and prisoners don’t care how they get a thing so they get it, and nobody don’t blame them for it, either. It ain’t no crime in a prisoner to steal the thing he needs to get away with, Tom said; it’s his right; and so, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a perfect right to steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves out of prison with. He said if we warn’t prisoners it would be a very different thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery person would steal when he warn’t a prisoner. So we allowed we would steal everything there was that come handy. And yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that, when I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he made me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for. Tom said that what he meant was, we could steal anything we needed. Well, I says, I needed the watermelon. But he said I didn’t need it to get out of prison with; there’s where the difference was. He said if I’d a wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal with, it would a been all right. So I let it go at that, though I couldn’t see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if I got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like that every time I see a chance to hog a watermelon.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Then we discussed how to make ink. While some use iron rust and tears, which is common, especially for women, the best approach, according to the experts, is using one's own blood. Tom suggested Jim could do this. To send secret messages to reveal his location, Jim could scratch them onto the bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out the window, just like the Man in the Iron Mask did – Tom insisted it was a good method. I pointed out Jim didn't have tin plates, as he was fed from a pan. Tom dismissed this, saying we could get him some. I argued that no one would be able to read the plates. Tom said that didn't matter; the point was for Jim to write the message and throw it out. He claimed you often can't read what prisoners write anyway. I then wondered why we'd waste plates if no one could read them. Tom exclaimed it wasn't the prisoner's plates being wasted. I countered that they belonged to someone. Tom was about to ask what the prisoner would care whose they were when the breakfast horn blew, so we hurried back to the house. Later that morning, I took a sheet and a white shirt from the clothesline and an old sack to carry them in. We also went to get fox-fire and put it in the sack. I considered it borrowing, as my pap always did, but Tom insisted it was stealing. He explained that since we were acting as prisoners, and prisoners don't care how they get things as long as they get them, and are not blamed for it, it was acceptable. Tom argued that for a prisoner, stealing necessities for escape isn't a crime but a right. Therefore, while we were playing prisoners, we had the absolute right to steal anything on the place that would help us escape. He added that if we weren't prisoners, it would be completely different, and only a truly awful person would steal. So, we agreed to steal anything useful we came across. Despite this rule, Tom later made a big deal when I stole and ate a watermelon from the slave garden. He made me give the slaves a dime without explaining why. Tom clarified that he meant we could steal anything we *needed* for the escape. I argued I needed the watermelon, but he explained the difference was that I didn't need it to get out of prison. He said if I'd wanted it to hide a knife to smuggle to Jim to kill the warden, that would have been fine. I accepted his explanation, even though I found it confusing to have to think through such fine points every time I saw a chance to grab something good, wondering if representing a prisoner was really worth it.",

He said if we weren't prisoners, it would be another story, and only a bad person would steal if he wasn't a prisoner. So we agreed to take anything useful we could.

Tom said we could only steal what we needed. I said I needed the watermelon, but he said I didn't need it to help Jim escape—that's the difference. He said if I wanted to use it to hide a knife to sneak to Jim so he could kill the guard, that would be okay. I let it go, but I didn't see the point in acting like a prisoner if every time I wanted something like a watermelon, I had to worry about all Tom's complicated rules."

He replied that they were for digging, questioning whether I expected them to gnaw their way out. I asked if the old, damaged picks and things in there weren't good enough for digging a person out. Tom looked at me with extreme pity, enough to make someone cry, and said, \"Huck Finn, have you ever heard of a prisoner being given picks, shovels, and other modern conveniences in their cell to dig themselves out? Now, honestly, if you have any sense at all, what chance would that give him to become a hero? They might as well just hand him the key and be done with it.

He told me: \"Everything’s good now except for the tools, but that’s easy to fix.\" \n\n\"Tools?\" I asked. \n\n\"Yep,\" he replied. \n\n\"Tools for what?\" \n\n\"To dig. We’re not going to gnaw him out, are we?\"\n\nI asked, \"Aren’t those old broken picks and things in there good enough to dig someone out with?\"\n\nHe looked at me sympathetically, almost enough to make a person cry, and said, \"Huck Finn, have you ever heard of a prisoner having picks, shovels, and all sorts of modern tools in his room so he can dig himself out? I want to ask you—if you’ve got any sense at all—what kind of chance would that give him to be a hero? They might as well give him the key. Picks and shovels—they wouldn’t even give those to a king.\"\n\n\"So,\" I said, \"if we’re not using picks and shovels, what are we going to use?\"\n\n\"A couple of case-knives.\"\n\n\"You mean to dig out the foundation of that cabin with case-knives?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That’s crazy, Tom.\"\n\n\"It doesn’t matter how crazy it seems, it’s the right way—it’s the way it’s always done. And I never heard of it being done any other way, and I’ve read all the books about these things. They always use a case-knife—not even to dig through dirt, but usually through solid rock. And it takes them weeks and weeks forever. For example, think about that prisoner in the bottom cell of the Chateau d’If in Marseilles Harbor who dug himself out that way; guess how long it took him?\"\n\n\"I don’t know.\"\n\n\"Come on, guess.\"\n\n\"I don’t know. A month and a half?\"\n\n\"Thirty-seven years—and he ended up in China. That’s the kind I mean. I wish the bottom of this place was solid rock.\""

Why can’t you stick to the main point?”\n“All right—I don’t care where he comes out, so he comes out; and Jim don’t, either, I reckon. But there’s one thing, anyway—Jim’s too old to be dug out with a case-knife. He won’t last.”\n“Yes he will last, too. You don’t reckon it’s going to take thirty-seven years to dig out through a dirt foundation, do you?”\n“How long will it take, Tom?”\n“Well, we can’t resk being as long as we ought to, because it mayn’t take very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans. He’ll hear Jim ain’t from there. Then his next move will be to advertise Jim, or something like that. So we can’t resk being as long digging him out as we ought to. By rights I reckon we ought to be a couple of years; but we can’t. Things being so uncertain, what I recommend is this: that we really dig right in, as quick as we can; and after that, we can let on, to ourselves, that we was at it thirty-seven years. Then we can snatch him out and rush him away the first time there’s an alarm. Yes, I reckon that’ll be the best way.”\n“Now, there’s sense in that,” I says. “Letting on don’t cost nothing; letting on ain’t no trouble; and if it’s any object, I don’t mind letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year. It wouldn’t strain me none, after I got my hand in. So I’ll mosey along now, and smouch a couple of case-knives.”\n“Smouch three,” he says; “we want one to make a saw out of.”\n“Tom, if it ain’t unregular and irreligious to sejest it,” I says, “there’s an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under the weather-boarding behind the smoke-house.”\nHe looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, and says:\n“It ain’t no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck.

Tom retorted, asking what that had to do with anything, pointing out that the other person (presumably a character from a story) didn't either. He complained that Huck was constantly getting sidetracked and urged him to focus on the main issue. Huck agreed, saying he didn't care how Jim got out, as long as he did, and he figured Jim felt the same. However, he brought up a concern: Jim was too old to be dug out gradually with a knife; he wouldn't survive the process. Tom insisted he would. He questioned if Huck really thought digging through a dirt foundation would take thirty-seven years. Huck asked how long it would actually take. Tom explained they couldn't risk taking as long as they ideally should because Uncle Silas might get news from the New Orleans area relatively soon and discover Jim wasn't from there. His next action would likely be to advertise for Jim. Therefore, they couldn't afford to spend as much time digging him out as they truly ought to. Tom estimated that by rights, it should take a couple of years, but they couldn't do that. Given the uncertainty, Tom's recommendation was to dig in as quickly as possible. Afterward, they could pretend to themselves that the process had taken thirty-seven years. Then, they could snatch him out and hurry him away the first time there was an alarm. Tom concluded that would probably be the best way. \"Now that makes sense,\" Huck said. \"Pretending doesn't cost anything; pretending isn't any trouble. If it's important, I don't mind pretending we worked on it for a hundred and fifty years. It wouldn't be difficult for me, once I got the hang of it. So, I'll go now and swipe a couple of pocketknives.\" \"Swipe three,\" Tom instructed. \"We need one to turn into a saw.\" Huck asked if it was unconventional or perhaps wrong to suggest it, but he mentioned there was an old rusty saw blade stuck under the siding behind the smokehouse. Tom looked somewhat weary and discouraged, saying, \"It's no use trying to teach you anything, Huck. Go on and steal the knives—three of them.\" So, Huck went and did it.",

He won't survive.\"\n\"Yes, he will. You don't really think it'll take thirty-seven years to dig through dirt with a knife, do you?\"\n\"How long will it take, Tom?\"\n\"We can't risk taking as long as we maybe should, because Uncle Silas may soon find out from New Orleans that Jim isn't from there. Then Uncle Silas will probably advertise for Jim or something. So we can't take as much time digging him out as perhaps we should. Really, we should take a couple of years; but we just can't. Things are too risky. My suggestion is, we dig as quickly as possible, and afterwards we pretend to ourselves that we worked at it for thirty-seven years. Then, when there's an alarm, we can grab Jim and get him out. Yes, I think that's our best plan.\"\n\"Now that's sensible,\" I replied. \"Pretending doesn't cost anything; it's no trouble; and if it makes a difference, I can pretend we dug for a hundred and fifty years.

Tom said he was right behind Jim’s bed now, and we’d dig in under it, and when we got through there couldn’t nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole there, because Jim’s counter-pin hung down most to the ground, and you’d have to raise it up and look under to see the hole. So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then we was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn’t see we’d done anything hardly. At last I says:\n“This ain’t no thirty-seven year job; this is a thirty-eight year job, Tom Sawyer.”\nHe never said nothing. But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped digging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking. Then he says:\n“It ain’t no use, Huck, it ain’t a-going to work. If we was prisoners it would, because then we’d have as many years as we wanted, and no hurry; and we wouldn’t get but a few minutes to dig, every day, while they was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn’t get blistered, and we could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right, and the way it ought to be done. But we can’t fool along; we got to rush; we ain’t got no time to spare. If we was to put in another night this way we’d have to knock off for a week to let our hands get well—couldn’t touch a case-knife with them sooner.”\n“Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?”\n“I’ll tell you. It ain’t right, and it ain’t moral, and I wouldn’t like it to get out; but there ain’t only just the one way: we got to dig him out with the picks, and let on it’s case-knives.”\n“Now you’re talking!” I says; “your head gets leveler and leveler all the time, Tom Sawyer,” I says. “Picks is the thing, moral or no moral; and as for me, I don’t care shucks for the morality of it, nohow. When I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school book, I ain’t no ways particular how it’s done so it’s done. What I want is my nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I want is my Sunday-school book; and if a pick’s the handiest thing, that’s the thing I’m a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sunday-school book out with; and I don’t give a dead rat what the authorities thinks about it nuther.”\n“Well,” he says, “there’s excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like this; if it warn’t so, I wouldn’t approve of it, nor I wouldn’t stand by and see the rules broke—because right is right, and wrong is wrong, and a body ain’t got no business doing wrong when he ain’t ignorant and knows better. It might answer for you to dig Jim out with a pick, without any letting on, because you don’t know no better; but it wouldn’t for me, because I do know better. Gimme a case-knife.”\nHe had his own by him, but I handed him mine. He flung it down, and says:\n“Gimme a case-knife.”\nI didn’t know just what to do—but then I thought. I scratched around amongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe and give it to him, and he took it and went to work, and never said a word.\nHe was always just that particular. Full of principle.",

We cleared an area of about four or five feet along the middle of the bottom log. Tom explained that this spot was directly behind Jim's bed, and we would tunnel underneath it. He figured that once we finished, no one in the cabin would discover the hole because Jim's bedspread hung nearly to the floor, requiring someone to lift it to see under the bed. So we dug and dug with our case-knives until close to midnight. By then, we were utterly exhausted, and our hands were covered in blisters, yet we had made almost no visible progress. Finally, I remarked, \"This isn't merely a thirty-seven-year project, Tom Sawyer; it's going to take thirty-eight years!\" He didn't reply immediately but sighed and soon stopped digging. I knew he was deep in thought for quite a while. Then he said, \"It's useless, Huck, it's not going to succeed. If we were actual prisoners, it would work, because then we'd have all the time we needed and no need to hurry. We'd only get a few minutes to dig each day while the guards were changing, which would keep our hands from getting blistered, and we could keep at it steadily, year after year, doing it properly, the way it should be done. But we can't just take our time; we have to move fast; we have no time to waste. If we worked another night like this, we'd have to stop for a week just to let our hands heal – we wouldn't be able to even touch a case-knife before then.\" \"Okay, then, what should we do, Tom?\" I asked. He answered, \"I'll tell you. It's not the right way, and it's not moral, and I wouldn't want anyone to know, but there's only one solution: we have to use picks to dig him out, but pretend they are case-knives.\" \"Now you're thinking!\" I exclaimed. \"You're getting wiser all the time, Tom Sawyer,\" I told him. \"Picks are the way to go, regardless of morality. As for me, I honestly don't care one bit about the morality of it. When I intend to steal something, be it a slave, a watermelon, or a Sunday-school book, I'm not particular about the method, just that it gets done. What I want is my slave; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I want is my Sunday-school book. And if a pick is the most convenient tool, that's what I'll use to get that slave, or watermelon, or Sunday-school book out. And I couldn't care less what the authorities think about it either.\" \"Well,\" he said, \"using picks and pretending is justifiable in a case like this. If it weren't, I wouldn't approve of it, nor would I stand by and watch the rules be broken – because right is right, and wrong is wrong, and a person has no business doing wrong when they are not ignorant and know better. It might be acceptable for you to dig Jim out with a pick without pretending, because you don't know any better; but it wouldn't be for me, because I do know better.\" \"Give me a case-knife,\" he instructed. He had his own nearby, but I handed him mine. He tossed it down and repeated, \"Give me a case-knife.\" I wasn't sure what he meant at first, but then I understood. I looked around amongst the old tools, found a pickaxe, and gave it to him. He took it, immediately started working with it, and didn't utter another word.

Then he said, “This isn’t going to work, Huck. If we were prisoners, it would work, because then we’d have all the time in the world and wouldn’t be in a rush. We’d only be able to dig a little each day when the guards changed, so our hands wouldn’t get sore and we could keep at it year after year. But we have to hurry; we don’t have much time.

Picks are the way to go, morals or not; and for me, I don't care about the morality of it. No matter if I’m set on stealing a slave, a watermelon, or a Sunday-school book, I don’t worry about how I do it, just that it gets done. If a pick is the easiest tool, then that’s what I’ll use. And I don’t care what the authorities think either.” Tom replied, “There’s a good reason for picks and pretending in a situation like this; if it weren’t, I’d never agree or let the rules get broken—because right is right and wrong is wrong, and no one should do wrong when they know better. Maybe you can use a pick to dig Jim out without pretending because you don’t know better; but I do, so I must pretend. Hand me a case-knife.” Although he had one, I gave him mine, but he threw it down and said again, “Hand me a case-knife.” I wasn’t sure what to do, but then I looked through the old tools, found a pickaxe and gave it to him.

We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was as long as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it. When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing his level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn’t come it, his hands was so sore. At last he says:\n“It ain’t no use, it can’t be done. What you reckon I better do? Can’t you think of no way?”\n“Yes,” I says, “but I reckon it ain’t regular. Come up the stairs, and let on it’s a lightning-rod.”\nSo he done it.\nNext day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house, for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin plates. Tom says it wasn’t enough; but I said nobody wouldn’t ever see the plates that Jim throwed out, because they’d fall in the dog-fennel and jimpson weeds under the window-hole—then we could tote them back and he could use them over again. So Tom was satisfied. Then he says:\n“Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim.”\n“Take them in through the hole,” I says, “when we get it done.”\nHe only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard of such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying. By-and-by he said he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn’t no need to decide on any of them yet. Said we’d got to post Jim first.\nThat night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took one of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard Jim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn’t wake him. Then we whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half the job was done. We crept in under Jim’s bed and into the cabin, and pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile, and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle and gradual. He was so glad to see us he most cried; and called us honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away, and clearing out without losing any time. But Tom he showed him how unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans, and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, sure. So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old times awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt Sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and both of them was kind as they could be, Tom says:\n“Now I know how to fix it. We’ll send you some things by them.”",

We kept at it for about half an hour, which was the maximum amount of time we could physically endure standing and working like that. However, our effort resulted in a considerable hole. When I went back upstairs, I looked out the window and saw Tom trying his absolute best to climb the lightning rod, but he couldn't manage it because his hands were too raw and sore. Finally, he said, \"It's no good, I can't do it. What do you think I should do? Can't you think of any alternative?\" \"Yes,\" I replied, \"but I don't think it's the proper way. Come upstairs the regular way, and we'll pretend it's the lightning rod.\" And that's what he did. The next day, Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick from the house to fashion into pens for Jim, along with six tallow candles. I hung around the slave quarters, waiting for an opportunity, and managed to steal three tin plates. Tom thought this wasn't enough, but I explained that no one would ever see the plates Jim threw out because they would land in the tall dog-fennel and jimpson weeds under the window opening. Then we could just pick them up and bring them back for him to use again. This explanation satisfied Tom. Then he said, \"Now, the problem we need to solve is how to get these things to Jim.\" \"We can take them through the hole,\" I said, \"once we finish digging it.\" He just gave me a scornful look, muttered something about nobody ever hearing of such a foolish idea, and then went back to thinking hard. After a while, he said he had worked out two or three possible methods, but there was no need to decide on any of them yet. He said our priority was to inform Jim first. That night, a little after ten o'clock, we climbed down the lightning rod, taking one of the candles with us. We listened under the window opening and heard Jim snoring, so we tossed the candle in, and it didn't wake him up. Then we eagerly returned to digging with the pick and shovel, and the job was completed in about two and a half hours. We carefully crept under Jim's bed and into the cabin, felt around until we found the candle, lit it, and stood over Jim for a moment, observing that he looked strong and healthy. Then we gently and gradually woke him up. He was so overjoyed to see us that he was close to tears, calling us endearing names like 'honey' and every other affectionate term he could think of. He immediately wanted us to find a cold chisel to cut the chain off his leg right away and leave without wasting any time. But Tom showed him how unconventional that would be according to his elaborate plans, sat down, and explained all our schemes to him. He detailed how we could change our plans instantly if there was any alarm and told Jim not to worry at all because we would absolutely ensure his escape. So Jim agreed that everything was fine, and we sat there talking about past times for a while. Then Tom asked him many questions, and when Jim mentioned that Uncle Silas visited him every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt Sally came in to make sure he was comfortable and had enough food, and that both of them were as kind as could be, Tom exclaimed, \"Ah, now I know how to handle this. We'll send you some things by them!\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I grabbed a shovel, and together we took turns digging with both the pick and the shovel, making quick progress. We worked at it for about half an hour, until we were too tired to keep going, but we ended up with a pretty decent hole. When I went upstairs and looked out the window, I saw Tom struggling to climb the lightning-rod because his hands were so sore. Eventually, he gave up and said it was impossible, and asked me for ideas. I said I had one, though it wasn’t the usual way—he should just come up the stairs and pretend it was the lightning-rod, which he did.\n\nThe next day, Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick from the house to make pens for Jim, and also grabbed six tallow candles. I hung around near the slave cabins waiting for a chance, and managed to steal three tin plates. Tom didn’t think that was enough, but I pointed out that no one would see the plates Jim threw out because they’d land among the tall weeds beneath the window—we could just fetch them back and reuse them. Tom agreed with that. Then he said the real challenge was figuring out how to get the items to Jim.\n\nI suggested passing them through the hole when we finished it, but Tom thought that idea was ridiculous and wanted something more elaborate. After thinking for a while, he said he’d come up with a few possibilities, but didn’t want to decide yet—he said we needed to make sure Jim was aware of the plan first.\n\nThat night, after ten o’clock, we climbed down using the lightning-rod again, took a candle with us, and listened below Jim’s window, hearing him snoring away. We tossed the candle inside, and Jim didn’t wake up, so we got busy with the pick and shovel. After about two and a half hours we finished digging, crawled under Jim’s bed and into the cabin, retrieved and lit the candle, and stood over Jim for a bit, making sure he seemed healthy. When we gently woke him, he was overjoyed to see us, calling us affectionate names, and wanted to immediately find something to cut the chain off his leg and escape. But Tom explained that wouldn’t follow the proper plan, and instead laid out all our ideas, promising Jim we’d get him out safely if there was ever any alarm. Jim agreed and felt reassured, so we all sat and reminisced for a while. Tom asked Jim a lot of questions, finding out that Uncle Silas came in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt Sally checked on his comfort and food—they were both being very kind. So Tom decided we’d sneak some supplies to Jim using them as messengers."

Jim had to be watchful and not show surprise, ensuring Nat didn't see him open the packages. We'd put smaller items into Uncle's coat pockets for Jim to pilfer, and tie things to Aunt's apron strings or hide them in her apron pocket if we found an opportunity. Tom detailed what these items would be and their purpose, and even instructed him on keeping a journal by writing on his shirt with his own blood, among other things. He laid out every detail.

We’d hide small things in our uncle’s coat pockets for Jim to steal and, if possible, tie things to our aunt’s apron-strings or put them in her apron pocket; we told Jim exactly what these items were and what he should do with them.

Tom was in an excellent mood, saying it was the most fun and intellectually stimulating thing he’d ever done.

We searched around and found an old tin washpan, patched up the holes as best we could so we could use it for baking the pie. Then we went down to the cellar, filled it with flour, and got ready for breakfast. We also found a couple of shingle nails, which Tom thought a prisoner could use to scratch his name and troubles into the dungeon walls. We put one of these nails into Aunt Sally’s apron pocket, which was hanging on a chair, and stuck the other into Uncle Silas’s hatband, which was lying on the bureau, because we’d heard the kids say their parents were going to the runaway slave’s house that morning. After that, we went in for breakfast, and Tom slipped the pewter spoon into Uncle Silas’s coat pocket. Aunt Sally wasn’t there yet, so we had to wait a bit."

But after that we was all right again—it was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold. Uncle Silas he says:\n“It’s most uncommon curious, I can’t understand it. I know perfectly well I took it off, because—”\n“Because you hain’t got but one on. Just listen at the man! I know you took it off, and know it by a better way than your wool-gethering memory, too, because it was on the clo’s-line yesterday—I see it there myself. But it’s gone, that’s the long and the short of it, and you’ll just have to change to a red flann’l one till I can get time to make a new one. And it’ll be the third I’ve made in two years. It just keeps a body on the jump to keep you in shirts; and whatever you do manage to do with ’m all is more’n I can make out. A body ’d think you would learn to take some sort of care of ’em at your time of life.”\n“I know it, Sally, and I do try all I can. But it oughtn’t to be altogether my fault, because, you know, I don’t see them nor have nothing to do with them except when they’re on me; and I don’t believe I’ve ever lost one of them off of me.”\n“Well, it ain’t your fault if you haven’t, Silas; you’d a done it if you could, I reckon. And the shirt ain’t all that’s gone, nuther. Ther’s a spoon gone; and that ain’t all. There was ten, and now ther’s only nine. The calf got the shirt, I reckon, but the calf never took the spoon, that’s certain.”\n“Why, what else is gone, Sally?”\n“Ther’s six candles gone—that’s what. The rats could a got the candles, and I reckon they did; I wonder they don’t walk off with the whole place, the way you’re always going to stop their holes and don’t do it; and if they warn’t fools they’d sleep in your hair, Silas—you’d never find it out; but you can’t lay the spoon on the rats, and that I know.”\n“Well, Sally, I’m in fault, and I acknowledge it; I’ve been remiss; but I won’t let to-morrow go by without stopping up them holes.”\n“Oh, I wouldn’t hurry; next year’ll do. Matilda Angelina Araminta Phelps!”\nWhack comes the thimble, and the child snatches her claws out of the sugar-bowl without fooling around any. Just then the nigger woman steps on to the passage, and says:\n“Missus, dey’s a sheet gone.”\n“A sheet gone! Well, for the land’s sake!”\n“I’ll stop up them holes to-day,” says Uncle Silas, looking sorrowful.\n“Oh, do shet up!—s’pose the rats took the sheet? Where’s it gone, Lize?”\n“Clah to goodness I hain’t no notion, Miss’ Sally. She wuz on de clo’sline yistiddy, but she done gone: she ain’ dah no mo’ now.”\n“I reckon the world is coming to an end. I never see the beat of it in all my born days. A shirt, and a sheet, and a spoon, and six can—”\n“Missus,” comes a young yaller wench, “dey’s a brass cannelstick miss’n.”\n“Cler out from here, you hussy, er I’ll take a skillet to ye!”",

Immediately, she began pouring coffee with one hand while simultaneously swatting the nearest child on the head with her thimble, and said, \"I've searched everywhere, and it's utterly baffling what happened to your other shirt.\" My stomach dropped, and a hard piece of cornbread I was trying to swallow got stuck, causing me to cough it up. It flew across the table, hitting one of the kids in the eye, making him double over like a hooked fish and yell loud enough to sound like a war cry. Tom also looked pale and sick. For about fifteen seconds, things were pretty chaotic, and I would have gladly escaped if I could. But then we recovered; it was just the sudden shock that had paralyzed us. Uncle Silas commented, \"It's really strange; I don't get it. I'm sure I took it off because—\" \"Because you're only wearing one now! Just listen to him! I know you took it off, and I know it better than your forgetful mind does, because it was on the clothesline yesterday—I saw it myself. But it's vanished, that's the plain truth, and you'll just have to wear a red flannel one until I can sew a new one. That will be the third one I've made in two years. It's a constant struggle just to keep you supplied with shirts, and what you manage to do with all of them is beyond me. Anyone would think you'd learn to take care of them at your age.\" \"I know, Sally, and I truly do try my best. But it shouldn't be entirely my fault, because, you know, I don't see them or handle them except when they're on me, and I don't think I've ever lost one while wearing it.\" \"Well, if you haven't lost one that way, it's not for lack of trying, I suppose. And the shirt isn't the only thing missing either. A spoon is gone; and that's not all. There used to be ten, and now there are only nine. The calf probably got the shirt, I figure, but a calf certainly didn't take the spoon.\" \"What else is missing, Sally?\" \"Six candles are gone, that's what. The rats could have taken the candles, and I bet they did; I'm surprised they haven't carried off the whole house, considering how you always say you'll seal up their holes but never do. If they weren't stupid, they'd sleep in your hair, Silas—you'd never notice; but you can't blame the spoon on the rats, I know that for sure.\" \"Alright, Sally, I admit I'm at fault; I've been negligent. But I promise I won't let tomorrow pass without sealing up those holes.\" \"Oh, don't rush! Next year will be fine. Matilda Angelina Araminta Phelps!\" (Aunt Sally's thimble hits the child) and the child quickly pulls her hands out of the sugar bowl without delay. Just then, an enslaved woman comes into the hallway and says, \"Mistress, a sheet is missing.\" \"A sheet is gone! Good heavens!\" \"I'll seal up those holes today,\" Uncle Silas says, looking upset. \"Oh, be quiet! Do you think the rats took the sheet? Where did it go, Lize?\" \"I swear to goodness I have no idea, Miss Sally. It was on the clothesline yesterday, but it's gone now; it's not there anymore.\" \"I think the world must be ending. I've never seen anything like this in my life. A shirt, and a sheet, and a spoon, and six candl—\" \"Mistress,\" says a young enslaved girl, \"a brass candlestick is missing.\" \"Get out of here, you imp, or I'll hit you with a frying pan!\"",

She began pouring coffee with one hand while tapping the nearest child's head with her thimble using the other. She complained, “I’ve searched everywhere, and I just can’t figure out what happened to your other shirt.” I felt a sinking feeling inside, and as I swallowed a tough piece of corn-crust, I started coughing, which caused it to shoot across the table and hit a child in the eye, making him react dramatically. Tom looked a bit pale, and everything was chaos for a moment before things settled down again—it was just the shock of the moment that unsettled us. Uncle Silas said it was strange, as he was sure he’d taken the shirt off. Sally challenged his memory, saying she knew it had been on the clothesline the previous day but now it was gone, so he’d have to wear a red flannel shirt until she could make another. She grumbled about constantly having to make new shirts for him, wondering what he did with them all, and said he ought to take better care at his age. Uncle Silas insisted he tried and only handled his shirts when he was wearing them, doubting he’d ever lost one otherwise. Sally retorted that it wasn’t his fault only because he hadn’t lost one that way—he would have if he could. She then added that a spoon was missing as well, and that there used to be ten but now there were only nine. She guessed maybe a calf got the shirt, but the calf couldn’t have taken the spoon. Silas asked what else was missing, and Sally replied that six candles were also gone, probably taken by rats. She teased that the rats might as well take over the whole house and that Silas would never notice. But, she said, the missing spoon couldn’t be blamed on rats. Silas admitted his neglect and promised to block the rats’ holes soon. Sally sarcastically told him not to rush, calling for her daughter Matilda Angelina Araminta Phelps while disciplining her for taking sugar. At that moment, the housemaid entered to announce that a sheet was missing. Sally was incredulous, exclaiming over all the missing items. Silas solemnly vowed to stop up the rat holes that very day. Sally mocked him, asking if he thought rats had taken the sheet and pressed the maid for details, who replied she had seen it on the line but it was gone now. Sally declared that she’d never seen the like—so many things missing! Just then, another servant reported a missing brass candlestick, and Sally angrily chased her out, threatening her with a skillet."

She froze, mouth wide open and hands raised; and personally, I wished I were anywhere else, like Jerusalem. But that feeling didn't last, because she quickly said: \"This is exactly what I figured. You had it in your pocket the whole time; and you probably have the other missing items in there as well. How did it end up there?\" He replied apologetically, “I truly don’t know, Sally, otherwise you know I’d tell you. I was reading my Bible passage from Acts Seventeen before breakfast, and I suppose I put the spoon in my pocket without realizing, intending instead to put my New Testament there, and it must have happened that way because my Testament isn’t in my pocket; but I’ll go check; and if the Testament is still where I left it, I’ll know I didn’t put it in my pocket, which will prove that I set the Testament down and picked up the spoon, and—” “Oh, for goodness sake! Give me a moment's peace! Get out of here right now, all of you; and don’t come near me again until I’ve calmed down.” I would have heard her even if she’d just muttered it to herself, let alone shouting it; and I would have gotten up and obeyed her even if I were dead.

Tom began counting the spoons and setting them aside, while I secretly slid one into my sleeve. Tom then announced, \"Aunt Sally, there are still only nine spoons.\" She told him to go play and stop bothering her, saying she knew there were more because she had counted them herself. Tom persisted, \"Well, Aunty, I've counted them twice, and I can only get nine.\" She looked extremely impatient but naturally came over to count, as anyone would. \"Good heavens, there really are only nine!\" she exclaimed. \"Why, what in the world—confound the things, I'll count them again.\" So I discreetly put the spoon back. When she finished counting the second time, she declared, \"Blast the troublesome junk, there are ten now!\" She looked both annoyed and flustered. But Tom countered, \"Aunty, I honestly don't think there are ten.\" \"You blockhead, didn't you just watch me count them?\" \"I know, but—\" \"Fine, I'll count them again.\" So I quickly took another spoon, and the count resulted in nine, just like the previous time. At this point, she was absolutely furious—just trembling all over with anger. But she kept counting and counting until she was so confused she would sometimes try to count the basket itself as a spoon. As a result, the count was ten three times and nine three times. Then she grabbed the basket, threw it across the house, sending the cat flying, and yelled for us to get out and leave her alone. She threatened to beat us if we bothered her again between then and dinner. We had successfully obtained the extra spoon, and while she was giving us our scolding, we slipped it into her apron pocket. Jim got it without trouble, along with her shingle nail, before noon. We were very pleased with this operation, and Tom believed it was worth double the effort. He explained that now she would never be able to count the spoons the same way twice again in her life and wouldn't believe her own count even if it happened to be right.

I know better; I already counted them.” Tom insisted, “Well, I’ve counted twice and can only find nine.” Aunt Sally, irritated, came to count for herself—as anyone would. She said, “Well, there really are only nine!” Getting frustrated, she decided to count again. While she was counting, I slipped the spoon back. When she finished, she exclaimed, “Now there are ten!” looking both annoyed and confused. Tom then said, “Aunty, I don’t think there are ten.” She responded, “Didn’t you just see me count them all?” Tom replied, “I know, but—” so she decided to count once more. I quickly swiped a spoon and, again, there were only nine. Aunt Sally became furious and started trembling with anger. She counted and recounted until she got so confused she sometimes counted spoons still in the basket. Three times she got the right number, three times she didn’t. At last, she snatched up the basket, threw it across the room, knocked the cat aside, and told us to leave her alone, threatening to punish us if we bothered her again before dinner. In the end, we managed to get the extra spoon and sneak it into her apron pocket while she was scolding us. Jim received the spoon along with the shingle nail before noon. We were very pleased with how things worked out, and Tom said it was twice as much fun as he expected, because now Aunt Sally would never be able to count her spoons correctly again, and even if she did, she wouldn’t trust her own counting.

          "text_segment": "Making them pens was a distressid tough job, and so was the saw; and Jim allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all. That’s the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall. But he had to have it; Tom said he’d got to; there warn’t no case of a state prisoner not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and his coat of arms.\n“Look at Lady Jane Grey,” he says; “look at Gilford Dudley; look at old Northumberland! Why, Huck, s’pose it is considerble trouble?—what you going to do?—how you going to get around it? Jim’s got to do his inscription and coat of arms. They all do.”\nJim says:\n“Why, Mars Tom, I hain’t got no coat o’ arm; I hain’t got nuffn but dish yer ole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat.”\n“Oh, you don’t understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very different.”\n“Well,” I says, “Jim’s right, anyway, when he says he ain’t got no coat of arms, because he hain’t.”\n“I reckon I knowed that,” Tom says, “but you bet he’ll have one before he goes out of this—because he’s going out right, and there ain’t going to be no flaws in his record.”\nSo whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece, Jim a-making his’n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon, Tom set to work to think out the coat of arms. By-and-by he said he’d struck so many good ones he didn’t hardly know which to take, but there was one which he reckoned he’d decide on. He says:\n“On the scutcheon we’ll have a bend or in the dexter base, a saltire murrey in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for common charge, and under his foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with a chevron vert in a chief engrailed, and three invected lines on a field azure, with the nombril points rampant on a dancette indented; crest, a runaway nigger, sable, with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister; and a couple of gules for supporters, which is you and me; motto, Maggiore fretta, minore atto. Got it out of a book—means the more haste, the less speed.”\n“Geewhillikins,” I says, “but what does the rest of it mean?”\n“We ain’t got no time to bother over that,” he says; “we got to dig in like all git-out.”\n“Well, anyway,” I says, “what’s some of it? What’s a fess?”\n“A fess—a fess is—you don’t need to know what a fess is. I’ll show him how to make it when he gets to it.”\n“Shucks, Tom,” I says, “I think you might tell a person. What’s a bar sinister?”\n“Oh, I don’t know. But he’s got to have it. All the nobility does.”\nThat was just his way. If it didn’t suit him to explain a thing to you, he wouldn’t do it. You might pump at him a week, it wouldn’t make no difference.\nHe’d got all that coat of arms business fixed, so now he started in to finish up the rest of that part of the work, which was to plan out a mournful inscription—said Jim got to have one, like they all done. He made up a lot, and wrote them out on a paper, and read them off, so:\n1. Here a captive heart busted.\n2. Here a poor prisoner, forsook by the world and friends, fretted out his sorrowful life.\n3. Here a lonely heart broke, and a worn spirit went to its rest, after thirty-seven years of solitary captivity.\n4. Here, homeless and friendless, after thirty-seven years of bitter captivity, perished a noble stranger, natural son of Louis XIV.\nTom’s voice trembled whilst he was reading them, and he most broke down. When he got done he couldn’t no way make up his mind which one for Jim to scrabble on to the wall, they was all so good; but at last he allowed he would let him scrabble them all on. Jim said it would take him a year to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail, and he didn’t know how to make letters, besides; but Tom said he would block them out for him, and then he wouldn’t have nothing to do but just follow the lines. Then pretty soon he says:\n“Come to think, the logs ain’t a-going to do; they don’t have log walls in a dungeon: we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock. We’ll fetch a rock.”\nJim said the rock was worse than the logs; he said it would take him such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn’t ever get out. But Tom said he would let me help him do it. Then he took a look to see how me and Jim was getting along with the pens. It was most pesky tedious hard work and slow, and didn’t give my hands no show to get well of the sores, and we didn’t seem to make no headway, hardly; so Tom says:\n“I know how to fix it. We got to have a rock for the coat of arms and mournful inscriptions, and we can kill two birds with that same rock. There’s a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill, and we’ll smouch it, and carve the things on it, and file out the pens and the saw on it, too.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Creating those writing tools was incredibly difficult, and the saw was just as bad. Jim thought the inscription would be the hardest task of all. This is the writing that the prisoner is supposed to scratch onto the wall. But it was non-negotiable; Tom insisted it had to be done, saying there was no instance of a state prisoner failing to scratch their inscription and coat of arms to leave behind. 'Look at Lady Jane Grey,' he exclaimed, 'look at Gilford Dudley; look at old Northumberland! Why, Huck, even if it is a lot of work, what are you going to do? How can you avoid it? Jim must do his inscription and coat of arms. They all do it.' Jim replied, 'Master Tom, I don't have a coat of arms; I have nothing but this old shirt, and you know I need that to keep the journal on.' 'Oh, you misunderstand, Jim,' Tom explained, 'a coat of arms is completely different.' 'Well,' I said, 'Jim is right, though, when he says he doesn't have a coat of arms, because he really doesn't.' 'I suppose I already knew that,' Tom said, 'but you can bet he'll have one before he gets out of here—because he's going to escape properly, and there won't be any defects in his record.' So while Jim and I filed away at our pens on separate brick pieces—Jim making his from brass and me from a spoon—Tom concentrated on devising the coat of arms. After a while, he said he had thought of so many good designs he could barely choose, but there was one he thought he would decide on. He said, 'On the shield, we will have a gold diagonal band on the lower right side, a reddish-purple cross in the center, with a lying-down dog as a main image, and under its paw a chain representing slavery, with a green pointed band at the top with jagged edges, and three curved lines on a blue background, with the central points standing up on a jagged horizontal band; the crest will be a black runaway slave, carrying his bundle over his shoulder on a diagonal bar; and a pair of red figures as supporters, which are you and me; the motto will be Maggiore fretta, minore atto. I got it from a book—it means the more speed, the less haste.' 'Wow,' I said, 'but what does the rest of it mean?' 'We don't have time to worry about that,' he replied; 'we need to get working as fast as possible.' 'Okay, but anyway,' I persisted, 'what are some of the parts? What's a fess?' 'A fess—a fess is—you don't need to know what a fess is. I'll show him how to make it when he gets to that part.' 'Seriously, Tom,' I said, 'I think you could tell a person. What's a bar sinister?' 'Oh, I don't know. But he has to have it. All noble people do.' That was just how he was. If he didn't feel like explaining something to you, he wouldn't. You could ask him for a week, and it wouldn't change anything. He had finished planning the entire coat of arms, so now he started working on the rest of that phase, which was to design a sad inscription—he said Jim had to have one, just like all prisoners did. He created several options, wrote them on paper, and read them aloud: 1. Here a captive heart broke. 2. Here a poor prisoner, abandoned by the world and friends, ended his sorrowful life in distress. 3. Here a lonely heart shattered, and a weary spirit found rest, after thirty-seven years of being held alone. 4. Here, without a home or friends, after thirty-seven years of cruel imprisonment, a noble stranger, the illegitimate son of Louis XIV, died. Tom's voice shook as he read them, and he almost cried. When he finished, he couldn't decide which one Jim should carve on the wall because they were all so good; but eventually, he decided he would let him carve all of them. Jim said it would take him a year to carve such a huge amount of text onto the logs with a nail, and besides, he didn't know how to make letters. But Tom said he would draw the outlines for him, and then Jim would just need to follow the lines. Then, pretty soon, he said, 'Thinking about it, the logs won't work; dungeons don't have log walls. We have to carve the inscriptions into a rock. We'll find a rock.' Jim said the rock was worse than the logs; he said it would take him such an incredibly long time to carve them into a rock that he would never escape. But Tom said he would let me help him do it. Then he checked to see how Jim and I were progressing with the pens. It was extremely annoying, hard, and slow work, and it wasn't allowing my hands to heal from the sores, and we didn't seem to be making much progress at all. So Tom said, 'I know how to solve it. We need a rock for the coat of arms and sad inscriptions, and we can use that same rock for two purposes. There's a big, fancy grindstone down at the mill, and we'll steal it, carve the designs on it, and also use it to sharpen the pens and the saw.'\n",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Making those pens was extremely hard, and so was the saw; and Jim thought that writing the inscription would be the hardest job of all. That's the message the prisoner has to scratch onto the wall. But Tom insisted it had to be done; every proper state prisoner left his inscription and his coat of arms behind.  \n\n\"Just think of Lady Jane Grey,\" he said, \"or Gilford Dudley, or old Northumberland! Even if it's troublesome, what are you going to do? There's no getting out of it—Jim must make his inscription and coat of arms. Everyone does.\"\n\nJim replied, \"But Master Tom, I ain't got no coat of arms; all I have is this old shirt, and you know I need it for my journal.\"\n\nTom answered, \"You don't get it, Jim; a coat of arms means something different.\"\n\nI added, \"Jim's right anyhow—he doesn’t have a coat of arms.\"\n\nTom replied, \"Sure, I knew that, but you can bet he'll have one before he gets out of here, ‘cause he's going to be set free the right way, with no details missing.\"\n\nSo while Jim and I kept working at making pens—him using brass, me using a spoon—Tom tried to come up with a design for the coat of arms. After a while, Tom said he’d thought of several good ones but finally decided on one. He said:\n\n\"On the shield we’ll have a gold stripe in the lower right, a purple X-shape in the middle, a dog lying down as a symbol, with a chain under its paw to represent slavery, a green chevron at the top with wavy edges, and three jagged lines on a blue field, with the points sticking up in the center on a zigzag base; on top, a black runaway slave figure, carrying a bundle on a left-leaning bar, and a pair of red supporters, which are you and me. The motto is 'Maggiore fretta, minore atto.' Got it from a book—it means the more hurry, the less speed.\"\n\n\"Gee whiz,\" I said, \"but what does the rest of it mean?\"\n\n\"No time to worry about that now,\" he said, \"we’ve got digging to do.\"\n\n\"But what’s some of it mean? What’s a fess?\"\n\n\"A fess is—you don’t need to know. I’ll show Jim how to make it when it’s his turn.\"\n\n\"Aw, Tom, you could at least tell a person. What’s a bar sinister?\"\n\n\"I don’t know. But he’s got to have it. All the nobles do.\"\n\nThat was Tom’s way—if he didn’t care to explain something, he simply wouldn’t, no matter how much you asked.\n\nOnce the coat of arms was decided, Tom started planning the sad inscription Jim would have to carve, the kind every prisoner leaves. He wrote out several examples and read them aloud:\n\n1. Here a captive heart broke.\n2. Here a poor prisoner, abandoned by the world and friends, grieved out his miserable life.\n3. Here a lonely heart broke, and a worn spirit found rest after thirty-seven years of solitary captivity.\n4. Here, homeless and friendless, after thirty-seven years of painful imprisonment, perished a noble stranger, natural son of Louis XIV.\n\nTom’s voice shook as he read them, nearly getting choked up. He couldn’t choose just one—they were all so good—so he decided Jim should carve them all. Jim protested that it would take a year to scratch all that onto the logs with a nail, plus he didn’t know how to make letters, but Tom said he would outline them first and Jim would only have to trace them. Soon Tom realized, though, that logs wouldn’t work—they don’t use log walls in dungeons: the inscription had to go on rock. So, they would need to bring a rock.\n\nJim complained that carving into rock was an even bigger task, but Tom said I could help him. Then Tom checked how our pen-making was going—it was awfully slow, hard work, and our hands were sore, not making much progress. So Tom said, \"I know how to solve this. We need a rock for the coat of arms and the inscriptions, and we can use one big rock for everything. There's a huge grindstone down at the mill—we’ll sneak it here, carve everything on it, and also use it to finish the pens and saw.\""

Master Tom, I’m willing to try most anything that isn’t unreasonable, but if you and Huck bring a rattlesnake in here for me to tame, I am going to leave, that’s for sure.” Tom said, “Well then, forget it, forget it, if you’re so stubborn about it. We can get you some garter snakes, and you can tie some buttons on their tails, and pretend they’re rattlesnakes, and I guess that will have to do.” Jim replied, “I can handle those, Master Tom, but I certainly could do without them, I tell you that. I never knew before that being a prisoner was so much bother and trouble.”",

Tom then said they could bring him some spiders, but Jim protested, saying he was afraid of them and would rather have rattlesnakes around than spiders. After thinking for a bit, Tom suggested having a rattlesnake as a pet, reasoning that other prisoners must have done it and it would be a good idea. Jim was alarmed by this, saying if a rattlesnake came in he would break through the log wall to escape. Tom tried to reassure Jim by saying that the snake could be tamed with kindness and would become friendly, perhaps even sleeping with him and letting him put its head in his mouth. Jim was horrified at the thought and refused, saying he definitely didn't want any such glory or risk. Tom then suggested they could try garter snakes with buttons on their tails to pretend they were rattlesnakes, and Jim reluctantly agreed, but remarked that he didn’t know being a prisoner was so troublesome."

Dey’s de dadblamedest creturs to ’sturb a body, en rustle roun’ over ’im, en bite his feet, when he’s tryin’ to sleep, I ever see. No, sah, gimme g’yarter-snakes, ’f I’s got to have ’m, but doan’ gimme no rats; I hain’ got no use f’r um, skasely.”\n“But, Jim, you got to have ’em—they all do. So don’t make no more fuss about it. Prisoners ain’t ever without rats. There ain’t no instance of it. And they train them, and pet them, and learn them tricks, and they get to be as sociable as flies. But you got to play music to them. You got anything to play music on?”\n“I ain’ got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o’ paper, en a juice-harp; but I reck’n dey wouldn’ take no stock in a juice-harp.”\n“Yes they would. They don’t care what kind of music ’tis. A jews-harp’s plenty good enough for a rat. All animals like music—in a prison they dote on it. Specially, painful music; and you can’t get no other kind out of a jews-harp. It always interests them; they come out to see what’s the matter with you. Yes, you’re all right; you’re fixed very well. You want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep, and early in the mornings, and play your jews-harp; play ‘The Last Link is Broken’—that’s the thing that’ll scoop a rat quicker ’n anything else; and when you’ve played about two minutes you’ll see all the rats, and the snakes, and spiders, and things begin to feel worried about you, and come. And they’ll just fairly swarm over you, and have a noble good time.”\n“Yes, dey will, I reck’n, Mars Tom, but what kine er time is Jim havin’? Blest if I kin see de pint. But I’ll do it ef I got to. I reck’n I better keep de animals satisfied, en not have no trouble in de house.”\nTom waited to think it over, and see if there wasn’t nothing else; and pretty soon he says:\n“Oh, there’s one thing I forgot. Could you raise a flower here, do you reckon?”\n“I doan know but maybe I could, Mars Tom; but it’s tolable dark in heah, en I ain’ got no use f’r no flower, nohow, en she’d be a pow’ful sight o’ trouble.”\n“Well, you try it, anyway. Some other prisoners has done it.”\n“One er dem big cat-tail-lookin’ mullen-stalks would grow in heah, Mars Tom, I reck’n, but she wouldn’t be wuth half de trouble she’d coss.”\n“Don’t you believe it. We’ll fetch you a little one and you plant it in the corner over there, and raise it. And don’t call it mullen, call it Pitchiola—that’s its right name when it’s in a prison. And you want to water it with your tears.”\n“Why, I got plenty spring water, Mars Tom.”\n“You don’t want spring water; you want to water it with your tears. It’s the way they always do.”\n“Why, Mars Tom, I lay I kin raise one er dem mullen-stalks twyste wid spring water whiles another man’s a start’n one wid tears.”\n“That ain’t the idea. You got to do it with tears.”\n“She’ll die on my han’s, Mars Tom, she sholy will; kase I doan’ skasely ever cry.”\nSo Tom was stumped. But he studied it over, and then said Jim would have to worry along the best he could with an onion. He promised he would go to the nigger cabins and drop one, private, in Jim’s coffee-pot, in the morning. Jim said he would “jis’ ’s soon have tobacker in his coffee;” and found so much fault with it, and with the work and bother of raising the mullen, and jews-harping the rats, and petting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things, on top of all the other work he had to do on pens, and inscriptions, and journals, and things, which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook, that Tom most lost all patience with him; and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for himself, and yet he didn’t know enough to appreciate them, and they was just about wasted on him. So Jim he was sorry, and said he wouldn’t behave so no more, and then me and Tom shoved for bed.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Tom stated that having rats is always necessary for a task done correctly, and asked Jim if he had any nearby. Jim replied that he hadn't seen any and didn't want any, calling them the most annoying creatures that disturb and bite you while trying to sleep. He said if he absolutely had to have animals, he'd prefer garter snakes over rats, for which he had practically no use. Tom insisted Jim must have rats, as all prisoners do, and told him to stop complaining. He explained that prisoners never lack rats; they train, pet, teach them tricks, and they become as friendly as flies, provided you play music for them. He asked if Jim had anything to play music on. Jim mentioned only a coarse comb, a piece of paper, and a jew's harp, doubting the rats would care for the latter. Tom disagreed, saying they aren't particular about the music type and a jew's harp is perfectly adequate. He claimed all animals, especially in prison, love music, particularly sad music, which is all you get from a jew's harp. It always grabs their attention and makes them curious. Tom assured Jim he was well set up and instructed him to sit on his bed mornings and nights, playing his jew's harp, specifically the song 'The Last Link is Broken,' which he claimed would attract rats faster than anything. After about two minutes of playing, all the rats, snakes, spiders, and other creatures would become concerned for him, come out, swarm over him, and have a wonderful time. Jim acknowledged this might happen but questioned what kind of experience *he* would be having, admitting he didn't see the benefit. However, he agreed to do it if required, thinking it best to keep the animals happy and avoid problems. Tom paused to consider if anything else was needed, then asked if Jim thought he could grow a flower in the cell. Jim was unsure, citing the darkness and lack of need for a flower, stating it would be a lot of trouble. Tom told him to try anyway, as other prisoners had. Jim suggested a large mullen-stalk might grow but wouldn't be worth the effort. Tom dismissed this, saying they would bring a small one, and Jim should plant it in the corner and care for it. He insisted Jim call it 'Pitchiola,' its correct name in prison, and water it with his tears. Jim countered that he had plenty of spring water. Tom insisted he *must* use tears, as it was the traditional method. Jim argued he could grow two mullen-stalks with spring water in the time it would take someone else to even start one with tears. Tom reiterated that using tears was the required method. Jim predicted the plant would surely die because he rarely cried. This stumped Tom momentarily, but after thinking, he decided Jim would have to manage as best he could with an onion. He promised to secretly drop one in Jim's coffee pot in the morning to make him cry. Jim complained he'd just as soon have tobacco in his coffee. He found so much fault with the onion idea, the work of growing the mullen, playing music for the rats, and petting the snakes and spiders, on top of all the other tasks like writing with pens, making inscriptions, keeping journals, and so on, which made being a prisoner more troublesome and stressful than anything he'd ever done. Tom nearly lost patience, saying Jim was burdened with more elaborate opportunities than any prisoner ever had to make a name for himself, but was too ignorant to appreciate them, thus wasting the chance. Jim felt sorry, apologized, and promised to behave better, and then Huck and Tom headed for bed.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Tom insisted that having rats in the prison was important, as it was always done that way, and asked if there were any around. Jim replied he hadn’t seen any, and expressed his dislike for rats, preferring garter snakes if he had to have animals, because rats were noisy and tended to bite at night. Tom insisted that all prisoners had rats, and that they even trained them and let them live with them, but that they had to play music for the rats. Jim said he only had a comb and a piece of paper, and a jew's-harp, but doubted rats would like that. Tom assured him rats liked any music, especially the sad kind a jew's-harp made, and told him to play \"The Last Link is Broken\" to attract them. Jim questioned what good this would do for him, but agreed to do it to avoid more problems. Tom then remembered that Jim should try raising a flower in his cell. Jim doubted it would grow or be worth the trouble, but Tom insisted and said they would call it Pitchiola and water it with tears, as was the custom for prisoners. Jim doubted he could produce enough tears to water it, so Tom decided Jim would have to use an onion instead, which displeased Jim further. With all the chores and rules, Jim complained that being a prisoner was more trouble than anything else he had ever tried. Tom got frustrated, saying Jim didn’t appreciate his chance to become legendary as a prisoner, but Jim apologized, promising to behave better, and then Tom and Huck went to bed."

But while we was gone for spiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found it there, and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out, and they did; and Aunt Sally she come in, and when we got back she was a-standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doing what they could to keep off the dull times for her. So she took and dusted us both with the hickry, and we was as much as two hours catching another fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome cub, and they warn’t the likeliest, nuther, because the first haul was the pick of the flock. I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was.\nWe got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and caterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to got a hornet’s nest, but we didn’t. The family was at home. We didn’t give it right up, but stayed with them as long as we could; because we allowed we’d tire them out or they’d got to tire us out, and they done it. Then we got allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all right again, but couldn’t set down convenient. And so we went for the snakes, and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and put them in a bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was supper-time, and a rattling good honest day’s work: and hungry?—oh, no, I reckon not! And there warn’t a blessed snake up there when we went back—we didn’t half tie the sack, and they worked out somehow, and left. But it didn’t matter much, because they was still on the premises somewheres. So we judged we could get some of them again. No, there warn’t no real scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell. You’d see them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then; and they generly landed in your plate, or down the back of your neck, and most of the time where you didn’t want them. Well, they was handsome and striped, and there warn’t no harm in a million of them; but that never made no difference to Aunt Sally; she despised snakes, be the breed what they might, and she couldn’t stand them no way you could fix it; and every time one of them flopped down on her, it didn’t make no difference what she was doing, she would just lay that work down and light out. I never see such a woman. And you could hear her whoop to Jericho. You couldn’t get her to take a-holt of one of them with the tongs. And if she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think the house was afire. She disturbed the old man so that he said he could most wish there hadn’t ever been no snakes created. Why, after every last snake had been gone clear out of the house for as much as a week Aunt Sally warn’t over it yet; she warn’t near over it; when she was setting thinking about something you could touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump right out of her stockings. It was very curious. But Tom said all women was just so. He said they was made that way for some reason or other.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The following morning, we traveled to the village and purchased a wire rat trap. We brought it back, unblocked the most suitable rat hole, and within about an hour, we had caught fifteen excellent specimens. We then placed the trap in a secure spot under Aunt Sally's bed. However, while we were away looking for spiders, young Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps discovered it there and opened the door to see if the rats would come out, which they did. Aunt Sally then entered the room, and when we returned, she was standing atop the bed, raising a fuss, while the rats were certainly making things lively for her. Consequently, she punished both of us with a hickory stick. It took us roughly two hours to catch another fifteen or sixteen rats – curse that interfering boy – and they weren't as good as the first ones, because that initial catch was the very best. I've honestly never seen a better group of rats than that first haul. We gathered a large collection of various spiders, bugs, frogs, caterpillars, and other things. We almost managed to capture a hornet's nest, but we didn't; the hornets were all home. We didn't give up immediately but stayed near them for as long as possible, assuming we would tire them out or they would tire us out, and they definitely tired us out. We then applied allycumpain salve to the affected areas and were mostly fine again, though sitting down comfortably was difficult. So, we went after snakes next, catching about two dozen garter and house snakes. We put them in a bag and took it to our room. By that time, it was supper, completing a truly good, hard day's work, and we were absolutely ravenous! However, when we returned, there wasn't a single snake left in the room. We hadn't tied the sack properly, and they had somehow gotten out and left. But it didn't matter much, because they were still somewhere on the property, so we figured we could catch some again. Indeed, there was a significant number of snakes around the house for quite some time. You'd see them dropping from the rafters and other spots occasionally, usually landing in your plate, or down the back of your neck, and typically where you least wanted them. Although they were attractive and striped, and a million of them wouldn't do any harm, that never made any difference to Aunt Sally. She despised snakes, no matter the species, and couldn't tolerate them in any way. Every time one fell on her, no matter what she was doing, she would immediately stop her task and run away. I've never seen such a woman. You could hear her yell a long distance away. You couldn't get her to hold one even with tongs. And if she turned over in bed and found a snake, she would scramble out and let out a scream that would make you think the house was on fire. She bothered the old man so much that he said he almost wished snakes had never been created. Even after every last snake had been gone from the house for as long as a week, Aunt Sally still hadn't gotten over it; she was far from recovered. If she was sitting and thinking about something, you could lightly touch the back of her neck with a feather, and she would jump dramatically. It was very peculiar. But Tom claimed that all women were just like that. He said they were designed that way for some particular reason.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The next morning, we went into town, bought a wire rat-trap, brought it back, and opened up the best rat-hole. In about an hour, we had caught fifteen excellent rats, which we then hid safely under Aunt Sally’s bed. However, while we went out to get spiders, little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Alexander Phelps found the trap, opened it to see if the rats would come out, and they did. When Aunt Sally walked in and saw what had happened, she was standing on her bed in a panic while the rats ran wild. When we got back, she punished us both with a hickory switch, and it took us about two hours to catch another batch of fifteen or sixteen rats, thanks to that meddling boy. These new ones weren’t as good as the first lot, either.\n\nWe managed to collect a great variety of spiders, bugs, frogs, caterpillars, and other creatures. We almost got a hornet’s nest too, but the hornets were home, so we didn’t succeed. We stuck around as long as we could, hoping to tire them out or be tired ourselves, and eventually they drove us off. Afterward, we used some ointment on our stings and soon felt better, though it was uncomfortable to sit. Next, we went to find snakes and caught about two dozen garter and house snakes, putting them in a bag in our room. By then, it was supper, and we had worked up a big appetite. But when we returned, all the snakes had escaped because we hadn’t closed the bag tightly. Still, the snakes were somewhere in the house, so we figured we could catch some again. For quite a while, snakes were common around the house—you’d see them hanging from the rafters and dropping down in all sorts of places, often landing in your food or down your shirt.\n\nThe snakes were pretty and harmless, but Aunt Sally couldn’t stand them and hated all kinds. No matter what she was doing, if a snake fell on her, she would drop everything and run, screaming so loudly it could be heard far away. She refused to touch them, even with tongs, and if she found one in bed, she’d jump out instantly and make a racket as if the house was on fire. She disturbed Uncle so much that he sometimes almost wished snakes didn’t exist. Even after all the snakes were gone for a week, Aunt Sally hadn’t gotten over it; a simple touch with a feather on her neck would make her jump. It was rather odd, but Tom said that all women were like that by nature."

Jim didn’t like the spiders, and the spiders didn’t like Jim; and so they’d lay for him, and make it mighty warm for him. And he said that between the rats and the snakes and the grindstone there warn’t no room in bed for him, skasely; and when there was, a body couldn’t sleep, it was so lively, and it was always lively, he said, because they never all slept at one time, but took turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, and when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so he always had one gang under him, in his way, and t’other gang having a circus over him, and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at him as he crossed over.

But we managed to get them, along with everything else; and Jim's cabin became extraordinarily lively when they all came out for the music and bothered him. Jim disliked the spiders, and the spiders seemed to dislike Jim as well; they would wait for him and make things quite uncomfortable for him. He also mentioned that with the rats, snakes, and the grindstone, there was hardly any space left for him in the bed; and even when there was, it was impossible to sleep due to the constant activity. It was always lively, he explained, because they never slept simultaneously but alternated shifts. Thus, when the snakes were asleep, the rats were active, and when the rats went to sleep, the snakes became vigilant. This meant he always had one group below him, interfering with him, and the other group causing a commotion above him. If he tried to find a new spot to sleep, the spiders would attack him as he moved across. He declared that if he ever escaped this time, he would never again allow himself to be a prisoner, not even for money. By the end of three weeks, everything was quite prepared.

Still, we managed to get all the snakes and other creatures together, and I swear, you never saw a cabin as lively as Jim’s when they all came out for music and made for him. Jim hated the spiders and they hated him right back—they’d lay in wait and make his life miserable. Jim said that between the rats, snakes, and the grindstone, there was hardly any space for him in bed; and even when he could lie down, he couldn’t sleep because the cabin was always full of activity. There was never a time when all the animals slept at once; when the snakes dozed the rats were up and about, and vice versa. That meant that Jim always had some of them crawling around beneath him and others running amok above, and if he tried to move to another spot, the spiders would seize their chance to get at him. He said if he ever escaped, he’d never let himself become a prisoner again, no matter what he was offered.\n\nBy the end of three weeks, everything was pretty well arranged.

Tom he went down the lightning-rod to spy around; and the nigger at the back door was asleep, and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back. This letter said:\nDon’t betray me, I wish to be your friend. There is a desprate gang of cutthroats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal your runaway nigger to-night, and they have been trying to scare you so as you will stay in the house and not bother them. I am one of the gang, but have got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again, and will betray the helish design. They will sneak down from northards, along the fence, at midnight exact, with a false key, and go in the nigger’s cabin to get him. I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if I see any danger; but stead of that I will BA like a sheep soon as they get in and not blow at all; then whilst they are getting his chains loose, you slip there and lock them in, and can kill them at your leasure. Don’t do anything but just the way I am telling you, if you do they will suspicion something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo. I do not wish any reward but to know I have done the right thing.\nUNKNOWN FRIEND",

Consequently, early the very next morning at the first light of dawn, we prepared another letter. We were uncertain how to deliver it, as we had heard them say during supper that they planned to have a Black man standing guard at both doors throughout the entire night. Tom climbed down the lightning rod to observe the situation. The Black guard at the back door was asleep, so Tom tucked the letter into the back of his neck and came back up. This letter stated:\r\nPlease do not reveal my identity; I wish to be your supporter. A ruthless gang of criminals from the Indian Territory is planning to steal your runaway enslaved person tonight. They have been attempting to frighten you into staying inside so you won't interfere with them. I am a member of this gang, but I have found religion and want to abandon this lifestyle to live honestly again, and therefore, I will expose their terrible plan. They will sneak from the north, along the fence, precisely at midnight, using a counterfeit key, and enter the enslaved person's cabin to take him. My instruction is to be stationed a little way off and blow a tin horn if I detect any danger. However, instead, I will bleat like a sheep as soon as they get inside and will not blow the horn at all. Then, while they are releasing his chains, you should quietly approach and lock them inside, and you can eliminate them at your leisure. Only do exactly as I am instructing; if you do otherwise, they will become suspicious and create a massive commotion. I seek no reward other than the knowledge that I have done what is right.\r\nYour Unknown Friend",

The very next morning, as soon as the sun came up, we prepared another letter and were trying to figure out how to deliver it. The previous night at dinner, we’d overheard that they were planning to have a Black man watching both doors all night. Tom climbed down the lightning rod to check things out; he found the man at the back door asleep, so he put the letter in the back of his neck and came back. The letter said: Don’t turn me in; I want to help you. There’s a dangerous gang from Indian Territory coming tonight to steal your escaped slave, and they’ve been trying to frighten you so you’ll stay inside and not interfere. I’m part of the gang but I’ve found religion, want to leave this life of crime, and am willing to reveal their wicked plan. They’ll sneak down from the north by the fence, right at midnight, with a fake key to break into the slave’s cabin. My job is to watch from a distance and blow a horn if there’s trouble, but instead I’ll make a sheep’s ‘baa’ noise when they go in, and won’t sound the horn at all. While they’re freeing his chains, you should sneak over, lock them in, and you’ll be able to deal with them as you please. Follow my instructions exactly; if you do anything else they’ll get suspicious and cause a commotion. I’m not seeking any reward—just the satisfaction of doing the right thing.

Well, I reckon you’d think so if you’d a been in this house for a while back. Why, they’ve stole everything they could lay their hands on—and we a-watching all the time, mind you. They stole that shirt right off o’ the line! and as for that sheet they made the rag ladder out of, ther’ ain’t no telling how many times they didn’t steal that; and flour, and candles, and candlesticks, and spoons, and the old warming-pan, and most a thousand things that I disremember now, and my new calico dress; and me and Silas and my Sid and Tom on the constant watch day and night, as I was a-telling you, and not a one of us could catch hide nor hair nor sight nor sound of them; and here at the last minute, lo and behold you, they slides right in under our noses and fools us, and not only fools us but the Injun Territory robbers too, and actuly gets away with that nigger safe and sound, and that with sixteen men and twenty-two dogs right on their very heels at that very time! I tell you, it just bangs anything I ever heard of. Why, sperits couldn’t a done better and been no smarter. And I reckon they must a been sperits—because, you know our dogs, and ther’ ain’t no better; well, them dogs never even got on the track of ’m once! You explain that to me if you can!—any of you!”\n“Well, it does beat—”\n“Laws alive, I never—”\n“So help me, I wouldn’t a be—”\n“House-thieves as well as—”\n“Goodnessgracioussakes, I’d a ben afeard to live in sich a—”\n“’Fraid to live!—why, I was that scared I dasn’t hardly go to bed, or get up, or lay down, or set down, Sister Ridgeway. Why, they’d steal the very—why, goodness sakes, you can guess what kind of a fluster I was in by the time midnight come last night. I hope to gracious if I warn’t afraid they’d steal some o’ the family! I was just to that pass I didn’t have no reasoning faculties no more. It looks foolish enough now, in the daytime; but I says to myself, there’s my two poor boys asleep, ’way up stairs in that lonesome room, and I declare to goodness I was that uneasy ’t I crep’ up there and locked ’em in! I did. And anybody would. Because, you know, when you get scared that way, and it keeps running on, and getting worse and worse all the time, and your wits gets to addling, and you get to doing all sorts o’ wild things, and by-and-by you think to yourself, spos’n I was a boy, and was away up there, and the door ain’t locked, and you—” She stopped, looking kind of wondering, and then she turned her head around slow, and when her eye lit on me—I got up and took a walk.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The place was packed with farmers and their wives for dinner, and the noise was incredible. Old Mrs. Hotchkiss was the loudest; her tongue never stopped. She declared to Sister Phelps that she had thoroughly searched the cabin and was certain the slave was insane. She insisted she had told Sister Damrell the very same thing – that he was crazy, and everything proved it. She pointed to the carved grindstone as proof, asking if any sane person would carve such nonsensical things onto a stone, like accounts of people breaking hearts or living thirty-seven years, calling it 'everlasting rubbish.' She reiterated that he was completely crazy, stating it was her opinion from the beginning, the middle, and always – 'the nigger’s crazy—crazy ’s Nebokoodneezer,' she said. Old Mrs. Damrell added, 'And look at that rag ladder, Sister Hotchkiss; what on earth could he possibly want with that?' Mrs. Hotchkiss exclaimed that she had just said the same thing to Sister Utterback, asking 'what could he have wanted with it?' Another voice, Brer Penrod, cut in, 'But how in the world did they ever get that grindstone in there, anyway? And who dug that hole? And who—' Mrs. Hotchkiss interrupted, claiming those were her exact thoughts. Passing the molasses, she told Brer Penrod she had just been saying to Sister Dunlap, 'how did they get that grindstone in there?' Emphasizing 'without help, mind you—without help!' She insisted there was help, 'plenty' of it, estimating a dozen people helped the slave. She declared she would 'skin every last nigger on this place' until she found out who did it. Another, Brer Hightower, countered, 'A dozen, you say! forty couldn’t have done everything that’s been done.' He cited the painstakingly made case-knife saws, the bed-leg sawed off (a week's work for six men), and the straw dummy on the bed as evidence of the immense effort. Mrs. Hotchkiss responded, 'You may well say it, Brer Hightower! It’s just as I was saying to Brer Phelps himself.' She recounted asking him what he thought, and when he mentioned the sawed bed-leg, she stated it didn't saw itself off – someone sawed it, and that was her unwavering opinion. Brer Marples chimed in, suggesting 'a house-full o’ niggers' must have been working nightly for four weeks, pointing to the shirt covered in 'secret African writ’n done with blood' as proof of many people involved. He said he'd pay two dollars to have it read and would lash the ones who wrote it. Mrs. Phelps then spoke, addressing Brother Marples about the idea of people helping. She said anyone living in their house lately would think so, as things were constantly stolen despite their watchfulness. She listed stolen items: the shirt, the sheet used for the ladder (stolen multiple times), flour, candles, candlesticks, spoons, the warming-pan, her new dress, and 'most a thousand things.' She stressed that she, Silas, Sid, and Tom were on constant watch 'day and night,' yet never saw or heard anyone. She expressed astonishment that the slave 'slides right in under our noses and fools us,' not only them but also the suspected 'Injun Territory robbers,' and actually got away 'safe and sound' with the slave, despite sixteen men and twenty-two dogs right behind them. She declared it 'just bangs anything I ever heard of,' suggesting they must have been 'spirits' because their excellent dogs couldn't track them. She challenged anyone to explain it. Other guests murmured in disbelief and fear: 'Well, it does beat—', 'Laws alive, I never—', 'So help me, I wouldn't a be—', 'House-thieves as well as—', 'Goodnessgracioussakes, I’d a ben afeard to live in sich a—'. Mrs. Phelps then described her own terror to Sister Ridgeway, saying she was so scared she was afraid to go to bed, get up, lie down, or sit down. She was afraid 'they'd steal the very—' and that by midnight she was in such a 'fluster' she was afraid they might steal some of her family members. She said she lost her 'reasoning faculties' and, thinking how foolish it seems now, she crept upstairs and locked her two boys in their room because she was so uneasy. She explained that anyone would understand because when fear builds and your wits become addled, you do wild things, and you imagine being a boy alone upstairs with an unlocked door. She paused, looking thoughtful, then slowly turned her head. When her eyes met mine, I got up and walked away.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The entire place was full of farmers and their wives having dinner, and the noise of everyone talking was overwhelming. Mrs. Hotchkiss talked more than anyone, constantly chattering. She insisted that after searching the cabin, she was convinced the black man was insane and repeated this to everyone around her, pointing to strange things like odd writing on a grindstone and claiming no sane person would do such things. She went on about bizarre messages and carvings, insisting repeatedly that he must be mad, as crazy as Nebuchadnezzar. \n\nMrs. Damrell added that there was even a ladder made out of rags and wondered what use that could have been to him. Mrs. Hotchkiss chimed in that she had been saying the very same thing to others. Another person questioned how they even got a grindstone into the cabin, who dug a hole, and so on, while Mrs. Hotchkiss maintained that the man must have had help—more than one person, possibly a dozen—and said she would find out everyone who helped him. \n\nOthers argued that even forty people could barely have managed everything that was done: making saws from case knives, cutting a bed-leg, making a dummy from straw, and so forth. They supposed there must have been a large group helping night after night. Someone was amazed at a shirt covered with strange writing, presumably done with blood, and wondered how many people worked on it. Suspicion and accusations continued to fly; they lamented about the thefts—shirts, sheets, flour, candles, spoons, dress, and more—especially since the whole household was supposed to be on constant watch.\n\nDespite all their efforts, the people involved in the escape managed to fool everyone, including a group of robbers from Indian Territory, and got away with the black man right under their noses, with sixteen men and twenty-two dogs in pursuit. The dogs never even got the scent, so some insisted there must have been supernatural aid. \n\nSome women declared they were so frightened by all this thievery that they barely dared to sleep or even move, locking up their children out of fear they might be stolen too. Looking back, it seemed foolish, but in the moment, fear had made them irrational. One woman described how scared she was for her sons, locking them in their room at night, and reflecting on how such fear drives people to do strange things. As she spoke and looked at me, I decided to leave the room."

Then, I recounted everything I had previously told Uncle Silas.

Of course I judged he must be a runaway nigger, and there I was! and there I had to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night. It was a fix, I tell you! I had a couple of patients with the chills, and of course I’d of liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn’t, because the nigger might get away, and then I’d be to blame; and yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail. So there I had to stick plumb until daylight this morning; and I never see a nigger that was a better nuss or faithfuller, and yet he was risking his freedom to do it, and was all tired out, too, and I see plain enough he’d been worked main hard lately. I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars—and kind treatment, too.

And the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and towed her over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start.

This time, instead of a bed leg, they fastened him to a large metal staple driven into the lowest log of the cabin. They also chained both his hands and both his legs and declared he would only receive bread and water until his owner came or he was sold at auction because his owner didn't appear within a certain period. They filled in the hole we'd made and ordered two armed farmers to guard the cabin every night, with a bulldog tied to the door during the day. As they finished up, wrapping things with a final round of curses, the old doctor arrived and inspected the situation. He told them not to be any rougher on Jim than absolutely necessary because he wasn't a bad fellow. The doctor explained that when he reached the location where he found the boy (Tom), he realized he couldn't remove the bullet without help, and the boy was too weak for him to leave to get assistance. The boy's condition worsened, and after some time, he became delirious, refusing to let the doctor come near him, threatening to kill him if he marked his raft, and talking all sorts of wild nonsense. Seeing he couldn't manage alone, the doctor decided he had to find help somehow. The moment he said this, Jim crawled out from somewhere and offered to assist, which he did, and did very well. The doctor naturally assumed Jim was a runaway slave and found himself stuck there, forced to stay with them throughout the rest of the day and all night. It was a real predicament, he admitted. He had patients in town suffering from chills whom he would have liked to check on, but he dared not leave for fear Jim might escape, which would have made him responsible. Yet, no boat came close enough for him to signal. So, he was stuck right there until daylight that morning. He added that he had never encountered a slave who was a better or more faithful nurse, noting that Jim was risking his own freedom to help and was clearly exhausted, having been worked very hard recently. He liked Jim for that, telling the gentlemen that such a slave was worth a thousand dollars and deserved kind treatment. The doctor had everything he needed, and the boy was doing as well there as he would have at home, perhaps even better because it was so quiet. But the doctor was stuck with both of them on his hands until about dawn that morning. Then, some men in a small boat came by, and fortunately, Jim was sitting by the makeshift bed, sound asleep with his head propped on his knees. The doctor quietly gestured them in, and they silently approached and quickly grabbed and tied him up before he was even aware of what was happening, and there was no trouble. Since the boy was also in a somewhat light sleep, they muffled the boat's oars, attached the raft, and towed it away smoothly and quietly. Jim didn't make the slightest sound or say a word from the beginning. He concluded by stating, 'He's not a bad slave, gentlemen; that's my assessment of him.'",

They said he’d only get bread and water to eat until his owner came, or until he was sold at auction if his owner didn’t show up in time. They sealed up the hole we had made and arranged for a couple of armed farmers to watch the cabin each night, with a bulldog tied to the door during the day.

At that moment, Jim appeared from somewhere and offered to help, which he did very well. The doctor suspected Jim was a runaway, but had to stay with both patients all night and day, missing out on seeing his other patients. No boats passed close enough to call for help, so he had to stick it out until morning. He said Jim proved to be an excellent and loyal nurse, even though he was risking his own freedom and was clearly exhausted from hard work.

So I slips to the sick-room, and if I found him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that would wash. But he was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and pale, not fire-faced the way he was when he come. So I set down and laid for him to wake. In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding in, and there I was, up a stump again! She motioned me to be still, and set down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful now, because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he’d been sleeping like that for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all the time, and ten to one he’d wake up in his right mind.\nSo we set there watching, and by-and-by he stirs a bit, and opened his eyes very natural, and takes a look, and says:\n“Hello!—why, I’m at home! How’s that? Where’s the raft?”\n“It’s all right,” I says.\n“And Jim?”\n“The same,” I says, but couldn’t say it pretty brash. But he never noticed, but says:\n“Good! Splendid! Now we’re all right and safe! Did you tell Aunty?”\nI was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says: “About what, Sid?”\n“Why, about the way the whole thing was done.”\n“What whole thing?”\n“Why, the whole thing. There ain’t but one; how we set the runaway nigger free—me and Tom.”\n“Good land! Set the run— What is the child talking about! Dear, dear, out of his head again!”\n“No, I ain’t out of my HEAD; I know all what I’m talking about. We did set him free—me and Tom. We laid out to do it, and we done it. And we done it elegant, too.” He’d got a start, and she never checked him up, just set and stared and stared, and let him clip along, and I see it warn’t no use for me to put in. “Why, Aunty, it cost us a power of work—weeks of it—hours and hours, every night, whilst you was all asleep. And we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and the shirt, and your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and case-knives, and the warming-pan, and the grindstone, and flour, and just no end of things, and you can’t think what work it was to make the saws, and pens, and inscriptions, and one thing or another, and you can’t think half the fun it was. And we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things, and nonnamous letters from the robbers, and get up and down the lightning-rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, and made the rope ladder and send it in cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and things to work with in your apron pocket—”\n“Mercy sakes!”\n“—and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on, for company for Jim; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat that you come near spiling the whole business, because the men come before we was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us and let drive at us, and I got my share, and we dodged out of the path and let them go by, and when the dogs come they warn’t interested in us, but went for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for the raft, and was all safe, and Jim was a free man, and we done it all by ourselves, and wasn’t it bully, Aunty!”",

Aunt Sally stayed by the sickbed throughout the day and night, and every time I saw Uncle Silas looking lost, I kept out of his way. The next morning, I heard Tom was much better, and they said Aunt Sally had gone to take a nap. So I quietly went into the sickroom. If I found him awake, I thought we could invent a believable story for the family. But he was sleeping, very peacefully, and looked pale, not flushed with fever like when he arrived. So I sat down and waited for him to wake up. About half an hour later, Aunt Sally quietly came in, and I was caught again! She motioned for me to be quiet, sat down next to me, and whispered that we could all be happy now because all his symptoms were excellent. He had been sleeping soundly for a long time, looking better and more peaceful all the while, and it was very likely he would wake up in his right mind. So we sat there watching, and soon he stirred a little, opened his eyes naturally, looked around, and said, \"Hello! Why, I'm home! How'd that happen? Where's the raft?\" \"It's fine,\" I said. \"And Jim?\" \"He's fine,\" I replied, but I couldn't say it very confidently. But he didn't notice and said, \"Good! Splendid! Now we're completely alright and safe! Did you tell Aunt Sally?\" I was going to say yes, but she interrupted and asked, \"Tell me about what, Sid?\" \"Why, about how the whole thing was done.\" \"What whole thing?\" \"Why, the whole thing. There's only one; how Tom and I freed the runaway slave.\" \"Good heavens! Freed the run— What is the child talking about?! Oh dear, dear, he's delirious again!\" \"No, I'm not delirious; I know exactly what I'm talking about. Tom and I *did* free him. We planned to do it, and we did it. And we did it with flair, too.\" He was excited, and she didn't stop him; she just sat and stared, letting him chatter on. I saw there was no point in me trying to get a word in. \"Why, Aunt Sally, it took a huge amount of work—weeks of it—hours every single night while you were all asleep. And we had to steal candles, and a sheet, and a shirt, and your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and case knives, and the warming pan, and the grindstone, and flour, and just an endless list of things. You can't imagine the effort it took to make the saws, and pens, and inscriptions, and all sorts of other things. And you can't even imagine half the fun it was! We even had to draw pictures of coffins and things, and fake anonymous letters from robbers, and climb up and down the lightning rod, and dig a tunnel into the cabin, and make the rope ladder and send it in baked inside a pie, and send in spoons and tools to work with hidden in your apron pocket—\" \"For goodness sake!\" \"—and fill Jim's cabin with rats and snakes and such for company. And then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat that you almost ruined the whole plan, because the men arrived before we were out of the cabin, and we had to rush. They heard us and shot at us, and I got hit. We jumped off the path to let them pass, and when the dogs came, they weren't interested in us but followed the loudest noise. We got our canoe, headed for the raft, and were completely safe. And Jim was a free man, and we did it all by ourselves, and wasn't it wonderful, Aunt Sally!\"",

I sat and waited for him to wake up. After about half an hour, Aunt Sally quietly came in, told me to be quiet, and sat beside me. She whispered that we could all be happy now because Tom's symptoms were great, he’d been sleeping well, looked better and more peaceful, and was likely to wake up in his right mind. We watched him together. Soon, Tom stirred, opened his eyes naturally, saw us, and asked why he was at home and what happened to the raft. I told him everything was fine, and when he asked about Jim, I said the same, though I wasn’t very confident. He didn’t notice, and said it was good because we were all safe. Tom asked if I’d told Aunt Sally about everything we’d done. She asked what he meant, and Tom explained how he and I had freed the runaway slave, Jim, and described all the work involved: sneaking around at night, stealing supplies, making tools, sending messages, creating distractions with rats and snakes, and rushing out just in time to escape. He excitedly recounted how we managed to set Jim free on our own, and insisted it was a great adventure."

She called for Huck to come out from under the bed, which I did, though I felt pretty sheepish.\n\nAunt Sally looked as confused as anyone I’d ever seen—except perhaps Uncle Silas, who came in and heard everything and was so overwhelmed, it was as if he’d gotten dizzy. He was so addled that he delivered a sermon that night that left everyone bewildered, since no one could understand a word of it.\n\nAunt Polly then explained to everyone who I really was and how it all happened. I had to admit that when Mrs. Phelps mistook me for Tom Sawyer—at which point Aunt Sally insisted I call her Aunt Sally, since she was used to it—I had no choice but to play along, knowing Tom wouldn’t mind. Tom liked making adventures out of things like this, and he pretended to be Sid to help me out. \n\nAunt Polly then shared that Tom had been right about Miss Watson freeing Jim in her will. So, in the end, Tom Sawyer had gone to great lengths and made a huge fuss just to free someone who was already free!
