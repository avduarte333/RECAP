I remember him looking round the cove and whistling to himself as he did so, and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so often afterwards: “Fifteen men on the dead man’s chest—Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!”\nin the high, old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and broken at the capstan bars. Then he rapped on the door with a bit of stick like a handspike that he carried, and when my father appeared, called roughly for a glass of rum. This, when it was brought to him, he drank slowly, like a connoisseur, lingering on the taste and still looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard.\n“This is a handy cove,” says he at length; “and a pleasant sittyated grog-shop. Much company, mate?”\nMy father told him no, very little company, the more was the pity.\n“Well, then,” said he, “this is the berth for me. Here you, matey,” he cried to the man who trundled the barrow; “bring up alongside and help up my chest. I’ll stay here a bit,” he continued. “I’m a plain man; rum and bacon and eggs is what I want, and that head up there for to watch ships off. What you mought call me? You mought call me captain. Oh, I see what you’re at—there”; and he threw down three or four gold pieces on the threshold. “You can tell me when I’ve worked through that,” says he, looking as fierce as a commander.\nAnd indeed bad as his clothes were and coarsely as he spoke, he had none of the appearance of a man who sailed before the mast, but seemed like a mate or skipper accustomed to be obeyed or to strike. The man who came with the barrow told us the mail had set him down the morning before at the Royal George, that he had inquired what inns there were along the coast, and hearing ours well spoken of, I suppose, and described as lonely, had chosen it from the others for his place of residence. And that was all we could learn of our guest.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "At the request of Squire Trelawney, Dr. Livesey, and these other gentlemen, I have been asked to record the full story about Treasure Island, from beginning to end. I am holding nothing back except for the exact location of the island, solely because there is still treasure remaining there that hasn't been recovered. Therefore, in the year of grace 17--, I pick up my pen and return to the time when my father ran the Admiral Benbow inn and the weather-beaten old sailor with the sabre cut first came to lodge under our roof. I recall him as clearly as if it happened yesterday: he arrived laboriously walking towards the inn door, his sea chest following behind him on a handcart pulled by another man. He was a tall, strong, heavily built man with a dark, tanned complexion. His stiff, tar-covered pigtail hung over the shoulder of his soiled blue coat, his hands were rough and scarred with black, broken fingernails, and a dirty, pale white scar ran across one cheek from a sabre cut. I remember him looking around the cove while quietly whistling to himself before suddenly bursting into that old sea song he would sing so frequently afterwards: \"Fifteen men on the dead man’s chest—Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!\" He sang this in a high, old, shaky voice that sounded as though it had been worn out and broken by working at the capstan. He then knocked on the door using a piece of stick, like a small crowbar, that he was carrying. When my father appeared, he roughly demanded a glass of rum. When it was brought to him, he drank it slowly, like someone who appreciated good drink, lingering over the taste and still looking out at the cliffs and up at our signpost. \"This is a convenient little cove,\" he said at length, \"and a nicely situated pub. Do you get many customers, mate?\" My father told him no, very few customers, which was a shame. \"Well, then,\" he said, \"this is the place for me. Hey you, matey,\" he called to the man pushing the cart, \"bring it alongside and help me get my chest in. I'll be staying here for a while,\" he continued. \"I'm a simple man; rum and bacon and eggs are what I need, and that high spot there to watch ships. What should you call me? You can call me captain. Oh, I see what you're looking for—here\"; and he threw down three or four gold coins on the doorstep. \"You can inform me when I've gone through that,\" he said, looking as stern as a military officer. And indeed, despite his poor clothes and rough manner of speaking, he did not look like a common sailor who served before the mast, but rather seemed like an officer or captain accustomed to being obeyed or resorting to physical discipline. The man who came with the cart told us that the mail coach had dropped him off the previous morning at the Royal George inn, that he had inquired about inns along the coast, and presumably hearing good things about ours and that it was described as quiet, had chosen it over the others as his place of residence. And that was the sum of what we could learn about our guest.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Squire Trelawney, Dr. Livesey, and the others have asked me to write a complete account of Treasure Island, telling the entire story except for the exact location of the island, which I will keep secret because some treasure is still left there. So, I begin my tale, returning to the period when my father managed the Admiral Benbow inn and the weathered old sailor with the scar on his face first arrived to stay with us.\n\nI recall him as clearly as if it happened just yesterday: he trudged up to our inn's entrance, dragging his sea-chest behind him on a wheelbarrow. He was a tall, broad, and weather-beaten man, with a tarred ponytail draped over his stained blue jacket, rough and scarred hands with dirty, broken nails, and a pale, ugly scar across one cheek. I remember him glancing around the bay, whistling quietly, before launching into a sea shanty he would sing many times later: “Fifteen men on the dead man’s chest—Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!” His voice was aged and shaky, as if worn out from singing at sea.\n\nHe knocked on the door with a stick shaped like a handspike, and when my father answered, he demanded a glass of rum in a gruff manner. When the drink was served, he sipped it slowly, savoring the flavor, all the while scanning the cliffs and our inn’s sign.\n\nHe finally said, “This is a good spot and a nicely placed tavern. Do you get many guests?” My father replied that there were hardly any, which was unfortunate. “Well, that suits me,” the man answered. He then called the man who was wheeling his chest to bring it inside, saying he would be staying for a while. He explained that he was a simple man who wanted rum, bacon, and eggs, as well as a view of the sea to watch ships from. Asked what to call him, he replied, “You can call me captain,” and threw down several gold coins, telling my father to let him know when he’d used up that much credit, while looking fierce and commanding.\n\nEven though his clothes were shabby and his manners rough, he didn’t look like an ordinary sailor but rather someone used to being in charge, perhaps a mate or captain. The man who’d helped with his sea-chest told us that the old sailor had arrived by the mail coach the day before at the Royal George, asked about local inns, and, after hearing ours was well thought of and isolated, chose it as his lodgings. That was all we learned about our new guest."

All day he hung round the cove or upon the cliffs with a brass telescope; all evening he sat in a corner of the parlour next the fire and drank rum and water very strong. Mostly he would not speak when spoken to, only look up sudden and fierce and blow through his nose like a fog-horn; and we and the people who came about our house soon learned to let him be. Every day when he came back from his stroll he would ask if any seafaring men had gone by along the road. At first we thought it was the want of company of his own kind that made him ask this question, but at last we began to see he was desirous to avoid them. When a seaman did put up at the Admiral Benbow (as now and then some did, making by the coast road for Bristol) he would look in at him through the curtained door before he entered the parlour; and he was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any such was present. For me, at least, there was no secret about the matter, for I was, in a way, a sharer in his alarms. He had taken me aside one day and promised me a silver fourpenny on the first of every month if I would only keep my “weather-eye open for a seafaring man with one leg” and let him know the moment he appeared. Often enough when the first of the month came round and I applied to him for my wage, he would only blow through his nose at me and stare me down, but before the week was out he was sure to think better of it, bring me my four-penny piece, and repeat his orders to look out for “the seafaring man with one leg.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The man was habitually a person of few words. Throughout the day, he could be found observing the cove or the cliffs using a brass telescope; in the evenings, he would occupy a corner seat by the fire in the common room, consuming very potent rum and water. Generally, he would not respond when addressed, instead looking up suddenly and fiercely, expelling air through his nose with a sound like a foghorn. Consequently, both the inhabitants of our house and its visitors quickly learned to leave him undisturbed. Upon returning from his daily walk, he consistently inquired if any sailors had passed along the road. Initially, we presumed he felt lonely for company of his own kind, but we eventually understood that he actually wished to evade them. Whenever a sailor did lodge at the Admiral Benbow (which happened occasionally as they traveled the coastal route toward Bristol), he would peer at them through the draped doorway before entering the parlour and would invariably become completely silent in their presence. For my part, the situation was quite clear, as I was, in a sense, privy to his anxieties. He had taken me aside one day and offered me a fourpenny silver coin at the beginning of each month on the condition that I remain watchful for a \"seafaring man with one leg\" and inform him the moment such a person appeared. Frequently, when the start of the month arrived and I requested my payment, he would merely snort at me and stare me down. However, before the week concluded, he would certainly reconsider, give me my fourpenny piece, and reiterate his instruction to be on the lookout for \"the seafaring man with one leg.\"",

He spent most of his days walking around the cove or standing on the cliffs, watching through a brass telescope. In the evenings, he would sit quietly in a corner near the fireplace at the inn, drinking strong rum and water. He rarely replied when spoken to; instead, he’d give a sudden, fierce glare and make a loud sound through his nose, which made us and our visitors soon learn not to bother him. Each day after his walk, he’d always ask if any sailors had passed by on the road. At first, we assumed he simply missed the company of other seamen, but over time we realized he was actually trying to avoid them. Whenever a seaman stopped at the Admiral Benbow inn—which sometimes happened as they traveled to Bristol—he would peek at them from behind the curtain before entering the room and would become extremely quiet if they were around. I, for one, knew exactly what was going on, since he had once pulled me aside and promised me a silver fourpenny every month if I kept a lookout for a sailor with one leg and told him the moment such a person appeared. When payday came, he was often stubborn and wouldn’t pay me right away, just glaring and making that same noise with his nose, but later in the week he’d end up giving me the coin and reminding me to keep watch for that one-legged sailor."

On stormy nights, when the wind shook the four corners of the house and the surf roared along the cove and up the cliffs, I would see him in a thousand forms, and with a thousand diabolical expressions. Now the leg would be cut off at the knee, now at the hip; now he was a monstrous kind of a creature who had never had but the one leg, and that in the middle of his body. To see him leap and run and pursue me over hedge and ditch was the worst of nightmares. And altogether I paid pretty dear for my monthly fourpenny piece, in the shape of these abominable fancies.\nBut though I was so terrified by the idea of the seafaring man with one leg, I was far less afraid of the captain himself than anybody else who knew him. There were nights when he took a deal more rum and water than his head would carry; and then he would sometimes sit and sing his wicked, old, wild sea-songs, minding nobody; but sometimes he would call for glasses round and force all the trembling company to listen to his stories or bear a chorus to his singing. Often I have heard the house shaking with “Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum,” all the neighbours joining in for dear life, with the fear of death upon them, and each singing louder than the other to avoid remark. For in these fits he was the most overriding companion ever known; he would slap his hand on the table for silence all round; he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question, or sometimes because none was put, and so he judged the company was not following his story. Nor would he allow anyone to leave the inn till he had drunk himself sleepy and reeled off to bed.",

On stormy nights, when the wind rattled the house's structure and the waves crashed loudly along the bay and against the cliffs, I would picture him in countless guises and with myriad wicked expressions. Sometimes his leg was severed at the knee, sometimes at the hip; other times he appeared as a grotesque creature who had never possessed more than a single leg, bizarrely situated in the middle of his torso. Witnessing him leap, run, and chase me across fields and ditches was the absolute worst of my nightmares. In essence, I felt I was paying quite a high price, in the form of these horrible fantasies, for the fourpence I received each month.\n\nHowever, despite being so terrified by the mere concept of a seafaring man with only one leg, I was actually less afraid of the captain himself than anyone else who knew him. There were evenings when he consumed considerably more rum and water than he could handle; during these times, he would sometimes just sit and sing his depraved, old, raucous sea shanties, ignoring everyone. But occasionally, he would order drinks for all present and compel the fearful assembly to listen to his accounts or join in as a chorus to his singing. I often heard the whole building vibrating with the sound of \"Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum,\" with all the local residents joining in out of sheer terror, their fear of death palpable, each one singing louder than the others to avoid drawing his attention. For when he was in these moods, he was the most overbearing companion imaginable; he would bang his hand on the table to demand absolute silence from everyone. He would erupt into a fit of rage if questioned, or sometimes simply because no one asked anything, interpreting this as a sign the company wasn't following his narrative.

From what he said, he must have spent his life among some of the worst men ever to sail, and the way he expressed himself shocked our simple country folks almost as much as the dreadful things he described. My father often worried that the inn would be ruined, since guests would stop coming if they were bullied and scared into their rooms; but in truth, I think his presence actually helped us. People were scared at the time, but looking back, they seemed to enjoy the excitement he brought to our quiet rural lives. Some of the younger men even claimed to respect him, calling him a \"genuine sea-dog\" or a \"real old salt,\" and said it was men like him who made England so powerful at sea.\n\nIn another respect, he was nearly our undoing, for he kept staying week after week, eventually for months, using up all his money and yet my father never had the courage to demand more payment. If he ever brought it up, the captain would make a loud noise through his nose and stare at my father until he had to leave. I've seen my father wring his hands after such an encounter, and I'm sure the stress and fear he endured contributed to his early and unhappy death."

But by this time we had all long ceased to pay any particular notice to the song; it was new, that night, to nobody but Dr. Livesey, and on him I observed it did not produce an agreeable effect, for he looked up for a moment quite angrily before he went on with his talk to old Taylor, the gardener, on a new cure for the rheumatics. In the meantime, the captain gradually brightened up at his own music, and at last flapped his hand upon the table before him in a way we all knew to mean silence. The voices stopped at once, all but Dr. Livesey’s; he went on as before speaking clear and kind and drawing briskly at his pipe between every word or two. The captain glared at him for a while, flapped his hand again, glared still harder, and at last broke out with a villainous, low oath, “Silence, there, between decks!”\n“Were you addressing me, sir?” says the doctor; and when the ruffian had told him, with another oath, that this was so, “I have only one thing to say to you, sir,” replies the doctor, “that if you keep on drinking rum, the world will soon be quit of a very dirty scoundrel!”\nThe old fellow’s fury was awful.

I’m not a doctor only; I’m a magistrate; and if I catch a breath of complaint against you, if it’s only for a piece of incivility like tonight’s, I’ll take effectual means to have you hunted down and routed out of this.

However, by this time, we had all grown so accustomed to the song that we hardly noticed it. It was new only to Dr. Livesey that evening, and I could tell it didn't sit well with him; he briefly looked up in annoyance before continuing his conversation with old Taylor, the gardener, about a new remedy for rheumatism. Meanwhile, the captain visibly cheered up as he sang, eventually slapping his hand on the table in a gesture we all understood meant he wanted quiet. Conversations immediately ceased, except for Dr. Livesey’s. He kept speaking as before, clearly and kindly, pausing only to take a quick puff from his pipe. The captain glared at him for a moment, slammed his hand down again, glared even more intensely, and finally exploded with a vile, low curse, \"Quiet down, you down there!\" \"Were you speaking to me, sir?\" the doctor asked. When the brute confirmed he was, with another curse, the doctor replied, \"Sir, I have only one statement for you: if you persist in drinking rum, the world will soon be rid of a thoroughly unpleasant rascal!\" The old man's rage was terrifying. He jumped up, pulled out and unfolded a sailor's clasp knife, balanced the open blade on his palm, and threatened to pin the doctor to the wall. The doctor didn't even flinch. He spoke to the captain as he had before, looking over his shoulder in the same slightly raised voice so everyone in the room could hear, but remaining perfectly calm and steady: \"If you do not immediately put that knife back in your pocket, I give you my word of honour, you will be hanged at the next court session.\" What followed was a silent staredown, but the captain quickly yielded, put away his weapon, and slumped back into his chair, muttering like a defeated dog. \"And now, sir,\" the doctor went on, \"since I'm now aware there's such a person in my area, you can be sure I will be keeping a constant watch on you. I'm not just a doctor; I'm also a magistrate.

I had always my eye open for seafaring men, with one leg or two, and I remember this one puzzled me. He was not sailorly, and yet he had a smack of the sea about him too.\nI asked him what was for his service, and he said he would take rum; but as I was going out of the room to fetch it, he sat down upon a table and motioned me to draw near. I paused where I was, with my napkin in my hand.\n“Come here, sonny,” says he. “Come nearer here.”\nI took a step nearer.\n“Is this here table for my mate Bill?” he asked with a kind of leer.\nI told him I did not know his mate Bill, and this was for a person who stayed in our house whom we called the captain.\n“Well,” said he, “my mate Bill would be called the captain, as like as not. He has a cut on one cheek and a mighty pleasant way with him, particularly in drink, has my mate Bill. We’ll put it, for argument like, that your captain has a cut on one cheek—and we’ll put it, if you like, that that cheek’s the right one. Ah, well! I told you. Now, is my mate Bill in this here house?”\nI told him he was out walking.\n“Which way, sonny? Which way is he gone?”\nAnd when I had pointed out the rock and told him how the captain was likely to return, and how soon, and answered a few other questions, “Ah,” said he, “this’ll be as good as drink to my mate Bill.”\nThe expression of his face as he said these words was not at all pleasant, and I had my own reasons for thinking that the stranger was mistaken, even supposing he meant what he said. But it was no affair of mine, I thought; and besides, it was difficult to know what to do. The stranger kept hanging about just inside the inn door, peering round the corner like a cat waiting for a mouse. Once I stepped out myself into the road, but he immediately called me back, and as I did not obey quick enough for his fancy, a most horrible change came over his tallowy face, and he ordered me in with an oath that made me jump. As soon as I was back again he returned to his former manner, half fawning, half sneering, patted me on the shoulder, told me I was a good boy and he had taken quite a fancy to me. “I have a son of my own,” said he, “as like you as two blocks, and he’s all the pride of my ’art. But the great thing for boys is discipline, sonny—discipline. Now, if you had sailed along of Bill, you wouldn’t have stood there to be spoke to twice—not you. That was never Bill’s way, nor the way of sich as sailed with him. And here, sure enough, is my mate Bill, with a spy-glass under his arm, bless his old ’art, to be sure. You and me’ll just go back into the parlour, sonny, and get behind the door, and we’ll give Bill a little surprise—bless his ’art, I say again.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "My mother and father were upstairs, and I was in the process of setting the breakfast table, anticipating the captain's return, when the door to the common room opened and a man entered whom I had never encountered before. He appeared ill, with a pale, waxy face, and was missing two fingers from his left hand. Despite wearing a cutlass, he didn't seem particularly formidable. I always paid close attention to sailors, whether they had one leg or two, and this individual puzzled me. He didn't quite fit the mold of a sailor, yet he definitely had a maritime air about him. I asked what I could do for him, and he requested rum. However, as I turned to fetch it, he seated himself on a table and signaled for me to come nearer. I paused, holding the napkin in my hand. 'Come here, sonny,' he instructed. 'Step closer.' I took a step forward. With a rather sly expression, he inquired, 'Is this table being prepared for my companion, Bill?' I explained that I didn't know his companion Bill and that the setting was for a person staying with us whom we called the captain. 'Well,' he responded, 'my companion Bill is quite likely known as the captain. He has a scar on one cheek and is very agreeable, especially after drinking. Let's assume, hypothetically, that your captain has a scar on one cheek—and for the sake of argument, let's say it's on the right cheek. See? I told you. Is my companion Bill in this house right now?' I told him the captain was out walking. 'Which direction, lad? Where did he go?' After I showed him the rock formation, explained how and when the captain was expected back, and answered a few other questions, he remarked, 'Ah, this information will be as satisfying as a drink to my companion Bill.' The look on his face as he said this was far from pleasant, and I had my own reasons to believe the stranger was mistaken, even if he was being truthful. Nevertheless, I thought it was none of my concern, and besides, I was unsure how to proceed. The stranger lingered just inside the inn's entrance, peering around the corner like a cat waiting for a mouse. At one point, I stepped outside onto the road, but he immediately called me back, and when I didn't obey quickly enough for his liking, his waxy face underwent a terrifying change, and he cursed violently, ordering me back inside, which made me jump. As soon as I was back inside, he reverted to his earlier manner, a mix of being overly friendly and mocking. He patted my shoulder, called me a good boy, and claimed to have taken a real liking to me. 'I have a son who looks just like you,' he said, 'identical, and he is the absolute pride of my heart. But the most important thing for boys is discipline, lad—discipline. Now, if you had sailed with Bill, you wouldn't have stood there needing to be told twice—not you. That was never Bill's way, nor the way of the men who sailed with him.' Then, just as expected, he said, 'And here comes my companion Bill, with a spyglass under his arm, bless his old heart. You and I will just go back into the common room, boy, and hide behind the door, and we'll give Bill a little surprise—bless his heart, I say again.'",

Suddenly, the door to the parlor opened and a stranger came in, a man I had never seen before. He looked pale and almost sickly, missing two fingers on his left hand. Despite the cutlass at his side, he didn't really appear to be much of a fighter. I was always on the lookout for sailors, whether they had one leg or two, but this man confused me—he didn’t have the typical look of a sailor, but something about him did remind me of the sea.\n\nI asked what he wanted, and he answered that he’d have some rum. But as I turned to get it for him, he sat down at a table and gestured for me to come closer. I stopped, still holding my napkin.\n\n\"Come here, sonny,\" he said. \"Come a bit nearer.\"\n\nSo I stepped closer.\n\nHe asked if this table was meant for his friend Bill, giving me a strange look. I told him I didn't know anyone named Bill; the table was for someone staying with us whom we called the captain.\n\n\"Well,\" he replied, \"my mate Bill might answer to ‘the captain.’ He has a scar on his cheek and is a fine fellow, especially when he’s drunk. Let’s suppose your captain has a scar—maybe on his right cheek. Now, tell me—is my friend Bill in this house?\"\n\nI said the captain was out walking.\n\n\"Which way did he go, sonny?\" he continued,\n\nI pointed out where the captain had gone, explained when he was likely to come back, and answered more of his questions. The stranger said, \"That’s just as good as giving my mate Bill a drink.\"\n\nThe look on his face when he said that wasn’t pleasant at all, and I had my doubts about his intentions—if he even meant what he said. Still, I thought it was none of my business and truthfully didn’t know what else to do. The stranger hung around just inside the inn’s door, peeking around the corner like a cat watching for a mouse. When I tried to step outside, he called me back right away, and when I didn’t move quickly enough, his face twisted in a frightening way, and he ordered me back inside with a curse that made me jump. Once I was inside, his attitude changed again; he became half-friendly, half-mocking, patted my shoulder, and called me a good boy, saying he’d taken a liking to me. \"I’ve got a boy myself, just like you, and he’s the pride of my heart. Still, what boys need most is discipline—discipline, my boy. If you had sailed with Bill, you wouldn’t wait to be told twice. That’s not Bill’s way, or the way of his crew. And look, there’s my mate Bill now, carrying his spy-glass, bless his heart. Let’s you and I step back into the parlor, sonny, and hide behind the door to surprise Bill—bless his heart, as I said.\""

'Bill,' the stranger said, in a voice I thought he was trying to make sound brave and loud. The captain whirled around on his heel and faced us; all the healthy brown color had vanished from his face, and even his nose was blue; he looked like someone who had seen a ghost, or the devil, or something even worse, if such a thing exists; and truly, I felt bad seeing him suddenly appear so old and ill. 'Come on, Bill, you know me; you surely know an old shipmate, Bill,' the stranger repeated. The captain made a gasping sound. 'Black Dog!' he exclaimed. 'And who else?' the other replied, becoming more comfortable. 'It's the same old Black Dog, who's come to visit his old shipmate Billy at the Admiral Benbow inn. Ah, Bill, Bill, we've been through a lot together, you and I, since I lost these two claws,' he added, holding up his damaged hand. 'Now, listen,' the captain said, 'you've tracked me down; here I am; alright, then, tell me what you want.' 'That's the way, Bill,' Black Dog responded. 'You're absolutely right, Billy. I'll have a glass of rum from this nice child here, who I've taken a liking to; and we'll sit down, if you please, and talk honestly, like old shipmates.' When I came back with the rum, they were already seated across from each other at the captain's breakfast table—Black Dog was next to the door, sitting sideways so he could watch his old shipmate with one eye and, I believed, his escape route with the other.

He appeared shocked, as if he'd seen a ghost or something worse, and I genuinely felt sorry to see him suddenly look so old and ill. The stranger continued, \"Come now, Bill, you recognize me—an old shipmate, don’t you?\" The captain gasped, “Black Dog!” “Indeed,” the other replied, relaxing a bit. “Black Dog, just as always, visiting his old shipmate Billy up at the Admiral Benbow inn. We’ve been through a lot since I lost these two fingers,” he said, showing his injured hand. The captain said, “Now look here, you’ve found me—here I am. So out with it; what do you want?” Black Dog responded, “That’s right, Bill. I’ll have some rum from this fine lad, who I’ve taken a liking to. Then let’s sit down and have a straightforward talk, like old friends.” When I brought the rum, the two men were already seated at the breakfast table—Black Dog sat near the door, sideways, keeping his eyes both on the captain and on his escape.

Just then, my mother, alarmed by the earlier commotion, hurried downstairs to assist me. Together, we lifted the captain's head. His breathing was harsh and labored, his eyes were shut, and his face looked dreadful.\n\n\"Oh dear,\" my mother exclaimed, \"what a shame this is for our house! And with your poor father unwell too!\"\n\nWe had no idea how to help the captain, except to assume he had been fatally injured in the fight with the stranger. I did manage to get the rum and tried to pour it into his mouth, but his teeth were clenched tightly and his jaw was unyielding. We were greatly relieved when Doctor Livesey arrived to visit my father and found us in this predicament."

Never a month but I’ve given you a silver fourpenny for yourself. And now you see, mate, I’m pretty low, and deserted by all; and Jim, you’ll bring me one noggin of rum, now, won’t you, matey?”\n“The doctor—” I began.\nBut he broke in cursing the doctor, in a feeble voice but heartily. “Doctors is all swabs,” he said; “and that doctor there, why, what do he know about seafaring men? I been in places hot as pitch, and mates dropping round with Yellow Jack, and the blessed land a-heaving like the sea with earthquakes—what to the doctor know of lands like that?—and I lived on rum, I tell you. It’s been meat and drink, and man and wife, to me; and if I’m not to have my rum now I’m a poor old hulk on a lee shore, my blood’ll be on you, Jim, and that doctor swab”; and he ran on again for a while with curses. “Look, Jim, how my fingers fidges,” he continued in the pleading tone. “I can’t keep ’em still, not I. I haven’t had a drop this blessed day. That doctor’s a fool, I tell you. If I don’t have a dram o’ rum, Jim, I’ll have the horrors; I seen some on ’em already. I seen old Flint in the corner there, behind you; as plain as print, I seen him; and if I get the horrors, I’m a man that has lived rough, and I’ll raise Cain. Your doctor hisself said one glass wouldn’t hurt me. I’ll give you a golden guinea for a noggin, Jim.”\nHe was growing more and more excited, and this alarmed me for my father, who was very low that day and needed quiet; besides, I was reassured by the doctor’s words, now quoted to me, and rather offended by the offer of a bribe.\n“I want none of your money,” said I, “but what you owe my father. I’ll get you one glass, and no more.”\nWhen I brought it to him, he seized it greedily and drank it out.\n“Aye, aye,” said he, “that’s some better, sure enough. And now, matey, did that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old berth?”\n“A week at least,” said I.\n“Thunder!” he cried. “A week! I can’t do that; they’d have the black spot on me by then. The lubbers is going about to get the wind of me this blessed moment; lubbers as couldn’t keep what they got, and want to nail what is another’s. Is that seamanly behaviour, now, I want to know? But I’m a saving soul. I never wasted good money of mine, nor lost it neither; and I’ll trick ’em again. I’m not afraid on ’em. I’ll shake out another reef, matey, and daddle ’em again.”\nAs he was thus speaking, he had risen from bed with great difficulty, holding to my shoulder with a grip that almost made me cry out, and moving his legs like so much dead weight. His words, spirited as they were in meaning, contrasted sadly with the weakness of the voice in which they were uttered. He paused when he had got into a sitting position on the edge.\n“That doctor’s done me,” he murmured. “My ears is singing. Lay me back.”\nBefore I could do much to help him he had fallen back again to his former place, where he lay for a while silent.\n“Jim,” he said at length, “you saw that seafaring man today?”\n“Black Dog?” I asked.\n“Ah! Black Dog,” says he. “He’s a bad ’un; but there’s worse that put him on. Now, if I can’t get away nohow, and they tip me the black spot, mind you, it’s my old sea-chest they’re after; you get on a horse—you can, can’t you? Well, then, you get on a horse, and go to—well, yes, I will!—to that eternal doctor swab, and tell him to pipe all hands—magistrates and sich—and he’ll lay ’em aboard at the Admiral Benbow—all old Flint’s crew, man and boy, all on ’em that’s left. I was first mate, I was, old Flint’s first mate, and I’m the on’y one as knows the place. He gave it me at Savannah, when he lay a-dying, like as if I was to now, you see. But you won’t peach unless they get the black spot on me, or unless you see that Black Dog again or a seafaring man with one leg, Jim—him above all.”\n“But what is the black spot, captain?” I asked.\n“That’s a summons, mate. I’ll tell you if they get that. But you keep your weather-eye open, Jim, and I’ll share with you equals, upon my honour.”\nHe wandered a little longer, his voice growing weaker; but soon after I had given him his medicine, which he took like a child, with the remark, “If ever a seaman wanted drugs, it’s me,” he fell at last into a heavy, swoon-like sleep, in which I left him.",

He was lying still in much the same position as when we had left him, only propped up a little higher, and he appeared both feeble yet agitated. 'Jim,' he said, 'you are the only one here who is reliable, and you know I have always treated you well. Every month, without fail, I've given you a silver fourpenny coin for yourself. And now you see, friend, I am quite ill, and everyone has abandoned me; and Jim, you will bring me one noggin of rum now, won’t you, matey?' 'The doctor—' I began. But he interrupted with curses aimed at the doctor, spoken in a weak voice but with genuine feeling. 'Doctors are all incompetent,' he declared; 'and that doctor there, what does he understand about sailors? I have been in places as hot as hell, with shipmates dying from yellow fever all around, and the very land shaking violently like the sea with earthquakes—what does a doctor know of lands like that?—and I survived on rum, I tell you. It has been my sustenance and companionship; and if I am not to have my rum now that I am a helpless wreck stranded near the shore, you and that doctor will be responsible for my death, Jim,' and he continued ranting with curses for a while. 'Look, Jim, how my fingers are trembling,' he went on in a pleading tone. 'I cannot hold them steady, not I. I haven't had a single drop the entire day. That doctor is a fool, I tell you. If I don't get a dram of rum, Jim, I will suffer from the horrors; I have already seen some of them. I saw old Flint in the corner there, behind you; I saw him as clearly as print; and if I get the horrors, I am a man who has led a hard life, and I will cause trouble. Your doctor himself said one glass wouldn't harm me. I will give you a golden guinea for a noggin, Jim.' He was becoming increasingly excited, and this worried me for my father, who was very weak that day and needed quiet; furthermore, I was reassured by the doctor's words, which had just been quoted to me, and felt somewhat insulted by his attempt to bribe me. 'I don't want any of your money,' I said, 'but only what you owe my father. I will get you one glass, and no more.' When I brought it to him, he grabbed it eagerly and finished it. 'Yes, yes,' he said, 'that is definitely feeling a bit better, sure enough. And now, matey, did that doctor say how long I was supposed to lie here in this old bed?' 'A week at least,' I replied. 'Blast!' he cried. 'A week! I cannot do that; they would give me the black spot by then. The rascals are trying to get the better of me this very moment; incompetent landlubbers who couldn't hold onto their own and now want to steal what belongs to someone else. Is that how sailors ought to behave, I want to know? But I am a thrifty person. I never spent my money foolishly, nor lost it either; and I will outsmart them again. I am not afraid of them. I will make another effort, matey, and fool them again.' As he was talking like this, he had managed to get out of bed with great effort, leaning on my shoulder with a grip so tight it nearly made me shout, and dragging his legs as if they were lifeless. Though his words were full of spirit, they stood in stark contrast to his weak voice in which they were spoken. He stopped when he had managed to sit up on the side. 'That doctor finished me off,' he murmured. 'My ears are ringing. Help me lie down.' Before I could assist him properly, he had collapsed back into his original position, where he remained silent for some time. 'Jim,' he said eventually, 'you saw that sailor today?' 'Black Dog?' I asked. 'Yes! Black Dog,' he said. 'He's a bad one; but there are worse people who are directing him. Now, if I cannot escape somehow, and they give me the black spot, remember, it is my old sea-chest they want; you get on a horse—you know how, right? Well, then, you get on a horse, and go to—yes, that's right!—to that damned incompetent doctor, and tell him to summon everyone—magistrates and the like—and he'll bring them to the Admiral Benbow—everyone left from old Flint's crew, young and old. I was the first mate, I was, old Flint's first mate, and I am the only one who knows where it is. He told me where it was in Savannah, when he was dying, just like I am now, you see. But you won't tell unless they give me the black spot, or unless you encounter that Black Dog again or a one-legged sailor, Jim—him especially.' 'But what is the black spot, captain?' I asked. 'That is a formal demand, mate. I will tell you if they give me that. But you stay alert, Jim, and I will divide everything equally with you, I promise.' He continued rambling for a bit longer, his voice becoming fainter; but shortly after I had administered his medicine, which he swallowed obediently like a child, commenting, 'If anyone ever needed medicine, it's a sailor like me,' he finally sank into a deep, unconscious-like sleep, in which state I left him.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Around midday, I brought the captain some refreshing drinks and medicine. He was lying much as before, only propped up a bit higher, and seemed both frail and agitated.\n\n\"Jim,\" he said, \"you're the only one here who's any good, and you know I've always treated you well. Every month I gave you a silver coin for yourself. Now you see how down I am, abandoned by everyone. Jim, will you fetch me a little rum, won't you, mate?\"\n\n\"The doctor—\" I started, but he interrupted me weakly but angrily, cursing the doctor. \"Doctors are all fools,\" he insisted. \"What does that doctor know about sailors? I've been in burning hot places, seen mates dying of Yellow Jack, and the earth shaking like the sea with earthquakes—what does the doctor know of places like that? I've survived on rum; it's been everything to me. If I can't have my rum now, and I'm left here like a wreck, my death will be on you and that doctor.\" He kept muttering angrily. \"Look at my fingers shake, Jim,\" he pleaded. \"I can't keep them still. I haven't had any rum today. The doctor doesn't understand; if I don't get some, I'll start hallucinating—I already have. I saw old Flint back there in the corner, clear as day. If I get the horrors, I'll go mad. Even your doctor said one glass wouldn't hurt. I'll give you a gold coin for just one drink, Jim.\"\n\nHe got more agitated, which worried me because my father was also very sick and needed rest. Plus, the doctor's advice reassured me, and I felt offended by the bribe.\n\n\"I don't want your money, only what you owe my father. I'll bring you one glass, but that's all,\" I replied.\n\nWhen I brought it, he grabbed it eagerly and drank it all at once.\n\n\"Ah, that's better,\" he said. \"Now, did the doctor say how long I'm to stay in this bed?\"\n\n\"At least a week,\" I answered.\n\n\"A week!\" he exclaimed. \"I can't manage that. By then, they'll give me the black spot. They're after me right now—shouldn't a real sailor know better? But I've always looked after my money, never lost it, and I'll fool them again. I'm not afraid. I'll deal with them yet.\"\n\nWhile saying this, he struggled up from bed, leaning heavily on my shoulder, his legs almost lifeless. His words were spirited, but his voice was feeble. He stopped when he sat at the edge.\n\n\"That doctor got the best of me,\" he muttered. \"My ears are ringing. Lay me back.\"\n\nBefore I could help him much, he fell back onto the bed and lay silent for a while.\n\n\"Jim,\" he finally said, \"did you see that sailor today?\"\n\n\"Black Dog?\" I replied.\n\n\"Yes, Black Dog,\" he confirmed. \"He's a bad sort, but worse men sent him. If I can't escape and they mark me for death, remember—the sea chest is what they're after. If that happens, get on a horse and go straight to—yes, even to that cursed doctor. Tell him to gather everyone—magistrates and all—and they'll catch the lot at the Admiral Benbow—every last man left of old Flint's crew. I was Flint's first mate and the only one who knows the spot. Flint told me in Savannah when he was dying, just like I am now. But don't tell, unless they give me the black spot, or unless you see Black Dog again—or a sailor with one leg, Jim—especially him.\"\n\n\"What's the black spot, captain?\" I asked.\n\n\"It's a warning,\" he explained. \"If I get it, I'll explain. But you stay alert, Jim, and I'll split it with you—my word.\"\n\nHe talked a bit more, fading in strength, and soon after I got him his medicine, which he took like a child, saying, \"If ever a sailor needed drugs, it's me.\" After that, he fell into a deep, heavy sleep, and that's how I left him."

But as things fell out, my poor father died quite suddenly that evening, which put all other matters on one side.

I have said the captain was weak, and indeed he seemed rather to grow weaker than regain his strength. He clambered up and down stairs, and went from the parlour to the bar and back again, and sometimes put his nose out of doors to smell the sea, holding on to the walls as he went for support and breathing hard and fast like a man on a steep mountain. He never particularly addressed me, and it is my belief he had as good as forgotten his confidences; but his temper was more flighty, and allowing for his bodily weakness, more violent than ever. He had an alarming way now when he was drunk of drawing his cutlass and laying it bare before him on the table. But with all that, he minded people less and seemed shut up in his own thoughts and rather wandering.

He rarely spoke directly to me, and I believe he had mostly forgotten his previous confessions. However, his mood became more erratic, and considering his physical feebleness, he was more violent than ever before. When drunk, he now had an alarming habit of unsheathing his cutlass and placing it naked on the table in front of him. Yet, despite all this, he paid less attention to others and seemed withdrawn in his own thoughts, somewhat disconnected. For example, to our immense surprise on one occasion, he started singing a completely different tune – a kind of rural love song he must have known from his youth before he began life at sea.",

The more we told of our troubles, the more—man, woman, and child—they clung to the shelter of their houses.

Yet, there was no unusual noise detected—only the gentle sound of the waves washing ashore and the calls of the wildlife in the forest. Darkness had fallen, requiring candles for light, by the time we arrived at the village. I will never forget how much seeing the warm, yellow light spilling from the doorways and windows lifted my spirits. However, as it turned out, that initial feeling of relief was the most helpful thing we were likely to experience from the villagers. Despite what you might think, expecting people to be ashamed of their inaction, not a single person agreed to come back with us to the Admiral Benbow. The more we explained our troubles, the more everyone—men, women, and children alike—clung tightly to the safety of their homes. The name of Captain Flint, which was new to me, was familiar enough to some there and carried a significant power to terrify. Some of the men who had been working in the fields further past the Admiral Benbow also recalled encountering several strangers on the road; they had assumed they were smugglers and had hastily fled. At least one person had even spotted a small boat, a lugger, in the place we called Kitt’s Hole. Indeed, simply being associated with the captain was enough to scare them profoundly.

No matter how much we explained our predicament, everyone—men, women, and children—only clung tighter to the safety of their homes.

A few men who had been working in fields past the inn recalled seeing some unfamiliar people on the road and, thinking they were smugglers, had quickly fled the scene.

But the pause was brief, for the blind man again issued his commands. His voice sounded louder and higher, as if he were afire with eagerness and rage.\n“In, in, in!” he shouted, and cursed them for their delay.\nFour or five of them obeyed at once, two remaining on the road with the formidable beggar. There was a pause, then a cry of surprise, and then a voice shouting from the house, “Bill’s dead.”\nBut the blind man swore at them again for their delay.\n“Search him, some of you shirking lubbers, and the rest of you aloft and get the chest,” he cried.\nI could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs, so that the house must have shook with it. Promptly afterwards, fresh sounds of astonishment arose; the window of the captain’s room was thrown open with a slam and a jingle of broken glass, and a man leaned out into the moonlight, head and shoulders, and addressed the blind beggar on the road below him.\n“Pew,” he cried, “they’ve been before us. Someone’s turned the chest out alow and aloft.”",

I couldn't stay hidden where I was, but crept back to the embankment again. There, hiding my head behind a bush of broom, I could get a clear view of the road in front of our door. I had barely settled into my hiding spot before my adversaries started showing up, about seven or eight of them running hard, their footsteps uneven on the road, with the man carrying a lantern several steps ahead. Three men ran together, holding hands, and I could make out, even through the fog, that the one in the middle of this group was the blind beggar. The sound of his voice moments later showed me I was right. \"Knock the door down!\" he cried. \"Aye, aye, sir!\" answered two or three, and they rushed upon the Admiral Benbow, the lantern-bearer following. Then I saw them pause and heard them speaking in a quieter tone, as if they were surprised to find the door open. But the pause was short, as the blind man issued his commands again. His voice sounded louder and higher, as if he were burning with eagerness and rage. \"In, in, in!\" he shouted, and cursed them for their delay. Four or five of them obeyed immediately, while two remained on the road with the formidable beggar. There was a moment's silence, then a cry of surprise, and then a voice shouting from inside the house, \"Bill's dead.\" But the blind man swore at them again for their delay. \"Some of you lazy idlers, search him,\" he cried, \"and the rest of you go upstairs and get the chest.\" I could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs, so the house must have shaken from it. Quickly afterwards, fresh sounds of astonishment arose; the window of the captain's room was violently thrown open with a slam and a jingle of broken glass, and a man leaned out into the moonlight, head and shoulders visible, and spoke to the blind beggar on the road below him. \"Pew,\" he cried, \"someone got here before us.

I had just settled into my hiding spot when my pursuers appeared—seven or eight men running, their footsteps loud and out of sync, with one carrying a lantern a few steps ahead. Three of them were holding hands as they ran, and even through the mist, I could tell that the man in the middle was the blind beggar. He soon confirmed it by shouting, \"Down with the door!\" A couple replied, \"Aye, aye, sir!\" and they rushed toward the Admiral Benbow inn, following the lantern bearer. There was a brief pause and I heard them talking more quietly, probably surprised to find the door open, but the blind man quickly urged them on, shouting more loudly and angrily, \"In, in, in!\" and cursing their slowness. Four or five men obeyed him, while two stayed outside with the blind beggar. After another short pause, someone inside shouted in surprise and then yelled, \"Bill's dead!\" The blind man angrily ordered them to search the body and for the rest to go upstairs and get the chest. I could hear them thundering up the stairs, shaking the old house. Suddenly, there were more sounds of shock, a window in the captain's room was thrown open, glass breaking, and a man leaned out into the moonlight to call to the blind beggar below: \"Pew,\" he yelled, \"we've been beaten to it.

He hailed her. A voice replied, telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get some lead in him, and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his arm. Soon after, the lugger doubled the point and disappeared. Mr. Dance stood there, as he said, “like a fish out of water,” and all he could do was to dispatch a man to B—— to warn the cutter. “And that,” said he, “is just about as good as nothing. They’ve got off clean, and there’s an end. Only,” he added, “I’m glad I trod on Master Pew’s corns,” for by this time he had heard my story.",

One, lagging slightly, was a boy from our village who had been sent to Dr. Livesey's house. The rest were customs officers he had encountered on the road, and intelligently, he had decided to return with them immediately. News of the smuggling ship in Kitt's Hole had reached Supervisor Dance, prompting him to ride out in our direction that very night. It was due to this timely arrival that my mother and I were saved from death. Pew was indeed dead, utterly lifeless. As for my mother, after we helped her back to the hamlet, a little cold water and smelling salts quickly revived her, and she suffered no lasting harm from her fear, although she continued to mourn the loss of the remaining money. Meanwhile, the supervisor rode on to Kitt's Hole as fast as possible, but his men had to dismount and carefully navigate down the steep valley, leading and sometimes supporting their horses, constantly fearful of ambushes. Consequently, it was not surprising that by the time they reached the cove, the lugger was already moving away from the shore, though still nearby. Dance hailed the ship. A voice from it warned him to stay out of the moonlight unless he wanted to be shot, and at the same moment, a bullet whizzed close to his arm. Soon after, the ship rounded the point and disappeared. Mr. Dance stood there, feeling, as he described it, completely out of his element. His only option was to send a man to B—— to warn the cutter. \"And that,\" he remarked, \"is practically useless. They've escaped completely, and that's the end of it.\" \"However,\" he added, \"I'm glad I ran over Master Pew,\" having by then heard my account of events.",

One, who was behind the others, was a boy who had gone to see Dr. Livesey from our village. The rest were revenue officers that he had met on his way, and, sensibly, he had come back with them at once. Some word about the smuggler boat in Kitt’s Hole had reached Supervisor Dance and sent him our way that night, and thanks to that, my mother and I were saved from death.\n\nPew was dead—completely dead. As for my mother, after we brought her back to the hamlet, a little cold water and smelling salts soon revived her, and she wasn’t harmed by her fright, although she still worried about the missing money. Meanwhile, Supervisor Dance hurried to Kitt’s Hole, but his men had to get off their horses and carefully lead them down the ravine, afraid of an ambush. Therefore, it wasn’t very surprising that when they finally reached the Hole, the smuggler boat was already heading out to sea, though still nearby. He called out to the boat. Someone shouted back, warning him to stay out of the moonlight or get shot, and a bullet immediately flew past his arm. Soon after, the boat rounded the point and vanished. Mr. Dance said he felt helpless, and all he could do was send a man to B—— to alert the coast guard, though he said that was likely useless—they had escaped completely. But he was glad, he said, to have dealt with Pew, as by then he had heard my account of what had happened."

The doctor examined it thoroughly, as if eager to open it, but instead, he calmly placed it in his coat pocket. \"Squire,\" he said, \"Once Dance has his ale, he must, of course, depart to fulfill his duty for the King; however, I intend to keep Jim Hawkins here to sleep at my residence, and with your consent, I suggest we serve the cold pie and let him eat.\" \"As you wish, Livesey,\" the squire responded; \"Hawkins has earned more than just cold pie.\" Consequently, a large pigeon pie was brought in and set on a side table, and I ate a substantial meal, feeling extremely hungry, while Mr. Dance received additional compliments before finally being sent on his way.",

He was the bloodthirstiest buccaneer that sailed. Blackbeard was a child to Flint. The Spaniards were so prodigiously afraid of him that, I tell you, sir, I was sometimes proud he was an Englishman.

The squire exclaimed, astonished at the question, stating that Flint was the most brutal pirate to ever sail, making Blackbeard seem insignificant in comparison. He added that the Spaniards were so terrified of Flint that he, the squire, sometimes felt proud Flint was English. The squire recalled seeing Flint's ship's upper sails off Trinidad with his own eyes and his cowardly captain turning back into Port of Spain. Dr. Livesey mentioned that he had also heard of Flint, even in England, but the real question was whether Flint had accumulated significant wealth. The squire reacted strongly, asking if the doctor had heard the tales, emphasizing that pirates cared for nothing but money and risked their lives solely for riches. Dr. Livesey responded that they would soon find out but noted how the squire's excitability made it hard to speak. He clarified his point: if he had a clue in his pocket to Flint's buried treasure, would that treasure be substantial? The squire enthusiastically declared that if they had such a clue, he would fund and equip a ship in Bristol harbor, take both the doctor and young Hawkins along, and search until the treasure was found, even if it took a year. \"Very well,\" the doctor agreed, adding that provided Jim was willing, they would open the package, which he then placed on the table before him.",

The Spaniards were so terrified of him that, to be honest, I sometimes felt proud he was an Englishman. I’ve actually seen his sails near Trinidad, and the cowardly fellow I sailed with turned our ship around back to Port of Spain.” \n\n“I’ve heard stories about him in England, too,” the doctor responded. “But what matters is, did he have money?”\n\n“Money!” shouted the squire. “Haven’t you heard the tale? All those scoundrels wanted was money! It’s all they cared about. Why else would they risk their worthless lives?”\n\n“We’ll soon see,” said the doctor. “But you’re so excitable, I can hardly say a word! What I want to know is this: If I have, let’s say, a clue to Flint’s treasure in my pocket, is that treasure likely to be valuable?”\n\n“Valuable!” cried the squire. “If we have that clue, I’ll outfit a ship at Bristol, and take you and Hawkins along, and I’ll find that treasure if it takes me an entire year.” \n\n“All right then,” said the doctor. “If Jim agrees, let’s open the packet.” He placed it on the table in front of him."

On the first page there were only some scraps of writing, such as a man with a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice. One was the same as the tattoo mark, “Billy Bones his fancy”; then there was “Mr. W. Bones, mate,” “No more rum,” “Off Palm Key he got itt,” and some other snatches, mostly single words and unintelligible. I could not help wondering who it was that had “got itt,” and what “itt” was that he got. A knife in his back as like as not.\n“Not much instruction there,” said Dr. Livesey as he passed on.\nThe next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious series of entries. There was a date at one end of the line and at the other a sum of money, as in common account-books, but instead of explanatory writing, only a varying number of crosses between the two. On the 12th of June, 1745, for instance, a sum of seventy pounds had plainly become due to someone, and there was nothing but six crosses to explain the cause. In a few cases, to be sure, the name of a place would be added, as “Offe Caraccas,” or a mere entry of latitude and longitude, as “62° 17′ 20″, 19° 2′ 40″.”\nThe record lasted over nearly twenty years, the amount of the separate entries growing larger as time went on, and at the end a grand total had been made out after five or six wrong additions, and these words appended, “Bones, his pile.”\n“I can’t make head or tail of this,” said Dr. Livesey.\n“The thing is as clear as noonday,” cried the squire. “This is the black-hearted hound’s account-book. These crosses stand for the names of ships or towns that they sank or plundered. The sums are the scoundrel’s share, and where he feared an ambiguity, you see he added something clearer. ‘Offe Caraccas,’ now; you see, here was some unhappy vessel boarded off that coast. God help the poor souls that manned her—coral long ago.”\n“Right!” said the doctor. “See what it is to be a traveller. Right! And the amounts increase, you see, as he rose in rank.”",

The squire and I leaned over his shoulder as he opened it; Dr. Livesey had kindly gestured for me to move closer from the side-table where I'd been eating, so I could join in the excitement of the discovery. The initial page just had random bits of writing, like someone holding a pen might scribble out of boredom or for practice. One note matched the tattoo, \"Billy Bones his fancy\"; others included \"Mr. W. Bones, mate,\" \"No more rum,\" \"Off Palm Key he got itt,\" and various other short, unclear phrases. I couldn't help but wonder who received \"itt\" and what \"itt\" was – perhaps a stab in the back. Dr. Livesey noted that this page didn't offer much insight and moved on. The following ten or twelve pages were filled with peculiar entries. Each line featured a date on one side and a monetary amount on the other, similar to a standard account book. However, instead of explanations, there were just differing numbers of crosses between the date and sum. For example, an entry dated June 12, 1745, showed a sum of seventy pounds apparently owed, with only six crosses providing context. In a few instances, a location was added, like \"Offe Caraccas,\" or just coordinates, such as \"62° 17′ 20″, 19° 2′ 40″.\" This record covered nearly two decades, with the amounts in the individual entries increasing over time. At the end, a grand total had been calculated after several incorrect sums, with the words \"Bones, his pile\" added. Dr. Livesey stated he couldn't make sense of it. The squire exclaimed that its meaning was perfectly clear: it was the account book of the vile scoundrel. He interpreted the crosses as representing the names of ships or towns they had sunk or robbed. The sums were the villain's share, and where he feared misunderstanding, he added clearer notes, such as \"Offe Caraccas,\" indicating an unfortunate ship boarded near that coast. The squire pitied the poor souls who crewed it, long since at the bottom of the sea. The doctor agreed, saying, \"Right!\" He acknowledged the value of the squire's experience as a traveler and confirmed that the increasing amounts likely reflected Bones's rise in rank.",

For example, on June 12, 1745, there was a note of seventy pounds owed to someone, but only six crosses shown as explanation. Sometimes a location would be added, such as ‘Offe Caraccas,’ or just latitude and longitude, like ‘62° 17′ 20″, 19° 2′ 40″.’ These records went on for about twenty years, with the sums growing bigger, and at the end a final tally was written after a few errors in adding, along with the words, ‘Bones, his pile.’ “I can’t make sense of this,” Dr. Livesey said. “It’s perfectly clear!” exclaimed the squire. “This is the villain’s account book. The crosses stand for the names of ships or towns they attacked or plundered. The sums are his share, and if something might be unclear, he added a note. Like ‘Offe Caraccas’—that must be a ship raided off that coast. The poor crew are likely long gone.” “Exactly!” the doctor agreed. “That’s what experience brings.

There’s only one man I’m afraid of.”\n“And who’s that?” cried the squire. “Name the dog, sir!”\n“You,” replied the doctor; “for you cannot hold your tongue.

He declared he would depart for Bristol the next day, fully intending to procure the best ship and the most capable crew in all of England very quickly—in three weeks, he first said, then amended it to two weeks, and finally to just ten days. He announced that Hawkins would serve as the cabin boy, predicting he would be excellent at it. Livesey was assigned the role of ship's doctor, while he, the squire, would be the admiral. They would enlist Redruth, Joyce, and Hunter. The squire optimistically expected favorable winds, a rapid voyage, no difficulty whatsoever in locating the spot, and boundless riches thereafter—enough money to feast upon, wallow in, and freely squander forever. In response, the doctor stated he would join the expedition and guaranteed that Jim would as well, proving to be a valuable asset to their endeavor. However, he confessed to being afraid of only one individual. The squire exclaimed, demanding to know who this person was, telling him to name the 'dog'. The doctor replied, 'You,' elaborating that his fear stemmed from the squire's inability to keep a secret. He stressed that they weren't the sole people aware of the document. The men who assaulted the inn that evening, whom he characterized as unquestionably brave and reckless individuals, along with the others who stayed aboard the lugger, and likely more not far off, were, without exception and through any hardship, resolved to obtain that money. Therefore, none of them should venture out alone until they reached the safety of the sea. In the meantime, Jim and the doctor would stick together, and the squire should take Joyce and Hunter with him when he rode to Bristol. Most importantly, not a single one of them should utter a word about their discovery from the very beginning until the end. The squire conceded, acknowledging that Livesey was, as always, right, and vowed to maintain absolute silence on the matter.",

In just three weeks—no, two weeks—or even ten days—we’ll have the finest ship and best crew in all of England. Hawkins will accompany us as the cabin-boy—Hawkins, you’ll make an excellent one. Livesey, you’ll be our ship’s doctor; as for me, I’m the admiral. Redruth, Joyce, and Hunter will come along too. We’ll have good winds, a swift journey, no trouble at all finding the treasure, and more money than we can possibly spend.\"\n\n\"Trelawney,\" replied the doctor, \"I’ll join you, and I guarantee Jim will too; we’ll do ourselves proud. But there’s only one man I’m concerned about.\"\n\n\"Who’s that?\" the squire demanded. \"Tell me who!\"\n\n\"You,\" answered the doctor, \"because you can’t keep things secret. We aren’t the only ones who know about this treasure. The men who attacked the inn tonight—tough, daring men—and those who stayed on their ship, perhaps even more people nearby, are all determined to get that money. None of us should go anywhere alone until we set sail. Jim and I will stay together; when you go to Bristol, be sure to take Joyce and Hunter. And above all, we mustn’t tell a soul about what we’ve discovered.\"\n\n\"You’re quite right, Livesey,\" the squire agreed. \"I’ll keep completely silent.\""

          "text_segment": "Old Anchor Inn, Bristol, March 1, 17—.\nDear Livesey—As I do not know whether you are at the hall or still in London, I send this in double to both places.\nThe ship is bought and fitted. She lies at anchor, ready for sea. You never imagined a sweeter schooner—a child might sail her—two hundred tons; name, Hispaniola.\nI got her through my old friend, Blandly, who has proved himself throughout the most surprising trump. The admirable fellow literally slaved in my interest, and so, I may say, did everyone in Bristol, as soon as they got wind of the port we sailed for—treasure, I mean.\n“Redruth,” said I, interrupting the letter, “Dr. Livesey will not like that. The squire has been talking, after all.”\n“Well, who’s a better right?” growled the gamekeeper. “A pretty rum go if squire ain’t to talk for Dr. Livesey, I should think.”\nAt that I gave up all attempts at commentary and read straight on:\nBlandly himself found the Hispaniola, and by the most admirable management got her for the merest trifle. There is a class of men in Bristol monstrously prejudiced against Blandly. They go the length of declaring that this honest creature would do anything for money, that the Hispaniola belonged to him, and that he sold it me absurdly high—the most transparent calumnies. None of them dare, however, to deny the merits of the ship.\nSo far there was not a hitch. The workpeople, to be sure—riggers and what not—were most annoyingly slow; but time cured that. It was the crew that troubled me.\nI wished a round score of men—in case of natives, buccaneers, or the odious French—and I had the worry of the deuce itself to find so much as half a dozen, till the most remarkable stroke of fortune brought me the very man that I required.\nI was standing on the dock, when, by the merest accident, I fell in talk with him. I found he was an old sailor, kept a public-house, knew all the seafaring men in Bristol, had lost his health ashore, and wanted a good berth as cook to get to sea again. He had hobbled down there that morning, he said, to get a smell of the salt.\nI was monstrously touched—so would you have been—and, out of pure pity, I engaged him on the spot to be ship’s cook. Long John Silver, he is called, and has lost a leg; but that I regarded as a recommendation, since he lost it in his country’s service, under the immortal Hawke. He has no pension, Livesey. Imagine the abominable age we live in!\nWell, sir, I thought I had only found a cook, but it was a crew I had discovered. Between Silver and myself we got together in a few days a company of the toughest old salts imaginable—not pretty to look at, but fellows, by their faces, of the most indomitable spirit. I declare we could fight a frigate.\nLong John even got rid of two out of the six or seven I had already engaged. He showed me in a moment that they were just the sort of fresh-water swabs we had to fear in an adventure of importance.\nI am in the most magnificent health and spirits, eating like a bull, sleeping like a tree, yet I shall not enjoy a moment till I hear my old tarpaulins tramping round the capstan.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Bristol, March 1, 17—. To dear Livesey—Uncertain whether you are at home or still in London, I am sending identical letters to both addresses. We have bought and prepared the ship. She is moored, ready to depart. You couldn't imagine a more magnificent schooner—she's so easy to sail a child could manage her—she displaces two hundred tons and is called the Hispaniola. My old acquaintance, Blandly, facilitated the purchase; he has truly been exceptionally helpful throughout. This fine fellow dedicated himself to my interests, and honestly, the entire population of Bristol seemed to do the same once they heard our destination—by which I mean treasure. I interrupted the letter, saying, 'Redruth, Dr. Livesey won't appreciate that disclosure. The squire has mentioned it, after all.' The gamekeeper grumbled, 'Well, why shouldn't he? It would be strange indeed if the squire wasn't allowed to speak for Dr. Livesey.' Following that, I stopped trying to offer comments and continued reading. Blandly himself located the Hispaniola and, with truly remarkable skill, acquired her for next to nothing. There is a segment of people in Bristol who are extremely prejudiced against Blandly. They go as far as claiming this decent man would do anything for money, that the Hispaniola actually belonged to him, and that he sold it to me at an ridiculously high price—these are clearly false rumors. However, none of them can deny the ship's quality. So far, everything has gone smoothly. The workers, specifically the riggers and such, were admittedly very slow, but that problem resolved itself with time. It was finding the crew that worried me. I wanted approximately twenty men—in case of encounters with natives, pirates, or the despised French—and I had immense difficulty finding even half a dozen, until an extraordinary piece of luck led me directly to the person I needed. I was standing on the docks when, purely by chance, I started a conversation with him. I discovered he was a former sailor, ran a pub, was familiar with all the seafaring folk in Bristol, had lost his health on land, and desired a good position as cook to get back to sea. He mentioned he had limped down there that morning simply to get a whiff of the ocean air. I was deeply moved—as you would have been—and, out of sheer sympathy, I hired him on the spot to be the ship's cook. He is known as Long John Silver and has lost a leg; however, I saw this as a positive sign, as he lost it serving his country under the legendary Hawke. He receives no pension, Livesey. Can you believe the terrible era we live in! Well, sir, I initially thought I had only found a cook, but in fact, I had found a whole crew. Between Silver and myself, we quickly assembled a company of the toughest, most experienced sailors imaginable—not pleasant to look at, but men whose appearances suggested immense courage. I swear we could challenge a warship. Long John even managed to get rid of two of the six or seven men I had previously hired. He instantly showed me that they were precisely the kind of inexperienced landlubbers we needed to avoid on an important expedition. I am in excellent health and spirits, eating heartily and sleeping soundly, yet I won't feel truly content until I hear my sturdy old seamen marching around the capstan.",

The ship is now purchased and fully equipped—she's anchored and prepared for our voyage. You wouldn’t believe what a lovely schooner she is; she handles so easily that even a child could steer her. She's 200 tons and goes by the name Hispaniola.\n\nI acquired her thanks to my old friend Blandly, who has been immensely helpful—he worked tirelessly in my interest, and really, everyone in Bristol helped once they learned we’re sailing off in search of treasure.\n\n“Redruth,” I said, pausing the letter, “Dr. Livesey won’t like that—the squire’s been talking after all.”\n“Well, why shouldn’t he?” replied the gamekeeper. “It would be odd if the squire couldn’t speak for Dr. Livesey.”\n\nAfter that, I continued reading:\n\nIt was Blandly who found the Hispaniola, and he managed to get her for me at a bargain price. Some people in Bristol have a grudge against Blandly and claim he’s only in it for money, that he owned the ship, and that he charged me too much. These accusations are completely unfounded, though nobody denies the quality of the vessel.\n\nUp until this point, all went smoothly, except the workers—riggers and others—were frustratingly slow, but that soon resolved. My main problem was finding a crew.\n\nI wanted about twenty men to guard against threats like natives, pirates, or even the French, yet I had great difficulty finding even half a dozen, until a stroke of luck brought me just the man I needed.\n\nStanding on the docks by chance, I struck up a conversation with an old sailor who ran a tavern, knew all the local seamen, had poor health, and was looking for a job at sea as a cook. He’d come down to smell the sea air that morning, he said. I was deeply moved, and I'm sure you would have been too, so I hired him immediately as our ship’s cook. His name is Long John Silver; he’s lost a leg—a fact I consider a plus, as he lost it serving our country with Admiral Hawke. He gets no pension, Livesey—can you imagine such injustice?\n\nAt first, I thought I’d only hired a cook, but I quickly realised I’d found someone who could assemble a crew. Within days, Silver and I gathered the toughest, most determined sailors—perhaps not the most handsome, but clearly capable fighters. In fact, I’m sure we could hold our own against a warship. Silver even dismissed two of the original men I’d hired, showing me immediately they weren’t up to the task.\n\nMy health and spirits are excellent—I’m eating and sleeping well—yet I won’t relax until I hear those old sailors of mine stamping around the capstan."

Long John Silver unearthed a very competent man for a mate, a man named Arrow. I have a boatswain who pipes, Livesey; so things shall go man-o’-war fashion on board the good ship Hispaniola.\nI forgot to tell you that Silver is a man of substance; I know of my own knowledge that he has a banker’s account, which has never been overdrawn. He leaves his wife to manage the inn; and as she is a woman of colour, a pair of old bachelors like you and I may be excused for guessing that it is the wife, quite as much as the health, that sends him back to roving.\nP.P.S.—Hawkins may stay one night with his mother.\nYou can fancy the excitement into which that letter put me.

Addendum: I failed to mention that Blandly, who is supposed to dispatch a rescue vessel if we don't return by the close of August, has found an excellent individual to be our sailing master—he's a bit rigid, which I regret, but in all other ways, he's superb. Long John Silver found a very capable first mate named Arrow. We even have a boatswain, Livesey, so operations on the good ship Hispaniola will be conducted in a military manner. I also neglected to mention that Silver is a person of means; I know firsthand that he possesses a bank account that has never been depleted. He has entrusted his wife, a woman of color, with managing the inn; being two old bachelors like us, we might speculate that it's his wife, just as much as his health, that motivates his return to a life of adventure. Further Addendum: Hawkins is permitted to stay one night with his mother. You can imagine how thrilling I found that letter. I was practically ecstatic with joy, and if there was anyone I ever looked down upon, it was old Tom Redruth, whose only reaction was to whine and complain. Any of the younger gamekeepers would have gladly swapped places with him, but that wasn't the squire's wish, and among them, the squire's wishes were treated as law. Nobody but old Redruth would have even dared to voice a complaint.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Look to the sea! Forget about the treasure—it's the allure of the ocean that's captured me. So, Livesey, hurry and don't waste a moment if you value me. Let young Hawkins go visit his mother right away, with Redruth accompanying him for protection, and then both should come to Bristol as quickly as possible. —John Trelawney\n\nP.S.—I forgot to mention, Blandly—who will send a second ship if we don’t return by August—has found an excellent sailing master. He’s a rather stern man, which I regret, but otherwise he’s outstanding. Long John Silver has recruited a very able mate, a man named Arrow. Also, I have a boatswain who can pipe, Livesey, so the Hispaniola will be run with real naval discipline.\n\nAlso, Silver owns property; I know for a fact he has a healthy bank account. His wife is staying behind to manage their inn, and since she’s a woman of color, you and I—being old bachelors—might suspect that it’s as much his wife as his health that encourages him to go to sea again.\n\nP.P.S.—Hawkins can stay one night with his mother.\n\nYou can imagine how excited I was by this letter. I was nearly overwhelmed with happiness, and if I ever looked down on anyone, it was old Tom Redruth, who did nothing but grumble and complain. Any of the junior gamekeepers would have been happy to swap places with him, but that wasn’t the squire’s wish. The squire’s decisions were absolute among us all. Nobody but Redruth would have even dared to complain."

          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "As I waited, a man emerged from a nearby room, and at a glance, I was sure he must be Long John Silver. He was missing his left leg at the hip, and he skillfully used a crutch under his left armpit, maneuvering it with impressive ease, moving like a bird by hopping. He was quite tall and muscular, with a face that was large like a ham – simple and lacking colour, but clearly intelligent and friendly-looking. Indeed, he appeared to be in the best of moods, whistling as he went about among the tables, offering cheerful remarks or a friendly pat on the back to his favorite patrons. Now, frankly, ever since Squire Trelawney mentioned Long John in his letter, I had worried that he might turn out to be the very one-legged sailor I had observed for so long at the old Benbow inn. However, a single look at the man before me was sufficient. I had encountered the Captain, Black Dog, and the blind man, Pew, and I believed I understood what a buccaneer resembled – a creature I considered quite different, in my opinion, from this clean and kindly landlord. I quickly summoned my courage, stepped inside, and walked directly towards the man where he stood, leaning on his crutch, engaged in conversation with a customer. \"Mr. Silver, sir?\" I inquired, extending the note. \"Yes, my boy,\" he replied; \"that is indeed my name. And who might you be?\" Then, as he saw the squire’s letter, he seemed almost startled. \"Ah!\" he exclaimed quite loudly, and offered his hand. \"I see. You are our new cabin-boy; I am very glad to meet you.\" And he took my hand in his large, firm grasp.",

He was missing his left leg close to the hip, and used a crutch beneath his left shoulder with remarkable skill, hopping on it nimbly, almost like a bird. He was very tall and strong, with a large, pale, and ordinary face, yet there was intelligence and a smile in his expression. He looked to be in very high spirits, cheerfully whistling as he moved around the tables, giving friendly words and playful pats on the back to his favorite customers.\n\nTo be honest, ever since I first heard Long John mentioned in Squire Trelawney's letter, I'd been nervous that he was the one-legged sailor I'd always been watching out for at the old Benbow Inn. But seeing this man for myself was all I needed. I had met the captain, Black Dog, and the blind man Pew, and I thought I knew what a pirate was supposed to look like — but this landlord was quite unlike them, clean and pleasant in manner.\n\nI gathered my courage, stepped inside, and approached him as he stood talking with a customer, propped up on his crutch. “Mr. Silver, sir?” I asked, handing over the letter.\n\n“Yes, my boy,\" he replied, “that’s me. And who are you?” When he saw the squire’s note, he looked to make a sudden movement, almost a jump of surprise.\n\n“Oh!” he exclaimed loudly, extending his hand. “Now I see. You must be our new cabin boy; I’m very pleased to meet you.”\n\nHe shook my hand firmly with his large hand."

And what was he saying to you?”\n“I don’t rightly know, sir,” answered Morgan.\n“Do you call that a head on your shoulders, or a blessed dead-eye?” cried Long John. “Don’t rightly know, don’t you! Perhaps you don’t happen to rightly know who you was speaking to, perhaps? Come, now, what was he jawing—v’yages, cap’ns, ships? Pipe up!

Get back to your place for a lubber, Tom.”\nAnd then, as Morgan rolled back to his seat, Silver added to me in a confidential whisper that was very flattering, as I thought, “He’s quite an honest man, Tom Morgan, on’y stupid. And now,” he ran on again, aloud, “let’s see—Black Dog? No, I don’t know the name, not I. Yet I kind of think I’ve—yes, I’ve seen the swab.

He should run him down, hand over hand, by the powers! He talked o’ keel-hauling, did he? I’ll keel-haul him!”\nAll the time he was jerking out these phrases he was stumping up and down the tavern on his crutch, slapping tables with his hand, and giving such a show of excitement as would have convinced an Old Bailey judge or a Bow Street runner. My suspicions had been thoroughly reawakened on finding Black Dog at the Spy-glass, and I watched the cook narrowly. But he was too deep, and too ready, and too clever for me, and by the time the two men had come back out of breath and confessed that they had lost the track in a crowd, and been scolded like thieves, I would have gone bail for the innocence of Long John Silver.",

Long John sternly asked Morgan if he had ever seen 'that Black—Black Dog' before. Morgan saluted and replied he had not. 'You didn't know his name either, right?' Long John pressed. 'No, sir,' Morgan answered. The landlord (Long John) exclaimed forcefully that it was fortunate for Morgan he didn't know someone like that, warning him that associating with such people would mean being permanently banned from his establishment. He then demanded to know what they had been talking about. Morgan replied that he didn't quite remember. Long John angrily asked if he had a head or just a 'dead-eye' (a nautical term for a block used in rigging), scolding him for not knowing. He pushed him harder, asking if he didn't even know who he was talking to, and insisted he reveal the topic, whether it was voyages, captains, or ships. Morgan finally said they were discussing 'keel-hauling'. Long John confirmed this, called it a 'mighty suitable thing,' and insultingly told Morgan to go back to his place like the 'lubber' he was. As Morgan shuffled back, Silver leaned into me and whispered confidentially, which I found flattering, that Tom Morgan was an honest but simply foolish man. Then, speaking loudly again, he mused about Black Dog, claiming not to know the name but then recalling seeing the man before, mentioning he used to come to the tavern with a blind beggar. I confirmed this, adding that I knew the blind man too, and his name was Pew. Silver cried out excitedly, confirming that Pew was indeed the name. He remarked that Pew looked like a villain. He then stated that catching Black Dog would be significant news for Captain Trelawney, praising his man Ben as an excellent runner who should easily track him down 'hand over hand'. Referencing Morgan's comment, he vowed, 'I'll keel-haul him!' Throughout this speech, he was energetically moving around the tavern on his crutch, hitting tables with his hand, putting on a performance of excitement convincing enough for even a seasoned judge or police officer. My suspicions were strongly revived upon seeing Black Dog at the Spy-glass, and I watched the cook very carefully. However, he was too cunning, quick-thinking, and adept for me to read. By the time the two sailors he had sent returned breathless, confessing they had lost Black Dog in a crowd and been sharply reprimanded, I was so persuaded by Silver's act that I would have sworn to Long John Silver's complete innocence.",

The landlord then declared that if Morgan had been involved with someone like Black Dog, he wouldn't have been allowed back into the tavern. Long John asked what Black Dog had talked to him about. Morgan said he wasn't quite sure. Silver scolded him for not being able to remember, suggesting he must not be very bright, and pressed him to say what the conversation was about—perhaps about voyages, captains, or ships. Morgan finally said they had been talking about keel-hauling. Silver agreed that was an appropriate topic and ordered him back to his place, calling him a fool. As Morgan took his seat, Silver whispered to the narrator that Morgan was honest but not very smart. Then, speaking louder, he claimed not to know Black Dog but remembered seeing him in the company of a blind beggar. The narrator confirmed the blind man's name was Pew, which excited Silver. He said if they could catch Black Dog, it would be significant news for Captain Trelawney and praised Ben as a good runner who could catch him. Silver declared that since Black Dog had discussed keel-hauling, he'd make sure to punish him the same way. Throughout all this, Silver was moving energetically around the tavern on his crutch, banging tables and acting so convincingly that he could have fooled a judge or detective. Despite the narrator's renewed suspicions after seeing Black Dog at the tavern, Silver's craftiness and clever acting made it impossible to catch him out, and after the pursuers returned empty-handed and were berated, the narrator was almost willing to vouch for Silver's innocence."

That's the second thing.\"\n\"Anything else?\" Mr. Trelawney asked.\n\"One last thing,\" said the captain. \"There's already been too much gossip.\"\n\"Far too much,\" the doctor agreed.\n\"I'll tell you what rumors I've heard,\" Captain Smollett continued: \"that you have a map showing an island, marked with crosses for treasure, and the exact latitude and longitude—\" as he recited the precise location.\n\"I've never shared that!\" the squire exclaimed. \"Not with a soul!\"\n\"The crew knows, sir,\" the captain said.\n\"Livesey, it must have been you or Hawkins,\" accused the squire.\n\"It's not really important who it was,\" the doctor replied. I could see that neither he nor the captain cared much about Mr. Trelawney's objections. Neither did I, since he had a habit of loose talk; but in this case, I actually believed at least no one had revealed where the island was."

He argued that no captain would be justified in setting sail at all if they had sufficient reason to suspect a mutiny. While he fully believed Mr. Arrow was honest, and that some, maybe even all, of the crew were the same, his duty was to ensure the ship's safety and the lives of everyone aboard.

The doctor simply replied that time would tell. When they went up on deck, the crew members were already busy moving the weapons and gunpowder, singing rhythmically as they worked, with the captain and Mr. Arrow overseeing the process. The updated arrangement for sleeping quarters suited the narrator well. The entire schooner had been thoroughly inspected and modified; six sleeping berths had been built in the back section, utilizing what was previously the rear part of the ship's main cargo area. This cluster of cabins was connected to the kitchen and the crew's living area in the bow (forecastle) only by a slatted walkway along the port (left) side. The initial plan was for the captain, Mr. Arrow, Hunter, Joyce, the doctor, and the squire to occupy these six berths. However, under the new plan, Redruth and the narrator were to take two of them, while Mr. Arrow and the captain were to sleep in the on-deck structure called the companionway. This area had been expanded outwards on both sides to the point where it could almost be called a small, low cabin or 'round-house'. Although still quite low, it was large enough to hang two hammocks, and even the mate, Mr. Arrow, seemed content with the setup. Perhaps even he had concerns about the crew, but that's just a guess, because, as you will learn, they didn't have the benefit of his opinion for much longer.",

The ship had been reorganized, with six sleeping spaces added at the stern where the back part of the hold had been, all connected to the galley and forecastle by a wooden passage on the port side. Initially, the plan was for the captain, Mr. Arrow, Hunter, Joyce, the doctor, and the squire to use those six spaces. Now Redruth and I were to have two of them, with Mr. Arrow and the captain set to sleep up top in the enlarged companionway, which was now nearly as big as a roundhouse. Although it was still quite low, there was now enough space to hang two hammocks, and even the mate seemed satisfied with this change. He, too, may have had his doubts about the rest of the crew, but I'm only guessing—since, as you’ll hear, we didn’t benefit from his views for much longer.\""

Besides being ineffective as an officer and setting a poor example for the crew, it was obvious that his drinking would soon be fatal.

Still more strange was it to see him in the heaviest of weather cross the deck. He had a line or two rigged up to help him across the widest spaces—Long John’s earrings, they were called; and he would hand himself from one place to another, now using the crutch, now trailing it alongside by the lanyard, as quickly as another man could walk.

Here’s this poor old innocent bird o’ mine swearing blue fire, and none the wiser, you may lay to that.

The bird would then bite the bars and swear continuously, with incredible wickedness. \"There,\" John would add, \"you can't handle tar without getting dirty, lad. Here's my poor old innocent bird swearing fiercely, and she's completely ignorant of what she's saying, you can count on that.

He owned, when driven into a corner, that he seemed to have been wrong about the crew, that some of them were as brisk as he wanted to see and all had behaved fairly well. As for the ship, he had taken a downright fancy to her. “She’ll lie a point nearer the wind than a man has a right to expect of his own married wife, sir.

Double grog was going on the least excuse; there was duff on odd days, as, for instance, if the squire heard it was any man’s birthday, and always a barrel of apples standing broached in the waist for anyone to help himself that had a fancy.\n“Never knew good come of it yet,” the captain said to Dr. Livesey. “Spoil forecastle hands, make devils.

Regarding the ship, he had grown genuinely fond of her. He would remark that she sailed closer to the wind than one could reasonably expect, comparing her performance favorably even to a devoted spouse. Nevertheless, he would consistently conclude by stating they were not yet home and he felt apprehensive about the journey. Upon hearing this, the Squire would turn away and stride up and down the deck, looking haughty. He would comment that a bit more interaction with the captain would make him lose his temper. We experienced some severe weather, which merely served to highlight the *Hispaniola*'s excellent capabilities. Everyone on board appeared content, and they would have been difficult to please otherwise, as I believe no ship's crew had been so pampered since Noah set sail. They were given extra grog for minor reasons; pudding was served on random days, for instance, if the Squire heard it was someone's birthday, and an open barrel of apples was always available mid-ship for anyone to help themselves to.

We were sailing South-Southwest with a consistent side wind and calm seas. The Hispaniola rolled evenly, her bowsprit occasionally dipping and throwing up a little spray.

Our course was south-southwest, the wind was steady from the side, and the sea was calm. The Hispaniola moved smoothly, sometimes sending her bowsprit into the spray.

That was Roberts’ men, that was, and comed of changing names to their ships—Royal Fortune and so on. Now, what a ship was christened, so let her stay, I says. So it was with the Cassandra, as brought us all safe home from Malabar, after England took the Viceroy of the Indies; so it was with the old Walrus, Flint’s old ship, as I’ve seen amuck with the red blood and fit to sink with gold.”\n“Ah!” cried another voice, that of the youngest hand on board, and evidently full of admiration. “He was the flower of the flock, was Flint!”\n“Davis was a man too, by all accounts,” said Silver. “I never sailed along of him; first with England, then with Flint, that’s my story; and now here on my own account, in a manner of speaking. I laid by nine hundred safe, from England, and two thousand after Flint. That ain’t bad for a man before the mast—all safe in bank. ’Tain’t earning now, it’s saving does it, you may lay to that. Where’s all England’s men now? I dunno. Where’s Flint’s? Why, most on ’em aboard here, and glad to get the duff—been begging before that, some on ’em. Old Pew, as had lost his sight, and might have thought shame, spends twelve hundred pound in a year, like a lord in Parliament. Where is he now? Well, he’s dead now and under hatches; but for two year before that, shiver my timbers, the man was starving! He begged, and he stole, and he cut throats, and starved at that, by the powers!”\n“Well, it ain’t much use, after all,” said the young seaman.\n“’Tain’t much use for fools, you may lay to it—that, nor nothing,” cried Silver. “But now, you look here: you’re young, you are, but you’re as smart as paint. I see that when I set my eyes on you, and I’ll talk to you like a man.”\nYou may imagine how I felt when I heard this abominable old rogue addressing another in the very same words of flattery as he had used to myself.

My leg was amputated by a highly skilled surgeon, a university graduate knowledgeable in many things, including fluent Latin. However, he was later executed and left to hang and dry in the sun like the others at Corso Castle by Roberts’ men, who were known for constantly renaming their ships, like the Royal Fortune, which I think is a bad practice.\" Silver added his belief that a ship should keep the name it was originally given. He cited the *Cassandra*, which brought them safely back from Malabar after England captured the *Viceroy of the Indies*, and the infamous old *Walrus*, Flint's vessel, which he had witnessed covered in blood and so laden with gold it seemed on the verge of sinking.",

The very attack that cost me my leg also blinded old Pew. A top-notch surgeon, fresh out of university and full of Latin phrases, amputated my leg—yet he wound up hanged and left to dry in the sun at Corso Castle. That was the work of Roberts’ men, who got in trouble for renaming their ships—Royal Fortune and such. My view is: when a ship’s named, she should keep her name. Take the Cassandra, which safely brought us back from Malabar after England captured the Viceroy of the Indies, or Flint’s old ship, the Walrus—I’ve seen her awash in blood and weighed down with treasure.”\n\n“Ah!” said the youngest crewmate, clearly impressed. “Flint was the best of them all!”\n\n“Davis was a fine man too, or so I’ve heard,” Silver replied. “I never sailed with him myself—first I sailed with England, then with Flint. That’s my story. Now I’m acting on my own. I set aside nine hundred from my days with England, and two thousand after Flint. Not bad for someone before the mast, all secure in the bank. These days it’s about saving, not earning, you can believe that. Where are England’s men now? I don’t know. Where are Flint’s? Most of them are here, happy for even simple food—some used to beg. Old Pew, who was blind and should’ve felt shame, spent twelve hundred pounds in a year, like a lord. Where is he now? Dead and buried. But for two years before that, curse me, he was starving! He begged, stole, murdered, and still starved.”\n\n“Well, it doesn’t seem worth it,” said the young sailor.\n\n“It’s worthless for fools, I tell you—and that goes for anything,” Silver replied. “But listen here: you’re young, but you’re sharp. I saw that right away, and I’ll speak to you like a man.”\n\nYou can imagine my feelings when I heard this despicable old scoundrel using the same words of praise on someone else that he’d said to me. If I’d have had the chance, I’d have shot him then and there. Meanwhile, he kept talking, not realizing he was being overheard."

Now, here's my instruction: you'll sleep with the common sailors, live strictly, speak softly, and stay sober until I give the signal; and you'd better understand that, my son.\" \"Well, I'm not refusing, am I?\" grumbled the coxswain. \"What I'm asking is, *when*? That's my question.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"Alright, I'll tell you straight,\" the boy replied, \"I wasn't at all sure about this until I spoke with you, John; but now, I'm in.\" Silver grasped his hand with great enthusiasm, making the whole barrel shake, and said, \"You're a brave and clever lad, and I’ve never seen anyone look more the part of a gentleman of fortune than you.\" At this point, I began to understand what they meant by \"gentleman of fortune\"—it was simply another name for a pirate, and the conversation I overheard was the final step in turning one of the honest crew—possibly the last—over to their side. But soon, this concern was put to rest when Silver gave a low whistle and another man came over and joined them. \"Dick's reliable,\" said Silver. \"Of course, Dick’s solid,\" responded Israel Hands, the coxswain, as he spat after chewing his quid. \"But listen up, Barbecue,\" he continued, \"How much longer are we going to drift about like some useless supply boat? I’m fed up with Captain Smollett bossing me around! I want to get into the captain’s cabin and help myself to his pickles and wine.\" Silver replied, \"Israel, I never thought much of your brains, but at least you can listen—and you should, with ears that big. Here’s what I say: you’ll stay up front, you’ll put up with tough conditions, you’ll mind your tongue, and you’ll keep sober until I say otherwise; and you can count on that.\" Israel grumbled, \"I’m not saying no, am I? What I want to know is, when exactly? That’s what I say.\""

Here’s a first-rate seaman, Cap’n Smollett, sails the blessed ship for us. Here’s this squire and doctor with a map and such—I don’t know where it is, do I? No more do you, says you. Well then, I mean this squire and doctor shall find the stuff, and help us to get it aboard, by the powers. Then we’ll see. If I was sure of you all, sons of double Dutchmen, I’d have Cap’n Smollett navigate us half-way back again before I struck.”\n“Why, we’re all seamen aboard here, I should think,” said the lad Dick.\n“We’re all forecastle hands, you mean,” snapped Silver. “We can steer a course, but who’s to set one? That’s what all you gentlemen split on, first and last. If I had my way, I’d have Cap’n Smollett work us back into the trades at least; then we’d have no blessed miscalculations and a spoonful of water a day. But I know the sort you are. I’ll finish with ’em at the island, as soon’s the blunt’s on board, and a pity it is. But you’re never happy till you’re drunk. Split my sides, I’ve a sick heart to sail with the likes of you!”\n“Easy all, Long John,” cried Israel. “Who’s a-crossin’ of you?”\n“Why, how many tall ships, think ye, now, have I seen laid aboard? And how many brisk lads drying in the sun at Execution Dock?” cried Silver. “And all for this same hurry and hurry and hurry. You hear me? I seen a thing or two at sea, I have. If you would on’y lay your course, and a p’int to windward, you would ride in carriages, you would. But not you! I know you. You’ll have your mouthful of rum tomorrow, and go hang.”\n“Everybody knowed you was a kind of a chapling, John; but there’s others as could hand and steer as well as you,” said Israel. “They liked a bit o’ fun, they did. They wasn’t so high and dry, nohow, but took their fling, like jolly companions every one.”\n“So?” says Silver. “Well, and where are they now? Pew was that sort, and he died a beggar-man. Flint was, and he died of rum at Savannah. Ah, they was a sweet crew, they was! On’y, where are they?”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Silver, shouting, asked, “When indeed! By the powers!” He continued, “Well now, if you’re asking, I’ll tell you the time: The absolute last moment I can manage, and that’s when.” He pointed out they had a highly skilled seaman, Captain Smollett, navigating the ship. He noted that the Squire and Doctor possessed the map and related information – something he himself didn’t have, nor did any of them, as he stated. Therefore, he insisted that the Squire and Doctor would locate the treasure and help them load it onto the ship. “Then we’ll see,” he added. He revealed that if he were certain of their loyalty, calling them insulting names, he would have Captain Smollett sail them halfway back before making his move.\nYoung Dick remarked that he thought they were all capable seamen aboard.\nSilver snapped back, “You mean you’re all common crewmen.” He explained that they could steer the ship, but lacked the skill to plot a course, stating that this inability was the downfall of such men. He expressed a wish to have Captain Smollett sail them back into the trade winds at least, which would prevent serious errors and ensure they had enough water. However, knowing their nature, he decided he would finish things on the island as soon as the gold was on board, regretting that it had to be this way. He complained that they were never satisfied until they were drunk, expressing his deep displeasure at having to sail with men like them.\nIsrael urged calm, asking who was challenging Silver.\nSilver passionately questioned how many large vessels he had seen captured and how many capable young men he had witnessed executed (drying in the sun at Execution Dock). He blamed this on their constant rush. He claimed to have learned a great deal at sea. He argued that if they would just follow a proper course, perhaps tacking slightly into the wind, they could achieve great wealth and live in luxury. But, he asserted, they wouldn’t do this; he knew them – they would simply drink their rum tomorrow and face the gallows.\nIsrael replied that everyone knew Silver was a bit like a “chaplain” (meaning overly serious or moralistic), but others were just as skilled at sailing and handling the ship. These others, he added, enjoyed having fun and weren't so rigid or distant, but embraced life's pleasures like cheerful companions.\n“Is that so?” Silver responded. He then questioned where these men were now. He mentioned Pew, who was like that and died a beggar, and Flint, who was similar and died from drinking in Savannah. He sarcastically called them a “sweet crew,” but reiterated his question: “The only thing is, where are they now?”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "“When is it happening, then?” exclaimed Silver. “All right, if you really want to know, I’ll tell you. It’ll be at the very last moment I can pull it off. That’s when. We’ve got a top-notch sailor in Captain Smollett, who’s steering the ship for us. The squire and the doctor are here with the map—although I don’t know where the treasure is, do I? Neither do you, you’ll admit. My plan is this: I’ll have the squire and the doctor find the treasure and help us load it on board, by thunder. Then we’ll worry about the rest. If I could count on you all, you lot of stubborn Dutchmen, I’d have Captain Smollett take us halfway home before I made my move.”\n\n“We’re all seamen here, aren’t we?” said young Dick.\n\n“We’re all regular sailors, you mean,” Silver retorted sharply. “Sure, we know how to steer, but who among us knows how to chart a course? That’s where you all fail, every time. If it were up to me, I’d get Captain Smollett to take us back to the trade winds, at the very least; that way we wouldn’t risk starving or dying of thirst. But I know what you’re like. I’ll deal with them at the island—as soon as the money’s on board—even though it’s a shame. But you lot can’t be satisfied unless you’re drunk. By thunder, I hate sailing with men like you!”\n\n“Calm down, Long John,” called Israel. “No one’s arguing with you.”\n\n“How many big ships do you think I’ve seen captured in my time?” cried Silver. “How many lively lads have I seen hanged at Execution Dock? And it’s always because they were in such a rush. Listen to me, I’ve learned a thing or two at sea. If you would just hold your course and be patient, you’d end up rich as kings! But no, not you! You’ll be drinking rum tomorrow and face the consequences.”\n\n“Everyone knew you were a cautious sort, John,” said Israel, “but there are others who could steer just as well as you. They liked a bit of fun, sure—they weren’t so straight-laced, but enjoyed themselves, like good mates.”\n\n“Oh, really?” said Silver. “And where are they now? Pew was like that, but he died a pauper. Flint was the same, and he drank himself to death in Savannah. They made a fine crew, didn’t they? But where are they now?”"

Well, what would you think? Put ’em ashore like maroons? That would have been England’s way. Or cut ’em down like that much pork? That would have been Flint’s, or Billy Bones’s.”\n“Billy was the man for that,” said Israel. “‘Dead men don’t bite,’ says he. Well, he’s dead now hisself; he knows the long and short on it now; and if ever a rough hand come to port, it was Billy.”\n“Right you are,” said Silver; “rough and ready. But mark you here, I’m an easy man—I’m quite the gentleman, says you; but this time it’s serious. Dooty is dooty, mates. I give my vote—death. When I’m in Parlyment and riding in my coach, I don’t want none of these sea-lawyers in the cabin a-coming home, unlooked for, like the devil at prayers. Wait is what I say; but when the time comes, why, let her rip!”\n“John,” cries the coxswain, “you’re a man!”\n“You’ll say so, Israel when you see,” said Silver. “Only one thing I claim—I claim Trelawney. I’ll wring his calf’s head off his body with these hands, Dick!” he added, breaking off. “You just jump up, like a sweet lad, and get me an apple, to wet my pipe like.”\nYou may fancy the terror I was in! I should have leaped out and run for it if I had found the strength, but my limbs and heart alike misgave me. I heard Dick begin to rise, and then someone seemingly stopped him, and the voice of Hands exclaimed, “Oh, stow that! Don’t you get sucking of that bilge, John. Let’s have a go of the rum.”\n“Dick,” said Silver, “I trust you. I’ve a gauge on the keg, mind. There’s the key; you fill a pannikin and bring it up.”\nTerrified as I was, I could not help thinking to myself that this must have been how Mr. Arrow got the strong waters that destroyed him.\nDick was gone but a little while, and during his absence Israel spoke straight on in the cook’s ear. It was but a word or two that I could catch, and yet I gathered some important news, for besides other scraps that tended to the same purpose, this whole clause was audible: “Not another man of them’ll jine.” Hence there were still faithful men on board.\nWhen Dick returned, one after another of the trio took the pannikin and drank—one “To luck,” another with a “Here’s to old Flint,” and Silver himself saying, in a kind of song, “Here’s to ourselves, and hold your luff, plenty of prizes and plenty of duff.”\nJust then a sort of brightness fell upon me in the barrel, and looking up, I found the moon had risen and was silvering the mizzen-top and shining white on the luff of the fore-sail; and almost at the same time the voice of the lookout shouted, “Land ho!”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Dick then inquired, \"But when we engage them head-on, what exactly do we plan to do with them?\"\n\"Now that's the kind of question I like!\" the cook exclaimed with admiration. \"That's practical thinking. Well, what do you suggest? Set them ashore with no supplies, like marooned sailors? That would have been the English Navy's approach. Or simply butcher them like animals? That was more Flint's style, or Billy Bones's.\"\n\"Billy was certainly the man for that,\" Israel commented. \"'Dead men tell no tales,' he'd say. Well, he's dead himself now; he understands the finality of it all these days; and if there was ever a tough character who arrived in port, it was Billy.\"\n\"Absolutely correct,\" Silver agreed; \"tough and ready. But listen here, I'm a flexible man—you could say I'm quite the gentleman; but this situation is serious. Duty calls, mates. I cast my vote—for death. When I'm wealthy and riding in my carriage, I don't want any of these argumentative sailors unexpectedly turning up in the cabin back home, like the devil appearing during prayers. My policy is to wait; but when the time comes, let's go for it with full force!\"\n\"John,\" cried the coxswain, \"you are a true man!\"\n\"You'll see that, Israel, when the moment arrives,\" Silver replied. \"There's only one person I claim—I claim Trelawney. I'll personally twist his head clean off his body with these hands, Dick!\" he added abruptly, then changed tack. \"Now, jump up like a good lad, and fetch me an apple, to moisten my pipe.\"\nYou can imagine the fear I was experiencing! I would have sprung out and fled if my strength hadn't deserted me, but my limbs and my courage failed me simultaneously. I heard Dick beginning to stand, and then someone seemed to stop him, and the voice of Hands spoke up, \"Oh, forget that! Don't bother with that watery stuff, John. Let's have some rum.\"\n\"Dick,\" Silver said, \"I trust you. Remember, there's a measuring stick on the barrel. Here's the key; fill a metal cup and bring it up.\"\nDespite my terror, I couldn't help but think to myself that this was likely how Mr. Arrow got the strong drink that ultimately destroyed him.\nDick was only gone a short time, and during his absence, Israel spoke directly into the cook's ear. I only managed to catch a word or two, yet I gleaned some significant information, because besides other fragments that suggested the same point, this entire phrase was clear enough to hear: \"Not a single other one of them will join us.\" This confirmed there were still loyal men among the crew.\nWhen Dick returned, the three men took turns taking the metal cup and drinking—one said \"To good fortune,\" another offered a toast \"Here's to old Flint,\" and Silver himself sang softly, \"Here's to us all, steer close to the wind, plenty of riches and plenty of good food.\"\nJust at that moment, a patch of light fell upon me inside the barrel, and looking up, I saw that the moon had risen and was casting a silver glow on the top of the mizzen mast and shining brightly on the front edge of the fore-sail; and almost simultaneously, the voice of the lookout high above shouted, \"Land ahead!\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"But what do we do with them once we capture them?\" Dick asked.\n\n\"Now there's a practical question!\" the cook replied, clearly impressed. \"What do you think? Should we abandon them on an island like castaways? That's the English way. Or just kill them, like Flint or Billy Bones would have done?\"\n\n\"Billy liked that method,\" said Israel. \"He used to say, 'Dead men don't bite.' Well, now he's dead himself, so he should know better than anyone. He was as tough as they come.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Silver agreed. \"He was always direct and ruthless. But listen here, I'm a reasonable man—call me a gentleman if you like—but this time it's serious. Duty calls, mates. My vote is for death. When I'm a rich man back in England, I don't want any troublemakers sneaking into my cabin. My advice is to wait for the right moment, but when the time comes, don't hold back!\"\n\n\"John, you're a real leader!\" the coxswain exclaimed.\n\n\"You'll agree with me, Israel, when you see what I do,\" Silver replied. \"But there's one thing I insist on—I want Trelawney for myself. I'll deal with him personally, Dick!\" he exclaimed, then suddenly changing the subject. \"Now, be a good lad and fetch me an apple to go with my pipe.\"\n\nI was terrified! If I had the strength, I would have run away, but fear held me frozen. I heard Dick start to get up, but someone stopped him, and Hands spoke up, \"Oh, stop that! Don't keep on with that nonsense, John. Let's have a drink instead.\"\n\n\"Dick,\" said Silver, \"I trust you. I've got the rum measured out. Here's the key—fill a cup and bring it up.\"\n\nEven in my fear, I couldn't help thinking this must be how Mr. Arrow got hold of the drink that ruined him.\n\nDick was only gone a short while, and as he was away, Israel whispered something quietly to the cook. I only caught a few words, but I realized something important: \"Not another man of them’ll join.\" So there were still loyal men aboard.\n\nWhen Dick returned, each of the three had a drink—one toasted good luck, another, \"Here's to old Flint,\" and Silver, in a singsong voice, toasted, \"Here's to us, and smooth sailing, with lots of riches and plenty to eat.\"\n\nAt that moment, a light crept into the barrel where I hid; I looked up and saw the moon shining on the ship, and right then, the lookout shouted, \"Land ho!\""

          "text_segment": "There was a great rush of feet across the deck. I could hear people tumbling up from the cabin and the forecastle, and slipping in an instant outside my barrel, I dived behind the fore-sail, made a double towards the stern, and came out upon the open deck in time to join Hunter and Dr. Livesey in the rush for the weather bow.\nThere all hands were already congregated. A belt of fog had lifted almost simultaneously with the appearance of the moon. Away to the south-west of us we saw two low hills, about a couple of miles apart, and rising behind one of them a third and higher hill, whose peak was still buried in the fog. All three seemed sharp and conical in figure.\nSo much I saw, almost in a dream, for I had not yet recovered from my horrid fear of a minute or two before. And then I heard the voice of Captain Smollett issuing orders. The Hispaniola was laid a couple of points nearer the wind and now sailed a course that would just clear the island on the east.\n“And now, men,” said the captain, when all was sheeted home, “has any one of you ever seen that land ahead?”\n“I have, sir,” said Silver. “I’ve watered there with a trader I was cook in.”\n“The anchorage is on the south, behind an islet, I fancy?” asked the captain.\n“Yes, sir; Skeleton Island they calls it. It were a main place for pirates once, and a hand we had on board knowed all their names for it. That hill to the nor’ard they calls the Foremast Hill; there are three hills in a row running south’ard—fore, main, and mizzen, sir. But the main—that’s the big un, with the cloud on it—they usually calls the Spy-glass, by reason of a lookout they kept when they was in the anchorage cleaning, for it’s there they cleaned their ships, sir, asking your pardon.”\n“I have a chart here,” says Captain Smollett. “See if that’s the place.”\nLong John’s eyes burned in his head as he took the chart, but by the fresh look of the paper I knew he was doomed to disappointment. This was not the map we found in Billy Bones’s chest, but an accurate copy, complete in all things—names and heights and soundings—with the single exception of the red crosses and the written notes. Sharp as must have been his annoyance, Silver had the strength of mind to hide it.\n“Yes, sir,” said he, “this is the spot, to be sure, and very prettily drawed out. Who might have done that, I wonder? The pirates were too ignorant, I reckon. Aye, here it is: ‘Capt. Kidd’s Anchorage’—just the name my shipmate called it. There’s a strong current runs along the south, and then away nor’ard up the west coast. Right you was, sir,” says he, “to haul your wind and keep the weather of the island. Leastways, if such was your intention as to enter and careen, and there ain’t no better place for that in these waters.”\n“Thank you, my man,” says Captain Smollett. “I’ll ask you later on to give us a help. You may go.”",

Slipping instantly out of my barrel, I ducked behind the front sail, doubled back towards the rear of the ship, and emerged onto the open deck just in time to join Hunter and Dr. Livesey as they rushed to the forward side facing the wind. Everyone had already gathered there. A band of fog had lifted at nearly the same moment the moon appeared. To our southwest, we saw two low hills, separated by about two miles, and behind one of them rose a third, taller hill whose peak was still hidden by the fog. All three appeared sharply pointed, like cones. I saw this much, almost as if in a dream, as I had not yet recovered from the terrible fear I'd felt only a minute or two before. Then, I heard Captain Smollett giving orders. The Hispaniola was turned a bit closer into the wind, and now sailed on a path that would just barely pass the island to the east. \"Now, men,\" the captain said, once all the ropes controlling the sails were secured, \"has anyone here seen that land ahead before?\" \"I have, sir,\" replied Silver. \"I've stopped there to get water when I was cook on a trading vessel.\" \"The place to anchor is on the south side, behind a small island, if I recall correctly?\" the captain asked. \"Yes, sir; they call it Skeleton Island. It used to be a major spot for pirates, and a fellow we had aboard knew all their names for it. The hill to the north they call the Foremast Hill; there's a line of three hills running southward—fore, main, and mizzen, sir. But the main one—that's the large one, with the cloud on it—they usually call the Spy-glass, because they used it as a lookout when they were anchored there cleaning their ships, sir, begging your pardon.\" \"I have a map here,\" said Captain Smollett. \"See if it's the same place.\" Long John's eyes seemed to burn as he took the chart, but the fresh look of the paper told me he would be disappointed. This was not the map we had found in Billy Bones's chest, but an exact copy, complete with all details—names, elevations, and depths—except for the red crosses and the handwritten notes. Despite how sharp his annoyance must have been, Silver had the presence of mind to conceal it. \"Yes, sir,\" he said, \"this is the spot, no doubt about it, and very nicely drawn. I wonder who could have done that? The pirates were likely too uneducated, I reckon. Aye, here it is: 'Capt. Kidd’s Anchorage'—that's just what my old shipmate called it. There's a strong current that runs south, and then heads north along the west coast. You were right, sir,\" he added, \"to turn into the wind and stay on the windward side of the island. At least, if your intention was to go in and careen the ship, and there's no better place around here for that.\" \"Thank you, my man,\" Captain Smollett said. \"I'll ask you for some help later on. You can go now.\"",

Slipping quickly out from my hiding place by the barrel, I dove behind the fore-sail, twisted toward the back of the ship, and emerged on the open deck just in time to join Hunter and Dr. Livesey as they hurried toward the weather bow. There, everyone had already gathered together. The fog had lifted almost as soon as the moon appeared. Looking to the southwest, we saw two low hills about two miles apart, and behind one of them was a third, taller hill, its peak still shrouded in mist. All three hills were pointed and cone-shaped. I only took this in vaguely, still shaken from my earlier fright. Then I heard Captain Smollett giving out orders. The Hispaniola was steered a little closer to the wind, now heading on a course that would just pass east of the island.\n\nOnce the sails were properly set, the captain addressed the crew: \"Has anyone seen that land ahead before?\"\n\nSilver replied, \"I have, sir. I stopped there with a trading ship when I was the cook.\"\n\nThe captain asked, \"Is the anchorage on the south, behind a small islet?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; it's called Skeleton Island. Pirates used it often, and one of our hands remembers all their names for it. That northern hill is called Foremast Hill; there are three hills in a row running south—fore, main, and mizzen. But the main hill—that's the largest one with the cloud on it—they call the Spy-glass, because they kept lookout there while cleaning their ships in the anchorage.\"\n\n\"I have a chart here,\" said Captain Smollett. \"See if it's the place.\"\n\nSilver's eyes glinted as he looked at the map, but I could tell from the newness of the paper that it wasn’t the original we got from Billy Bones's chest, but an exact copy with all the details—names, heights, and depths—except for the red crosses and handwritten notes. Although Silver was clearly disappointed, he managed to hide his feelings.\n\nHe said, \"Yes, sir, that's definitely the spot, and it's very skillfully drawn. I wonder who made it? Certainly not the pirates—they weren't educated enough. Here it is: 'Capt. Kidd’s Anchorage,' the same name my mate called it. There's a strong current running along the south and then northward up the west coast. You were right, sir, to steer this way and keep the windward side of the island, especially if you were planning to enter and clean your ship there—there’s no better place for it here.\"\n\nThe captain replied, \"Thank you. I'll ask for your help again later. You can go.\""

Now, about the honest hands?”\n“Most likely Trelawney’s own men,” said the doctor; “those he had picked up for himself before he lit on Silver.”\n“Nay,” replied the squire. “Hands was one of mine.”\n“I did think I could have trusted Hands,” added the captain.\n“And to think that they’re all Englishmen!” broke out the squire. “Sir, I could find it in my heart to blow the ship up.”\n“Well, gentlemen,” said the captain, “the best that I can say is not much. We must lay to, if you please, and keep a bright lookout. It’s trying on a man, I know. It would be pleasanter to come to blows. But there’s no help for it till we know our men. Lay to, and whistle for a wind, that’s my view.”\n“Jim here,” said the doctor, “can help us more than anyone. The men are not shy with him, and Jim is a noticing lad.”\n“Hawkins, I put prodigious faith in you,” added the squire.\nI began to feel pretty desperate at this, for I felt altogether helpless; and yet, by an odd train of circumstances, it was indeed through me that safety came. In the meantime, talk as we pleased, there were only seven out of the twenty-six on whom we knew we could rely; and out of these seven one was a boy, so that the grown men on our side were six to their nineteen.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Addressing the Captain, the Squire conceded, \"Captain, you were indeed correct, and I was mistaken. I admit my foolishness and await your instructions.\" The Captain replied, \"You are no more foolish than I, sir. I've never before encountered a crew planning mutiny without showing prior indications, visible to anyone observant enough to spot the danger and act accordingly. But this crew,\" he added, \"has outsmarted me.\" The Doctor commented, \"Captain, with all due respect, that's Silver's doing. He's a truly remarkable individual.\" The Captain retorted, \"He'd look remarkably suitable hanging from a yardarm, sir. But idle chatter achieves nothing. I see three or four critical points, and with Mr. Trelawney's permission, I'll outline them.\" \"Sir, you are the Captain. It is your place to speak,\" Mr. Trelawney declared with dignity. \"First point,\" Mr. Smollett began, \"we must proceed onward, as retreating is impossible. If I ordered a turnabout, they would rebel instantly. Second point, we have time available – at least until the treasure is located. Third point, there are loyal individuals among us. Now, sir, a confrontation is inevitable eventually, and my suggestion is to seize the opportunity proactively, as the saying goes, and strike on a day when they least expect it. We can certainly count on your personal household staff, Mr. Trelawney, correct?\" The Squire affirmed, \"As if they were myself.\" \"Three,\" the Captain calculated; \"with us, that makes seven, including Hawkins here. Now, regarding the trustworthy seamen?\" \"Most likely Trelawney's original men,\" the Doctor suggested; \"the ones he recruited himself before hiring Silver.\" \"No,\" the Squire corrected. \"Hands was one of mine.\" The Captain added, \"I genuinely believed I could trust Hands.\" \"And to think they're all Englishmen!\" the Squire exclaimed in frustration. \"Sir, I feel like exploding the ship.\" \"Well, gentlemen,\" the Captain said, \"the best I can offer isn't much comfort. We must heave to, if you agree, and maintain a vigilant watch. It's taxing, I know. Fighting would be preferable. But there's no alternative until we identify our reliable men. Stay put and hope for favorable conditions, that's my perspective.\" \"Jim here,\" the Doctor noted, \"can assist us more than anyone. The crew are relaxed around him, and Jim is a sharp young fellow.\" \"Hawkins, I have tremendous confidence in you,\" the Squire added. At this, I began to feel quite despairing, as I felt entirely powerless; and yet, due to a strange series of events, it was indeed through me that our safety was ultimately achieved. In the meantime, despite our discussion, we could only confidently rely on seven people out of the twenty-six; and of these seven, one was a boy, leaving the ratio of adult loyalists to mutineers at six to nineteen.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"All right, captain,\" said the squire, \"you were correct and I was mistaken. I admit my fault, and I'll follow your orders.\" \n\"You're no more to blame than I am, sir,\" replied the captain. \"Usually, mutinous crews show warning signs if someone is observant enough to catch on and act, but this crew has surprised me.\" \n\"Captain,\" the doctor said, \"with your leave, I think that's Silver's doing. He's an extraordinary fellow.\" \n\"He'd look even more extraordinary hanging from the yard-arm, sir,\" the captain answered dryly. \"But let’s get to practical matters instead of just talking. I have a few points to lay out, with Mr. Trelawney's consent.\" \n\"You're the captain—you should speak,\" Mr. Trelawney replied with dignity. \n\"First,\" the captain began, \"we have no choice except to proceed—we can't turn back, or the crew would mutiny immediately. Second, we still have some time left—at least until the treasure is found. Third, we aren’t alone—we have loyal men among us. So, eventually we'll have to fight, and I suggest we surprise them at a time of our choosing. Will your personal servants side with us, Mr. Trelawney?\" \n\"Absolutely, I trust them as I do myself,\" the squire affirmed. \n\"That's three,\" calculated the captain; \"with ourselves, that’s seven including Hawkins. What about other trustworthy crew?\" \n\"Probably only those men Trelawney hired himself, before meeting Silver,\" the doctor guessed. \n\"No, Hands was one of my hires,\" the squire replied.\n\"I thought I could trust Hands,\" the captain remarked. \n\"And to think they're all fellow Englishmen!\" the squire exclaimed. \"I'd almost like to blow up the ship myself.\" \n\"Gentlemen,\" the captain said, \"the wisest course is to stay alert and cautious. I know it's stressful and action would be preferable, but until we know for sure who’s loyal, we must bide our time and keep watch.\" \n\"Jim here,\" said the doctor, \"can help us most of all. The men are unguarded around him, and Jim notices things.\" \n\"Hawkins, I put tremendous trust in you,\" added the squire.\nAt this, I began to feel quite desperate, since I felt powerless; yet, oddly, it was through me that our safety would eventually come. For now, despite all our planning, we only knew we could truly rely on seven out of twenty-six, and one of those was just a boy, leaving only six grown men on our side against their nineteen.\"} Recognizing that there are only seven trustworthy people, including Jim (a boy), leaving only six adult allies versus the nineteen mutineers."

Although the breeze had now utterly ceased, we had made a great deal of way during the night and were now lying becalmed about half a mile to the south-east of the low eastern coast. Grey-coloured woods covered a large part of the surface. This even tint was indeed broken up by streaks of yellow sand-break in the lower lands, and by many tall trees of the pine family, out-topping the others—some singly, some in clumps; but the general colouring was uniform and sad. The hills ran up clear above the vegetation in spires of naked rock. All were strangely shaped, and the Spy-glass, which was by three or four hundred feet the tallest on the island, was likewise the strangest in configuration, running up sheer from almost every side and then suddenly cut off at the top like a pedestal to put a statue on.\nThe Hispaniola was rolling scuppers under in the ocean swell. The booms were tearing at the blocks, the rudder was banging to and fro, and the whole ship creaking, groaning, and jumping like a manufactory. I had to cling tight to the backstay, and the world turned giddily before my eyes, for though I was a good enough sailor when there was way on, this standing still and being rolled about like a bottle was a thing I never learned to stand without a qualm or so, above all in the morning, on an empty stomach.\nPerhaps it was this—perhaps it was the look of the island, with its grey, melancholy woods, and wild stone spires, and the surf that we could both see and hear foaming and thundering on the steep beach—at least, although the sun shone bright and hot, and the shore birds were fishing and crying all around us, and you would have thought anyone would have been glad to get to land after being so long at sea, my heart sank, as the saying is, into my boots; and from the first look onward, I hated the very thought of Treasure Island.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "When I came on deck the next morning, the island's appearance was completely transformed. Although the wind had now entirely stopped, we had travelled a considerable distance during the night and were now lying motionless about half a mile to the southeast of the island's low eastern shore. Large sections of the land were covered in grey-toned woods. This consistent colour was interrupted by stretches of yellow sand in the lower areas and by numerous tall pine trees, some alone and some in clusters, rising above the other vegetation. However, the overall colour scheme remained monotonous and gloomy. The hills rose sharply above the greenery as bare rock spires. They were all strangely shaped, and the Spy-glass peak, which was three or four hundred feet taller than any other point on the island, also had the most unusual form, rising almost vertically from nearly all sides before being abruptly flattened at the top, like a base for a statue. The Hispaniola was rolling heavily in the ocean swell, with the lower decks dipping into the water. The ship's spars were straining against the pulleys, the rudder was banging back and forth, and the entire vessel was creaking, groaning, and lurching as noisily as a factory. I had to hold tightly to the support rope at the back, and everything seemed to spin before my eyes. While I was a competent sailor when the ship was moving, being stationary and tossed around like a bottle was something I never learned to endure without feeling somewhat ill, especially in the morning on an empty stomach. Perhaps it was the ship's motion, or perhaps it was the sight of the island with its sad grey woods, rugged stone peaks, and the waves that we could both see and hear foaming and roaring on the steep beach. Regardless, although the sun was bright and warm, and shorebirds were fishing and calling all around us – making one think anyone would be eager to land after so long at sea – my spirits plummeted, as the saying goes; and from that initial look onwards, I utterly detested the very notion of Treasure Island.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "When I came up on deck the next morning, the island looked completely different. The wind had stopped, but during the night we had traveled a fair distance and were now stranded about half a mile southeast of the island’s low eastern shore. Much of the land was covered with gray woods, although the monotonous color was broken by yellow stretches of sand in the lower areas and groups of tall pine trees towering above the rest. Overall, the colors looked dull and somber. The hills rose sharply above the forest as bare, oddly shaped spires of rock. The largest and most unusual was the Spy-glass, a peak that rose steeply on most sides before ending abruptly flat on top, like the base for a statue.\n\nMeanwhile, the Hispaniola rolled heavily in the ocean’s swell. The booms strained at their moorings, the rudder swung wildly, and the whole ship creaked and groaned like a loud factory. I had to hold tightly to the rigging, feeling dizzy as the ship rocked unpredictably; I could handle movement when we were sailing, but being at a standstill and tossed about like a bottle unsettled me—especially on an empty stomach in the morning.\n\nMaybe this nausea, or maybe the gloomy look of the island with its gray woods, jagged rocks, and the crashing surf made my spirits sink. Although the sun was shining and birds cried and fished along the shore—things that might cheer anyone ready for land after a long sea voyage—I felt uneasy. From my very first glimpse, I dreaded the idea of Treasure Island."

I offered to join one of the boats, although my help wasn't actually required. The heat was oppressive, and the crew expressed strong discontent about the task. Anderson was in charge of my boat, but instead of keeping the men in line, he complained just as much as the most vocal among them. He remarked with a curse, 'This won't last forever,' which I considered a very worrying sign. Until that day, the men had worked diligently and without hesitation, but simply seeing the island had loosened their discipline. As we made our way in, Long John stood by the helmsman, guiding the ship. He was intimately familiar with the passage, and even though the sailor checking the depth found more water than indicated on the chart, John steered confidently without hesitation. He explained that a strong outgoing tide caused significant scouring, effectively deepening the passage 'as if it had been dug with a shovel.' We dropped anchor exactly where the chart showed, roughly a third of a mile from both shores – the mainland on one side and Skeleton Island on the other. The bottom was clear sand. The splash of the anchor briefly scattered flocks of birds, causing them to circle and cry over the woods, but within moments they had landed again, and quiet returned.",

I volunteered to join one of the boats, even though I really shouldn’t have. The oppressive heat made things worse, and the men complained loudly about the job. Anderson, who led my boat, did nothing to motivate us—instead, he grumbled as much as anyone else. “Well,” he swore, “at least it won’t last forever.” This struck me as an ominous development, because until now the crew had worked cheerfully and efficiently; but just the sight of the island seemed to weaken their discipline. The whole time, Long John Silver stood by the helmsman and guided the ship, obviously very familiar with the channel. Even though the man checking the depth kept getting readings deeper than shown on our chart, Long John navigated with complete confidence. “There’s a strong current at low tide,” he commented, “and you could say this passage was almost dug out with a spade.” We finally anchored exactly where the chart indicated, about a third of a mile from each shore, with the mainland on one side and Skeleton Island on the other. The seabed was clean sand. When our anchor splashed in, flocks of birds rose screeching from the forest, but within a minute they settled again and everything was quiet."

And when there was no specific task, he maintained a constant stream of songs, seemingly to mask the general discontent of the others. Of all the bleak characteristics of that somber afternoon, Long John's noticeable anxiety seemed the most unsettling.",

Long John was moving around the deck, giving good advice to everyone, and serving as an excellent example. He was even more helpful and polite than usual, constantly smiling at those around him. Whenever an order was given, he quickly responded with a cheerful 'Aye, aye, sir!' and, when not occupied with tasks, he kept singing to try and hide the unease of the others. Of all the troubling things about that dreary afternoon, it was Long John's obvious nervousness that seemed the most disturbing."

A turn ashore’ll hurt nobody—the boats are still in the water; you can take the gigs, and as many as please may go ashore for the afternoon.

The honest hands—and I was soon to see it proved that there were such on board—must have been very stupid fellows. Or rather, I suppose the truth was this, that all hands were disaffected by the example of the ringleaders—only some more, some less; and a few, being good fellows in the main, could neither be led nor driven any further.

The captain was too shrewd to stay visible. He quickly disappeared from view, leaving Silver to organize the shore party, and I think it was wise of him to do so. If he had stayed on deck, he couldn't have even pretended not to understand what was happening. It was completely obvious. Silver was acting as the captain, commanding a very mutinous crew. The genuinely honest sailors—and it would soon be demonstrated that some were indeed still on board—must have been quite slow-witted. Or perhaps, the reality was that all hands were influenced by the bad example of the ringleaders, some more, some less; and a few, being fundamentally decent men, could not be persuaded or forced into further wrongdoing. It's one thing to be lazy and avoid work, but quite another to seize a ship and kill a number of innocent people.",

He said the boats were ready, and whoever wished could go to land until he signaled by firing a gun half an hour before sunset. The crew, perhaps believing they'd immediately find treasure, quickly cheered up and gave a loud cheer that echoed off a distant hill and set the birds fluttering around the ship. The captain then quickly disappeared, leaving Silver in charge of arranging who would go ashore. This was probably for the best, since if the captain had stayed, he couldn't have pretended not to see what was truly happening: Silver was now leading a fiercely mutinous crew. Though there were still some honest crew members (as I would later see), they must have lacked awareness, or perhaps everyone had been influenced by the actions of the ringleaders—some to a greater extent than others. A few good men couldn't be persuaded or forced to go any further into wrongdoing. After all, there's a big difference between being lazy and avoiding work and actually plotting to seize a ship and murder innocent people."

I realized that if Silver left only six men on the ship, our loyal party on shore would be unable to capture or fight for control of the ship; and because only six remained aboard, it was equally evident that the cabin party on land had no immediate need for my help. The thought struck me at once to go ashore with them. In a flash, I had climbed over the side and concealed myself in the front section of the closest boat, which then pushed off almost instantly. No one seemed to notice me, except for the rower in the bow who simply said, \"Is that you, Jim?

I immediately decided to go ashore. In no time, I slipped down the side and hid in the front of the nearest boat, just as it headed away from the ship. Nobody seemed to notice me except the man rowing at the bow, who asked quietly if it was me and told me to keep my head down. Silver, though, saw me from another boat and called out, asking if it was me, and at that point, I started to regret my choice. The boats raced toward the shore, but the one I was in had a head start, was lighter, and had a better crew, so we reached land first.

On the far side of the open stood one of the hills, with two quaint, craggy peaks shining vividly in the sun.\nI now felt for the first time the joy of exploration. The isle was uninhabited; my shipmates I had left behind, and nothing lived in front of me but dumb brutes and fowls. I turned hither and thither among the trees. Here and there were flowering plants, unknown to me; here and there I saw snakes, and one raised his head from a ledge of rock and hissed at me with a noise not unlike the spinning of a top. Little did I suppose that he was a deadly enemy and that the noise was the famous rattle.\nThen I came to a long thicket of these oaklike trees—live, or evergreen, oaks, I heard afterwards they should be called—which grew low along the sand like brambles, the boughs curiously twisted, the foliage compact, like thatch. The thicket stretched down from the top of one of the sandy knolls, spreading and growing taller as it went, until it reached the margin of the broad, reedy fen, through which the nearest of the little rivers soaked its way into the anchorage.

Now, I found myself at the edge of an open stretch of gently rolling, sandy terrain, approximately a mile long. This area was sparsely populated with pines and many oddly twisted trees that resembled oaks in their structure but had pale leaves like willows. Beyond this open space, one of the island's hills rose up, featuring two distinct, rocky peaks that gleamed brightly under the sun. It was at this moment that I first experienced the thrill of exploring. The island seemed uninhabited; I had left my companions behind, and the only living things I saw were silent animals and birds. I wandered back and forth among the trees. Scattered around were flowering plants I didn't recognise, and occasionally, I spotted snakes. One snake lifted its head from a rock shelf and made a hissing sound at me, which reminded me of a spinning top. I had no idea at the time that it was a dangerous creature and that the sound was its well-known rattle. Next, I encountered a long, dense patch of these trees resembling oaks – later I learned they were called live or evergreen oaks. They grew low to the ground on the sand, similar to tangled bushes, with their branches strangely contorted and their leaves densely packed like a roof covering. This thicket extended downhill from the crest of a sandy hillock, broadening and increasing in height as it descended, until it reached the edge of the wide, grassy marsh. The closest small river flowed sluggishly through this marshland on its way to the harbour. The marsh was giving off vapour in the intense sunlight, and the shape of the distant Spy-glass mountain appeared distorted and shimmering through the heat haze.",

My eyes turned instinctively in that direction, and I saw a figure leap with great rapidity behind the trunk of a pine. What it was, whether bear or man or monkey, I could in no wise tell. It seemed dark and shaggy; more I knew not. But the terror of this new apparition brought me to a stand.\nI was now, it seemed, cut off upon both sides; behind me the murderers, before me this lurking nondescript. And immediately I began to prefer the dangers that I knew to those I knew not. Silver himself appeared less terrible in contrast with this creature of the woods, and I turned on my heel, and looking sharply behind me over my shoulder, began to retrace my steps in the direction of the boats.\nInstantly the figure reappeared, and making a wide circuit, began to head me off. I was tired, at any rate; but had I been as fresh as when I rose, I could see it was in vain for me to contend in speed with such an adversary. From trunk to trunk the creature flitted like a deer, running manlike on two legs, but unlike any man that I had ever seen, stooping almost double as it ran. Yet a man it was, I could no longer be in doubt about that.\nI began to recall what I had heard of cannibals. I was within an ace of calling for help. But the mere fact that he was a man, however wild, had somewhat reassured me, and my fear of Silver began to revive in proportion. I stood still, therefore, and cast about for some method of escape; and as I was so thinking, the recollection of my pistol flashed into my mind. As soon as I remembered I was not defenceless, courage glowed again in my heart and I set my face resolutely for this man of the island and walked briskly towards him.\nHe was concealed by this time behind another tree trunk; but he must have been watching me closely, for as soon as I began to move in his direction he reappeared and took a step to meet me. Then he hesitated, drew back, came forward again, and at last, to my wonder and confusion, threw himself on his knees and held out his clasped hands in supplication.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "From a part of the hillside here, which was steep and covered in stones, some gravel spilled, falling noisily and bouncing down through the trees. My eyes automatically looked that way, and I saw a shape quickly jump behind the trunk of a pine tree. I could not tell at all what it was, whether an animal or a person. It looked dark and furry or hairy; I could not tell anything more. But the sudden fear caused by this new sight made me stop where I was. I felt, it seemed, trapped on both sides; the killers were behind me, and this hidden, unknown being was ahead. And immediately, I decided I would rather face the dangers I knew than those I didn't. Even Silver seemed less frightening compared to this creature from the woods, so I turned around quickly, looking sharply over my shoulder behind me, and started walking back the way I came, towards the boats. Right away, the figure showed itself again, and going around in a wide circle, began to try and block my path. I was already tired; but even if I had been as energetic as when I woke up, I could see it would be pointless for me to try to outrun such an opponent. The creature moved from tree to tree as fast as a deer, running upright on two legs, but unlike any man I had ever seen, bending over almost completely as it ran. Yet, it was a man, there was no longer any doubt about that. I began to remember stories I had heard about cannibals. I was on the verge of shouting for help. But the simple fact that he was human, no matter how wild, had calmed me down somewhat, and my fear of Silver began to increase again in proportion. Therefore, I stood still and looked around for a way to escape; and as I was thinking this, I suddenly remembered I had my pistol. The moment I recalled I wasn't unarmed, courage returned to my heart, and I faced this man of the island determinedly and walked quickly towards him. By this time, he was hidden behind another tree trunk; but he must have been watching me closely, because as soon as I started moving towards him, he reappeared and took a step forward to meet me. Then he hesitated, stepped back, came forward again, and finally, to my surprise and confusion, he dropped to his knees and held out his hands, clasped together, as if begging.",

Instinctively, I looked over and caught a glimpse of a creature quickly jumping behind a pine tree. I couldn't tell what it was—whether it was a bear, a man, or even a monkey. All I could make out was that it looked dark and hairy. Seeing this strange figure filled me with fear, and I decided to stop where I was. It seemed like I was trapped: the murderers were behind me, and now this mysterious being lurked ahead. I realized I would rather face familiar dangers than unknown ones, and even Long John Silver seemed less scary compared to this forest stranger. So I turned around and started to head back to the boats, keeping a careful watch behind me. Almost immediately, the creature appeared again, circling around to block my path. I was already tired, and even if I had felt fresh, I knew I couldn't outrun it. The being darted from tree to tree like a deer, running upright like a man but hunched over in a way I'd never seen before. Eventually, I became certain it was a man, not an animal. I remembered stories about cannibals and almost shouted for help. However, simply knowing it was a human being calmed me a little, and my fear of Silver returned. I stopped and thought about how to escape, when I suddenly remembered my pistol. Realizing I wasn't entirely defenseless boosted my courage, so I boldly started walking towards the islander. He was hiding behind another tree, but as soon as I approached, he watched me and stepped forward a little. He seemed uncertain, stepping back and then coming forward again, before finally dropping to his knees with his hands clasped together, as if begging or pleading, which left me both surprised and confused."

His skin, everywhere it was exposed, was deeply darkened by the sun; even his lips were black, and his light-colored eyes appeared quite striking against such a dark face. Among all the destitute individuals I had ever encountered or imagined, he was the absolute epitome of raggedness. His clothes were fashioned from tattered fragments of old ship's canvas and worn sea fabric, and this unusual, pieced-together garment was held intact by a variety of dissimilar and ill-matched fastenings, such as brass buttons, small pieces of wood, and loops of tarry rope. He wore an old leather belt with a brass buckle around his waist, which was the only substantial item in his entire outfit. \"Three years!\" I exclaimed. \"Were you in a shipwreck?\" \"No, friend,\" he responded, \"I was marooned.\" I had heard the term before and understood it referred to a dreadful form of punishment quite common among pirates, where the offender is put ashore with minimal gunpowder and shot and left behind on a remote and uninhabited island.",

Well, I’ve spent plenty of nights dreaming about cheese—hot, melted cheese in particular—only to wake up and find myself still here.\" \n\n\"If I ever make it back on board, you’ll get as much cheese as you want,\" I promised him.\n\nWhile we were talking, he kept touching my jacket, running his hands over mine, inspecting my boots, and showing clear delight just to be near another person. But at what I’d just said, he suddenly became alert and a bit cunning.\n\n\"If you ever can get back on board, you say? Who’s going to stop you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Certainly not you,\" I replied.\n\n\"Exactly,\" he exclaimed. \"Now then, what’s your name, mate?\"\n\n\"Jim,\" I answered.\n\n\"Jim, Jim,\" he repeated, seeming quite happy. \"Well, Jim, I’ve lived a rough life—you’d be shocked to hear it. You wouldn’t guess I had a religious mother, just from looking at me, would you?\"\n\n\"No, not really,\" I said.\n\n\"Ah, but I did—a very devout woman. I was an obedient, religious boy once, and I could recite my catechism so quickly you couldn’t make out one word from the next. But look how it ended up for me, Jim, and it all started with tossing coins on gravestones! That’s how it began, but it went even further, just as my mother warned me—she predicted everything, that good woman! But it was fate that left me here. I’ve thought a lot during my loneliness on this island, and I’ve returned to faith. I barely touch rum now—just a tiny bit for luck if I ever get the chance. I’m determined to be good, and I can see how to do it. And Jim\"—he glanced around and lowered his voice—\"I’m wealthy.\""

I began to suspect I had found someone who could assist us, and I answered him without hesitation.\n\n“It is not Flint’s ship, and Flint is dead; but to answer you honestly, as you asked—some of Flint’s former crew are on board; unfortunately for the rest of us.”\n\n“Not a man—with a—wooden leg?” he gasped.\n\n“Silver?” I inquired.\n\n“Ah, Silver!” he exclaimed. “That was indeed his name.”\n\n“He is the cook, and also the leader of the mutiny.”\n\nHe was still holding my wrist, and at this news, he gave it a harsh twist.\n\n“If Long John sent you,” he stated, “then I am finished, and I know it.

Well, just rely on Ben Gunn—Ben Gunn is the one who can sort this out. Would you think it likely that your squire would be generous in exchange for help—considering he’s in trouble, as you mentioned?”\n\nI assured him the squire was an exceptionally generous man.\n\n“Yes, but you see,” Ben Gunn replied, “I wasn’t thinking of him just giving me a job as a gatekeeper and a uniform and such; that’s not what I’m after, Jim. What I mean is, would he be willing to pay something like a thousand pounds from money that feels like it’s already as good as mine?”\n\n“I am certain he would,” I responded. “Actually, everyone was supposed to share the treasure anyway.”\n\n“And transportation home?” he added with a very cunning look.\n\n“Why,” I exclaimed, “the squire is a true gentleman!

Oh, Jim, you’ll thank your lucky stars you were the first to find me!”\n\nAs he said this, his expression darkened, he gripped my hand tighter, and pointed a finger at me menacingly.\n\n“Now, Jim, be honest with me: that ship out there isn’t Flint’s ship, is it?” he demanded.\n\nSuddenly struck by a hopeful idea, I started thinking I might have found a friend, so I replied right away.\n\n“No, it’s not Flint’s ship, and Flint himself is dead; but, to be truthful, as you want, some of Flint’s old crew are aboard it—which is bad news for the rest of us.”\n\nHis voice trembled, “There isn’t a man with—one—leg, is there?”\n\n“You mean Silver?” I asked.\n\n“Ah, Silver!

Sometimes, he suggested, I might add that Ben Gunn occasionally thought about praying, or perhaps of his mother, assuming she was still living. But, he instructed me to stress, the majority of Gunn's time, the vast majority, was spent on something else entirely. 'And then,' he added, 'you'll give him a little pinch, just like I'm doing now,' demonstrating with another confidential squeeze. He went on to instruct me further: 'Then, you'll stand up and state clearly: Ben Gunn is a decent man,' you will say, 'and he trusts a born gentleman significantly more – mark my words, significantly more – than these so-called gentlemen of fortune, having been one of them himself.' I confessed, 'I don't understand anything you're saying.' I added, however, that wasn't the immediate problem; the main issue was figuring out how I could get back aboard the ship. 'Ah,' he acknowledged, 'yes, that's the main obstacle, for sure.' He then mentioned, 'Well, there's the boat I built myself with my own hands. I keep it hidden near the white rock. If things get really bad, we could try using that after it gets dark.' Suddenly, he exclaimed, 'Listen! What's that?' This was because, even though the sun wouldn't set for another hour or two, all the island's echoes roared in response to the sound of a cannon. 'They've started fighting!' I shouted, and urged him, 'Follow me!' Forgetting my fear, I started running towards where the ships were anchored, while the castaway, still wearing his goatskin clothes, easily and swiftly kept pace right beside me. 'To your left, left,' he guided, 'stick to your left side, mate Jim! Stay under the trees! That's where I killed my very first goat. The goats don't come down this low anymore; they all stay high up on the mountains now, afraid of Benjamin Gunn. Ah! And over there is the cemetery,' he meant, of course. 'See those burial mounds? I used to come here and pray sometimes, whenever I thought it might be around Sunday. It wasn't exactly like a church, but it felt more serious; and you'll explain, Ben Gunn was short-handed – no chaplain, not even a Bible or a flag, you see.'

And then you pinch him, just like I’ve done to you.” He pinched me again, as if we were sharing a secret. “Next,” he said, “you’ll stand up and tell him: Gunn is a good man, you’ll say, and he trusts a real gentleman much more than these gentlemen of fortune, because he used to be one himself.” “Well,” I replied, “I have no idea what you are talking about. But that doesn’t really matter—how am I supposed to get back to the ship?” “Well, that’s a problem,” he admitted. \"But I have a boat that I built myself, hidden under the white rock. If we have no other choice, we could use it after dark. Wait! What’s that?” Just then, even though the sun was still up, the island was filled with echoes that roared with the sound of a cannon. “The fighting has started!” I shouted. “Come with me.” I ran towards the anchorage, having forgotten my fear, and the man in goatskins ran lightly beside me. “Keep left, Jim! Stay under the trees! That’s where I shot my first goat. The goats don’t come here now; they all stay up in the hills, too scared of Ben Gunn. And there’s the cemetery,” he added, pointing to some mounds. “I would come here and pray occasionally, especially when I thought it might be Sunday. It wasn’t really a chapel, but it felt serious enough. And then you’ll say Ben Gunn was alone—no chaplain, not even a Bible or a flag, you’ll say.” He kept talking as I ran, not expecting any reply. After the cannon, there was a long pause before a burst of gunfire, then another silence. Suddenly, less than a quarter of a mile ahead, I saw the Union Jack waving above the trees."

With the men in the temper they were in, it seemed an even chance if we should see the lad again. We ran on deck. The pitch was bubbling in the seams; the nasty stench of the place turned me sick; if ever a man smelt fever and dysentery, it was in that abominable anchorage.

Adding to our difficult situation, Hunter arrived with the news that Jim Hawkins had secretly boarded a boat and gone ashore with the others. We didn't doubt Jim's loyalty, but we were extremely concerned for his safety. Given the crew's hostile mood, it seemed uncertain whether we would see the boy alive again. We quickly went up to the deck. The intense heat caused the tar in the seams to bubble; the foul smell of the location made me feel sick, truly suggesting a place prone to fever and dysentery. The six villains who stayed behind were complaining under a sail in the forecastle. On shore, we could see the smaller boats tied up near the river mouth, each with a man sitting in it.

We never suspected Jim of any betrayal, but we were worried about his safety, knowing how dangerous the other men were; we weren’t sure we’d ever see him again. We hurried up to the deck. The tar in the planks was bubbling, and the foul smell of the place made me feel ill—if someone were to sense an outbreak of disease, it would be here in this dreadful anchorage. The six mutineers were sitting together, complaining under a sail at the front of the ship. On shore, we could see that the boats were tied up, each with a man inside, close to where a river met the sea. One man was whistling “Lillibullero.” The tension of waiting was too much, so it was decided that Hunter and I would take the jolly-boat to shore to find out more about what was happening."

Well, on the knoll, and enclosing the spring, they had clapped a stout loghouse fit to hold two score of people on a pinch and loopholed for musketry on either side. All round this they had cleared a wide space, and then the thing was completed by a paling six feet high, without door or opening, too strong to pull down without time and labour and too open to shelter the besiegers. The people in the log-house had them in every way; they stood quiet in shelter and shot the others like partridges. All they wanted was a good watch and food; for, short of a complete surprise, they might have held the place against a regiment.\nWhat particularly took my fancy was the spring. For though we had a good enough place of it in the cabin of the Hispaniola, with plenty of arms and ammunition, and things to eat, and excellent wines, there had been one thing overlooked—we had no water. I was thinking this over when there came ringing over the island the cry of a man at the point of death. I was not new to violent death—I have served his Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland, and got a wound myself at Fontenoy—but I know my pulse went dot and carry one. “Jim Hawkins is gone,” was my first thought.\nIt is something to have been an old soldier, but more still to have been a doctor. There is no time to dilly-dally in our work. And so now I made up my mind instantly, and with no time lost returned to the shore and jumped on board the jolly-boat.",

On this knoll, enclosing the spring, they had quickly built a strong log structure capable of accommodating up to forty people if needed, fitted with openings on both sides for firing muskets. They had cleared a wide space surrounding this, and the setup was completed with a six-foot-high protective fence. This fence had no entry point, was too robust to be easily torn down without significant effort and time, and was too open to offer cover to anyone attacking. Those inside the log building held a complete advantage; they remained secure within while shooting the attackers as if they were partridges. All they required were effective surveillance and supplies; short of being taken entirely by surprise, they could have held the position against a whole regiment.",

Around this spring, they had built a sturdy loghouse strong enough to hold about forty people in a crisis, and it had loopholes on both sides for shooting muskets. They had also cleared a large area around the building, and put up a six-foot tall fence with no doorway or gap, making it too tough to break down quickly and too open for attackers to hide behind. Those inside the loghouse were in complete control: they could take cover while firing at their enemies easily. All they needed were enough guards and supplies, because unless they were completely surprised, they could have defended the place against even a whole regiment.\n\nWhat I especially liked was the presence of the spring. Even though we were comfortable enough in the cabin of the Hispaniola, well-supplied with weapons, food, and good wine, we had overlooked one thing—there was no water. I was just thinking this when the sound of a dying man suddenly echoed across the island. Although I was no stranger to violent death—having served under the Duke of Cumberland and even being wounded at Fontenoy—my heart still skipped a beat, and my first thought was, \"Jim Hawkins is dead.\"\n\nHaving been a soldier is helpful, but being a doctor is even more so.

All three of us carried heavy loads for the first trip and threw the goods over the fence. After that, Joyce stayed behind to guard the supplies—he was just one man, but he had about six muskets. Hunter and I went back to the jolly-boat and loaded up again. We kept at this without stopping until we had moved all the cargo, then the two servants stayed in the block house while I rowed as fast as I could back to the Hispaniola.\n\nAlthough it might seem reckless to risk a second trip with another boat load, it wasn't as risky as it appeared. The men on shore outnumbered us, but we had the advantage in firearms.

Five grown men, and three of them—Trelawney, Redruth, and the captain—over six feet high, was already more than she was meant to carry. Add to that the powder, pork, and bread-bags. The gunwale was lipping astern. Several times we shipped a little water, and my breeches and the tails of my coat were all soaking wet before we had gone a hundred yards.\nThe captain made us trim the boat, and we got her to lie a little more evenly. All the same, we were afraid to breathe.\nIn the second place, the ebb was now making—a strong rippling current running westward through the basin, and then south’ard and seaward down the straits by which we had entered in the morning. Even the ripples were a danger to our overloaded craft, but the worst of it was that we were swept out of our true course and away from our proper landing-place behind the point. If we let the current have its way we should come ashore beside the gigs, where the pirates might appear at any moment.\n“I cannot keep her head for the stockade, sir,” said I to the captain. I was steering, while he and Redruth, two fresh men, were at the oars. “The tide keeps washing her down. Could you pull a little stronger?”\n“Not without swamping the boat,” said he. “You must bear up, sir, if you please—bear up until you see you’re gaining.”\nI tried and found by experiment that the tide kept sweeping us westward until I had laid her head due east, or just about right angles to the way we ought to go.\n“We’ll never get ashore at this rate,” said I.\n“If it’s the only course that we can lie, sir, we must even lie it,” returned the captain. “We must keep upstream. You see, sir,” he went on, “if once we dropped to leeward of the landing-place, it’s hard to say where we should get ashore, besides the chance of being boarded by the gigs; whereas, the way we go the current must slacken, and then we can dodge back along the shore.”\n“The current’s less a’ready, sir,” said the man Gray, who was sitting in the fore-sheets; “you can ease her off a bit.”\n“Thank you, my man,” said I, quite as if nothing had happened, for we had all quietly made up our minds to treat him like one of ourselves.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The fifth journey we undertook was distinctly unlike any prior ones. To begin with, the small, seemingly inadequate boat we occupied was severely overloaded. With five grown men, three of whom—Trelawney, Redruth, and the captain—were over six feet tall, the boat already carried more than it was designed for. Adding supplies like powder, pork, and bread bags brought the boat's edge perilously close to the water level at the rear. We took on some water multiple times, leaving my trousers and the lower part of my coat completely soaked within the first hundred yards. The captain instructed us to redistribute the weight, which helped the boat sit a little more balanced, but we remained cautious, barely daring to move. Secondly, a strong outgoing tide was now active, creating a noticeable current flowing westward through the harbor and then southward towards the open sea via the channel we had used earlier. Even the slight ripples posed a risk to our overloaded vessel, but the main issue was being pushed off our intended path and away from our planned landing spot behind the point. If we let the current control us, we would land near the pirate boats, where they could appear at any moment. \"I cannot steer her towards the stockade, sir,\" I informed the captain. I was steering, while he and Redruth, both fresh, were rowing. \"The tide keeps washing her downstream. Could you put more power into your rowing?\" \"Not without sinking the boat,\" he answered. \"You must angle more into the current, sir, please—keep heading into it until you observe you're gaining ground.\" I attempted this and discovered through practice that the tide continued to push us westward unless I steered almost directly east, essentially at a right angle to the direction we needed to go. \"We'll never make it ashore at this rate,\" I commented. \"If that's the only course we can maintain, sir, then we must maintain it,\" replied the captain. \"We have to go upstream. You see, sir,\" he explained further, \"if we once drift downwind of the landing site, it's hard to tell where we would land, plus there's the risk of the pirate boats approaching; whereas, by going this way, the current is bound to weaken, and then we can maneuver back along the shore.\" \"The current feels weaker already, sir,\" remarked Gray, who was seated in the front part of the boat; \"you can ease up on the steering a bit.\" \"Thank you, my man,\" I said, speaking quite normally, as we had all silently resolved to treat him as one of our own.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "This fifth journey was not like any of the previous ones. First of all, the small boat we were using was seriously overloaded. There were five adult men aboard, three of whom—Trelawney, Redruth, and the captain—were all over six feet tall, which was already beyond what the boat was built to hold. On top of that, we had to bring along gunpowder, pork, and bags of bread. The back edge of the boat was so low that water was almost spilling in. Several times, we actually took on some water, and both my pants and coat became soaking wet before we had even rowed a hundred yards. The captain had us adjust our positions to balance the boat better, which helped a little, but we still hardly dared to move or breathe. Secondly, the ebb tide was now flowing—a strong, rippling current was pulling west through the basin and then south towards the sea, the same route we had come in by earlier that day. Even the small waves posed a threat to our overloaded boat, but the bigger problem was that the current was carrying us off our intended path and away from the landing spot behind the point. If we let the current do as it wished, we would end up landing next to the gigs, where the pirates might show up at any moment. \"I can't keep the boat headed for the stockade, sir,\" I said to the captain as I was steering and he and Redruth, who were both still strong, rowed. \"The tide keeps pushing us off course. Could you row a bit harder?\" \"Not without risking sinking us,\" he replied. \"You need to keep the boat's nose up, sir—keep trying until you see we're making headway.\" I experimented and found that the current kept pushing us to the west unless I aimed the boat directly east, almost at a right angle to the direction we needed to go. \"We'll never reach the shore at this rate,\" I said. \"If that's the only way we can go, sir, then that's the way we'll have to take,\" the captain responded. \"We must keep going upstream. You see, if we let ourselves get carried past our landing place, there's no telling where we'd end up, not to mention risking being caught by the gigs. But if we fight the current, it should get weaker eventually, and then we can get back along the shore.\" \"The current's already weaker, sir,\" said Gray, who was sitting in the front of the boat. \"You can let up a little.\" \"Thank you, my man,\" I replied, acting as though nothing unusual had happened, because we had all silently decided to accept him as one of our group."

But the worst of it was that with the course I now held we turned our broadside instead of our stern to the Hispaniola and offered a target like a barn door.\nI could hear as well as see that brandy-faced rascal Israel Hands plumping down a round-shot on the deck.\n“Who’s the best shot?” asked the captain.\n“Mr. Trelawney, out and away,” said I.\n“Mr. Trelawney, will you please pick me off one of these men, sir? Hands, if possible,” said the captain.\nTrelawney was as cool as steel. He looked to the priming of his gun.\n“Now,” cried the captain, “easy with that gun, sir, or you’ll swamp the boat.

However, we had no luck, for just as Trelawney fired, down he stooped, the ball whistled over him, and it was one of the other four who fell.\nThe cry he gave was echoed not only by his companions on board but by a great number of voices from the shore, and looking in that direction I saw the other pirates trooping out from among the trees and tumbling into their places in the boats.",

By now, we had moved sufficiently out of the main current to maintain control of the boat's direction, even with our necessary slow pace of rowing, and I was able to hold her steady on course for our objective. The significant drawback, however, was that the path we were now taking exposed our boat's side, rather than its rear, to the Hispaniola, presenting a target as large and obvious as a barn door. I could clearly see and hear that drunken scoundrel, Israel Hands, positioning a cannonball on the deck. \"Who is the best shot?\" the captain inquired. \"Mr. Trelawney, easily,\" I replied. \"Mr. Trelawney, would you kindly shoot one of those men for me, sir? Hands, if you can,\" said the captain. Trelawney remained incredibly composed. He checked the priming powder of his gun. \"Now,\" the captain shouted, \"handle that gun carefully, sir, or you'll swamp us! Everyone get ready to balance the boat when he takes aim.\" The squire lifted his gun, we stopped rowing, and we all leaned towards the opposite side to keep the boat steady. This maneuver was executed so perfectly that not a single drop of water came aboard. By this time, the pirates had swung their swivel gun around, and Hands, standing at the muzzle with the rammer, was consequently the most exposed target. However, fortune was not with us; just as Trelawney fired, Hands ducked low. The bullet whizzed over him, and instead, it was one of the other four men who fell. The cry he let out was echoed not only by his companions on the ship but also by a large number of voices from the shore.

However, this meant that our side, rather than the stern, faced the Hispaniola, making us a much easier target. I could both see and hear Israel Hands, recognizable by his red face, loading a cannonball onto the deck. \n\nThe captain asked who among us was the best marksman. I replied that Mr. Trelawney was by far the best. The captain then requested that Mr. Trelawney try to shoot one of the men on deck—preferably Hands. \n\nMr. Trelawney remained perfectly composed as he checked his gun. The captain cautioned him to be careful so as not to upset the boat and instructed everyone to prepare to balance it when Mr. Trelawney took aim. As Mr. Trelawney got ready and stopped rowing, we all leaned over in the opposite direction for balance, managing to avoid taking on any water.\n\nMeanwhile, the crew of the Hispaniola had turned their cannon on its swivel to aim at us, and Hands, who was standing at the mouth of the cannon with the rammer, became especially exposed. Unfortunately, when Mr. Trelawney fired, Hands bent down at the last moment and the shot missed him, hitting one of the other four instead.\n\nThe wounded man’s cry was taken up not only by his shipmates but echoed by many voices on shore as well. When I looked, I saw more pirates coming out from the trees and hurrying into boats to join the fight."

Give him your gun; his own is no good.\" They swapped weapons, and Trelawney, remaining calm and collected as he had been since the trouble started, paused briefly to ensure everything was prepared for use. At the same time, seeing that Gray was unarmed, I gave him my cutlass. It was heartening to see him moisten his hand, furrow his brow, and make the blade whistle through the air. It was evident from his stance that our new man was highly capable and skilled. Forty paces further on, we reached the edge of the trees and saw the stockade before us. We arrived at the enclosure roughly in the middle of the southern side, and almost simultaneously, seven mutineers, with Job Anderson, the boatswain, leading them, appeared shouting loudly at the southwestern corner. They stopped as if caught off guard, and before they recovered, the squire and I, as well as Hunter and Joyce from the blockhouse, had time to fire. The four shots came in a somewhat spread-out burst, but they were effective: one of the enemies actually dropped, and the others immediately turned and ran back into the woods. After reloading, we walked down the outside of the palisade to examine the fallen enemy. He was completely dead, having been shot directly through the heart.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "We hurried as quickly as we could through the strip of forest separating us from the stockade, the shouts of the pirates growing louder with each step. Soon, their running footsteps and the snapping branches they pushed through told us they were very close. I realized we were sure to have a real fight, and checked that my weapon was ready to fire.\n\nI said, “Captain, Trelawney is the best shot. Give him your gun; his is no use.” The Captain and Trelawney swapped weapons, and Trelawney—as calm as ever—paused briefly to make sure the gun was ready. Noticing that Gray had no weapon, I gave him my cutlass. Seeing him confidently ready it, we all felt reassured—Gray clearly would pull his weight.\n\nForty steps later we left the woods and reached the stockade, hitting the southern side about halfway along. At that instant, seven mutineers, led by Job Anderson, appeared at the southwest corner. They stopped, surprised, giving us, along with Hunter and Joyce from the blockhouse, the chance to shoot. We fired four scattered shots, wounding one and sending the others running back into the trees without delay.\n\nAfter reloading, we walked around the outside of the fortification to check on the man we’d shot. He was dead, a shot straight through his heart."

Then, after climbing onto the roof, he personally attached and raised the flag. This action seemed to bring him great relief. He went back inside the log-house and started inventorying the supplies as if nothing else mattered. However, he kept an eye on the area where Tom had fallen.

'Dr. Livesey,' he asked, 'in how many weeks do you and the squire expect the relief ship?' I informed him it would be months, not weeks, explaining that Blandly was instructed to send assistance only if we hadn't returned by the end of August, not sooner.

Silver was sitting at the back, clearly in charge, and each man now had a musket, apparently from some hidden supply of their own. The captain returned to writing in his log, which began: Alexander Smollett, captain; David Livesey, ship's doctor; Abraham Gray, carpenter's mate; John Trelawney, owner; John Hunter and Richard Joyce, owner's servants, landsmen—are all who remain loyal of the crew—with provisions for ten days at reduced rations, landed today and raised the British flag over the log-house on Treasure Island. Thomas Redruth, owner's servant and landsman, was killed by the mutineers; James Hawkins, cabin-boy— At the same moment, I found myself worrying about poor Jim Hawkins' fate."

Away, near the mouth of the river, a great fire was glowing among the trees, and between that point and the ship one of the gigs kept coming and going, the men, whom I had seen so gloomy, shouting at the oars like children.

Men were busy destroying something with axes on the beach close to the stockade—which I later learned was the damaged jolly-boat. Further off, near the river's entrance, a large fire was burning among the trees, and between that spot and the ship, one of the smaller boats, a gig, was repeatedly travelling back and forth, with the men I had previously seen looking so unhappy now yelling as they rowed, like children. However, there was a tone in their voices that suggested they had been drinking rum. Eventually, I decided it was time to head back towards the stockade. I was situated quite a distance along the low, sandy strip of land that borders the anchorage to the east and connects to Skeleton Island at low tide. As I stood up, I noticed, a bit further along the spit and poking out from some low bushes, a single rock. It was quite tall and unusually white in colour.

Farther away, near where the river met the sea, a large fire blazed among the trees, and between the fire and the ship, one of the small boats moved back and forth. The men on board, who had seemed so downcast earlier, were now shouting loudly as they rowed, sounding as if they had been drinking rum.

But our best hope, it was decided, was to kill off the buccaneers until they either hauled down their flag or ran away with the Hispaniola. From nineteen they were already reduced to fifteen, two others were wounded, and one at least—the man shot beside the gun—severely wounded, if he were not dead. Every time we had a crack at them, we were to take it, saving our own lives, with the extremest care. And besides that, we had two able allies—rum and the climate.\nAs for the first, though we were about half a mile away, we could hear them roaring and singing late into the night; and as for the second, the doctor staked his wig that, camped where they were in the marsh and unprovided with remedies, the half of them would be on their backs before a week.\n“So,” he added, “if we are not all shot down first they’ll be glad to be packing in the schooner.

It seemed they were completely perplexed about what to do, as our supplies were so depleted that starvation would have certainly forced us to surrender long before any help could arrive. However, it was decided that our best hope lay in eliminating the pirates until they either surrendered or escaped using the Hispaniola. Their original number of nineteen was already down to fifteen, with two others wounded and at least one individual—the one shot near the cannon—seriously injured, if not dead. We were instructed to seize every opportunity to shoot at them with the utmost caution, prioritizing our own safety. Furthermore, we had two powerful allies: alcohol and the local climate. Concerning the first, even from about half a mile away, we could hear them shouting and singing late into the night; as for the second, the doctor was utterly convinced that, camped in the marsh without access to remedies, half of them would be disabled within seven days. \"So,\" he added, \"unless we are all shot first, they will probably be eager to get back onto the schooner.

After our meal of pork and a strong glass of brandy grog each, the three leaders moved off to a corner to talk about our situation. They were unsure how to proceed, as our supplies were so low that we would starve before getting rescued. The only real plan seemed to be to reduce the number of buccaneers until they gave up or sailed away with the Hispaniola. Their numbers had already dropped from nineteen to fifteen, with two wounded and one—shot by the gun—badly hurt if not dead. We were to seize every chance to attack safely, always being extremely cautious. Besides, we had two things on our side: the pirates’ own drinking and the climate. Even though they were half a mile away, we could hear them shouting and singing late into the night. The doctor bet that, because they were camped in the marsh without proper medicine, half of them would be sick in a week. ‘So,’ he said, ‘unless we all get shot first, they’ll probably end up leaving on the schooner, since they can always go back to being pirates.’ ‘It’s the first ship I’ve ever lost,’ Captain Smollett said."

The sky was bright and cloudless overhead, and the tops of the trees shone rosily in the sun. But where Silver stood with his lieutenant, all was still in shadow, and they waded knee-deep in a low white vapour that had crawled during the night out of the morass. The chill and the vapour taken together told a poor tale of the island. It was plainly a damp, feverish, unhealthy spot.\n“Keep indoors, men,” said the captain. “Ten to one this is a trick.”\nThen he hailed the buccaneer.\n“Who goes? Stand, or we fire.”\n“Flag of truce,” cried Silver.\nThe captain was in the porch, keeping himself carefully out of the way of a treacherous shot, should any be intended. He turned and spoke to us, “Doctor’s watch on the lookout. Dr. Livesey take the north side, if you please; Jim, the east; Gray, west. The watch below, all hands to load muskets. Lively, men, and careful.”\nAnd then he turned again to the mutineers.\n“And what do you want with your flag of truce?” he cried.\nThis time it was the other man who replied.\n“Cap’n Silver, sir, to come on board and make terms,” he shouted.\n“Cap’n Silver! Don’t know him. Who’s he?” cried the captain. And we could hear him adding to himself, “Cap’n, is it? My heart, and here’s promotion!”\nLong John answered for himself. “Me, sir. These poor lads have chosen me cap’n, after your desertion, sir”—laying a particular emphasis upon the word “desertion.” “We’re willing to submit, if we can come to terms, and no bones about it. All I ask is your word, Cap’n Smollett, to let me safe and sound out of this here stockade, and one minute to get out o’ shot before a gun is fired.”\n“My man,” said Captain Smollett, “I have not the slightest desire to talk to you. If you wish to talk to me, you can come, that’s all. If there’s any treachery, it’ll be on your side, and the Lord help you.”\n“That’s enough, Cap’n,” shouted Long John cheerily. “A word from you’s enough. I know a gentleman, and you may lay to that.”\nWe could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting to hold Silver back. Nor was that wonderful, seeing how cavalier had been the captain’s answer. But Silver laughed at him aloud and slapped him on the back as if the idea of alarm had been absurd. Then he advanced to the stockade, threw over his crutch, got a leg up, and with great vigour and skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the other side.\nI will confess that I was far too much taken up with what was going on to be of the slightest use as sentry; indeed, I had already deserted my eastern loophole and crept up behind the captain, who had now seated himself on the threshold, with his elbows on his knees, his head in his hands, and his eyes fixed on the water as it bubbled out of the old iron kettle in the sand. He was whistling “Come, Lasses and Lads.”",

It was still quite early and extremely cold, the most piercing chill I've ever felt outside. The sky was clear and sunny above, and the tops of the trees glowed pink in the light. However, where Silver and his companion stood, it was still shaded, and they were wading knee-deep in a thick, white fog that had drifted from the swamp during the night. This cold and mist together suggested the island was a damp, sickly, and unhealthy place.\n\nCaptain Smollett instructed his men to stay inside, believing it was likely a trick. He then called out to the approaching pirates, demanding they stop or be fired upon. Silver announced they were under a flag of truce. The captain, positioning himself safely back from the entrance, ordered the lookouts to their posts: Dr. Livesey covering the north, me (Jim) the east, and Gray the west. The rest of the crew were told to quickly and carefully load their muskets. He then addressed the mutineers again, asking the reason for their truce flag.\n\nSilver's companion replied, shouting that Captain Silver wished to enter and negotiate terms. \"'Captain' Silver!\" Captain Smollett exclaimed, pretending not to know him. \"Who's that?\" We heard him mutter to himself, \"'Captain,' is it? Well, look at that for a rise!\" Long John answered for himself, saying, \"That's me, sir. These poor fellows have made me captain after you abandoned us,\" putting special emphasis on the word \"abandoned.\" He stated, \"We're ready to surrender if we can agree on terms, simple as that. All I need is your promise, Captain Smollett, to let me leave this stockade safely and a minute's head start before any shooting begins.\" \n\nCaptain Smollett responded, \"I have no particular wish to speak with you. If you want to talk, you can come in, that's all. If there's any deceit involved, it will be on your part, and may God help you.\" Long John replied cheerfully, \"That's all I need, Captain. Your word is enough. I know a gentleman when I see one, you can count on that.\" We saw the man with the flag trying to hold Silver back, which was understandable given the captain's bluntness. But Silver just laughed loudly, slapped him on the back as if the idea of caution was silly, and approached the stockade. He threw his crutch over, lifted a leg, and with impressive energy and skill, climbed over the fence and dropped safely inside.\n\nI must confess I was so captivated by what was happening that I was completely useless as a guard. I had already left my spot at the eastern loophole and crept up behind the captain, who had sat down on the doorstep. He was leaning forward with his elbows on his knees, his head in his hands, watching the water bubble in the old iron kettle in the sand and whistling the tune \"Come, Lasses and Lads.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Sure enough, just outside the stockade stood two men—one holding up a white flag, while the other, none other than Silver himself, stood beside him calmly. It was still quite early in the day, and colder than I ever recalled—so cold it seemed to cut right into your bones. The sky was clear and bright above us, and the treetops glowed pink in the sunlight. But down where Silver and his companion stood, shadow still lingered, and they were knee-deep in a thick, white mist that had crept out from the swamp overnight. The combination of chill and fog spoke poorly of the island—it was clearly damp, unhealthy, and prone to fever. \"Stay inside, men,\" warned the captain. \"Odds are this is a trick.\" Then he called out to the men outside. \"Who’s there? Stand still, or we’ll shoot.\" \"Flag of truce!\" Silver called back. The captain, safely sheltered by the porch to avoid any chance of a treacherous shot, turned to us and gave orders: \"Doctor’s group, stay alert. Dr. Livesey, cover the north, Jim, the east, Gray, the west. The rest of you, reload the muskets. Quickly but carefully.\" Then he addressed the men outside once more. \"What do you want with your flag of truce?\" he demanded. This time, the other man answered. \"Captain Silver, sir, wants to come and discuss terms.\" \"Captain Silver? Never heard of him,\" the captain retorted, with a hint of mockery, muttering under his breath about Silver's \"promotion.\" Silver replied for himself, \"That’s me, sir. The lads picked me as captain after you deserted us.\" He stressed the word \"desertion.\" \"We’re willing to negotiate if we can agree, fair and square. All I ask is your word, Captain Smollett, that I can leave the stockade safely with a minute’s start before anyone fires.\" Captain Smollett replied, \"I have no interest in talking to you. If you want to talk, you can come here—that’s all. If any foul play happens, it’ll be on your side, and God help you.\" \"That’ll do, Captain,\" Silver called out cheerfully. \"A word from you is enough—I know a gentleman when I see one.\" We could see the man carrying the white flag trying to restrain Silver, understandably concerned by the captain’s dismissive answer. But Silver laughed, slapped his companion on the back, and seemed completely unconcerned. He then made his way to the stockade, tossed his crutch over, climbed up with impressive skill, and dropped down safely inside. I must admit, I was so absorbed in the scene that I neglected my post as sentry and had already left my spot to creep closer to the captain, who now sat on the threshold, elbows on his knees, head in his hands, eyes following the water trickling from the old iron kettle in the sand, whistling \"Come, Lasses and Lads.\""

He was tricked out in his best; an immense blue coat, thick with brass buttons, hung as low as to his knees, and a fine laced hat was set on the back of his head.\n“Here you are, my man,” said the captain, raising his head. “You had better sit down.”\n“You ain’t a-going to let me inside, Cap’n?” complained Long John. “It’s a main cold morning, to be sure, sir, to sit outside upon the sand.”\n“Why, Silver,” said the captain, “if you had pleased to be an honest man, you might have been sitting in your galley. It’s your own doing.

Silver was dressed in his finest clothes: a large blue coat adorned with numerous brass buttons hung down to his knees, and a decorative hat with lace was perched on the back of his head. The captain, lifting his head, said, “Here you are. You’d best find a place to sit.” Long John complained, “Captain, you’re not going to let me come inside? It’s certainly a very cold morning, sir, to be sitting out here on the sand.” “Why, Silver,” the captain replied sharply, “if you had chosen to be an honest man, you could have been sitting comfortably in your galley. This is the result of your choices. You are either my ship’s cook, in which case you were treated well, or you are ‘Captain’ Silver, a common mutineer and pirate, and for that, you deserve to hang!” “Alright, Captain,” the sea-cook responded, sitting down on the sand as he was told. “You’ll just have to help me get up again later, that’s all. You’ve got a rather nice little spot here. Oh, there’s Jim! Good morning, Jim. Doctor, my regards.

And I’ll not deny neither but what some of my people was shook—maybe all was shook; maybe I was shook myself; maybe that’s why I’m here for terms. But you mark me, Cap’n, it won’t do twice, by thunder! We’ll have to do sentry-go and ease off a point or so on the rum. Maybe you think we were all a sheet in the wind’s eye. But I’ll tell you I was sober; I was on’y dog tired; and if I’d awoke a second sooner, I’d ’a caught you at the act, I would. He wasn’t dead when I got round to him, not he.”\n“Well?” says Captain Smollett as cool as can be.\nAll that Silver said was a riddle to him, but you would never have guessed it from his tone. As for me, I began to have an inkling. Ben Gunn’s last words came back to my mind. I began to suppose that he had paid the buccaneers a visit while they all lay drunk together round their fire, and I reckoned up with glee that we had only fourteen enemies to deal with.\n“Well, here it is,” said Silver. “We want that treasure, and we’ll have it—that’s our point! You would just as soon save your lives, I reckon; and that’s yours. You have a chart, haven’t you?”\n“That’s as may be,” replied the captain.\n“Oh, well, you have, I know that,” returned Long John. “You needn’t be so husky with a man; there ain’t a particle of service in that, and you may lay to it. What I mean is, we want your chart. Now, I never meant you no harm, myself.”\n“That won’t do with me, my man,” interrupted the captain. “We know exactly what you meant to do, and we don’t care, for now, you see, you can’t do it.”\nAnd the captain looked at him calmly and proceeded to fill a pipe.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“You’re right, Captain Smollett,” Silver responded. “Certainly, duty is duty. Now listen, that was a clever move you pulled last night. I admit it was a good tactic. Some of you are quite skilled with a handspike. And I won't deny that some of my men were shaken—perhaps all of them; maybe even I was shaken; perhaps that’s why I’m here to discuss terms. But mark my words, Captain, it won’t succeed a second time, by thunder! We’ll need to post sentries and cut back on the rum a bit. Maybe you think we were all completely drunk. But I assure you, I was sober; I was just exhausted; and if I had woken up a second sooner, I would have caught you in the act, I would have. He wasn’t dead when I reached him, not at all.”\n“Yes?” Captain Smollett replied, utterly composed.\nEverything Silver said was unclear to him, but you wouldn’t have guessed it from his tone. As for me, I started to get an idea. Ben Gunn’s final words came back to me. I began to suspect that he had visited the pirates while they were all lying drunk around their fire, and I realized with satisfaction that we now only had fourteen adversaries to contend with.\n“All right, here’s the situation,” Silver said. “We want that treasure, and we will have it—that’s our objective! I assume you’d rather save your lives, and that’s yours. You have a map, don’t you?”\n“That remains to be seen,” the captain answered.\n“Oh, well, yes, you do, I know that,” Long John retorted. “There’s no need to be difficult; it’s completely pointless, and you can rely on that. What I mean is, we need your map. Look, I personally never intended to hurt you initially.”\n“That explanation won’t work with me, my friend,” the captain interrupted. “We know exactly what you intended to do, and we don’t care, because now, you see, you are unable to do it.”\nAnd the captain looked at him calmly as he began filling a pipe.",

Now listen, your actions last night were well planned, and I won’t pretend otherwise. Some of your men did a fine job with those handspikes. And I’ll admit, some of my men were rattled—maybe all of them; maybe I was, too; maybe that’s why I’m here to talk about a deal. But let me warn you, Captain, it won’t work a second time, by thunder! We’ll have guards posted now, and we’ll cut back on the rum. Perhaps you think we were all drunk as lords, but I was sober; just completely worn out, and if I’d woken a moment sooner, I would’ve caught you in the act. The man wasn’t dead when I got there, not at all.\"\n\nCaptain Smollett, remaining perfectly calm, simply said, \"Well?\"\n\nSilver’s words were confusing to the captain, but his voice didn’t betray any uncertainty. For my part, I started to guess at the truth. Ben Gunn’s last words echoed in my mind, and I suspected that he had visited the pirates as they lay around their fire, drunk, and I was happy to realize we now had only fourteen enemies left.\n\n\"Here’s the situation,\" Silver said. \"We want that treasure, and we’ll have it—that’s what we’re after! I imagine you want to save your lives, and that’s your aim. You have the map, don’t you?\"\n\n\"That may be so,\" the captain answered.\n\n\"Oh, you have it, I know that,\" Long John replied. \"No use pretending otherwise; there’s no benefit, and you can be sure of that. What I’m saying is, we want your map. I never meant you any harm, myself.\"\n\n\"That won’t work on me, man,\" the captain cut in. \"We know very well what you intended, and it doesn’t matter now, because you’re in no position to do it.\"\n\nWith that, the captain calmly lit his pipe."

Noticing the captain was about to smoke his pipe, Silver decided to do the same.

If that was the manner in which you served at Fontenoy, sir, you would have been better off remaining in your bunk.\" The Doctor's group had all returned to their firing positions, the others were occupied with loading additional muskets, and everyone, you can be certain, was blushing and felt thoroughly chastened.

Although outnumbered, the captain reminded us that our defensive position and discipline gave us an advantage, and that victory was possible if we held together.

As soon as the sun had climbed above our girdle of trees, it fell with all its force upon the clearing and drank up the vapours at a draught. Soon the sand was baking and the resin melting in the logs of the block house. Jackets and coats were flung aside, shirts thrown open at the neck and rolled up to the shoulders; and we stood there, each at his post, in a fever of heat and anxiety.\nAn hour passed away.\n“Hang them!” said the captain. “This is as dull as the doldrums. Gray, whistle for a wind.”\nAnd just at that moment came the first news of the attack.\n“If you please, sir,” said Joyce, “if I see anyone, am I to fire?”\n“I told you so!” cried the captain.\n“Thank you, sir,” returned Joyce with the same quiet civility.\nNothing followed for a time, but the remark had set us all on the alert, straining ears and eyes—the musketeers with their pieces balanced in their hands, the captain out in the middle of the block house with his mouth very tight and a frown on his face.\nSo some seconds passed, till suddenly Joyce whipped up his musket and fired. The report had scarcely died away ere it was repeated and repeated from without in a scattering volley, shot behind shot, like a string of geese, from every side of the enclosure. Several bullets struck the log-house, but not one entered; and as the smoke cleared away and vanished, the stockade and the woods around it looked as quiet and empty as before. Not a bough waved, not the gleam of a musket-barrel betrayed the presence of our foes.\n“Did you hit your man?” asked the captain.\n“No, sir,” replied Joyce. “I believe not, sir.”\n“Next best thing to tell the truth,” muttered Captain Smollett. “Load his gun, Hawkins. How many should say there were on your side, doctor?”\n“I know precisely,” said Dr. Livesey. “Three shots were fired on this side. I saw the three flashes—two close together—one farther to the west.”\n“Three!” repeated the captain. “And how many on yours, Mr. Trelawney?”\nBut this was not so easily answered. There had come many from the north—seven by the squire’s computation, eight or nine according to Gray. From the east and west only a single shot had been fired. It was plain, therefore, that the attack would be developed from the north and that on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of hostilities. But Captain Smollett made no change in his arrangements. If the mutineers succeeded in crossing the stockade, he argued, they would take possession of any unprotected loophole and shoot us down like rats in our own stronghold.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "As the captain had mentioned, the cold morning had passed. When the sun climbed above the encircling trees, its full strength hit the clearing, evaporating the moisture instantly. Soon, the sand was hot, and the resin in the blockhouse logs began to melt. We discarded our jackets and coats, loosened our shirts at the neck, and rolled up the sleeves to our shoulders. We remained at our stations, feeling both the intense heat and considerable anxiety. An hour went by. \"Damn them!\" the captain exclaimed. \"This is as boring as calm seas. Gray, try whistling for some wind.\" At that exact moment, we received the first indication of the attack. \"Begging your pardon, sir,\" said Joyce, \"if I see anyone, should I open fire?\" \"I already told you that!\" the captain exclaimed. \"Thank you, sir,\" Joyce replied with his usual calm politeness. For a moment, nothing else happened, but the question had put us all on high alert, straining our senses. The musketeers held their guns ready, and the captain stood in the middle of the blockhouse with a determined, frowning expression. This continued for several seconds until Joyce suddenly raised his musket and fired. The sound of his shot had barely faded when it was answered repeatedly from outside in a scattered volley, shots following one another like a line of geese, coming from every side of the fortified area. Several bullets struck the blockhouse logs but none penetrated. As the smoke cleared and vanished, the stockade and the surrounding woods appeared as calm and empty as before. No branch moved, no glint of a musket barrel revealed our enemies' presence. \"Did you hit your target?\" the captain asked. \"No, sir,\" replied Joyce. \"I don't believe so, sir.\" \"Telling the truth is the next best thing,\" Captain Smollett mumbled. \"Hawkins, load his weapon. Doctor, how many men would you say were on your side?\" \"I know exactly,\" Dr. Livesey said. \"Three shots were fired from this direction. I saw the three flashes—two close together, one further west.\" \"Three!\" the captain repeated. \"And how many on yours, Mr. Trelawney?\" Answering this was more difficult. Many shots came from the north—seven by the squire's count, eight or nine according to Gray. Only one shot came from the east and west respectively. It was therefore evident that the main assault would come from the north, and the activity on the other three sides was merely a distraction. However, Captain Smollett did not alter his defensive arrangements. He reasoned that if the mutineers succeeded in climbing over the stockade, they would take control of any unprotected firing points and shoot them down like trapped animals within their own fortification.",

An hour ticked by.\n\n\"Curse them! This is as boring as being stuck in the doldrums,\" the captain complained. \"Gray, give us a whistle to call up a breeze.\"\n\nRight then, we received the first warning of attack.\n\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" Joyce asked, \"should I fire if I see anyone?\"\n\n\"Absolutely,\" the captain replied.\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" Joyce responded politely.\n\nFor several moments, nothing else happened, but Joyce's question made us all extra vigilant. We strained our eyes and ears; the men held their muskets ready; the captain stood in the middle, lips pressed tight and brow furrowed in concern.\n\nAfter a few tense seconds, Joyce suddenly raised his musket and fired. The echo from his shot was quickly followed by a scattered volley from outside—shots fired in succession from all around the fort. Several bullets struck the block house, but none penetrated, and soon the smoke cleared, revealing the woods and palisades just as quiet as before, with no visible sign of our attackers.\n\n\"Did you hit anyone?\" the captain asked.\n\n\"I don't think so, sir,\" Joyce answered.\n\n\"At least you're honest,\" Captain Smollett muttered. \"Hawkins, reload his musket. How many fired from your side, doctor?\"\n\n\"Exactly three,\" Dr. Livesey replied. \"I saw three muzzle flashes—two nearby and one further west.\"\n\n\"Three shots,\" repeated the captain. \"How about your side, Mr. Trelawney?\"\n\nThat was harder to determine. According to the squire, seven shots came from the north; Gray thought there were eight or nine. Only a single shot was fired from both the east and the west. This made it clear that the main attack would come from the north, while the other sides would only see minor hostilities. Captain Smollett kept his defenses as they were, reasoning that if any mutineers managed to breach the stockade, they could quickly take over any unprotected opening and mow us down within our own defenses."

Meanwhile a third, running unharmed all around the house, appeared suddenly in the doorway and fell with his cutlass on the doctor.\nOur position was utterly reversed. A moment since we were firing, under cover, at an exposed enemy; now it was we who lay uncovered and could not return a blow.\nThe log-house was full of smoke, to which we owed our comparative safety. Cries and confusion, the flashes and reports of pistol-shots, and one loud groan rang in my ears.\n“Out, lads, out, and fight ’em in the open! Cutlasses!” cried the captain.\nI snatched a cutlass from the pile, and someone, at the same time snatching another, gave me a cut across the knuckles which I hardly felt. I dashed out of the door into the clear sunlight. Someone was close behind, I knew not whom. Right in front, the doctor was pursuing his assailant down the hill, and just as my eyes fell upon him, beat down his guard and sent him sprawling on his back with a great slash across the face.\n“Round the house, lads! Round the house!” cried the captain; and even in the hurly-burly, I perceived a change in his voice.\nMechanically, I obeyed, turned eastwards, and with my cutlass raised, ran round the corner of the house. Next moment I was face to face with Anderson. He roared aloud, and his hanger went up above his head, flashing in the sunlight. I had not time to be afraid, but as the blow still hung impending, leaped in a trice upon one side, and missing my foot in the soft sand, rolled headlong down the slope.\nWhen I had first sallied from the door, the other mutineers had been already swarming up the palisade to make an end of us. One man, in a red night-cap, with his cutlass in his mouth, had even got upon the top and thrown a leg across. Well, so short had been the interval that when I found my feet again all was in the same posture, the fellow with the red night-cap still half-way over, another still just showing his head above the top of the stockade. And yet, in this breath of time, the fight was over and the victory was ours.\nGray, following close behind me, had cut down the big boatswain ere he had time to recover from his last blow. Another had been shot at a loophole in the very act of firing into the house and now lay in agony, the pistol still smoking in his hand. A third, as I had seen, the doctor had disposed of at a blow. Of the four who had scaled the palisade, one only remained unaccounted for, and he, having left his cutlass on the field, was now clambering out again with the fear of death upon him.",

At that exact moment, another pirate seized Hunter’s rifle by the end of the barrel, ripped it from his grasp, yanked it through the narrow opening, and with a single devastating blow, knocked the poor man out cold onto the floor. Meanwhile, a third pirate, who had run unseen around the entire building, suddenly appeared in the doorway and attacked the doctor with his cutlass. Our situation was completely reversed. Just moments before, we were safely firing from cover at an exposed enemy; now we were the ones unprotected and unable to strike back. The log structure was filled with smoke, which ironically offered us some relative safety. Shouts, chaos, the flashes and bangs of pistols, and one loud groan echoed in my ears. “Outside, men, outside, and face them in the open! Swords!” the captain roared. I grabbed a cutlass from the stack, and someone else, snatching another sword at the same instant, gave me a nick across my knuckles that I scarcely felt. I burst out the door into the bright sunshine. Someone followed close behind, I didn’t know who. Directly ahead, the doctor was chasing his attacker down the slope, and just as I caught sight of him, he beat down the man’s defense and sent him falling backward with a significant cut across his face. “Around the building, men! Around the building!” the captain cried, and even amidst the frantic rush, I noticed a shift in his voice. Automatically, I obeyed, turning eastward, and with my cutlass raised, I ran around the corner of the house. The next instant, I was face to face with Anderson. He let out a loud roar, and his curved sword rose above his head, gleaming in the sunlight. I had no time to feel fear, but as the blow was still about to descend, I leaped sideways in a flash and, losing my balance in the soft sand, tumbled headfirst down the incline. When I had first rushed out of the doorway, the remaining mutineers were already swarming up the stockade wall to finish us off. One man, wearing a red nightcap and holding his cutlass in his mouth, had even reached the top and was swinging a leg over. Well, the time that passed was so brief that when I regained my footing, the situation was unchanged – the man in the red nightcap still halfway over, another’s head just visible above the top of the fence. And yet, in this mere instant, the fight was over, and victory was ours. Gray, who had followed directly behind me, had cut down the large boatswain before he had time to recover from his last effort. Another had been shot through a loophole precisely as he was firing into the house and now lay in agony, the pistol still smoking in his hand. A third, as I had seen, the doctor had quickly defeated with a single blow. Of the four who had climbed the stockade, only one remained unaccounted for, and he, having abandoned his weapon on the ground, was now scrambling back down again, terrified of death.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"Attack them, everyone—everyone to arms!\" he shouted powerfully. At the same instant, another pirate grabbed Hunter's musket by the barrel, yanked it out of his grip, pulled it through the gunport, and knocked poor Hunter unconscious with a single blow. At that time, a third pirate, unharmed as he circled the house, suddenly appeared in the doorway and attacked the doctor with his sword. Our fortunes had completely turned. Moments earlier, we were shooting from protection at exposed enemies; now we were the ones in the open, unable to retaliate. The inside of the cabin was thick with smoke, which somewhat protected us. I heard shouts and chaos, gunfire flashes and reports, and a deep groan. \"Outside, boys, out! Let’s fight them in the open with cutlasses!\" yelled the captain. I grabbed a cutlass from a pile, and as another person did the same, I received a shallow cut across my knuckles, though I barely noticed. I ran outside into bright sunshine, someone close behind me—though I didn’t know who. Ahead, the doctor was chasing his attacker downhill, and right before my eyes, he broke through the man’s guard and struck him across the face, sending him tumbling back. \"Around the house! Circle the house!\" the captain called, and even amid the chaos, I noticed something new in his voice. Acting automatically, I turned east, cutlass held high, and raced around the house corner. Suddenly, Anderson stood in front of me. He shouted fiercely, raising his sword in the sunlight. I didn’t have time to be frightened, but as the blow hovered, I dodged quickly to the side, slipped in the soft sand, and tumbled down the slope. When I first rushed out the door, the other mutineers were already climbing the fence to attack us. One, wearing a red nightcap and holding a cutlass in his mouth, had reached the top and was throwing a leg over. The moment had been so brief that, when I regained my feet, everything was nearly unchanged—the man in the red cap was still half over, another was just showing his head above the fence. Yet, within this fleeting moment, the fight had ended and we had triumphed. Gray, right behind me, had struck down the large boatswain before he could recover from his last attack. Another was shot while firing through a loophole and now lay wounded, his pistol still smoking. The doctor had taken care of a third with a single blow. Of the four men who climbed the fence, only one was left unaccounted for; abandoning his cutlass, he was hastily escaping, overcome by terror.\""

Anderson’s ball—for it was Job that shot him first—had broken his shoulder-blade and touched the lung, not badly; the second had only torn and displaced some muscles in the calf. He was sure to recover, the doctor said, but in the meantime, and for weeks to come, he must not walk nor move his arm, nor so much as speak when he could help it.\nMy own accidental cut across the knuckles was a flea-bite.

Despite the potential danger, the Squire and I prepared food outside, yet even there, we were distressed by the loud moans of the doctor's patients, making it difficult to focus on our task.  Of the eight men wounded in the conflict, only three were still alive: the pirate shot at the loophole, Hunter, and Captain Smollett. However, the first two were effectively doomed; the pirate died while the doctor was operating, and despite our efforts, Hunter never regained consciousness. He stayed alive all day, breathing heavily like the old buccaneer at home during his seizure, but his chest bones were crushed and his skull fractured from the fall. He passed away quietly sometime that night.  Captain Smollett's injuries, though severe, were not life-threatening, as no vital organs were critically damaged. Anderson's shot (Job had been the first to wound him) had broken his shoulder blade and slightly affected his lung; the second wound simply tore and displaced some muscles in his calf. The doctor confirmed he would recover but stressed he must not walk, move his arm, or speak unnecessarily for several weeks. My own cut on my knuckles was insignificant by comparison. Doctor Livesey bandaged it and playfully tugged my ears as well.",

Of the eight men hit during the fight, only three were still alive: a pirate who’d been shot at the loophole, Hunter, and Captain Smollett. But the pirate and Hunter were not expected to survive. The pirate died while the doctor operated, and although we tried to help Hunter, he never woke up, eventually passing away quietly during the night after spending the day breathing heavily due to his crushed chest and fractured skull. The captain, on the other hand, was badly hurt but not in mortal danger. The bullet from Anderson had broken his shoulder blade and grazed his lung, but not seriously, and another shot only injured his leg muscles. The doctor assured us he’d recover, but he needed complete rest for weeks, with no walking, moving his arm, or unnecessary talking. As for me, my minor cut on the knuckles was nothing—Dr. Livesey quickly bandaged it and scolded me gently for it."

You might call me foolish, and indeed my planned action was reckless and overly bold, but I was determined to execute it with all possible caution.

Since I already had a powder horn and bullets, I felt adequately armed. As for the idea I had, it wasn't inherently bad. My goal was to walk along the sandy strip of land separating the eastern anchorage from the open sea, locate the white rock I saw the previous evening, and confirm if Ben Gunn had hidden his boat there, which I still believe was a worthwhile objective. However, certain that I wouldn't be granted permission to leave the compound, my only recourse was to leave without asking (take French leave) and slip away when no one was looking.

I filled both coat pockets with biscuits in preparation for what I was planning—I might have been acting rashly, even foolishly, but I was determined to go about it with as much care as possible. The biscuits would keep me from starving if things went badly. I then armed myself with a pair of pistols, and since I already had powder and bullets, I felt fully prepared.

Soon, cool gusts of air began to reach me, and after walking just a short distance further, I emerged into the open area at the edge of the forest. From there, I saw the ocean stretching out blue and bright to the horizon, with the waves crashing and scattering foam along the beach. I've never known the sea around Treasure Island to be calm. Even when the sun was high and the air completely still, the large waves would continuously roll in along all the outer shores, making a loud, rumbling noise day and night. I hardly think there's a single place on the island where you couldn't hear their sound.

Night had almost come when I laid my hand on its rough sides. Right below it there was an exceedingly small hollow of green turf, hidden by banks and a thick underwood about knee-deep, that grew there very plentifully; and in the centre of the dell, sure enough, a little tent of goat-skins, like what the gipsies carry about with them in England.\nI dropped into the hollow, lifted the side of the tent, and there was Ben Gunn’s boat—home-made if ever anything was home-made; a rude, lop-sided framework of tough wood, and stretched upon that a covering of goat-skin, with the hair inside. The thing was extremely small, even for me, and I can hardly imagine that it could have floated with a full-sized man. There was one thwart set as low as possible, a kind of stretcher in the bows, and a double paddle for propulsion.\nI had not then seen a coracle, such as the ancient Britons made, but I have seen one since, and I can give you no fairer idea of Ben Gunn’s boat than by saying it was like the first and the worst coracle ever made by man.

Directly below the rock was a very small area of green grass, hidden by banks and dense undergrowth that reached about knee-high and grew very thickly there. In the center of this little dell, as expected, was a small tent made of goat hides, resembling those used by traveling people in England. I descended into the hollow, lifted the side of the tent, and there was Ben Gunn's boat – a truly handmade vessel. It consisted of a crude, uneven frame of strong wood, covered with a layer of goat skin, with the fur facing inward. This craft was exceedingly small, even for me, and I seriously doubt it could have floated with a full-sized adult. It had a single seat positioned as low as possible, a resting area in the front section, and a paddle with blades on both ends for moving through the water. At that time, I hadn't seen the type of coracle used by the ancient Britons, but I have since. The best description I can give of Ben Gunn's boat is that it was like the first and worst coracle ever constructed. Nevertheless, it certainly shared the coracle's primary advantage, being extremely light and easy to transport.",

By the time I finally touched its rough surface, evening was almost upon me. Just beneath the rock, I found a very small, grassy hollow, well hidden by banks and dense underbrush about knee high; and in the middle of this little dell stood a small tent made of goat-skins, similar to those used by gypsies in England. I climbed down into the hollow, lifted up a flap of the tent, and there was Ben Gunn's boat—clearly homemade; a rough, uneven frame of strong wood, covered with goat-skin stretched with the hair on the inside. The boat was tiny, even for someone my size, and I couldn't imagine a grown man being able to use it. Inside, there was a single seat set as low as possible, a simple crosspiece at the front, and a double-bladed paddle for moving it. At that time I hadn't seen a coracle like those built by ancient Britons, but now that I have, I can say Ben Gunn's boat resembled the first and worst coracle ever constructed. However, it shared the coracle's chief advantage—it was extremely light and easy to carry."

The other, merely a faint, indistinct light in the darkness, showed the location of the ship at anchor. She had swung around with the outgoing tide—her front was now facing me—the only lights on the vessel were in the cabin, and what I saw was simply the strong light from the stern window reflecting off the fog.\n\nThe outgoing tide had already been flowing for some time, and I had to walk through a wide area of swampy sand, where I sank several times above my ankles, before reaching the edge of the receding water, and stepping a short way in, I managed with some effort and skill to place my small boat, right side up, onto the surface.",

My plan was to sneak out at night, cut the Hispaniola loose, and let her drift wherever she pleased. I was convinced that the mutineers, defeated earlier that morning, only wanted to set sail and escape. I thought it would be a great move to stop them, and since I’d noticed they’d left their guards without a boat, I figured it wouldn’t be too dangerous to attempt. I sat down to wait for nightfall, enjoying a hearty meal of biscuits. The night was perfectly suited for my plan—thick fog covered the sky, and as the last daylight faded, total darkness enveloped Treasure Island.

The ship had turned with the ebbing tide, her bow pointed toward me, and the only lights onboard were in the cabin, reflected through the stern window and diffused by the fog. The tide had been going out for some time, so I had to cross a long stretch of muddy sand—sinking above my ankles several times—before I reached the water’s edge. There, wading in a little, I set my coracle carefully on the retreating water."

Do as you pleased, she always made more leeway than anything else, and turning round and round was the manoeuvre she was best at. Even Ben Gunn himself has admitted that she was “queer to handle till you knew her way.”\nCertainly I did not know her way. She turned in every direction but the one I was bound to go; the most part of the time we were broadside on, and I am very sure I never should have made the ship at all but for the tide. By good fortune, paddle as I pleased, the tide was still sweeping me down; and there lay the Hispaniola right in the fairway, hardly to be missed.\nFirst she loomed before me like a blot of something yet blacker than darkness, then her spars and hull began to take shape, and the next moment, as it seemed (for, the farther I went, the brisker grew the current of the ebb), I was alongside of her hawser and had laid hold.\nThe hawser was as taut as a bowstring, and the current so strong she pulled upon her anchor. All round the hull, in the blackness, the rippling current bubbled and chattered like a little mountain stream. One cut with my sea-gully and the Hispaniola would go humming down the tide.",

However, it was incredibly stubborn and unbalanced to steer. No matter what I tried, it always drifted sideways more than anything else, and its best maneuver was spinning in circles. Even Ben Gunn admitted it was 'peculiar to handle unless you understood its ways.' I certainly did not understand its ways. It would turn in any direction except the one I intended; most of the time we were moving sideways, and I am completely sure I would never have reached the ship without the assistance of the tide. Luckily, no matter how I paddled, the current kept carrying me downstream, and the Hispaniola lay right in the main channel, making it almost impossible to miss. Initially, it appeared before me as a dark smear even blacker than the surrounding night, then its masts and hull began to become distinct, and in what felt like an instant (because the stronger the current became as I got closer), I was alongside its anchor cable and grabbed onto it. The anchor cable was pulled as tight as a bowstring by the strong current tugging on the ship anchored there. All around the hull, in the darkness, the moving water gurgled and chattered like a small mountain stream. One slice with my sea knife, and the Hispaniola would be carried away rapidly by the tide.",

Even Ben Gunn admitted it was odd to control unless you understood its unique behavior. I certainly didn’t know how to manage it; the boat kept veering in every direction except toward my destination, and most of the time I was moving sideways across the water. In fact, if not for the tide, I doubt I would have ever reached the ship. Luckily, despite my paddling, the tide continued to carry me forward, straight towards the Hispaniola, which was impossible to miss as it sat right in my path. First, the ship appeared as a dark shadow, more black than the night around it, but soon its masts and hull became visible, and before long, as the current picked up speed, I found myself beside its hawser, which I grabbed hold of. The rope was stretched tight, the current so strong that it pulled the ship hard against its anchor. Around the hull, the rushing water gurgled and bubbled like a mountain creek in the dark. A single cut of my knife and the Hispaniola would be swept away swiftly by the tide."

But the light airs which had begun blowing from the south-east and south had hauled round after nightfall into the south-west.

However, the gentle breezes that had begun blowing from the south-east and south had changed direction to the south-west after dark.

Fortunately, the gentle winds, which had originally come from the south-east and south, shifted to the south-west as night fell.

Swearing erupted like a storm of hail, and every so often, there was an outburst so violent I thought it would surely end in a physical fight. Nevertheless, each time the conflict passed, and their voices dropped lower for a while until the next intense moment arrived and also concluded without action. On the land, I could see the warm glow of the large campfire burning through the trees near the shore. Someone was singing a repetitive, old, drawn-out sailor's song, ending each verse with a dying fall and a wobble, and it seemed to have no end other than the singer's endurance.

I’d been hearing loud voices in the cabin the whole time, but I hadn’t paid much attention, my mind occupied with other concerns. Now, with nothing else to do, I started to listen more closely. One voice I knew belonged to Israel Hands, the coxswain who used to be Flint’s gunner. The other was my acquaintance with the red night-cap. Both of them were obviously drunk—and getting drunker, as I saw one of them, shouting, throw an empty bottle out the back window. They weren’t just intoxicated, though; it was clear they were extremely angry. They cursed at each other constantly, sometimes arguing so violently I expected a fight, but each time the tension faded, and they’d mutter to each other until the next argument flared up and subsided again.\n\nLooking toward the shore, I saw the warm light of a big campfire shining through the trees, and I heard someone singing an old, dull sailor’s song, long and repetitive, ending each verse with a quaver and seeming to go on endlessly except for the singer’s endurance. I remembered hearing it during our voyage, particularly the lines: “But one man of her crew alive, What put to sea with seventy-five.”\n\nI thought that was a rather gloomy song for a group who’d suffered so many losses just that morning. From what I could tell, though, these pirates seemed as hardened as the ocean they sailed."

At length I was clear of my dangerous neighbour, and just as I gave the last impulsion, my hands came across a light cord that was trailing overboard across the stern bulwarks. Instantly I grasped it.\nWhy I should have done so I can hardly say. It was at first mere instinct, but once I had it in my hands and found it fast, curiosity began to get the upper hand, and I determined I should have one look through the cabin window.\nI pulled in hand over hand on the cord, and when I judged myself near enough, rose at infinite risk to about half my height and thus commanded the roof and a slice of the interior of the cabin.\nBy this time the schooner and her little consort were gliding pretty swiftly through the water; indeed, we had already fetched up level with the camp-fire. The ship was talking, as sailors say, loudly, treading the innumerable ripples with an incessant weltering splash; and until I got my eye above the window-sill I could not comprehend why the watchmen had taken no alarm. One glance, however, was sufficient; and it was only one glance that I durst take from that unsteady skiff. It showed me Hands and his companion locked together in deadly wrestle, each with a hand upon the other’s throat.\nI dropped upon the thwart again, none too soon, for I was near overboard.

I felt the heavy rope connecting us loosen again, and with a strong effort, I cut through the remaining strands. The breeze had little effect on my small boat, and I was almost instantly swept against the front of the Hispaniola. At the same time, the ship began to turn in place, slowly spinning completely around in the current. I worked frantically, expecting to be submerged at any moment. Since I couldn't push the boat directly away, I instead shoved it straight off the back. Finally, I was clear of the dangerous ship, and just as I gave the last push, my hands encountered a thin rope trailing overboard from the back railing. I grabbed it instantly. I can barely explain why I did this; it was purely instinct at first. But once I had it in my hands and found it secure, curiosity grew stronger, and I decided I had to get one look through the cabin window. I pulled myself closer by hauling in the rope hand over hand. When I judged I was near enough, I stood up about halfway, taking a huge risk, which let me see the ceiling and a portion of the cabin's interior. By now, the ship and my little boat were gliding quite rapidly through the water; indeed, we had already come level with the camp-fire. The ship was making a loud noise, as sailors call it, pushing through the countless small waves with a constant wet splashing sound. Until I got my eye above the window-sill, I couldn't understand why the lookouts hadn't raised an alarm.

The ship made a loud, splashing noise as it moved, and until I looked inside, I could not understand why the men watching the camp hadn’t been startled.

At the same moment, she yawed sharply and seemed to change her course. The speed in the meantime had strangely increased.\nI opened my eyes at once. All round me were little ripples, combing over with a sharp, bristling sound and slightly phosphorescent. The Hispaniola herself, a few yards in whose wake I was still being whirled along, seemed to stagger in her course, and I saw her spars toss a little against the blackness of the night; nay, as I looked longer, I made sure she also was wheeling to the southward.\nI glanced over my shoulder, and my heart jumped against my ribs. There, right behind me, was the glow of the camp-fire. The current had turned at right angles, sweeping round along with it the tall schooner and the little dancing coracle; ever quickening, ever bubbling higher, ever muttering louder, it went spinning through the narrows for the open sea.\nSuddenly the schooner in front of me gave a violent yaw, turning, perhaps, through twenty degrees; and almost at the same moment one shout followed another from on board; I could hear feet pounding on the companion ladder and I knew that the two drunkards had at last been interrupted in their quarrel and awakened to a sense of their disaster.\nI lay down flat in the bottom of that wretched skiff and devoutly recommended my spirit to its Maker. At the end of the straits, I made sure we must fall into some bar of raging breakers, where all my troubles would be ended speedily; and though I could, perhaps, bear to die, I could not bear to look upon my fate as it approached.\nSo I must have lain for hours, continually beaten to and fro upon the billows, now and again wetted with flying sprays, and never ceasing to expect death at the next plunge.

Drink and the devil had done for the rest—Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!” I was just contemplating how actively drink and the devil were at work at that very moment aboard the *Hispaniola*, when I was startled by the coracle suddenly tilting. Simultaneously, it veered sharply and seemed to alter its course. Meanwhile, its speed had increased in an unusual manner. I instantly opened my eyes. All around me were small waves, breaking with a sharp, prickly sound and faintly glowing. The *Hispaniola* itself, just a few yards ahead of me in whose wake I was still being swept along, appeared to sway unsteadily, and I saw its masts and spars pitching slightly against the night's darkness; indeed, as I watched longer, I became certain she was also turning towards the south. I glanced back over my shoulder, and my heart pounded against my ribs. There, directly behind me, was the light from the camp-fire. The current had changed direction by ninety degrees, carrying the large schooner and the small, bobbing coracle along with it; constantly accelerating, bubbling higher, murmuring louder, it spun through the narrow channel towards the open ocean. Suddenly, the schooner in front of me gave a violent swerve, turning, perhaps, by twenty degrees; and almost instantly, shouts followed one another from on board; I could hear feet clattering on the companion ladder and I knew that the two drunken men had finally been interrupted in their fight and become aware of their perilous situation. I lay down flat in the bottom of that wretched little boat and devoutly entrusted my soul to God. I was sure that at the end of the straits, we would be pulled into a line of furious crashing waves, where all my troubles would quickly end; and while I could perhaps face death, I could not bear to watch my inevitable end approaching. So I must have remained for hours, continuously thrown back and forth by the waves, occasionally soaked by spray, and always expecting death with the next surge.

Around me, tiny waves were forming with a sharp, hissing sound and emitting a faint glow. The Hispaniola, just a few yards ahead and towing me along in her wake, appeared unsteady in her movement, with her masts swaying against the darkness; as I kept watching, I became convinced she too was turning south. Looking back, my heart pounded as I spotted the burning light of the campfire right behind me. The current had shifted direction sharply, pulling both the large schooner and my little boat rapidly into the open sea, getting faster and more turbulent. Suddenly, the schooner jutted violently to one side, maybe by twenty degrees, and almost instantly I heard shouts from the ship—people running up the stairs—showing that the two drunken sailors had finally been disturbed and realized their peril. I lay flat in the bottom of my miserable craft and prayed for my soul. I believed we were about to be carried onto pounding breakers at the strait’s end, where my ordeal would quickly end; and while I might have been able to face death, I couldn’t bring myself to watch it approach. I likely stayed like that for hours, tossed here and there by the waves, sometimes sprayed with seawater, constantly expecting each moment to be my last. Slowly, exhaustion overcame me; a numbness and a dazed weariness set in, even amid my terror, until eventually, I dozed off, and as I drifted in my battered coracle, I dreamed of home and the familiar inn called the Admiral Benbow."

I was scarce a quarter of a mile to seaward, and it was my first thought to paddle in and land.\nThat notion was soon given over. Among the fallen rocks the breakers spouted and bellowed; loud reverberations, heavy sprays flying and falling, succeeded one another from second to second; and I saw myself, if I ventured nearer, dashed to death upon the rough shore or spending my strength in vain to scale the beetling crags.\nNor was that all, for crawling together on flat tables of rock or letting themselves drop into the sea with loud reports I beheld huge slimy monsters—soft snails, as it were, of incredible bigness—two or three score of them together, making the rocks to echo with their barkings.\nI have understood since that they were sea lions, and entirely harmless.

The sun had risen but was obscured by the imposing height of the Spy-glass mountain, which descended steeply into the ocean on this side, forming sheer cliffs. Nearby were Haulbowline Head and Mizzenmast Hill; the hill was barren and dark, while the headland featured cliffs forty to fifty feet tall, littered with large chunks of fallen rock along its base. I was only about a quarter-mile offshore, and my immediate thought was to paddle to shore and disembark. However, I quickly abandoned that plan. The waves crashed violently and roared among the scattered rocks; powerful echoes, intense sea spray rising and falling continuously, occurred moment after moment. I realised that if I attempted to land, I would likely be smashed against the rough coast or exhaust myself fruitlessly trying to climb the overhanging rocks. Furthermore, I saw enormous, slimy creatures – like exceptionally large, soft snails – clustering on flat rock surfaces or dropping into the water with loud splashes. There were perhaps forty or sixty of them together, their bark-like sounds echoing off the rocks. I later learned these were sea lions and were harmless. However, their appearance, combined with the challenging shoreline and the strong surf, completely put me off landing there. I felt it would be preferable to risk perishing at sea than to face such hazards.",

I was less than a quarter mile from the shore and, at first, thought I might paddle in to land. But I quickly changed my mind. The waves crashed and roared among the rocks, sending sprays of water flying and making loud echoes again and again. I realized that if I got any closer, I might either be smashed against the rocky coast or tire myself out trying to climb the steep cliffs. There was another reason too: I saw huge, slimy creatures—like gigantic snails—gathered on the flat rocks or dropping noisily into the sea, their barks echoing.

To the north of that, again, there comes another cape—Cape of the Woods, as it was marked upon the chart—buried in tall green pines, which descended to the margin of the sea.\nI remembered what Silver had said about the current that sets northward along the whole west coast of Treasure Island, and seeing from my position that I was already under its influence, I preferred to leave Haulbowline Head behind me and reserve my strength for an attempt to land upon the kindlier-looking Cape of the Woods.\nThere was a great, smooth swell upon the sea. The wind blowing steady and gentle from the south, there was no contrariety between that and the current, and the billows rose and fell unbroken.\nHad it been otherwise, I must long ago have perished; but as it was, it is surprising how easily and securely my little and light boat could ride. Often, as I still lay at the bottom and kept no more than an eye above the gunwale, I would see a big blue summit heaving close above me; yet the coracle would but bounce a little, dance as if on springs, and subside on the other side into the trough as lightly as a bird.\nI began after a little to grow very bold and sat up to try my skill at paddling. But even a small change in the disposition of the weight will produce violent changes in the behaviour of a coracle. And I had hardly moved before the boat, giving up at once her gentle dancing movement, ran straight down a slope of water so steep that it made me giddy, and struck her nose, with a spout of spray, deep into the side of the next wave.\nI was drenched and terrified, and fell instantly back into my old position, whereupon the coracle seemed to find her head again and led me as softly as before among the billows. It was plain she was not to be interfered with, and at that rate, since I could in no way influence her course, what hope had I left of reaching land?",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Meanwhile, I believed I had a better opportunity before me. North of Haulbowline Head, the land curves significantly inland, exposing a long stretch of yellow sand at low tide. Further north of that lay another cape, marked as the Cape of the Woods on the map, covered in tall green pine trees that extended down to the sea's edge. I remembered Silver's explanation of the northward current that flowed along the entire west coast of Treasure Island. Noticing from my location that I was already caught in this current, I decided to bypass Haulbowline Head and save my energy for attempting to land on the more inviting-looking Cape of the Woods. The sea had a large, smooth swell. A steady, gentle wind blew from the south, which did not conflict with the current, so the waves rose and fell without breaking. If the conditions had been different, I surely would have perished long ago. But as it was, it was remarkable how easily and safely my small, light boat could navigate the waves. Often, while still lying low in the boat, only peeking over the side, I would see a huge blue wave crest rise close above me. Yet, the coracle would merely bounce slightly, bobbing as if on springs, and then settle into the trough on the other side as lightly as a bird. After a little while, I began to feel more confident and sat up to try my hand at paddling. However, even a minor shift in weight distribution causes drastic changes in a coracle's behavior. I had barely moved when the boat immediately stopped its gentle bobbing motion, plunged straight down a water slope so steep it made me dizzy, and drove its front end deep into the side of the next wave with a burst of spray. I was soaked and scared, and instantly fell back into my original position. At that point, the coracle seemed to regain its composure and carried me gently through the waves again, just as before. It was evident that I shouldn't try to control it, and if I couldn't influence its direction at all, what hope did I have of reaching land?",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Meanwhile, I thought I had found a better opportunity. North of Haulbowline Head, the shoreline curves inward for quite a distance, revealing a wide expanse of yellow sand at low tide. Further north, another promontory called Cape of the Woods—marked as such on the map—was covered in tall green pine trees that reached down to the water’s edge. I recalled what Silver had said about a current flowing north along the west side of Treasure Island, and from where I was, I could tell I was already being carried by it. So I decided to leave Haulbowline Head behind and save my energy to try landing at the more promising Cape of the Woods. The sea was rolling with a large, smooth swell, the southerly wind was steady and mild, and because the wind matched the current, the waves rose and fell smoothly without breaking. If that hadn’t been the case, I would have been lost long ago; but as things were, it was amazing how easily and safely my small, light boat floated. Often, while I lay low in the boat with only my eyes peering over the edge, I would see big blue waves towering nearby. Yet the coracle would just gently bounce over them, spring up and down, and settle into the next hollow as lightly as a bird. After a while, I grew more confident and decided to sit up and try paddling. However, even a minor shift in weight can drastically affect how a coracle behaves. I had scarcely moved when the boat, no longer riding gently, rushed down a steep wave that made me dizzy, plunging its bow hard into the next wave and sending spray everywhere. Drenched and frightened, I quickly returned to my previous position, and the coracle resumed her calm movement among the waves. It became clear that she couldn’t be controlled, and since I couldn’t influence her direction at all, I wondered what chance I had left of reaching the shore."

First, moving with all care, I gradually baled out the coracle with my sea-cap; then, getting my eye once more above the gunwale, I set myself to study how it was she managed to slip so quietly through the rollers.\nI found each wave, instead of the big, smooth glossy mountain it looks from shore or from a vessel’s deck, was for all the world like any range of hills on dry land, full of peaks and smooth places and valleys. The coracle, left to herself, turning from side to side, threaded, so to speak, her way through these lower parts and avoided the steep slopes and higher, toppling summits of the wave.\n“Well, now,” thought I to myself, “it is plain I must lie where I am and not disturb the balance; but it is plain also that I can put the paddle over the side and from time to time, in smooth places, give her a shove or two towards land.” No sooner thought upon than done. There I lay on my elbows in the most trying attitude, and every now and again gave a weak stroke or two to turn her head to shore.\nIt was very tiring and slow work, yet I did visibly gain ground; and as we drew near the Cape of the Woods, though I saw I must infallibly miss that point, I had still made some hundred yards of easting. I was, indeed, close in. I could see the cool green tree-tops swaying together in the breeze, and I felt sure I should make the next promontory without fail.\nIt was high time, for I now began to be tortured with thirst. The glow of the sun from above, its thousandfold reflection from the waves, the sea-water that fell and dried upon me, caking my very lips with salt, combined to make my throat burn and my brain ache. The sight of the trees so near at hand had almost made me sick with longing, but the current had soon carried me past the point, and as the next reach of sea opened out, I beheld a sight that changed the nature of my thoughts.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Although I became incredibly scared, I managed to stay calm. My first action was to carefully and gradually empty the water from the small boat using my cap. Then, peeking over the edge again, I focused on observing how the boat was able to move so smoothly through the waves. I discovered that the waves, unlike the large, smooth, shiny mountains they appear from shore or a ship's deck, were actually quite like ranges of hills on land, full of peaks, smooth areas, and valleys. The coracle, left to itself, would sway from side to side and effectively find its way through the lower sections, avoiding the steep, collapsing crests of the waves. I thought to myself, \"It's clear I must remain lying down here to keep my balance, but it's also clear I can put the paddle in the water occasionally in calm spots and push towards land.\" I immediately put this plan into action. Lying awkwardly on my elbows, every so often I would give a weak stroke or two to steer the boat towards the shore. It was exhausting and slow work, yet I could see I was definitely getting closer. As I approached the area known as the Cape of the Woods, although I knew I wouldn't reach that exact spot, I had moved several hundred yards eastward. I was, in fact, quite near the shore. I could see the cool green tree-tops swaying gently in the breeze, and I felt confident I would reach the next headland successfully. It was critical that I made land soon, as I was now starting to suffer terribly from thirst. The intense sun from above, its dazzling reflection off the water, and the salt water that landed on me and dried, crusting my lips with salt, all combined to make my throat burn and my head ache. Seeing the trees so close by made me feel almost faint with longing, but the current quickly carried me past the cape, and as the next stretch of sea came into view, I saw something that completely changed my frame of mind.",

Once I could see over the edge of the boat again, I began to pay close attention to how the boat managed to move so quietly among the waves. I realized that, up close, each wave wasn’t like the smooth, towering hills of water they appear to be from the shore or a ship, but rather resembled a range of hills on land—with peaks, slopes, and valleys. When left to itself, the little boat turned from side to side and wound its way through the lower parts, avoiding the high, steep crests. I told myself it was clear I had to stay where I was and keep the boat balanced, but I could also put my paddle in the water and gently steer toward land whenever I hit a smooth spot. As soon as I decided this, I acted, lying uncomfortably on my elbows and occasionally paddling weakly to point the boat toward the shore. It was slow and exhausting work, but I could see I was making progress. As I got closer to the wooded cape, I realized I would miss that point, but I had still managed to move a considerable distance eastward. Now I was near enough to the land to see the green treetops moving in the wind, and I felt confident I’d reach the next part of land. It was a good thing, too, because I was suffering badly from thirst. The sunlight beating down, its glare off the water, and the salty sea spray drying on my lips made my throat burn and my head ache. The sight of the trees so close made me almost desperate with longing, but the current quickly carried me past, and as the coast opened up, I suddenly saw something that changed all my concerns."

I made sure, of course, that I should be taken; but I was so distressed for want of water that I scarce knew whether to be glad or sorry at the thought, and long before I had come to a conclusion, surprise had taken entire possession of my mind and I could do nothing but stare and wonder.\nThe Hispaniola was under her main-sail and two jibs, and the beautiful white canvas shone in the sun like snow or silver. When I first sighted her, all her sails were drawing; she was lying a course about north-west, and I presumed the men on board were going round the island on their way back to the anchorage. Presently she began to fetch more and more to the westward, so that I thought they had sighted me and were going about in chase. At last, however, she fell right into the wind’s eye, was taken dead aback, and stood there awhile helpless, with her sails shivering.\n“Clumsy fellows,” said I; “they must still be drunk as owls.” And I thought how Captain Smollett would have set them skipping.\nMeanwhile the schooner gradually fell off and filled again upon another tack, sailed swiftly for a minute or so, and brought up once more dead in the wind’s eye. Again and again was this repeated. To and fro, up and down, north, south, east, and west, the Hispaniola sailed by swoops and dashes, and at each repetition ended as she had begun, with idly flapping canvas. It became plain to me that nobody was steering. And if so, where were the men?

Initially, I was certain I'd be apprehended, but I was suffering so severely from lack of water that I was unsure whether to feel relief or disappointment at the thought. Before I could come to a decision, utter astonishment completely gripped my mind, and I could do nothing but gaze and marvel.\nThe *Hispaniola* was sailing with her main-sail and two jibs deployed, and the lovely white canvas shimmered in the sun like fresh snow or polished silver. When I first spotted her, all her sails were filled; she was following a path heading roughly north-west, and I assumed the crew intended to sail around the island to return to the anchoring spot. Soon after, she started to veer increasingly towards the west, making me believe they had seen me and were changing direction to give chase. However, she eventually turned directly into the wind's path, was completely stopped short, and stayed there for a time, powerless, with her sails fluttering.\n\"What clumsy sailors,\" I remarked to myself; \"they must be as drunk as ever.\" And I thought about how Captain Smollett would have had them moving smartly.\nIn the meantime, the schooner slowly drifted off course and caught the wind again on a new tack, sailed quickly for perhaps a minute, and then once more came to a stop directly facing the wind. This sequence was repeated multiple times. Moving back and forth, side to side, and in every direction, the *Hispaniola* sailed with sudden sweeps and rushes, and each time the movement ended as it had begun, with the sails flapping uselessly. It became obvious to me that no one was at the helm. And if that were true, where were the crew? They were either completely incapacitated by alcohol or had deserted the ship, I considered, and perhaps if I could manage to get on board, I might be able to bring the vessel back to her captain.",

I fully expected that I would be captured, but my desperate thirst made me unsure whether to feel relieved or alarmed, and before I could decide how I felt, I was completely overtaken by astonishment and could only watch in amazement. The Hispaniola was set with her mainsail and two jibs, and the brilliant white sails gleamed in the sunlight as brightly as snow or polished silver. At first sight, she was moving steadily northwest, and I assumed the crew was taking her around the island to return to their anchorage. Soon, however, she started to turn further west, making me think the crew had spotted me and were adjusting course to pursue. However, she soon ended up caught by the wind directly on her bow, stalled helplessly with her sails flapping. 'What a bunch of bunglers,' I muttered to myself; 'they must still be as drunk as can be.' I reflected on how much better Captain Smollett could have managed them. In the meantime, the ship slowly shifted and caught the wind again on a new course, sped forward for a short time, and then was stalled once more with the wind full on her sails. This happened repeatedly. Back and forth, in every direction, the Hispaniola darted and swooped, each time ending up with her sails loose and useless. It became clear that she was out of control—no one was steering her. This led me to wonder where the crew had gone; either they were incapacitated by drink, or had abandoned ship altogether. Maybe, if I managed to get aboard, I could bring the vessel back to the captain."

She was stock-still but for the current.\nFor the last little while I had even lost, but now redoubling my efforts, I began once more to overhaul the chase.\nI was not a hundred yards from her when the wind came again in a clap; she filled on the port tack and was off again, stooping and skimming like a swallow.\nMy first impulse was one of despair, but my second was towards joy. Round she came, till she was broadside on to me—round still till she had covered a half and then two thirds and then three quarters of the distance that separated us. I could see the waves boiling white under her forefoot. Immensely tall she looked to me from my low station in the coracle.\nAnd then, of a sudden, I began to comprehend.

The wind died down for a few seconds, and the current, slowly rotating it, caused the Hispaniola to turn gradually around its center. Eventually, it presented its stern to me, with the cabin window still hanging open and the lamp above the table still burning in the daylight. The main sail drooped like a flag. It was completely still except for the action of the current.\n\nI had even been losing ground just moments before, but now, doubling my effort, I began to gain on the pursuit once more.\n\nI was less than a hundred yards away when the wind suddenly returned with force; its sails on the port side caught the wind, and it sped off again, diving and skimming like a swallow.\n\nMy first reaction was one of despair, but my second was one of joy. It swung around until its side was directly facing me—continuing to turn until it had closed half, then two-thirds, and then three-quarters of the distance between us. I could see the waves frothing white under its front end. From my low position in the small boat, it appeared incredibly tall.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, I began to understand. I had barely any time to think—barely any time to act and save myself. I was on the crest of one wave as the schooner came sweeping down over the next. The bowsprit was directly over my head. I sprang to my feet and leaped, pushing the small coracle under the water with my weight. With one hand, I grasped the rope from the jib, while my foot found a hold between the supporting and tension ropes; and as I clung there, gasping for air, a dull impact told me the schooner had rushed forward and struck the coracle, leaving me stranded on the Hispaniola without a way off.",

Although she looked as if she was stuck—her sails booming loudly and the deck gear clattering around—she was still moving away from me, not only due to the force of the current but also because of the large sideways drift she experienced naturally.\n\nBut finally, my opportunity arrived.

The main sail hung limp like a flag with no wind. She was stationary now, except for the push of the current.\n\nRecently, I had even been losing ground, but reinvigorated, I started to gain on her again. I was less than a hundred yards away when suddenly the wind picked up again with a rush; she caught the breeze on the left side and took off once more, cutting through the water swiftly like a swallow.\n\nMy first reaction was hopelessness, but immediately afterward, I felt a surge of excitement. She swung around until she was broadside to me, rotating still more until she had shortened the gap between us by half, then by two-thirds, and then by three-quarters. From my low seat in the coracle, she towered above me, and I could see the water churning white beneath her bow.\n\nSuddenly, I understood what was happening. I barely had time to think or to react and save myself. As I rose on the crest of one wave, the schooner appeared over the next, her bowsprit looming above me. I jumped up and leapt forward, pushing the coracle under water. Grabbing the jib-boom with one hand, my foot wedged between cables, I clung there, breathing hard. Then came a dull impact—the schooner had run over and smashed the coracle, leaving me stranded with no way back, now clinging to the Hispaniola."

The planks, which had not been swabbed since the mutiny, bore the print of many feet, and an empty bottle, broken by the neck, tumbled to and fro like a live thing in the scuppers.\nSuddenly the Hispaniola came right into the wind. The jibs behind me cracked aloud, the rudder slammed to, the whole ship gave a sickening heave and shudder, and at the same moment the main-boom swung inboard, the sheet groaning in the blocks, and showed me the lee after-deck.\nThere were the two watchmen, sure enough: red-cap on his back, as stiff as a handspike, with his arms stretched out like those of a crucifix and his teeth showing through his open lips; Israel Hands propped against the bulwarks, his chin on his chest, his hands lying open before him on the deck, his face as white, under its tan, as a tallow candle.\nFor a while the ship kept bucking and sidling like a vicious horse, the sails filling, now on one tack, now on another, and the boom swinging to and fro till the mast groaned aloud under the strain. Now and again too there would come a cloud of light sprays over the bulwark and a heavy blow of the ship’s bows against the swell; so much heavier weather was made of it by this great rigged ship than by my home-made, lop-sided coracle, now gone to the bottom of the sea.\nAt every jump of the schooner, red-cap slipped to and fro, but—what was ghastly to behold—neither his attitude nor his fixed teeth-disclosing grin was anyway disturbed by this rough usage. At every jump too, Hands appeared still more to sink into himself and settle down upon the deck, his feet sliding ever the farther out, and the whole body canting towards the stern, so that his face became, little by little, hid from me; and at last I could see nothing beyond his ear and the frayed ringlet of one whisker.\nAt the same time, I observed, around both of them, splashes of dark blood upon the planks and began to feel sure that they had killed each other in their drunken wrath.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I had barely gotten into position on the bowsprit when the flying jib sail unexpectedly shifted to the other side with a loud bang, like a cannon shot. The schooner vibrated down to its core from the sudden change, but moments later, with the other sails still catching the wind, the jib flopped back and hung loosely. This sudden shift almost threw me into the water; so without delay, I crawled back along the bowsprit and fell headfirst onto the deck. I was on the sheltered side near the front of the ship, and the large mainsail, which was still filled with wind, blocked my view of a section of the stern deck. Not a single person was visible. The deck planks, not cleaned since the mutiny began, were marked with the impressions of many feet, and a broken bottle, its neck snapped, rolled back and forth in the drainage channels like something alive. Suddenly, the *Hispaniola* turned directly into the wind. The smaller jibs behind me cracked loudly, the rudder slammed over, the whole ship gave a sickening lurch and shudder, and at that exact moment, the main boom swung inwards across the deck, the rope groaning through the pulleys, revealing the back part of the deck on the leeward side. There the two watchmen were, just as expected: Red-cap on his back, rigid as a stiff board, with his arms spread out like a crucifix and his teeth showing through his open mouth; Israel Hands propped against the side railing, his chin on his chest, his hands lying open on the deck before him, his face as pale as a wax candle beneath its tan. For a time, the ship pitched and swayed uncontrollably like a wild horse, the sails filling first on one side, then the other, and the boom swinging back and forth until the mast groaned loudly under the stress. Occasionally, too, a burst of light spray would come over the side railing, followed by the ship's bow striking the swells heavily; this large, fully rigged ship struggled much more in the heavy weather than my simple, uneven little boat, now at the bottom of the sea. With each lurch of the schooner, Red-cap slid back and forth, but—horrifyingly—neither his posture nor his fixed, teeth-baring grin was disturbed in any way by this rough motion. With each jolt also, Hands seemed to settle further into himself and sink down onto the deck, his feet sliding increasingly outwards, and his entire body tilting towards the stern, so that his face was gradually hidden from my view; finally, I could see nothing but his ear and the frayed curl of one side-whisker. At the same time, I noticed splashes of dark blood on the planks around both of them and began to feel certain they had killed each other in their drunken fury.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I had barely managed to climb onto the bowsprit when the flying jib suddenly shifted direction with a loud bang like a gunshot. The schooner shook all the way down to her keel from the impact, but then, with the other sails still catching the wind, the jib swung back to its previous position and became slack. The sudden movement nearly knocked me into the sea, so I wasted no time in scurrying back along the bowsprit and fell headfirst onto the deck. I found myself on the sheltered side of the forecastle, where the still full mainsail blocked my view of part of the rear deck. There was nobody in sight. The deck, not cleaned since the mutiny, showed many footprints, and there was a broken-necked bottle rolling around the scuppers as if it were alive. All of a sudden, the Hispaniola swung directly into the wind; the jibs behind me snapped loudly, the rudder banged harshly, and the whole vessel lurched and shivered. At that instant, the main boom swung inward with a creak, revealing the sheltered portion of the after-deck. There I saw the two watchmen at last: one, Red-cap, lying flat on his back, rigid and with his arms stretched out like a crucifix, his teeth showing through his open mouth; the other, Israel Hands, slumped against the rails, head down, hands open on the deck, his face pale beneath its tan, almost candle-white. For a time, the ship lurched and twisted like a wild horse, sails filling on one side and then the other, the boom swinging back and forth so hard that it made the mast groan. Occasionally, spray would wash over the railing and the bow would crash into the waves, making the big ship much harder to handle than my old makeshift coracle, now lost at sea. With every jolt of the schooner, Red-cap slid across the deck, but, in a frightening way, his rigid posture and chilling grin never changed despite the rough movement. Each time, Israel Hands seemed to collapse further onto the deck, his feet sliding more and more, his body tilting toward the stern until, eventually, I could only see the side of his head and a tattered lock of hair. At the same time, I noticed dark stains of blood around both men on the deck and began to realize they had likely killed each other in a drunken rage."

His eyes never met mine; they kept wandering to and fro, up and down, now with a look to the sky, now with a flitting glance upon the dead O’Brien. All the time he kept smiling and putting his tongue out in the most guilty, embarrassed manner, so that a child could have told that he was bent on some deception. I was prompt with my answer, however, for I saw where my advantage lay and that with a fellow so densely stupid I could easily conceal my suspicions to the end.\n“Some wine?” I said. “Far better. Will you have white or red?”\n“Well, I reckon it’s about the blessed same to me, shipmate,” he replied; “so it’s strong, and plenty of it, what’s the odds?”\n“All right,” I answered. “I’ll bring you port, Mr. Hands. But I’ll have to dig for it.”\nWith that I scuttled down the companion with all the noise I could, slipped off my shoes, ran quietly along the sparred gallery, mounted the forecastle ladder, and popped my head out of the fore companion. I knew he would not expect to see me there, yet I took every precaution possible, and certainly the worst of my suspicions proved too true.\nHe had risen from his position to his hands and knees, and though his leg obviously hurt him pretty sharply when he moved—for I could hear him stifle a groan—yet it was at a good, rattling rate that he trailed himself across the deck. In half a minute he had reached the port scuppers and picked, out of a coil of rope, a long knife, or rather a short dirk, discoloured to the hilt with blood. He looked upon it for a moment, thrusting forth his under jaw, tried the point upon his hand, and then, hastily concealing it in the bosom of his jacket, trundled back again into his old place against the bulwark.\nThis was all that I required to know. Israel could move about, he was now armed, and if he had been at so much trouble to get rid of me, it was plain that I was meant to be the victim.

All the while, he wore a guilty, nervous smile, sticking out his tongue, making it obvious even to a child that he was planning something deceitful. I responded promptly, realizing where my advantage lay and that I could easily hide my suspicions from such a thick-headed individual. “Some wine?” I asked. “Much better. Red or white?” He replied, “Honestly, shipmate, it's much the same to me; as long as it’s strong and there's plenty, what difference does it make?” “Alright,” I said. “I’ll fetch you port, Mr. Hands. But I'll have to search for it.” With that, I made a loud descent down the companionway, then quietly slipped off my shoes, crept along the lower deck gallery, climbed the forecastle ladder, and carefully poked my head out of the fore companion. I knew he wouldn't expect me there, yet I took every possible precaution, and indeed, my worst fears proved true. He had pushed himself up onto his hands and knees, and though his leg clearly caused him sharp pain when he moved—I heard him suppress a groan—he dragged himself across the deck at a surprisingly brisk pace. Within half a minute, he reached the scuppers on the port side and pulled a long knife, or rather a short dirk, stained with blood up to the hilt, from a coil of rope. He stared at it for a moment, jaw jutting out, tested the point on his hand, then quickly hid it inside his jacket front before scrambling back to his original position against the bulwark.

I think I was a good, prompt subaltern, and I am very sure that Hands was an excellent pilot, for we went about and about and dodged in, shaving the banks, with a certainty and a neatness that were a pleasure to behold.\nScarcely had we passed the heads before the land closed around us. The shores of North Inlet were as thickly wooded as those of the southern anchorage, but the space was longer and narrower and more like, what in truth it was, the estuary of a river. Right before us, at the southern end, we saw the wreck of a ship in the last stages of dilapidation. It had been a great vessel of three masts but had lain so long exposed to the injuries of the weather that it was hung about with great webs of dripping seaweed, and on the deck of it shore bushes had taken root and now flourished thick with flowers. It was a sad sight, but it showed us that the anchorage was calm.\n“Now,” said Hands, “look there; there’s a pet bit for to beach a ship in. Fine flat sand, never a cat’s paw, trees all around of it, and flowers a-blowing like a garding on that old ship.”\n“And once beached,” I inquired, “how shall we get her off again?”\n“Why, so,” he replied: “you take a line ashore there on the other side at low water, take a turn about one of them big pines; bring it back, take a turn around the capstan, and lie to for the tide. Come high water, all hands take a pull upon the line, and off she comes as sweet as natur’. And now, boy, you stand by. We’re near the bit now, and she’s too much way on her.

I believe I played my part well as a quick and helpful assistant, and I know Hands was a skilled pilot, as we maneuvered skillfully, turning just in time and gliding close to the banks with admirable precision.\n\nAs soon as we entered, the land seemed to close in around us. The edges of North Inlet were as thickly forested as the southern anchorage. However, this area was longer and narrower, truly resembling a river’s estuary. Directly ahead, at the southern tip, lay the remains of a once-grand three-masted ship, decaying after years of exposure to the elements. Wet seaweed draped over it, and shore plants had started to grow and bloom on its deck. The sight was gloomy, but it confirmed how sheltered the anchorage was.\n\nHand pointed out a prime spot for beaching the ship, noting the flat sand, calm water, and surrounding trees and flowers, making the area look almost garden-like. I asked how we’d get the ship back into the water after beaching it. Hand explained that at low tide, we should run a line to a big pine tree across the shore, wrap it, bring it back to the capstan, and wait for high tide. Once the water rose, everyone would pull on the line, which would easily free the ship.\n\nHand then ordered me to stand ready as we approached the spot, giving me steering instructions that I quickly followed. Suddenly, he commanded me to turn the helm sharply, and the Hispaniola swiftly swung around to head directly for the low, tree-lined shore."

I leaned my hands against the main mast, which was quite large, and waited, every nerve tense.\nNoticing I intended to evade him, he also paused; and a few moments passed with him making feints and me reacting accordingly. It was the same kind of game I had often played at home among the rocks of Black Hill Cove, but certainly never before with such a frantically pounding heart as I had now. Still, as I said, it was a young person's game, and I believed I could hold my own against an older sailor with a hurt leg. In fact, my confidence had begun to increase so much that I allowed myself to think briefly about how the situation would end, and while I could see I could keep it going for a long time, I saw no possibility of ultimately getting away.\nThen, while this was happening, suddenly the Hispaniola struck something, stumbled, grated on the sand for an instant, and then, like a swift blow, tilted sharply to the left side until the deck was at a forty-five-degree angle, and about a large cask's worth of water splashed into the drains and collected in a pool between the deck and the side railing.\nBoth of us were knocked off balance instantly and rolled, almost simultaneously, into the drains, with the deceased man in the red cap, his arms still outstretched, tumbling stiffly behind us.

Yet it was still a game of agility, and I felt confident I could handle myself against an older sailor with an injured leg. My spirits rose so much that I let myself consider how things might end; while I was sure I could drag this out, I couldn't see any real chance of escape. \n\nSuddenly, while we were at this stalemate, the Hispaniola struck land, shook, scraped along the sand briefly, and quickly tilted to port, the deck slanting steeply as water surged through the scuppers, pooling between the deck and the bulwark. \n\nIn an instant, we were both thrown off balance and rolled together into the scuppers, with the dead man in the red cap tumbling stiffly close behind.

Quick as thought, I sprang into the mizzen shrouds, rattled up hand over hand, and did not draw a breath till I was seated on the cross-trees.\nI had been saved by being prompt; the dirk had struck not half a foot below me as I pursued my upward flight; and there stood Israel Hands with his mouth open and his face upturned to mine, a perfect statue of surprise and disappointment.\nNow that I had a moment to myself, I lost no time in changing the priming of my pistol, and then, having one ready for service, and to make assurance doubly sure, I proceeded to draw the load of the other and recharge it afresh from the beginning.\nMy new employment struck Hands all of a heap; he began to see the dice going against him, and after an obvious hesitation, he also hauled himself heavily into the shrouds, and with the dirk in his teeth, began slowly and painfully to mount.

My swift action saved me; the knife had narrowly missed me, striking less than a foot below as I ascended. Israel Hands stood below, his mouth open and face turned upward towards me, looking utterly surprised and defeated. Now that I had a moment to myself, I quickly replaced the powder in my pistol, and then, to be absolutely sure, I unloaded the other one completely and reloaded it from scratch. My actions visibly stunned Hands; he began to understand that the situation was turning against him, and after a noticeable pause, he too laboriously pulled himself into the ropes, gripping the knife in his teeth, and started a slow and painful ascent.

Thinking quickly, I leaped into the ropes of the mizzen mast and climbed up rapidly, not pausing for breath until I sat on the cross-trees. My quick thinking saved me—Hands' dirk struck just below my feet as I escaped upwards. Below, Israel Hands stared up at me in shock and frustration, frozen in place. Taking advantage of my brief safety, I quickly replaced the primer in my pistol, making it ready to fire, and then reloaded my second pistol from scratch. This change in my actions startled Hands, and with uncertainty, he started to pull himself up into the shrouds as well. With his knife in his teeth, he struggled to climb, hauling his injured leg behind him, groaning in pain, and taking so long that I had finished preparing my weapons well before he was more than a third of the way up."

The blood certainly flowed faster then, but I was free to move on my own again, held to the mast only by my clothing. I ripped through these with a sudden pull and then climbed back onto the deck using the starboard ropes.

I went below to attend to my injury; it was quite painful and still bleeding significantly, but it was neither deep nor critical and didn't hinder me much when I moved my arm. Then I looked around, and since the ship was now, in a way, under my control, I started contemplating how to get rid of its last remaining occupant—the deceased man, O’Brien. As I mentioned, he had collapsed against the ship's side, lying there like a ghastly, awkward life-sized doll, so unlike a living person in color or grace! In that position, it was simple to handle him, and as my frequent encounters with grim events had mostly removed my fear of the dead, I grabbed him by the waist as if he were just a sack of grain and with one strong heave, sent him over the side. He hit the water with a loud splash; his red cap came off and floated on top; and after the disturbance calmed, I could see him and Israel side-by-side, gently swaying with the water's movement.

The evening breeze had sprung up, and though it was well warded off by the hill with the two peaks upon the east, the cordage had begun to sing a little softly to itself and the idle sails to rattle to and fro.\nI began to see a danger to the ship. The jibs I speedily doused and brought tumbling to the deck, but the main-sail was a harder matter. Of course, when the schooner canted over, the boom had swung out-board, and the cap of it and a foot or two of sail hung even under water. I thought this made it still more dangerous; yet the strain was so heavy that I half feared to meddle. At last I got my knife and cut the halyards. The peak dropped instantly, a great belly of loose canvas floated broad upon the water, and since, pull as I liked, I could not budge the downhall, that was the extent of what I could accomplish. For the rest, the Hispaniola must trust to luck, like myself.\nBy this time the whole anchorage had fallen into shadow—the last rays, I remember, falling through a glade of the wood and shining bright as jewels on the flowery mantle of the wreck. It began to be chill; the tide was rapidly fleeting seaward, the schooner settling more and more on her beam-ends.\nI scrambled forward and looked over. It seemed shallow enough, and holding the cut hawser in both hands for a last security, I let myself drop softly overboard. The water scarcely reached my waist; the sand was firm and covered with ripple marks, and I waded ashore in great spirits, leaving the Hispaniola on her side, with her main-sail trailing wide upon the surface of the bay.

The sun was so close to setting that the shadows from the pine trees on the western shore were already stretching across the harbor and casting patterns on the deck. An evening breeze had started, and although the two-peaked hill to the east offered good shelter, the ropes had begun to make a soft humming sound, and the unattached sails were fluttering back and forth. I started to realize the ship was in danger. I quickly lowered the smaller front sails (the jibs), making them fall onto the deck, but the main sail was more challenging. Because the schooner was tilted over, the boom had swung outwards, with its end and a couple of feet of the sail submerged. I believed this made the situation even riskier; however, the strain was so intense that I was hesitant to interfere. Finally, I used my knife to cut the ropes that held the sail up (the halyards). The peak of the sail dropped instantly, a large bulk of loose canvas floated broadly on the water, and since I couldn't release the downhaul no matter how hard I pulled, that was all I managed to do. For the rest, the Hispaniola, like me, would have to rely on luck. By this time, the entire anchorage was cloaked in shadow—I remember the last rays of sunlight passing through a gap in the woods and shining brightly like gems on the flowery covering of the wreck. It started to feel cold; the tide was rapidly flowing out towards the sea, and the schooner was leaning more and more heavily onto its side. I climbed towards the front of the ship and looked over the edge. The water seemed quite shallow, and holding onto the cut anchor rope with both hands for final security, I gently lowered myself into the water. The water barely came up to my waist; the sand was firm and marked with ripples, and I waded towards the shore feeling very cheerful, leaving the Hispaniola tilted on its side with its large main sail trailing widely across the surface of the bay. Around the same moment, the sun completely set, and the breeze sighed softly in the twilight among the swaying pines.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Now I found myself alone on the ship as the tide started to flow out. The sun was almost set, so the shadows from the pine trees along the western shore stretched across the anchorage, casting patterned shadows on deck. An evening wind had picked up, and although the hill with two peaks to the east blocked most of it, I could hear the ropes humming quietly and see the loose sails flapping. I realized the ship was at risk. I hurriedly took down the jibs, letting them drop onto the deck, but handling the main-sail was much trickier. The schooner had tilted, making the boom swing outward so that the tip and some of the sail dipped into the water, which I thought made things even more precarious. Still, the tension was so great, I was hesitant to try fixing it. Eventually, I used my knife to cut the halyards, causing the peak to fall suddenly and the loose sail to billow over the water. I tried to free the downhaul but couldn’t move it, so that was all I could do. From then on, both the Hispaniola and I would have to rely on luck. By this point, shadows covered the anchorage—the sun's last rays shone through a gap in the woods, sparkling like jewels on the flowers draped over the wreck. It started to get cold, the ebb tide pulling out to sea and the schooner leaning further onto its side. I moved forward and looked over the edge, judging the water shallow enough. Clutching the cut rope for support, I carefully lowered myself overboard. The water barely came up to my waist, and the sandy bottom was solid, marked by ripples. I waded to the shore feeling quite cheerful, leaving the Hispaniola on her side, with its main-sail spreading across the surface of the bay. Right about then, the sun set completely and the wind whistled softly among the swaying pines in the twilight."

There lay the schooner, clear at last from buccaneers and ready for our own men to board and get to sea again. I had nothing nearer my fancy than to get home to the stockade and boast of my achievements. Possibly I might be blamed a bit for my truantry, but the recapture of the Hispaniola was a clenching answer, and I hoped that even Captain Smollett would confess I had not lost my time.\nSo thinking, and in famous spirits, I began to set my face homeward for the block house and my companions. I remembered that the most easterly of the rivers which drain into Captain Kidd’s anchorage ran from the two-peaked hill upon my left, and I bent my course in that direction that I might pass the stream while it was small. The wood was pretty open, and keeping along the lower spurs, I had soon turned the corner of that hill, and not long after waded to the mid-calf across the watercourse.\nThis brought me near to where I had encountered Ben Gunn, the maroon; and I walked more circumspectly, keeping an eye on every side. The dusk had come nigh hand completely, and as I opened out the cleft between the two peaks, I became aware of a wavering glow against the sky, where, as I judged, the man of the island was cooking his supper before a roaring fire. And yet I wondered, in my heart, that he should show himself so careless. For if I could see this radiance, might it not reach the eyes of Silver himself where he camped upon the shore among the marshes?",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Finally, I was back on land, free from the sea, and I hadn't returned without success. The schooner lay anchored, at last clear of the pirates and ready for our own men to board and sail again. More than anything else, I wanted to get back to the stockade and tell everyone about my accomplishment. Perhaps I might face some reprimand for wandering off, but taking back the Hispaniola was a conclusive argument, and I hoped that even Captain Smollett would agree my time had been well spent.\n\nThinking this way and feeling very pleased, I started making my way back towards the blockhouse to rejoin my companions. I remembered that the most easterly river that flows into Captain Kidd's anchorage originated from the two-peaked hill to my left, and I angled my path in that direction so I could cross the stream while it was still small. The woods were fairly open, and by following the lower parts of the hillside, I soon rounded the corner of that hill and not long after waded through the stream, which only came up to my mid-calf.\n\nThis brought me near the place where I had met Ben Gunn, the man marooned on the island; as a result, I walked with greater caution, keeping a close watch on all sides. The twilight had almost completely settled, and as I moved through the opening between the two peaks, I became aware of a fluctuating light against the sky. I guessed that the island man was preparing his supper there over a large fire. Still, I was puzzled as to why he would display such carelessness. If I could see this radiance, might it not also be visible to Silver, who was camped near the shore among the marshes?",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Finally, I had left the sea behind, and I hadn’t come back empty-handed. The schooner was now free of pirates and ready for our crew to board and sail away. My only wish was to get back to the stockade to share my success. I figured I might get in trouble for sneaking off, but taking back the Hispaniola should make up for it, and I even hoped Captain Smollett would agree I’d put my time to good use. In high spirits, I set off for the blockhouse to reunite with my friends. I recalled that the easternmost stream feeding Captain Kidd’s anchorage came from a twin-peaked hill on my left, so I headed that way, planning to cross the stream while it was still shallow. The forest was fairly open, and keeping to the foothills, I soon rounded the corner of the hill and waded through the creek, the water reaching my calves. This brought me close to where I’d first met Ben Gunn, the marooned sailor, so I moved more cautiously, staying alert. Dusk was almost complete, and as I passed between the two peaks, I noticed a flickering light in the sky—what I guessed was the islander cooking dinner over a large fire. Still, I was surprised at how careless he seemed; if I could spot the fire, wasn’t it possible that Silver and his men on the shore would see it too?"

At the same time, it was clear they weren’t keeping a good lookout—if Silver and his men had been sneaking up, nobody would have noticed until it was too late.

The pirates were in possession of the house and stores: there was the cask of cognac, there were the pork and bread, as before, and what tenfold increased my horror, not a sign of any prisoner. I could only judge that all had perished, and my heart smote me sorely that I had not been there to perish with them.\nThere were six of the buccaneers, all told; not another man was left alive. Five of them were on their feet, flushed and swollen, suddenly called out of the first sleep of drunkenness. The sixth had only risen upon his elbow; he was deadly pale, and the blood-stained bandage round his head told that he had recently been wounded, and still more recently dressed. I remembered the man who had been shot and had run back among the woods in the great attack, and doubted not that this was he.\nThe parrot sat, preening her plumage, on Long John’s shoulder. He himself, I thought, looked somewhat paler and more stern than I was used to. He still wore the fine broadcloth suit in which he had fulfilled his mission, but it was bitterly the worse for wear, daubed with clay and torn with the sharp briers of the wood.\n“So,” said he, “here’s Jim Hawkins, shiver my timbers! Dropped in, like, eh? Well, come, I take that friendly.”\nAnd thereupon he sat down across the brandy cask and began to fill a pipe.\n“Give me a loan of the link, Dick,” said he; and then, when he had a good light, “That’ll do, lad,” he added; “stick the glim in the wood heap; and you, gentlemen, bring yourselves to! You needn’t stand up for Mr. Hawkins; he’ll excuse you, you may lay to that. And so, Jim”—stopping the tobacco—“here you were, and quite a pleasant surprise for poor old John. I see you were smart when first I set my eyes on you, but this here gets away from me clean, it do.”\nTo all this, as may be well supposed, I made no answer. They had set me with my back against the wall, and I stood there, looking Silver in the face, pluckily enough, I hope, to all outward appearance, but with black despair in my heart.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The red glow of the torch lighting up the inside of the blockhouse confirmed my worst fears were realized. The pirates were now in control of the house and supplies; the cask of brandy, the pork, and bread were still there, exactly as before. What increased my horror ten times over was the complete absence of any prisoners. I could only assume that everyone had perished, and I was deeply sorry that I hadn't been there to die alongside them. There were six pirates in total, with no other survivors. Five were standing, their faces red and puffy, having been abruptly awakened from their initial drunken sleep. The sixth had only managed to raise himself onto his elbow; he was extremely pale, and the blood-stained bandage around his head indicated he had been recently injured and even more recently treated. I remembered the man who was shot during the major attack and ran back into the woods, and I had no doubt this was he. The parrot sat on Long John's shoulder, smoothing her feathers. Silver himself, I thought, appeared somewhat paler and more serious than I was used to seeing him. He was still wearing the fine broadcloth suit he had on for his mission, but it was significantly damaged, smeared with mud and torn by the sharp bushes of the woods. \"So,\" he said, \"here's Jim Hawkins, well I'll be blown! Just dropped in, have you? Well, come on, I call that friendly.\" And with that, he sat down on the brandy cask and began filling a pipe. \"Let me borrow the light, Dick,\" he said; and then, once he had a good flame, \"That's enough, lad,\" he added; \"stick the light in the wood pile; and you gentlemen, settle yourselves! You don't need to get up for Mr. Hawkins; you can count on him excusing you. And so, Jim\"—pausing his tobacco packing—\"here you were, and quite a pleasant surprise for poor old John. I saw you were sharp when I first laid eyes on you, but this here completely amazes me, it does.\" To all this, as you might expect, I gave no reply. They had placed me with my back against the wall, and I stood there, facing Silver. I hope I appeared brave enough outwardly, but inside, my heart was filled with utter despair.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The red light from the torch illuminated the inside of the block house, confirming my worst fears. The pirates had taken control of the dwelling and the supplies—there was the barrel of brandy, along with the pork and bread, just as before. What made the scene even more horrifying was the absence of any prisoners; it seemed as though everyone had been killed, and I was wracked with guilt for not having been with them in their final moments. There were six pirates present in total; all others appeared to be dead. Five were on their feet, their faces flushed and swollen, having just been roused from drunken slumber. The sixth lay propped up on his elbow, extremely pale, with a bloodied bandage on his head showing he was recently wounded and only just tended to. I remembered the man who had been shot and fled into the woods during the earlier attack, and was sure this was him. The parrot was sitting on Long John Silver’s shoulder, preening its feathers. Silver himself seemed paler and more severe than usual; he still wore his once-fine broadcloth suit, now dirty and torn by briars. 'Well, here’s Jim Hawkins—shiver my timbers!' he exclaimed. 'You’ve just dropped in, have you? That’s friendly, I suppose.' He sat down across the brandy cask and began to pack his pipe. 'Lend me the torch, Dick,' he said, and after lighting his pipe he instructed Dick to place the torch among the woodpile. He told the other pirates to make themselves comfortable, saying there was no need to stand on ceremony for me. Then, addressing me, he remarked that my arrival was a real surprise, more than he would have expected. I did not reply. They placed me with my back to the wall, and I stood facing Silver—trying to appear courageous, though inwardly I was filled with utter despair."

          "text_segment": "Silver took a whiff or two of his pipe with great composure and then ran on again.\n“Now, you see, Jim, so be as you are here,” says he, “I’ll give you a piece of my mind. I’ve always liked you, I have, for a lad of spirit, and the picter of my own self when I was young and handsome. I always wanted you to jine and take your share, and die a gentleman, and now, my cock, you’ve got to. Cap’n Smollett’s a fine seaman, as I’ll own up to any day, but stiff on discipline. ‘Dooty is dooty,’ says he, and right he is. Just you keep clear of the cap’n. The doctor himself is gone dead again’ you—‘ungrateful scamp’ was what he said; and the short and the long of the whole story is about here: you can’t go back to your own lot, for they won’t have you; and without you start a third ship’s company all by yourself, which might be lonely, you’ll have to jine with Cap’n Silver.”\nSo far so good. My friends, then, were still alive, and though I partly believed the truth of Silver’s statement, that the cabin party were incensed at me for my desertion, I was more relieved than distressed by what I heard.\n“I don’t say nothing as to your being in our hands,” continued Silver, “though there you are, and you may lay to it. I’m all for argyment; I never seen good come out o’ threatening. If you like the service, well, you’ll jine; and if you don’t, Jim, why, you’re free to answer no—free and welcome, shipmate; and if fairer can be said by mortal seaman, shiver my sides!”\n“Am I to answer, then?” I asked with a very tremulous voice. Through all this sneering talk, I was made to feel the threat of death that overhung me, and my cheeks burned and my heart beat painfully in my breast.\n“Lad,” said Silver, “no one’s a-pressing of you. Take your bearings. None of us won’t hurry you, mate; time goes so pleasant in your company, you see.”\n“Well,” says I, growing a bit bolder, “if I’m to choose, I declare I have a right to know what’s what, and why you’re here, and where my friends are.”\n“Wot’s wot?” repeated one of the buccaneers in a deep growl. “Ah, he’d be a lucky one as knowed that!”\n“You’ll perhaps batten down your hatches till you’re spoke to, my friend,” cried Silver truculently to this speaker. And then, in his first gracious tones, he replied to me, “Yesterday morning, Mr. Hawkins,” said he, “in the dog-watch, down came Doctor Livesey with a flag of truce. Says he, ‘Cap’n Silver, you’re sold out. Ship’s gone.’ Well, maybe we’d been taking a glass, and a song to help it round. I won’t say no. Leastways, none of us had looked out. We looked out, and by thunder, the old ship was gone! I never seen a pack o’ fools look fishier; and you may lay to that, if I tells you that looked the fishiest. ‘Well,’ says the doctor, ‘let’s bargain.’ We bargained, him and I, and here we are: stores, brandy, block house, the firewood you was thoughtful enough to cut, and in a manner of speaking, the whole blessed boat, from cross-trees to kelson. As for them, they’ve tramped; I don’t know where’s they are.”\nHe drew again quietly at his pipe.\n“And lest you should take it into that head of yours,” he went on, “that you was included in the treaty, here’s the last word that was said: ‘How many are you,’ says I, ‘to leave?’ ‘Four,’ says he; ‘four, and one of us wounded. As for that boy, I don’t know where he is, confound him,’ says he, ‘nor I don’t much care. We’re about sick of him.’ These was his words.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "After calmly taking a few puffs from his pipe, Silver resumed talking. He told Jim that since he was there, he would speak frankly. Silver claimed he had always liked Jim because he was a lively boy and reminded him of his younger, more attractive self. He had always wanted Jim to join their crew, share the spoils, and become a gentleman, and now, he asserted, Jim had no other option. Silver acknowledged Captain Smollett was a skilled seaman but too rigid regarding discipline, agreeing that Smollett was right to say \"Duty is duty.\" He advised Jim to steer clear of the captain. Silver also mentioned that the doctor was now completely against Jim, having called him an \"ungrateful rogue.\" The essence of the situation, Silver explained, was that Jim couldn't go back to his friends because they wouldn't welcome him, and short of forming his own lonely third group, he had to side with Captain Silver. Jim was relieved that his friends were still alive. Although he somewhat believed Silver's claim that the cabin crew were angry at him for leaving, he felt more comforted than upset by this information. Silver continued, stating that while Jim was undeniably in their power and should accept that, he preferred discussion over threats. He said he had never seen good come from intimidation. He told Jim that if he liked the prospect, he could join them, but if not, he was free to say no – he was welcome to refuse, calling Jim \"shipmate.\" Silver challenged anyone to make a fairer offer. Hesitantly, with a shaky voice, Jim asked if he was expected to answer. Despite Silver's seemingly easy conversation, Jim acutely felt the underlying threat of death, causing his cheeks to burn and his heart to beat painfully fast. Silver responded, telling the boy that no one was pressuring him. He advised him to consider his options. They wouldn't rush him because, Silver claimed, time passed pleasantly in Jim's company. Gaining a little confidence, Jim said that if he had to choose, he felt he had the right to understand the full situation: what was happening, why Silver's group was there, and the location of his friends. One of the pirates responded with a deep growl, repeating, \"What's what?\" and adding that it would be lucky to know. Silver fiercely ordered the pirate to be quiet until he was spoken to. Then, switching back to his kind tone towards Jim, he replied. He explained that the previous morning, during the dog-watch, Dr. Livesey arrived under a flag of truce. The doctor told Silver their side was defeated because the ship was gone. Silver admitted they might have been drinking and singing and hadn't been keeping watch. When they did look, the old ship was indeed gone! He claimed he had never seen a group of fools look more confused, and guaranteed that he himself looked the most confused. The doctor then suggested bargaining. Silver and the doctor negotiated, and the result was that Silver's group now had the supplies, brandy, the blockhouse, the firewood Jim had thoughtfully cut, and effectively, the entire property from mast-tops to the ship's bottom (meaning everything). As for Jim's friends, Silver said they had \"tramped off\" and he didn't know where they were. He quietly took another drag from his pipe. Silver added that to prevent Jim from thinking he was included in the treaty, he would relate the final exchange. Silver had asked how many people were leaving. The doctor replied, \"Four,\" adding that one was wounded. As for the boy (Jim), the doctor said he didn't know where he was, didn't really care, and was \"pretty tired of him.\" Silver insisted those were the doctor's exact words.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Silver calmly puffed on his pipe before speaking again. \"Listen here, Jim,\" he said, \"since you're now with us, I'll be straight with you. I've always liked your spirit—you remind me of myself when I was young. I always hoped you'd join us, share in our fortunes, and live as a gentleman. Now, you have no other choice. Captain Smollett is a good sailor, but he's strict about discipline. He says duty is duty, and he means it. Best to stay away from him. The doctor has turned against you—called you an ungrateful scamp. In short, your old group won't take you back, and unless you want to set out alone, your only option is to side with me, Captain Silver.\" That was somewhat reassuring to me—my friends must still be alive. While part of me thought what Silver said was true and that my former companions were angry at me for leaving, I wasn't as upset as I might have expected; I was more relieved.\n\nSilver continued, \"I'm not saying anything about you being in our custody—you are, no denying that. But I'm a man of discussion, not threats. If you want to join us, that's great. If not, you're free to refuse—no pressure. And if anyone could be fairer, shiver my timbers!\" \n\n\"Should I answer now?\" I asked, my voice trembling. Despite Silver’s seemingly friendly talk, I could sense the danger I was in, and I felt anxious and afraid. Silver replied, \"No rush, lad. Take your time—none of us are going to push you. We enjoy your company, so there's no hurry.\"\n\nI swallowed my nerves and said, \"If I'm to decide, I have a right to know what's going on—why you’re here, and where my friends are.\"\n\n\"What's going on?\" growled one pirate. \"He'd be lucky to know that!\" Silver sharply told the pirate to keep quiet, and then, in a kinder tone, explained to me. \"Yesterday morning, Hawkins, Doctor Livesey came under a flag of truce and told me, 'Captain Silver, you've been outwitted. The ship's gone.' Maybe we were enjoying a drink at the time and weren't paying attention, but when we checked, sure enough, the ship was missing. We were stunned. The doctor then proposed a deal. We negotiated, and here we are—supplies, brandy, the block house, and all the firewood you helped gather, basically everything aboard. As for your friends, they've left—I don't know where they’ve gone.\"\n\nHe resumed smoking his pipe and added, \"And in case you're thinking that you're covered by the deal, let me be clear about what was said. I asked, 'How many are leaving?' He said, 'Four, and one of them wounded. As for that boy, I don't know where he is, and to be frank, I don't much care. We're tired of him.' Those were his words.\""

Let the worst come to the worst, it’s little I care. I’ve seen too many die since I fell in with you. But there’s a thing or two I have to tell you,” I said, and by this time I was quite excited; “and the first is this: here you are, in a bad way—ship lost, treasure lost, men lost, your whole business gone to wreck; and if you want to know who did it—it was I! I was in the apple barrel the night we sighted land, and I heard you, John, and you, Dick Johnson, and Hands, who is now at the bottom of the sea, and told every word you said before the hour was out. And as for the schooner, it was I who cut her cable, and it was I that killed the men you had aboard of her, and it was I who brought her where you’ll never see her more, not one of you. The laugh’s on my side; I’ve had the top of this business from the first; I no more fear you than I fear a fly. Kill me, if you please, or spare me. But one thing I’ll say, and no more; if you spare me, bygones are bygones, and when you fellows are in court for piracy, I’ll save you all I can. It is for you to choose. Kill another and do yourselves no good, or spare me and keep a witness to save you from the gallows.”\nI stopped, for, I tell you, I was out of breath, and to my wonder, not a man of them moved, but all sat staring at me like as many sheep. And while they were still staring, I broke out again, “And now, Mr. Silver,” I said, “I believe you’re the best man here, and if things go to the worst, I’ll take it kind of you to let the doctor know the way I took it.”\n“I’ll bear it in mind,” said Silver with an accent so curious that I could not, for the life of me, decide whether he were laughing at my request or had been favourably affected by my courage.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“Is that all?” I inquired. “Well, that’s the extent of what you’re privy to, lad,” Silver responded. “So, I get to decide now?” I asked. “Indeed, the decision is yours to make, and you can be sure of that,” Silver affirmed. “Alright,” I said, “I’m not so ignorant that I don’t have a good idea of what lies ahead. Even if the worst happens, I’m not overly concerned. I’ve witnessed too much death since joining your company. But there are a couple of things I need to inform you of,” I continued, feeling quite agitated by this point; “and the first is this: you find yourselves in a dire predicament—your vessel gone, your riches lost, your men dead, your entire venture ruined. And if you want to know who is responsible—it was me! I was hidden in the apple barrel the night we first saw land, and I overheard your conversation, John, and yours, Dick Johnson, and Hands’, who now rests at the sea floor, and I reported everything you said within the hour. As for the schooner, I cut her anchor cable, I killed the men you had aboard her, and I brought her to a location where none of you will ever find her again. The victory is mine; I’ve been in control of this whole affair from the beginning; I have no more fear of you than I do of an insect. Go ahead and kill me if you wish, or let me live. But I will say one more thing, and that is all; if you spare me, we can put the past behind us, and when you fellows are brought to trial for piracy, I will do everything in my power to defend you. It is your choice. Kill another person and gain nothing, or spare me and keep a witness who can save you from the gallows.” I paused, quite out of breath, I must confess, and to my astonishment, none of them stirred; they all remained seated, staring at me like a flock of sheep. And while they were still fixedly gazing, I spoke again, “And now, Mr. Silver,” I said, “I believe you are the most capable man here, and if things take a turn for the worse, I would appreciate it if you would tell the doctor how I met my end.” “I shall keep that in mind,” Silver replied with a tone so peculiar that I was completely unable to determine whether he was mocking my request or was genuinely impressed by my courage.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"Is that all?\" I asked.\n\"That’s all I’m going to tell you, boy,\" Silver replied.\n\"So now I have to decide?\"\n\"Yes, it’s your choice now, and you can trust that,\" Silver said.\n\"Well,\" I said, \"I’m not so naive that I don’t know what I’m up against. Whatever happens, I don’t really care, because I’ve seen so much death since meeting you. But I have a couple of things to confess,\" I went on, getting more and more agitated. \"First of all, you’re in a tough spot: you’ve lost your ship, your treasure, your crew, and your whole plan is ruined. And if you want to know who’s responsible, it was me! I was hiding in the apple barrel the night we spotted land, and I overheard you, John, Dick Johnson, and Hands—who’s now dead—and I told everyone what you planned that very night. I was the one who cut the schooner's cable, I killed your men on board, and I sailed her somewhere you’ll never find her. I’ve outwitted you from the start; I’m not afraid of you at all. You can kill me if you want, or spare me, but let me say one more thing: if you let me live, I’ll forget the past, and if you’re taken to court for piracy, I’ll do my best to help you all. The choice is yours: kill me and gain nothing, or spare me and keep someone who might save you from hanging.\"\nI stopped, breathless, and to my surprise, none of them moved. They all just stared at me in shock. Then I continued, \"And now, Mr. Silver, I think you’re the best man among them, and if things go badly for me, I’d appreciate it if you tell the doctor how I handled it.\"\n\"I’ll remember that,\" Silver answered, but his tone was so odd that I couldn’t tell if he was amused by what I’d said or impressed by my bravery."

For it was this same boy that faked the chart from Billy Bones. First and last, we’ve split upon Jim Hawkins!”\n“Then here goes!” said Morgan with an oath.\nAnd he sprang up, drawing his knife as if he had been twenty.\n“Avast, there!” cried Silver. “Who are you, Tom Morgan? Maybe you thought you was cap’n here, perhaps. By the powers, but I’ll teach you better! Cross me, and you’ll go where many a good man’s gone before you, first and last, these thirty year back—some to the yard-arm, shiver my timbers, and some by the board, and all to feed the fishes. There’s never a man looked me between the eyes and seen a good day a’terwards, Tom Morgan, you may lay to that.”\nMorgan paused, but a hoarse murmur rose from the others.\n“Tom’s right,” said one.\n“I stood hazing long enough from one,” added another. “I’ll be hanged if I’ll be hazed by you, John Silver.”\n“Did any of you gentlemen want to have it out with me?” roared Silver, bending far forward from his position on the keg, with his pipe still glowing in his right hand. “Put a name on what you’re at; you ain’t dumb, I reckon. Him that wants shall get it. Have I lived this many years, and a son of a rum puncheon cock his hat athwart my hawse at the latter end of it? You know the way; you’re all gentlemen o’ fortune, by your account. Well, I’m ready. Take a cutlass, him that dares, and I’ll see the colour of his inside, crutch and all, before that pipe’s empty.”\nNot a man stirred; not a man answered.\n“That’s your sort, is it?” he added, returning his pipe to his mouth. “Well, you’re a gay lot to look at, anyway. Not much worth to fight, you ain’t. P’r’aps you can understand King George’s English. I’m cap’n here by ’lection. I’m cap’n here because I’m the best man by a long sea-mile. You won’t fight, as gentlemen o’ fortune should; then, by thunder, you’ll obey, and you may lay to it! I like that boy, now; I never seen a better boy than that. He’s more a man than any pair of rats of you in this here house, and what I say is this: let me see him that’ll lay a hand on him—that’s what I say, and you may lay to it.”\nThere was a long pause after this. I stood straight up against the wall, my heart still going like a sledge-hammer, but with a ray of hope now shining in my bosom. Silver leant back against the wall, his arms crossed, his pipe in the corner of his mouth, as calm as though he had been in church; yet his eye kept wandering furtively, and he kept the tail of it on his unruly followers. They, on their part, drew gradually together towards the far end of the block house, and the low hiss of their whispering sounded in my ear continuously, like a stream. One after another, they would look up, and the red light of the torch would fall for a second on their nervous faces; but it was not towards me, it was towards Silver that they turned their eyes.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“I can confirm that,” declared the old sailor with the dark red face named Morgan, whom I had previously encountered at Long John’s tavern on the Bristol docks. “He was the one who knew Black Dog.” “Right, and listen here,” added the cook. “I’ll back that up entirely, by thunder! Because it was this very boy who stole the chart from Billy Bones. Ultimately, Jim Hawkins is the cause of all our troubles!” “Then let’s do it!” said Morgan, swearing. And he leaped up, pulling out his knife as swiftly as a young man. “Stop right there!” Silver shouted. “Who do you think you are, Tom Morgan? Maybe you thought you were the captain here, perhaps. By the powers, I’ll show you otherwise! Cross me, and you’ll end up where many a good man has before you, over the past thirty years—some strung from the yardarm, blast my eyes, and some thrown overboard, all to feed the sharks. No man has ever looked me in the eye and seen a good day afterward, Tom Morgan, you can count on that.” Morgan paused, but a low, rough murmur rose from the others. “Tom’s correct,” one said. “I’ve taken enough disrespect from one person,” another added. “I’ll be damned if I’ll be disrespected by you, John Silver.” “Do any of you gentlemen want to settle things with me?” roared Silver, leaning far forward from his seat on the keg, his pipe still glowing in his right hand. “Say what you’re thinking; I know you aren’t speechless. Whoever wants trouble will get it. Have I lived this long, only for some worthless fellow to challenge my authority now? You know the way; you all call yourselves gentlemen of fortune. Well, I’m ready. Let the man who dares take a cutlass, and I’ll show you what his insides look like, crutch and all, before this pipe is out.” Not a man moved; not a man replied. “So, that’s your courage, is it?” he added, putting his pipe back in his mouth. “Well, you’re a amusing bunch to behold, anyway. Not much good at fighting, you aren’t. Perhaps you can understand straightforward English. I’m the captain here by choice. I’m the captain here because I’m the best man by a wide margin. You won’t fight, as gentlemen of fortune should; then, by thunder, you’ll obey, and you can rely on that! I like that boy, now; I’ve never met a finer boy. He has more courage than any two of you cowards in this building, and here’s what I say: let me see the man who will lay a hand on him—that’s what I say, and you can be sure of it.” A long silence followed this. I stood stiffly against the wall, my heart still pounding like a hammer, but with a glimmer of hope now flickering within me. Silver leaned back against the wall, his arms crossed, his pipe in the corner of his mouth, looking as calm as if he were in church; yet his eyes kept subtly scanning, and he kept them fixed on his rebellious followers. They, for their part, slowly drew together towards the far end of the block house, and the soft hiss of their whispering continuously reached my ear, like a flowing stream. One after another, they would glance up, and the red light of the torch would momentarily illuminate their tense faces; but their eyes were not turned towards me, but towards Silver.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The old sailor with a mahogany complexion—Morgan, whom I recognized from Long John’s tavern in Bristol—shouted, “I’ll agree with that! He’s the one who knew Black Dog.” The sea-cook added, “And let me add another point: it was this same boy who tricked Billy Bones out of his chart. One way or another, Jim Hawkins has been the root of our troubles!” Morgan then cursed and jumped up, brandishing his knife as though he were still young. Silver shouted, “Hold it, Tom Morgan! Maybe you think you’re captain here, but I’ll show you differently! If you cross me, you’ll end up like many others over the last thirty years—some hanged from the yard-arm, some tossed overboard, all fed to the fishes. No man’s ever looked me in the eye and had a good outcome, Tom Morgan, you can count on that.” Morgan hesitated, but the others began to grumble agreement. One said, “Tom’s right,” and another added, “I’ve endured enough bullying from someone—I won’t take it from you, John Silver.” Silver leaned forward on the keg, pipe still lit in his hand, and yelled, “Who among you wants to settle this with me? Speak up! If anyone dares, grab a cutlass, and I’ll see what you’re made of before my pipe’s finished. Have I lived these many years just to be defied at the end by someone like you? You’re all supposed to be gentlemen of fortune. Well, if you want it, come and get it.” No one responded or moved. Silver replaced his pipe and said, “So that’s how you are. You’re not much for fighting. Maybe you understand plain English—I’m captain by election and because I’m the best man by far. If you won’t fight like proper pirates, then you’ll obey—count on it! As for this boy, I have to say, I’ve never met a better one. He has more courage than any two of you. If any of you tries to touch him, you’ll answer to me—count on that.” There was a long silence. I stood straight against the wall, my heart pounding but now with a glimmer of hope. Silver leaned back calmly against the wall, pipe in his mouth, arms crossed, but he kept a wary eye on his rebellious crew, who gathered at the far end of the blockhouse, whispering among themselves. Occasionally, they glanced at Silver, their faces lit momentarily by torchlight, but none dared turn their eyes on me; their attention was fixed on him."

          "text_segment": "“You seem to have a lot to say,” remarked Silver, spitting far into the air. “Pipe up and let me hear it, or lay to.”\n“Ax your pardon, sir,” returned one of the men; “you’re pretty free with some of the rules; maybe you’ll kindly keep an eye upon the rest. This crew’s dissatisfied; this crew don’t vally bullying a marlin-spike; this crew has its rights like other crews, I’ll make so free as that; and by your own rules, I take it we can talk together. I ax your pardon, sir, acknowledging you for to be capting at this present; but I claim my right, and steps outside for a council.”\nAnd with an elaborate sea-salute, this fellow, a long, ill-looking, yellow-eyed man of five and thirty, stepped coolly towards the door and disappeared out of the house. One after another the rest followed his example, each making a salute as he passed, each adding some apology. “According to rules,” said one. “Forecastle council,” said Morgan. And so with one remark or another all marched out and left Silver and me alone with the torch.\nThe sea-cook instantly removed his pipe.\n“Now, look you here, Jim Hawkins,” he said in a steady whisper that was no more than audible, “you’re within half a plank of death, and what’s a long sight worse, of torture. They’re going to throw me off. But, you mark, I stand by you through thick and thin. I didn’t mean to; no, not till you spoke up. I was about desperate to lose that much blunt, and be hanged into the bargain. But I see you was the right sort. I says to myself, you stand by Hawkins, John, and Hawkins’ll stand by you. You’re his last card, and by the living thunder, John, he’s yours! Back to back, says I. You save your witness, and he’ll save your neck!”\nI began dimly to understand.\n“You mean all’s lost?” I asked.\n“Aye, by gum, I do!” he answered. “Ship gone, neck gone—that’s the size of it. Once I looked into that bay, Jim Hawkins, and seen no schooner—well, I’m tough, but I gave out. As for that lot and their council, mark me, they’re outright fools and cowards. I’ll save your life—if so be as I can—from them. But, see here, Jim—tit for tat—you save Long John from swinging.”\nI was bewildered; it seemed a thing so hopeless he was asking—he, the old buccaneer, the ringleader throughout.\n“What I can do, that I’ll do,” I said.\n“It’s a bargain!” cried Long John. “You speak up plucky, and by thunder, I’ve a chance!”\nHe hobbled to the torch, where it stood propped among the firewood, and took a fresh light to his pipe.\n“Understand me, Jim,” he said, returning. “I’ve a head on my shoulders, I have. I’m on squire’s side now. I know you’ve got that ship safe somewheres. How you done it, I don’t know, but safe it is. I guess Hands and O’Brien turned soft. I never much believed in neither of them. Now you mark me. I ask no questions, nor I won’t let others. I know when a game’s up, I do; and I know a lad that’s staunch. Ah, you that’s young—you and me might have done a power of good together!”\nHe drew some cognac from the cask into a tin cannikin.\n“Will you taste, messmate?” he asked; and when I had refused: “Well, I’ll take a dram myself, Jim,” said he. “I need a caulker, for there’s trouble on hand. And talking o’ trouble, why did that doctor give me the chart, Jim?”\nMy face expressed a wonder so unaffected that he saw the needlessness of further questions.\n“Ah, well, he did, though,” said he. “And there’s something under that, no doubt—something, surely, under that, Jim—bad or good.”\nAnd he took another swallow of the brandy, shaking his great fair head like a man who looks forward to the worst.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“You seem quite talkative,” Silver remarked, spitting a good distance. “Speak your piece now so I can hear it, or be quiet.” “Begging your pardon, sir,” one of the men replied, “you’re quite casual with some rules; perhaps you could pay attention to the others. This crew is unhappy; this crew doesn’t value being pushed around; this crew has its rights like any other crew, I’ll be bold enough to state that; and by your own regulations, I believe we’re allowed to converse amongst ourselves. I beg your pardon, sir, acknowledging you as the current captain; but I assert my right and am stepping outside for a discussion.” Following an elaborate nautical salute, this individual, a tall, unpleasant-looking man with yellow eyes, about thirty-five, calmly headed for the door and exited the building. The others followed suit, one by one, each offering a salute as they passed, and adding some form of explanation. “According to regulations,” one said. “Forecastle meeting,” said Morgan. And so, with various comments, they all left, leaving just Silver, me, and the torch. The sea cook immediately took his pipe from his mouth. “Now, pay attention, Jim Hawkins,” he said in a low, steady whisper that was barely audible, “you are within inches of death, and far worse, of suffering. They intend to abandon me. But, understand this, I will support you through thick and thin. I didn’t plan to; no, not until you spoke up. I was utterly desperate at the thought of losing all that money and being hanged besides. But I saw you were the right sort. I told myself, you stick by Hawkins, John, and Hawkins will stick by you. You are his last hope, and by thunder, John, he is yours! Side by side, I said. You protect your witness, and he will protect your neck!” I began to grasp the situation vaguely. “You mean everything is lost?” I asked. “Yes, absolutely!” he confirmed. “Ship gone, neck gone—that’s the summary. The moment I looked into that bay, Jim Hawkins, and saw no schooner—well, I’m resilient, but I gave up. As for that group and their meeting, mark my words, they are utter fools and cowards. I will save your life—if I possibly can—from them. But, listen, Jim—a fair exchange—you save Long John from being hanged.” I was confused; what he was asking seemed impossible—him, the veteran pirate, the leader throughout. “Whatever I can do, I will do,” I said. “It’s agreed!” Long John exclaimed. “You speak bravely, and by thunder, I have a fighting chance!” He limped over to the torch, propped amongst the firewood, and relit his pipe. “Understand me, Jim,” he said, returning. “I’m not stupid, I have a good head. I’m on the squire’s side now. I know you’ve secured that ship somewhere safely. How you managed it, I don’t know, but it is safe. I assume Hands and O’Brien failed. I never really trusted either of them. Now pay attention. I will ask no questions, nor will I let others. I know when a situation is hopeless, I do; and I know a steadfast lad. Ah, you who are young—you and I could have accomplished a great deal together!” He poured some brandy from the barrel into a metal cup. “Will you try some, shipmate?” he asked; and when I declined: “Well, I’ll have a drink myself, Jim,” he said. “I need a strong one, because trouble is brewing. And speaking of trouble, why did that doctor give me the chart, Jim?” My face showed such genuine surprise that he saw there was no need for more questions. “Ah, well, he did, though,” he said. “And there’s something behind that, no doubt—something, surely, behind that, Jim—whether good or bad.” And he took another drink of the brandy, shaking his large, light-colored head like a man anticipating the worst.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Silver, spitting into the air, commented, “You have a lot to say. Speak up so I can hear you, or keep quiet.”\n\nOne of the men answered, “Excuse me, sir, but you tend to bend the rules. Maybe you’ll keep to them for everyone. The crew is unhappy and doesn’t care for intimidation. We have rights like any crew, so let’s talk about it. I acknowledge you as captain for now, but I claim my right to speak and will step outside for a council.”\n\nWith an exaggerated sailor’s salute, this long, rough-looking man of about thirty-five walked out the door. The rest of the men followed him, each saluting and offering an excuse. “It’s by the rules,” said one. “It’s a forecastle council,” added Morgan. Soon, they had all filed out, leaving only Silver and me in the room with the torch.\n\nSilver immediately took out his pipe and leaned in to whisper, almost too quietly for anyone but me to hear: “Listen, Jim Hawkins, you’re only a step away from death or, worse, torture. They plan to get rid of me, but I’ll stick with you no matter what. I didn’t plan this until you spoke up. I was desperate about losing all that money and getting hanged. But I saw you had backbone. I told myself, ‘Stick with Hawkins, John, and he’ll stick with you. You’re his last hope—and he’s yours! Stand back to back. You save your witness, and he’ll save your neck!’”\n\nI started to understand. \n\n“So everything’s lost?” I asked.\n\n“Absolutely,” he answered. “The ship is gone, we’re done for. As soon as I saw the bay empty, I knew it was over. As for those men, they’re fools and cowards. I’ll try to save you from them if I can. But, Jim, you have to save Long John from being hanged.”\n\nI was confused. It seemed impossible, coming from him—the leader of the pirates.\n\n“I’ll do what I can,” I said.\n\n“It’s a deal!” cried Long John. “You’re brave, and now I have a chance!”\n\nHe limped over to the torch, relit his pipe, and came back. \n\n“Listen, Jim,” he said. “I’m clever. I’m on the squire’s side now. I know you’ve hidden the ship somewhere. I’m not sure how, but I trust it’s safe. Hands and O’Brien must have turned soft, but I never much trusted them anyway. Now, don’t worry—I won’t ask questions, nor will I let others. I know when the game’s up, and I know a loyal lad when I see one. You and I, Jim, could have done a lot together.”\n\nHe poured some brandy into a tin cup. “Want some, mate?” he asked. When I declined, he said, “Well, I’ll have some. I need it, because trouble is coming. Speaking of which, why did the doctor give me the map, Jim?”\n\nI must have looked so surprised that he realized I had nothing to do with it.\n\n“Well, he did,” said Silver. “And there must be a reason for it, surely—good or bad.” He took another drink and shook his head, clearly expecting the worst to come."

Silver briefly agreed, and this emissary retired again, leaving us together in the dark.\n“There’s a breeze coming, Jim,” said Silver, who had by this time adopted quite a friendly and familiar tone.\nI turned to the loophole nearest me and looked out. The embers of the great fire had so far burned themselves out and now glowed so low and duskily that I understood why these conspirators desired a torch. About half-way down the slope to the stockade, they were collected in a group; one held the light, another was on his knees in their midst, and I saw the blade of an open knife shine in his hand with varying colours in the moon and torchlight. The rest were all somewhat stooping, as though watching the manoeuvres of this last. I could just make out that he had a book as well as a knife in his hand, and was still wondering how anything so incongruous had come in their possession when the kneeling figure rose once more to his feet and the whole party began to move together towards the house.\n“Here they come,” said I; and I returned to my former position, for it seemed beneath my dignity that they should find me watching them.",

Then, one of them came back into the house, and with the same salute, which I found to have an insincere quality, he asked if he might borrow the torch briefly. Silver agreed without hesitation, and the messenger left again, leaving us in the dark. “A wind is starting to blow, Jim,” said Silver, who had by this point adopted a friendly and relaxed manner towards me. I turned to the closest opening I could look through and peered outside. The remains of the large fire had largely extinguished, and now only glowed faintly and indistinctly, which made it clear why these plotters needed a torch. They were assembled in a group approximately halfway down the incline towards the fort. One man held the light, another was kneeling in the middle of them, and I saw the sharp edge of an open knife in his hand catching and reflecting the light from the moon and the torch in varying hues. The others were all somewhat bowed over, as if observing the actions of the kneeling man. I could just distinguish that he held both a book and a knife, and I was still questioning how they could have acquired something so out of place when the figure who had been kneeling rose to his feet again and the entire company started advancing together towards the house. “Here they come,” I announced; and I returned to my original position, as I felt it would be undignified for them to discover me observing them.",

He greeted us as before, though it seemed mocking to me, and asked to borrow the torch for a moment. Silver agreed without much fuss, and the man left again, plunging us into darkness.\n\n\"There's a wind picking up, Jim,\" Silver said; by now he was speaking to me in a much more relaxed and friendly way.\n\nI moved to the nearest peephole and looked outside. The big bonfire had burned down, now only faintly glowing—this explained why the pirates wanted a torch. Halfway down the hill to the fort, I saw them gathered in a bunch. One pirate held up the light, while another was kneeling in the center; I could see the glint of an open knife in the flickering torch and moonlight. The others were bent over, watching what the kneeling man was doing. I noticed he held a book as well as the knife, and was still puzzled by this odd combination when the man stood up and the group started heading back towards the house.\n\n\"They're coming,\" I said, and I slipped away from the window, not wanting them to see me spying on them."

Well, who crossed me? Who forced my hand, as was the lawful cap’n? Who tipped me the black spot the day we landed and began this dance? Ah, it’s a fine dance—I’m with you there—and looks mighty like a hornpipe in a rope’s end at Execution Dock by London town, it does. But who done it? Why, it was Anderson, and Hands, and you, George Merry!

You’ve seen ’em, maybe, hanged in chains, birds about ’em, seamen p’inting ’em out as they go down with the tide. ‘Who’s that?’ says one. ‘That! Why, that’s John Silver.

And if you want to know about number four, and that boy, why, shiver my timbers, isn’t he a hostage? Are we a-going to waste a hostage? No, not us; he might be our last chance, and I shouldn’t wonder. Kill that boy? Not me, mates! And number three? Ah, well, there’s a deal to say to number three. Maybe you don’t count it nothing to have a real college doctor to see you every day—you, John, with your head broke—or you, George Merry, that had the ague shakes upon you not six hours agone, and has your eyes the colour of lemon peel to this same moment on the clock? And maybe, perhaps, you didn’t know there was a consort coming either? But there is, and not so long till then; and we’ll see who’ll be glad to have a hostage when it comes to that.

He acknowledged the voyage was a failure but asserted that if his original plan had been followed, they would all be aboard the Hispaniola tonight, alive, healthy, well-fed, and with the treasure secured. He then demanded to know who had defied him, the legitimate captain, and who had initiated their present trouble by giving him the black spot on the day they landed. He agreed their situation was dire, looking very much like a future hanging at London's Execution Dock. However, he insisted the blame rested with Anderson, Hands, and George Merry, identifying Merry as the last remaining member of that disruptive crew. He expressed his disbelief that Merry, who had caused their collective downfall, would have the nerve to try and command him, calling it the most incredible story he'd ever heard. Silver paused, and I could see that George and his remaining men were affected by his words. \"That covers the first point,\" Silver declared, wiping sweat from his face, having spoken with great intensity. He claimed he was disgusted by the mere act of speaking to them, accusing them of lacking both sense and memory, and questioning the background that led them to sea. He dismissed them as \"gentlemen of fortune,\" suggesting tailoring was a more suitable trade. \"Go on, John,\" urged Morgan. \"Address the others.\" \"Ah, the others!\" Silver replied. \"They're a fine bunch, aren't they? You say this voyage is ruined. Indeed! Good heavens, if only you understood how badly it's ruined, you would see the truth! We are so close to the gallows my neck aches just thinking about it. Perhaps you've seen men hanged in chains, birds around them, sailors pointing them out as they sail past on the tide. 'Who is that?' someone asks. 'That one! Why, that's John Silver. I knew him well,' another answers. And you can hear the chains rattling as you move towards the next buoy. Well, that's precisely where we are, every last one of us, thanks to him, and Hands, and Anderson, and the rest of you destructive fools. And if you want to know about point four, regarding that boy, well, blast my timbers, isn't he a hostage? Are we planning to waste a valuable hostage? No, not us; he might be our last chance, and I wouldn't be surprised. Kill that boy? Not me, mates! And point number three? Ah, yes, there's a lot to discuss about number three. Perhaps you don't value having a proper doctor from college examining you daily – you, John, with your head injury – or you, George Merry, who was shaking with fever less than six hours ago and still has eyes the color of lemon peel right now? And perhaps, just perhaps, you didn't know a support ship was coming either? But it is, and it won't be long before it arrives; and we'll see who's grateful to have a hostage then. And as for point number two, about why I made a deal – well, you came crawling on your hands and knees to me begging for it – you were on your knees, that's how desperate you were – and you would have starved too if I hadn't intervened – but that's a minor detail! Look there – that is the reason!\"",

Well, you all knew what I was aiming for, and if things had gone my way, we’d all be back on the Hispaniola tonight—alive, healthy, well-fed, and with the treasure safely in the hold! But who got in my way? Who undermined me when I was the rightful captain? Who gave me the black spot as soon as we landed and set us on this path? Sure, it’s been quite an adventure, but it’s starting to look like it’ll end at Execution Dock, with a rope around our necks. And whose fault is that? It was Anderson, Hands, and you, George Merry! Now you, the last of those troublemakers, have the nerve to try and take charge over me? You’ve ruined us all! This just takes the cake.\" Silver stopped, and it was clear his words had really struck George and the rest. \"That’s point one,\" he said, wiping sweat from his face—he’d been speaking so forcefully the whole place shook. \"Honestly, I’m sick of talking to you lot. You have no sense or memory, and I wonder what kind of mothers let you become sailors. 'Gentlemen of fortune?’ More like tailors, the lot of you.\" \"Go on, John,\" urged Morgan. \"Tell it to the rest.\" \"Ah yes, the rest,\" John replied, \"What a group you are! You say the journey’s been botched? You don’t even realize how badly! We’re so close to the gallows I can feel it! Have you ever seen men hanging in chains, with birds circling, and sailors pointing them out as the tide goes out? ‘Who’s that?’ one asks. ‘That’s John Silver,’ another replies. You can hear the chains rattling as you walk by. That’s our fate now, thanks to Hands, Anderson, and the rest of you fools! Now, for point four—the boy you’re worried about? He’s a hostage! We won’t waste that—he might be our last hope. I’m not about to kill the boy, not a chance! And point three? Maybe you don’t think it matters having a real doctor to look after us—John, your head’s been split open, and George, you’ve just had a fever and your eyes are still yellow! Maybe you didn’t know another ship is on the way? Well, it is, and when it arrives, you’ll be glad we kept a hostage. As for point two, about the bargain I made—remember, you all begged me to make that deal! You were desperate and would have starved without me—but that hardly matters now. Just look—there’s your answer!\""

Soon after, with a drink all round, we lay down to sleep, and the outside of Silver’s vengeance was to put George Merry up for sentinel and threaten him with death if he should prove unfaithful.\nIt was long ere I could close an eye, and heaven knows I had matter enough for thought in the man whom I had slain that afternoon, in my own most perilous position, and above all, in the remarkable game that I saw Silver now engaged upon—keeping the mutineers together with one hand and grasping with the other after every means, possible and impossible, to make his peace and save his miserable life.

I still have that peculiar item with me now, but the writing has vanished completely, leaving only a faint scratch, like one made by a thumbnail. That concluded the night's activities.

I struggled to fall asleep for a long time, my mind filled with thoughts about the man I had killed that afternoon, my own extremely dangerous situation, and especially the extraordinary strategy I observed Silver employing – simultaneously controlling the mutineers while desperately seeking any means, realistic or not, to save his own wretched life and make amends.

On the blank side, someone had written the word \"Depposed\" using similar ash. I still have that odd scrap, but now there's almost no writing left, except for a faint mark like a fingernail scratch. That ended what happened that night. Not long after, we had a drink together and lay down to sleep. For punishment, Silver made George Merry stand guard and warned him he'd be killed if he betrayed us. I couldn't sleep for a long time because my mind was racing—thinking of the man I had killed earlier, the danger I was in, and especially Silver's skillful balancing act—he was keeping his men united while desperately looking for ways to save himself.

Good morning to you, sir!” called Silver, instantly awake and smiling. “Up early, I see! The early bird gets the rations, so they say. George, get moving and help Dr. Livesey over the ship’s rail.

Well, George, how goes it? You’re a pretty colour, certainly; why, your liver, man, is upside down. Did you take that medicine? Did he take that medicine, men?”\n“Aye, aye, sir, he took it, sure enough,” returned Morgan.\n“Because, you see, since I am mutineers’ doctor, or prison doctor as I prefer to call it,” says Doctor Livesey in his pleasantest way, “I make it a point of honour not to lose a man for King George (God bless him!) and the gallows.”\nThe rogues looked at each other but swallowed the home-thrust in silence.\n“Dick don’t feel well, sir,” said one.\n“Don’t he?” replied the doctor. “Well, step up here, Dick, and let me see your tongue. No, I should be surprised if he did! The man’s tongue is fit to frighten the French. Another fever.”\n“Ah, there,” said Morgan, “that comed of sp’iling Bibles.”\n“That comes—as you call it—of being arrant asses,” retorted the doctor, “and not having sense enough to know honest air from poison, and the dry land from a vile, pestiferous slough. I think it most probable—though of course it’s only an opinion—that you’ll all have the deuce to pay before you get that malaria out of your systems. Camp in a bog, would you?

If anyone ever had a near-death experience, it was you; your skull must be incredibly tough.\" He then turned to another man, \"Alright, George, how are you feeling? You look quite unhealthy, truly; your liver seems completely out of sorts. Did you take that medicine?

I believe it's highly probable – though it's just my opinion, of course – that you'll all suffer terribly before you get this malaria out of your systems. You chose to camp in a marsh, did you? Silver, I'm surprised at you. You're generally less foolish than many, but it appears you haven't the slightest understanding of basic health principles.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" he added after he had treated each of them and they had swallowed his prescribed medicines with an almost comical submissiveness, resembling charitable schoolchildren more than notorious mutineers and pirates, \"that concludes my duties for today.

How are you feeling, George? You have quite a complexion; I'd say your liver is all out of sorts. Did you take your medicine? Did he take it, men?\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir, he did,\" answered Morgan.\n\n\"Since I'm the doctor for mutineers now—though I like to think of myself as the prison doctor—it's a point of honor with me not to lose a patient to the king’s executioners,\" Doctor Livesey said with a cheerful tone.\n\nThe men glanced at each other but kept quiet after this pointed remark.\n\n\"Dick isn’t feeling well, sir,\" someone said.\n\n\"Really? Let me take a look, Dick. Show me your tongue. Well, I'm not surprised; your tongue’s in such a state, it could scare the French. It's another fever.\"\n\n\"Aye, that’s what comes of ruining Bibles,\" said Morgan.\n\n\"What’s happened,\" the doctor replied, \"is that you’re all idiots who can’t tell the difference between fresh air and poison, or dry ground and a swamp. In my opinion, you’ll all suffer before you rid yourselves of this fever. Camping in a bog? Silver, I’d expect more sense from you. You’re not the biggest fool among the lot, but you don’t seem to have even the basics of health knowledge.\"\n\nAfter treating everyone and handing out medicine—while they submitted more like humble schoolboys than hardened pirates—the doctor finished by saying, \"That’s all for today.

Silver was roundly accused of playing double—of trying to make a separate peace for himself, of sacrificing the interests of his accomplices and victims, and, in one word, of the identical, exact thing that he was doing. It seemed to me so obvious, in this case, that I could not imagine how he was to turn their anger. But he was twice the man the rest were, and his last night’s victory had given him a huge preponderance on their minds. He called them all the fools and dolts you can imagine, said it was necessary I should talk to the doctor, fluttered the chart in their faces, asked them if they could afford to break the treaty the very day they were bound a-treasure-hunting.\n“No, by thunder!” he cried. “It’s us must break the treaty when the time comes; and till then I’ll gammon that doctor, if I have to ile his boots with brandy.”\nAnd then he bade them get the fire lit, and stalked out upon his crutch, with his hand on my shoulder, leaving them in a disarray, and silenced by his volubility rather than convinced.\n“Slow, lad, slow,” he said. “They might round upon us in a twinkle of an eye if we was seen to hurry.”\nVery deliberately, then, did we advance across the sand to where the doctor awaited us on the other side of the stockade, and as soon as we were within easy speaking distance Silver stopped.\n“You’ll make a note of this here also, doctor,” says he, “and the boy’ll tell you how I saved his life, and were deposed for it too, and you may lay to that. Doctor, when a man’s steering as near the wind as me—playing chuck-farthing with the last breath in his body, like—you wouldn’t think it too much, mayhap, to give him one good word? You’ll please bear in mind it’s not my life only now—it’s that boy’s into the bargain; and you’ll speak me fair, doctor, and give me a bit o’ hope to go on, for the sake of mercy.”\nSilver was a changed man once he was out there and had his back to his friends and the block house; his cheeks seemed to have fallen in, his voice trembled; never was a soul more dead in earnest.\n“Why, John, you’re not afraid?” asked Dr. Livesey.\n“Doctor, I’m no coward; no, not I—not so much!” and he snapped his fingers. “If I was I wouldn’t say it. But I’ll own up fairly, I’ve the shakes upon me for the gallows. You’re a good man and a true; I never seen a better man! And you’ll not forget what I done good, not any more than you’ll forget the bad, I know. And I step aside—see here—and leave you and Jim alone. And you’ll put that down for me too, for it’s a long stretch, is that!”\nSo saying, he stepped back a little way, till he was out of earshot, and there sat down upon a tree-stump and began to whistle, spinning round now and again upon his seat so as to command a sight, sometimes of me and the doctor and sometimes of his unruly ruffians as they went to and fro in the sand between the fire—which they were busy rekindling—and the house, from which they brought forth pork and bread to make the breakfast.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Once the doctor had departed, the immediate outcry of dissatisfaction, previously suppressed only by Silver's menacing glares, erupted. Silver faced widespread accusations of treachery – of attempting to secure a personal settlement, of abandoning the welfare of his fellow conspirators and captives, and, in essence, of the very act he was undeniably committing. To me, the situation seemed so evident that I couldn't fathom how he would manage to quell their fury. However, he possessed twice the determination of the others, and his success the previous night had granted him considerable influence over their thoughts. He subjected them to every imaginable insult, calling them utter simpletons. He insisted that my conversation with the doctor was necessary, brandished the map in their faces, and challenged them, asking if they could truly afford to violate the truce on the very day they were scheduled to hunt for treasure. \"No, by God!\" he exclaimed. \"*We* are the ones who will break the agreement when the time is right; until then, I'll pull the wool over that doctor's eyes, even if I have to oil his boots with brandy.\" He then ordered them to get the fire going and strode off on his crutch, his hand on my shoulder, leaving them disorganized and silenced more by his torrent of words than by persuasion. \"Slowly, lad, slowly,\" he advised. \"They could turn on us in an instant if we appeared to be rushing.\" Consequently, we moved very slowly and deliberately across the sand towards where the doctor awaited us outside the stockade, and as soon as we were within easy speaking distance, Silver halted. \"Make a note of this too, doctor,\" he said, \"and the boy will inform you how I saved his life, and was demoted because of it, and you can depend on that. Doctor, when a man is sailing as close to the wind as I am – practically gambling with his last breath – you wouldn't consider it too much, perhaps, to offer him a word of encouragement? Please bear in mind that it's not just my life now – the boy's is included in the bargain; and you'll speak kindly of me, doctor, and give me a sliver of hope to keep going, for the sake of mercy.\" Silver was transformed once he was outside, with his back to his former allies and the blockhouse; his cheeks seemed hollow, his voice quivered; he had never appeared more intensely earnest. \"Why, John, aren't you afraid?\" Dr. Livesey inquired. \"Doctor, I am no coward; no, not I – not in the least!\" and he snapped his fingers. \"If I were, I wouldn't admit it. But I'll confess honestly, I'm trembling at the thought of the gallows. You are a good man and a true one; I've never encountered a better man! And you won't forget the good deeds I've done, any more than you'll forget the bad ones, I know. And I'll step aside – watch – and leave you and Jim alone. And you'll record that for me too, because that's a considerable concession!\" With these words, he retreated a short distance, until he was out of earshot, and there he settled on a tree stump and began whistling, occasionally rotating on his seat to keep watch, sometimes on me and the doctor and sometimes on his disorderly crew as they moved back and forth across the sand between the fire – which they were busy relighting – and the house, from which they were fetching pork and bread for breakfast.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As soon as the doctor left, a wave of anger broke out among Silver’s companions—a reaction only held back until then by Silver's dangerous demeanor. The men accused Silver directly of betraying them for his own advantage, of negotiating a deal for himself at the expense of both his allies and his victims, and, essentially, of exactly what he was doing. It seemed so clear that I couldn’t see how he could calm their fury. Still, Silver was twice as capable as any of them, and his victory the night before had given him great influence over the group. He called them fools, said I needed to speak with the doctor, waved the map in front of them, and asked if they could really afford to break their agreement on the very day they were to hunt for treasure. “No, by thunder!” he shouted. “It’s up to us to break the deal when it suits us—but until then, I’ll fool that doctor if I have to grease his boots with brandy.” Then he ordered them to light the fire, left the cabin leaning on his crutch with his hand on my shoulder, and exited, leaving the group in chaos, silenced more by his fast talking than by logic. “Take it slow, boy,” he warned me—if anyone saw us rush, they might turn against us instantly. We walked very slowly across the sand to where the doctor stood outside the stockade. When we got close enough, Silver stopped. “Take note of this, doctor,” he said. “Jim here can tell you I saved his life and was ousted because of it. Remember that, and surely you can spare a kind word for a man hanging on by a thread—not just my life, but the boy’s depends on it, so for mercy’s sake, give me a bit of hope.” Out there, away from the others, Silver seemed transformed—more anxious than ever, cheeks sunken, voice unsteady. “You’re not scared, are you, John?” the doctor asked. “Not a coward, doctor, not me!” Silver replied. “But I’ll admit—I’m frightened of the gallows. You’re a good man, and you’ll remember both the bad and the good I’ve done. I’ll step aside now—see—and let you and Jim talk.” So he moved out of earshot, sat on a tree stump, and started to whistle, all the while watching me, the doctor, and his wild men, as they moved between the fire, which they were relighting, and the house, fetching food for breakfast."

It's certainly true that they possess the ship. I don't know its location currently, but once we locate the treasure, we'll need to act quickly and find out where it is. And then, men, I believe we who control the boats hold the dominant position.\" He spoke continuously like this, his mouth full of the hot bacon; in this manner, he renewed their hope and self-confidence, and I strongly suspect, strengthened his own spirits at the same time. \"Regarding a captive,\" he went on, \"that was likely his final discussion with those he holds so dear. I got my piece of useful information, and I thank him for that; but that matter is concluded. I'll keep him attached when we go searching for the treasure, because we will guard him like precious gold, you see, in case of any issues, and in the meantime. Once we have both the ship and the treasure and are sailing away together like happy friends, then we will discuss Mr. Hawkins's situation, and yes, we will certainly give him his portion, despite all his 'kindness'.\"",

It's true, they've got the ship now. I don't yet know where it is, but once we get the treasure, we'll need to move swiftly to figure it out. Then, my friends, those of us with the boats will have the advantage.\" While saying all this, still eating hot bacon, he managed to lift their spirits and, I suspect, boost his own as well. \"As for the hostage,\" he went on, \"that will probably be the last conversation he'll have with his dear friends. I've received the news I needed, thanks to him, but that's done with now. When we go treasure hunting, I'll bring him along, keeping him close for safety, just in case something happens. Meanwhile, once we have both the ship and treasure and are sailing away together like good friends, then we'll make a deal with Mr. Hawkins and give him his fair share for all his help.\""

He was still playing both sides, and it was clear he would choose the riches and liberty he could gain with the pirates over merely avoiding execution, which was the most he could expect by siding with us. Worse still, even if circumstances forced him to remain loyal to Dr. Livesey, we would still face great peril! Imagine the critical moment when his crew's doubts became certainties, and he and I—a disabled man and a young boy—would have to fight for our lives against five powerful and capable sailors! Combine this twofold fear with the lingering questions about my friends' actions—why they left the fort without explanation, why they inexplicably surrendered the map, and hardest to grasp, the doctor's final caution to Silver, \"Expect trouble when you find it,\" and you can easily understand why I had little appetite for breakfast and felt so anxious as I followed my captors on the search for the treasure.",

He was still allied with both groups, and it was obvious he would choose the pirates’ offer of wealth and freedom over simply escaping the gallows, which was the best he could hope for if he stayed loyal to us. Furthermore, even if events forced him to stay true to Dr. Livesey, we would still be in grave danger! Imagine what would happen if his crew’s fears turned into certainty—he and I would have to fight desperately for our lives—him being disabled and me just a boy—against five strong sailors! Add to these fears the confusion caused by the strange actions of my friends: why they abandoned the fort, why they inexplicably handed over the map, or most puzzling of all, why the doctor gave that last warning to Silver—‘Be prepared for trouble when you find the treasure.’ It’s no wonder that I had no appetite for breakfast and set off after my captors to hunt for the treasure with a very anxious heart."

Silver had two guns slung about him—one before and one behind—besides the great cutlass at his waist and a pistol in each pocket of his square-tailed coat. To complete his strange appearance, Captain Flint sat perched upon his shoulder and gabbling odds and ends of purposeless sea-talk. I had a line about my waist and followed obediently after the sea-cook, who held the loose end of the rope, now in his free hand, now between his powerful teeth. For all the world, I was led like a dancing bear.\nThe other men were variously burthened, some carrying picks and shovels—for that had been the very first necessary they brought ashore from the Hispaniola—others laden with pork, bread, and brandy for the midday meal. All the stores, I observed, came from our stock, and I could see the truth of Silver’s words the night before. Had he not struck a bargain with the doctor, he and his mutineers, deserted by the ship, must have been driven to subsist on clear water and the proceeds of their hunting. Water would have been little to their taste; a sailor is not usually a good shot; and besides all that, when they were so short of eatables, it was not likely they would be very flush of powder.\nWell, thus equipped, we all set out—even the fellow with the broken head, who should certainly have kept in shadow—and straggled, one after another, to the beach, where the two gigs awaited us. Even these bore trace of the drunken folly of the pirates, one in a broken thwart, and both in their muddy and unbailed condition. Both were to be carried along with us for the sake of safety; and so, with our numbers divided between them, we set forth upon the bosom of the anchorage.",

Adding to his peculiar look, Captain Flint the parrot sat on his shoulder, muttering random, nonsensical sea phrases. I had a rope tied around my waist and trailed behind the sea-cook obediently; he held the free end of the rope, sometimes in his hand, sometimes clenched in his strong teeth. It was exactly as if I were being led like a performing bear. The other men carried various burdens. Some were loaded with picks and shovels, the first essential tools they had brought ashore from the Hispaniola, while others were weighed down with supplies for lunch: pork, bread, and brandy. I noticed that all these provisions came from our own ship's stores, confirming what Silver had said the previous night. Without the agreement he had made with the doctor, he and his mutinous crew, abandoned by the ship, would have had to survive solely on water and whatever they could hunt. Water wouldn't have been appealing to them, sailors are typically poor marksmen, and furthermore, given their scarcity of food, they likely wouldn't have had much gunpowder to spare. So, equipped in this manner, we all set off—even the man with the head injury, who really should have stayed hidden—and made our way unevenly, one after another, to the beach where the two small boats (gigs) were waiting. Even these showed signs of the pirates' drunken recklessness; one had a broken seat, and both were muddy and full of water. We were to bring both boats with us for safety, so after dividing our group between them, we began our journey across the calm water of the anchorage.",

With all our equipment ready, we set off—including the man with the head wound, who should have stayed out of sight—and made our way, one by one, toward the shore where the two small boats waited. Even these boats showed signs of the pirates’ earlier drunken recklessness, with broken seats and dirty, waterlogged insides. Both boats were taken with us for safety, and after dividing our group between them, we made our way across the water in the anchorage."

          "text_segment": "As we pulled over, there was some discussion on the chart. The red cross was, of course, far too large to be a guide; and the terms of the note on the back, as you will hear, admitted of some ambiguity. They ran, the reader may remember, thus: Tall tree, Spy-glass shoulder, bearing a point to the N. of N.N.E. Skeleton Island E.S.E. and by E. Ten feet.\nA tall tree was thus the principal mark. Now, right before us the anchorage was bounded by a plateau from two to three hundred feet high, adjoining on the north the sloping southern shoulder of the Spy-glass and rising again towards the south into the rough, cliffy eminence called the Mizzenmast Hill. The top of the plateau was dotted thickly with pine-trees of varying height. Every here and there, one of a different species rose forty or fifty feet clear above its neighbours, and which of these was the particular “tall tree” of Captain Flint could only be decided on the spot, and by the readings of the compass.\nYet, although that was the case, every man on board the boats had picked a favourite of his own ere we were half-way over, Long John alone shrugging his shoulders and bidding them wait till they were there.\nWe pulled easily, by Silver’s directions, not to weary the hands prematurely, and after quite a long passage, landed at the mouth of the second river—that which runs down a woody cleft of the Spy-glass. Thence, bending to our left, we began to ascend the slope towards the plateau.\nAt the first outset, heavy, miry ground and a matted, marish vegetation greatly delayed our progress; but by little and little the hill began to steepen and become stony under foot, and the wood to change its character and to grow in a more open order. It was, indeed, a most pleasant portion of the island that we were now approaching. A heavy-scented broom and many flowering shrubs had almost taken the place of grass. Thickets of green nutmeg-trees were dotted here and there with the red columns and the broad shadow of the pines; and the first mingled their spice with the aroma of the others. The air, besides, was fresh and stirring, and this, under the sheer sunbeams, was a wonderful refreshment to our senses.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "As we rowed towards the shore, the discussion turned to the map. The prominent red cross was clearly too large to serve as a precise marker, and the instructions written on the back, as you will learn, were somewhat ambiguous. They read, as you may recall: 'Tall tree, Spy-glass shoulder, bearing a point to the N. of N.N.E. Skeleton Island E.S.E. and by E. Ten feet.' Thus, the primary marker was a tall tree. Directly ahead, the area where we could anchor was bordered by a high plateau, roughly two to three hundred feet tall. This plateau connected to the gently sloping southern side of the Spy-glass peak on its northern edge and rose again southward into the rough, cliffy prominence known as the Mizzenmast Hill. The top of the plateau was thickly covered with pine trees of varying heights. Here and there, a tree of a different type stood out, rising forty or fifty feet above its neighbours. Identifying which of these was Captain Flint's specific 'tall tree' could only be determined upon arrival using compass readings. Nevertheless, despite this uncertainty, every man in the boats had already chosen their personal favourite tree before we were even halfway there. Only Long John shrugged his shoulders, advising them to wait until they reached the location. Following Silver's instructions to avoid tiring the crew too soon, we rowed at a leisurely pace. After a quite lengthy journey, we landed at the mouth of the second river, which flows through a wooded ravine of the Spy-glass. From there, turning left, we began to climb the slope leading towards the plateau. Initially, our progress was significantly slowed by heavy, muddy ground and dense, marshy vegetation. However, gradually the hillside began to steepen and become stony underfoot, and the character of the woods changed, becoming more widely spaced. In fact, the part of the island we were now approaching was most pleasant. Strongly scented broom and many flowering shrubs had nearly replaced the grass. Clumps of green nutmeg trees were dotted among the red trunks and broad shadows of the pines, their spicy fragrance mingling with the aroma of the pines. Additionally, the air was fresh and moving, which, under the direct sunlight, provided wonderful refreshment to our senses.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As we approached, there was a conversation about the map. The red cross marked was obviously too big to be of much help in guiding us, and the wording on the reverse side, as you’ll hear, was somewhat unclear. It read: \"Tall tree, Spy-glass shoulder, bearing a point to the N. of N.N.E. Skeleton Island E.S.E. and by E. Ten feet.\" The most prominent indicator was a tall tree. Looking ahead, we saw that the anchorage was bordered by a plateau two to three hundred feet high, connecting to the northern side of the Spy-glass's southern slope and rising further south into the rocky, craggy land called Mizzenmast Hill. The plateau’s top was thick with pine trees of different heights. Occasionally, a tree of a different kind stood forty or fifty feet above the rest, and determining which of these was Captain Flint’s specific \"tall tree\" could only be done in person, with the aid of the compass. Still, despite this uncertainty, everyone in the boats had already chosen their own preferred tree before we were halfway across, except for Long John, who simply told them to wait until we arrived. Following Silver's advice, we rowed at a relaxed pace so as not to tire ourselves out, and after a lengthy trip, we landed at the entrance to the second river—the one that flows through a wooded ravine of the Spy-glass. From that point, turning left, we started to climb the slope up towards the plateau. At first, thick muddy ground and tangled, marshy plants slowed us down a lot, but gradually the hill became steeper and rockier, and the trees became less dense and more spaced out. We were entering a very charming part of the island; strong-smelling broom and many blooming shrubs nearly replaced the grass, while clumps of green nutmeg trees interspersed with the red trunks and wide shades of the pines together blended their fragrances. The air was lively and invigorating, and combined with the bright sunlight, it gave us a wonderful sense of renewal."

          "text_segment": "“I’ve taken a notion into my old numbskull,” observed Silver. “Here’s the compass; there’s the tip-top p’int o’ Skeleton Island, stickin’ out like a tooth. Just take a bearing, will you, along the line of them bones.”\nIt was done. The body pointed straight in the direction of the island, and the compass read duly E.S.E. and by E.\n“I thought so,” cried the cook; “this here is a p’inter. Right up there is our line for the Pole Star and the jolly dollars. But, by thunder! If it don’t make me cold inside to think of Flint. This is one of his jokes, and no mistake. Him and these six was alone here; he killed ’em, every man; and this one he hauled here and laid down by compass, shiver my timbers! They’re long bones, and the hair’s been yellow. Aye, that would be Allardyce. You mind Allardyce, Tom Morgan?”\n“Aye, aye,” returned Morgan; “I mind him; he owed me money, he did, and took my knife ashore with him.”\n“Speaking of knives,” said another, “why don’t we find his’n lying round? Flint warn’t the man to pick a seaman’s pocket; and the birds, I guess, would leave it be.”\n“By the powers, and that’s true!” cried Silver.\n“There ain’t a thing left here,” said Merry, still feeling round among the bones; “not a copper doit nor a baccy box. It don’t look nat’ral to me.”\n“No, by gum, it don’t,” agreed Silver; “not nat’ral, nor not nice, says you. Great guns! Messmates, but if Flint was living, this would be a hot spot for you and me. Six they were, and six are we; and bones is what they are now.”\n“I saw him dead with these here deadlights,” said Morgan. “Billy took me in. There he laid, with penny-pieces on his eyes.”\n“Dead—aye, sure enough he’s dead and gone below,” said the fellow with the bandage; “but if ever sperrit walked, it would be Flint’s. Dear heart, but he died bad, did Flint!”\n“Aye, that he did,” observed another; “now he raged, and now he hollered for the rum, and now he sang. ‘Fifteen Men’ were his only song, mates; and I tell you true, I never rightly liked to hear it since. It was main hot, and the windy was open, and I hear that old song comin’ out as clear as clear—and the death-haul on the man already.”\n“Come, come,” said Silver; “stow this talk. He’s dead, and he don’t walk, that I know; leastways, he won’t walk by day, and you may lay to that. Care killed a cat. Fetch ahead for the doubloons.”\nWe started, certainly; but in spite of the hot sun and the staring daylight, the pirates no longer ran separate and shouting through the wood, but kept side by side and spoke with bated breath. The terror of the dead buccaneer had fallen on their spirits.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“I've got an idea in my head,” remarked Silver. “Here's the compass; there's the highest point of Skeleton Island, jutting out sharply. Will you just get a compass reading using the line of those bones as a guide?” This was done. The skeleton pointed directly towards the island, and the compass registered exactly E.S.E. and by E. “Just as I thought,” exclaimed the cook; “this here is a marker. That's our path towards the treasure. But, by thunder! It truly chills me to think about Flint. This is definitely one of his tricks. He and these six were alone here; he murdered every single one of them; and this one he dragged here and positioned using a compass, well I'll be damned! They're long bones, and the hair was yellow. Yes, that must be Allardyce. Do you remember Allardyce, Tom Morgan?” “Yes, I do,” replied Morgan; “I remember him; he owed me money, he did, and took my knife ashore with him.” “Speaking of knives,” said another man, “why isn't his knife lying around? Flint wasn't the kind of man to steal from a dead sailor; and I reckon the birds would have left it alone.” “By the powers, you're right about that!” cried Silver. “There's nothing left here,” said Merry, still searching among the bones; “not a single small coin or a tobacco box. It just doesn't seem natural to me.” “No, by gum, it doesn't,” agreed Silver; “not natural, and not pleasant either, as you say. Good heavens, shipmates! If Flint were alive, this place would be extremely dangerous for the likes of you and me. There were six of them, and there are six of us; and now they're just bones.” “I saw him dead with these very eyes,” said Morgan. “Billy took me in. There he lay, with coins covering his eyes.” “Dead—yes, indeed he's dead and gone,” said the man with the bandage; “but if any ghost ever walked, it would be Flint's. Heavens above, but Flint died a terrible death!” “Yes, that he did,” observed another; “sometimes he was furious, and sometimes he yelled for rum, and sometimes he sang. ‘Fifteen Men’ was his only song, mates; and I honestly tell you, I've never truly liked hearing it since. It was very hot, and the window was open, and I could hear that old song coming out as clear as anything—with death already upon the man.” “Come now, come now,” said Silver; “let's stop this talk. He's dead, and he doesn't haunt, that I know; at least, he won't haunt during the day, you can be sure of that. Worry serves no purpose. Let's get on and find the treasure.” We did start moving, but despite the hot sun and the bright daylight, the pirates no longer ran scattered and shouting through the woods, but stayed close together and spoke in hushed tones. The fear of the dead buccaneer had overcome them.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Silver spoke up, saying he'd gotten an idea. He pointed out the compass and the spot on Skeleton Island that stood out, asking someone to line up their direction with the bones lying on the ground. When they did so, the bones pointed straight toward the island and the compass showed a reading of east-south-east and a bit east. Silver then exclaimed that this was clearly a clue, directing them toward treasure—or at least where Flint had hidden something. He shivered at the thought of Captain Flint, stating this must have been one of his grim tricks. Flint had killed his crew here and carefully laid out this body as a kind of marker. Judging by the long bones and yellow hair, Silver guessed it must be Allardyce and asked Morgan if he remembered him. Morgan replied that he did; Allardyce owed him money and had taken his knife. Another pirate wondered why Allardyce's knife wasn't still there—since Flint wasn't the kind to rob a man, and the local birds wouldn’t take it either. Silver agreed, surprised there wasn’t a trace left behind—not even a coin or a tobacco box, as Merry pointed out, which seemed odd to everyone. Silver said it was indeed strange—and warned that if Flint were still alive, this would be a dangerous place for them. He reflected that there were six dead men before and six pirates here now. Morgan chimed in, saying he’d seen Flint dead with coins on his eyes. Another with a bandage added that if any ghost would haunt this place, it’d be Flint, since he died so horribly. Another pirate recalled how Flint would rage, demand rum, and sing his favorite song, 'Fifteen Men,' which now made his skin crawl whenever he heard it. Silver then cut the talk short, declaring Flint was definitely dead and wouldn’t be haunting them, at least not in daylight, and urged them to keep moving toward the treasure. They pressed on, but despite the sunlight, the pirates drew together and kept their voices low, all feeling unnerved by the memory of the dead buccaneer."

Before us, over the tree-tops, we beheld the Cape of the Woods fringed with surf; behind, we not only looked down upon the anchorage and Skeleton Island, but saw—clear across the spit and the eastern lowlands—a great field of open sea upon the east. Sheer above us rose the Spy-glass, here dotted with single pines, there black with precipices. There was no sound but that of the distant breakers, mounting from all round, and the chirp of countless insects in the brush. Not a man, not a sail, upon the sea; the very largeness of the view increased the sense of solitude.\nSilver, as he sat, took certain bearings with his compass.\n“There are three ‘tall trees,’” said he, “about in the right line from Skeleton Island. ‘Spy-glass shoulder,’ I take it, means that lower p’int there. It’s child’s play to find the stuff now. I’ve half a mind to dine first.”\n“I don’t feel sharp,” growled Morgan. “Thinkin’ o’ Flint—I think it were—as done me.”\n“Ah, well, my son, you praise your stars he’s dead,” said Silver.\n“He were an ugly devil,” cried a third pirate with a shudder; “that blue in the face too!”\n“That was how the rum took him,” added Merry. “Blue! Well, I reckon he was blue. That’s a true word.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The entire group stopped upon reaching the crest of the slope, partly due to the unsettling incident just past, and partly to let Silver and the unwell men rest. Since the elevated ground sloped slightly westward, the area where we paused offered broad views in every direction. Looking ahead, beyond the canopy of trees, we could see the Cape of the Woods, its edge marked by breaking waves. To our rear, we not only had a view down upon the harbor and Skeleton Island but also, clearly visible across the sandbar and the low-lying areas to the east, a vast expanse of open ocean. Directly above us loomed the Spy-glass mountain, its sides dotted with individual pines in some places and dark with sheer rock faces in others. The only sounds were the constant, distant rush of the breakers from all around and the buzzing of innumerable insects in the undergrowth. There was no sign of any man or vessel on the sea; the sheer scale of the vista only intensified the feeling of isolation. As he sat, Silver used his compass to determine specific points. “There are three ‘tall trees’ mentioned,” he stated, “located roughly on the correct line from Skeleton Island. I believe ‘Spy-glass shoulder’ refers to that lower peak over there. Finding the treasure will be ridiculously easy now. I’m half tempted to eat first.” Morgan grumbled, “I don’t feel right. I think it was thinking about Flint that did it to me.” “Ah, well, my boy, you should be thankful he’s dead,” Silver replied. “He was a nasty piece of work,” shivered a third pirate, adding, “and that blue face!” “That’s what the rum did to him,” Merry contributed. “Blue! Yes, I’d say he was blue. That’s the truth of it.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Influenced partly by the lingering fear from the earlier scare and partly to allow Silver and the sick crewmen to rest, everyone in the group sat down as soon as they reached the top of the hill. The plateau sloped gently to the west, and from where they halted, they could see a wide view in every direction. Ahead, beyond the tops of the trees, the Cape of the Woods was visible with waves crashing against it; behind, they could see both the anchorage and Skeleton Island below, and further off to the east, a broad expanse of open sea. Above them towered the Spy-glass hill, marked here by solitary pine trees and there by dark cliffs. The only sounds were the distant waves breaking all around and the constant chattering of insects in the bushes. No ships or people were visible on the sea; the vastness of the landscape only made the feeling of loneliness stronger. As they sat, Silver used his compass to take some directions. \"There are three tall trees,\" he said, \"in a straight line from Skeleton Island. I think 'Spy-glass shoulder' must be that lower point down there. Finding the treasure should be easy now. Maybe I'll have my dinner first.\" \"I'm not hungry,\" Morgan complained. \"Thinking about Flint—I'm sure it was—has put me off my food.\" \"Well, you're lucky he's dead,\" Silver replied. \"He was a nasty piece of work,\" said another pirate, shivering; \"and that blue face!\" \"That was the rum's doing,\" added Merry. \"Blue as could be—true enough.\""

Their faces instantly lost all colour as if by magic; some sprang to their feet, others clutched at one another; Morgan collapsed onto the ground. “It’s Flint, curse him!” cried Merry.

I could hear his teeth rattle in his head, but he had not yet surrendered.\n“Nobody in this here island ever heard of Darby,” he muttered; “not one but us that’s here.” And then, making a great effort: “Shipmates,” he cried, “I’m here to get that stuff, and I’ll not be beat by man or devil. I never was feared of Flint in his life, and, by the powers, I’ll face him dead. There’s seven hundred thousand pound not a quarter of a mile from here. When did ever a gentleman o’ fortune show his stern to that much dollars for a boozy old seaman with a blue mug—and him dead too?”\nBut there was no sign of reawakening courage in his followers, rather, indeed, of growing terror at the irreverence of his words.\n“Belay there, John!” said Merry. “Don’t you cross a sperrit.”\nAnd the rest were all too terrified to reply. They would have run away severally had they dared; but fear kept them together, and kept them close by John, as if his daring helped them. He, on his part, had pretty well fought his weakness down.\n“Sperrit? Well, maybe,” he said. “But there’s one thing not clear to me. There was an echo.

He muttered that no one else on the island knew of 'Darby' except for their group. Then, making a strong effort, he shouted to his crew that he was determined to get the treasure and wouldn't be defeated by anyone. He claimed he was never afraid of Flint when he was alive and swore he would confront him dead. He reminded them that seven hundred thousand pounds was less than a quarter of a mile away, asking what 'gentleman of fortune' would ever turn his back on that much money because of a dead, drunken old sailor with a pale face. However, his followers showed no renewed courage; instead, they grew more terrified by his defiant words. Merry told him to stop provoking a spirit. The others were too scared to reply and would have run away individually if they dared, but their fear kept them huddled together near John, as if his bravery protected them. Meanwhile, Silver had mostly overcome his own moment of weakness. He pondered aloud if it was truly a spirit, noting the presence of an echo. He questioned how a spirit, which supposedly has no shadow, could produce an echo, stating that it didn't seem natural.",

I was never afraid of Flint while he lived, and, by heaven, I'll face him now he's dead. There's 700,000 pounds just a short distance away. When has a pirate ever turned away from such a fortune because of a drunk old sailor with a blue face—even if he is dead?\" His words, however, seemed only to increase his crew's fear, especially at his disrespectful talk. Merry tried to warn him: \"Hold it, John! Don't provoke the spirit.\" The others were too scared to say anything, and although they wanted to run, their fear kept them huddled together near John, as though his boldness gave them some courage. Silver appeared to have overcome his nerves. \"A spirit? Maybe,\" he said, \"but here's something strange—there was an echo. No one ever saw a ghost with a shadow; so why would a ghost have an echo? That doesn't make sense to me.\""

          "text_segment": "There never was such an overturn in this world. Each of these six men was as though he had been struck. But with Silver the blow passed almost instantly. Every thought of his soul had been set full-stretch, like a racer, on that money; well, he was brought up, in a single second, dead; and he kept his head, found his temper, and changed his plan before the others had had time to realize the disappointment.\n“Jim,” he whispered, “take that, and stand by for trouble.”\nAnd he passed me a double-barrelled pistol.\nAt the same time, he began quietly moving northward, and in a few steps had put the hollow between us two and the other five. Then he looked at me and nodded, as much as to say, “Here is a narrow corner,” as, indeed, I thought it was. His looks were not quite friendly, and I was so revolted at these constant changes that I could not forbear whispering, “So you’ve changed sides again.”\nThere was no time left for him to answer in. The buccaneers, with oaths and cries, began to leap, one after another, into the pit and to dig with their fingers, throwing the boards aside as they did so. Morgan found a piece of gold. He held it up with a perfect spout of oaths. It was a two-guinea piece, and it went from hand to hand among them for a quarter of a minute.\n“Two guineas!” roared Merry, shaking it at Silver. “That’s your seven hundred thousand pounds, is it? You’re the man for bargains, ain’t you? You’re him that never bungled nothing, you wooden-headed lubber!”\n“Dig away, boys,” said Silver with the coolest insolence; “you’ll find some pig-nuts and I shouldn’t wonder.”\n“Pig-nuts!” repeated Merry, in a scream. “Mates, do you hear that? I tell you now, that man there knew it all along. Look in the face of him and you’ll see it wrote there.”\n“Ah, Merry,” remarked Silver, “standing for cap’n again? You’re a pushing lad, to be sure.”\nBut this time everyone was entirely in Merry’s favour. They began to scramble out of the excavation, darting furious glances behind them. One thing I observed, which looked well for us: they all got out upon the opposite side from Silver.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The scene that unfolded was utterly chaotic. Each of the six men looked completely shocked, as if struck by a physical blow. However, the impact on Silver lasted only an instant. Every ounce of his focus had been stretched to its limit, like a racehorse at full gallop, aimed squarely at that money. Then, in a single second, he was brought to a dead stop. Yet, he quickly regained control, managed his temper, and devised a new course of action before the others had even had time to process their disappointment.\n\n\"Jim,\" he whispered to me, \"take this, and be ready for trouble.\" He passed me a pistol with two barrels.\n\nSimultaneously, he began to move quietly in a northerly direction, and within a few steps, he had positioned the dip in the ground between himself and me, and the other five men. He then looked at me and gave a nod, which I interpreted as meaning, \"We're in a difficult situation now,\" a sentiment I certainly shared. His expression wasn't entirely friendly, and I was so repulsed by his constant shifts in loyalty that I couldn't resist whispering back, \"So you've switched sides yet again.\"\n\nHe had no time to reply. The pirates, yelling curses and cries, started leaping into the pit one after another, digging with their fingers and throwing the wooden planks aside as they did so. Morgan discovered a piece of gold. He held it up, letting loose a torrent of oaths. It was a two-guinea coin, and they passed it among themselves for about fifteen seconds.\n\n\"Two guineas!\" shouted Merry, shaking it at Silver. \"*That's* your seven hundred thousand pounds, is it? You're the man for making great deals, aren't you? You're the one who never bungled anything, you dense-headed fool!\"\n\n\"Keep digging, lads,\" said Silver with the utmost calmness and arrogance. \"You'll likely find some worthless roots, I wouldn't be surprised.\"\n\n\"Worthless roots!\" Merry shrieked in reply. \"Mates, do you hear that? I'm telling you now, that man there knew about this all along. Look at his face and you'll see the truth written there.\"\n\n\"Ah, Merry,\" Silver commented, \"trying to be captain again? You're certainly a bold young man.\"\n\nBut this time, everyone was entirely in agreement with Merry. They began to scramble out of the dug-out area, casting furious looks behind them. One detail I observed, which seemed advantageous for us, was that they all exited the pit on the side opposite to where Silver was standing.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Never before had such chaos broken out. Each of the six men seemed stunned, as if paralyzed by what had happened. However, Silver recovered almost immediately. All his attention had been focused on the treasure; when his hopes were crushed in an instant, he composed himself, controlled his temper, and formulated a new plan before any of the others had the chance to process their shock.\n\nHe whispered to me, \"Jim, take this and be ready for trouble,\" as he handed me a double-barreled pistol.\n\nAt the same time, he started to edge his way to the north so that soon the hollow lay between us and the rest. He gave me a look and a nod, silently indicating, \"We’re in a tight spot,\" a thought I shared. He didn’t look very friendly, and I, fed up with his changing loyalties, couldn't stop myself from quietly saying, \"So you’ve switched sides yet again.\"\n\nHe had no opportunity to respond. The pirates, shouting and swearing, jumped into the pit one by one, clawing at the dirt and tossing away planks. Morgan dug up a gold coin, cursing loudly. It was a two-guinea coin, and it passed from hand to hand for less than half a minute.\n\n\"Two guineas!\" yelled Merry, waving it angrily at Silver. \"Is that your seven hundred thousand pounds? Some bargain you found, you big oaf!\"\n\nSilver replied coolly and with sarcasm, \"Keep digging, boys; maybe you'll find some pig-nuts.\"\n\n\"Pig-nuts!\" shrieked Merry. \"Did you hear that, mates? That man knew all along. Just look at his face – you can see it written there.\"\n\nSilver retorted, \"Trying for captain again, Merry? You’re an ambitious fellow.\"\n\nBut this time, everyone sided with Merry. They started clamoring out of the hole, glaring back at us with fury. I did notice one thing that gave me hope: all of them climbed out on the side away from Silver."

Now, mates—”\nHe was raising his arm and his voice, and plainly meant to lead a charge. But just then—crack! crack! crack!—three musket-shots flashed out of the thicket.

A tense moment passed, as neither side seemed ready to make the first move. Silver remained perfectly still, watching them attentively, leaning upright on his crutch, and appearing as composed as I had ever seen him. He was undoubtedly brave. Eventually, Merry seemed to decide that a speech might help motivate his men. \"Listen, mates,\" he called out, \"there are only two of them over there; one is the old cripple who got us into this mess and brought us here in the first place; the other is that young scoundrel whose heart I intend to rip out. Now, lads—\" He was raising his arm and his voice, clearly intending to lead an assault. But just then—bang! bang! bang!—three shots rang out from the dense undergrowth. Merry pitched headfirst into the excavation; the pirate with the bandaged head spun around abruptly and collapsed flat on his side, dead but his body still twitching; and the other three immediately turned and ran for their lives. Before you could blink, Long John had discharged both barrels of a pistol into the wounded Merry, and as the man's eyes rolled upwards at him in his final agony, Silver declared, \"George, I think I've taken care of you.\" At that very moment, the doctor, Gray, and Ben Gunn appeared from among the nutmeg trees, joining us with their muskets still smoking from having been fired.",

Eventually, Merry decided to try encouraging his group, speaking up: “Mates, it’s just the two of them over there—one’s the old cripple who led us here and ruined things, and the other’s the boy I’ve sworn to kill. Now, mates—” He began to lift his arm and voice, preparing to attack. But suddenly, three gunshots rang out from the bushes. Merry fell headfirst into the hole; the bandaged man spun and dropped dead, while the other three ran away at top speed. In an instant, Long John fired his pistol at Merry, and as Merry was dying, Silver said, “George, I guess that’s the end of you.” Right then, the doctor, Gray, and Ben Gunn appeared from the trees, muskets smoking from the shots they’d just fired."

The work that man went through, leaping on his crutch till the muscles of his chest were fit to burst, was work no sound man ever equalled; and so thinks the doctor. As it was, he was already thirty yards behind us and on the verge of strangling when we reached the brow of the slope.\n“Doctor,” he hailed, “see there! No hurry!”\nSure enough there was no hurry. In a more open part of the plateau, we could see the three survivors still running in the same direction as they had started, right for Mizzenmast Hill. We were already between them and the boats; and so we four sat down to breathe, while Long John, mopping his face, came slowly up with us.\n“Thank ye kindly, doctor,” says he. “You came in in about the nick, I guess, for me and Hawkins.

We have to cut them off from the boats.\" We immediately started running very fast, sometimes pushing through thick bushes. I must tell you, Silver was desperate to keep up. The physical effort he exerted, leaping on his crutch until the muscles in his chest seemed about to tear, was more than any able-bodied person could manage, and the doctor agreed. As it was, he had fallen roughly thirty yards behind us and was struggling to breathe by the time we reached the top of the slope. \"Doctor!\" he shouted, \"Look there! No need to rush!\" Indeed, there was no rush. From a more open part of the plateau, we could see the three remaining survivors still running the same way they had started, heading straight for Mizzenmast Hill. We were already positioned between them and their boats, so the four of us sat down to rest while Long John, wiping sweat from his face, slowly made his way up to us. \"Thank you kindly, doctor,\" he said. \"I suppose you showed up just in time for me and Hawkins. And so, it's actually you, Ben Gunn!\" he added, remarking that Ben was quite the character. \"I am Ben Gunn, I am,\" the maroon replied, squirming with embarrassment like an eel. After a long pause, he added, \"And, how do you do, Mr. Silver? You'd say, 'Pretty well, I thank you.'\" \"Ben, Ben,\" Silver murmured, dismayed, \"to think that you've outplayed me!\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"Advance!\" shouted the doctor. \"Quick march, boys. We need to cut them off from the boats.\" We rushed forward, sometimes crashing through the brush toward the treasure chest. I must say, Silver was determined to keep pace with us. The effort he made, hopping on his crutch so strenuously his chest muscles seemed ready to burst, was something even a healthy man couldn't match; that's the doctor's opinion too. Even so, he was already thirty yards behind by the time we topped the slope, gasping for breath. \"Doctor!\" he called out. \"Look! There's no need to rush now!\" Indeed, we could see the three remaining men running across the open plateau, heading for Mizzenmast Hill.

As we did, he quickly explained what had happened. This account was of great interest to Silver, and the central figure throughout was Ben Gunn, the slightly mentally impaired maroon. In his long, solitary travels across the island, Ben had discovered the skeleton – and had been the one to take its contents. He had also located the treasure. He had dug it up (the broken handle of his pickaxe was found in the hole). He had then transported it over many difficult journeys on his back from the base of the tall pine to a cave he used on the twin-peaked hill at the island's north-east corner, where it had remained safely hidden for two months before the *Hispaniola*'s arrival. When the doctor had extracted this secret from him on the afternoon of the attack, and upon seeing the anchorage empty the next morning, he had approached Silver. He gave him the chart, which was now useless, and the supplies, as Ben Gunn’s cave was well-stocked with goat meat he had salted himself. He essentially gave up everything in exchange for a safe route from the stockade to the two-pointed hill, intending to avoid malaria there and keep a watch over the money. Addressing me, he said, \"As for you, Jim, it pained me, but I did what I believed was best for those who had remained loyal to their duty.

However, he soon saw that the mutineer party had started earlier. Since Ben Gunn was a fast runner, he was sent ahead alone to do what he could. It then occurred to the doctor to play on the superstitions of his former shipmates, and this was so effective that Gray and the doctor managed to catch up and were already hidden in ambush before the treasure hunters arrived.",

Ben, during his years alone on the island, had discovered and looted the skeleton. He also found the treasure, dug it up—breaking the handle of his pick-axe in the process—and painstakingly transported it from beneath the tall pine tree to a cave he had claimed on the two-pointed hill at the island's northeast corner.

When the doctor learned Ben’s secret during the afternoon of the attack, and saw that the anchorage was deserted the next morning, he went to Silver and handed over the now-worthless treasure map, as well as provisions from Ben’s well-stocked cave—including salted goat meat—doing everything he could to ensure safe passage to the hill, away from disease and with a secure watch on the treasure. \"As for you, Jim,\" the doctor said, \"it pained me, but I did what I believed was right for those loyal to their duty. If you weren’t counted among them, who was to blame?\" That same morning, anticipating the disappointment he had engineered for the mutineers, the doctor hurried to the cave, leaving the squire to protect the captain, and taking Gray and Ben Gunn across the island to be in position near the pine. However, he soon realized our group had already gotten ahead. He then sent the quick-footed Ben Gunn on ahead by himself. The doctor aimed to take advantage of the superstitions of his former crewmates, and succeeded well enough that he and Gray were already lying in wait before the treasure-seekers arrived."

They quickly left the straits and rounded the south-eastern corner of the island, the same place they had towed the Hispaniola around four days before. As they passed the hill with two peaks, they could see the dark entrance of Ben Gunn's cave and a person standing by it, leaning on a musket. It was the squire, and they waved a handkerchief and gave him three cheers, with Silver joining in just as enthusiastically. Three miles further on, just inside the mouth of North Inlet, they were surprised to encounter the Hispaniola drifting by herself. The recent high tide had floated her, and if there had been much wind or a strong current, like in the southern anchorage, they would have never found her again, or found her stranded beyond help. Fortunately, there was little damage, just the wrecked main-sail. They prepared another anchor and dropped it in relatively shallow water (a fathom and a half deep).

The doctor used the pick-axe to destroy one of them, and we all boarded the other so we could sail around by sea to North Inlet.\nThe trip was eight or nine miles. Though Silver was already nearly exhausted, he was made to row like the rest of us, and soon we were gliding quickly over calm water. We left the straits and rounded the southeast tip of the island—the spot where, four days earlier, we had towed the Hispaniola.\nAs we sailed past the hill with two peaks, we spotted the dark entrance of Ben Gunn’s cave and a figure with a musket leaning nearby.

But as things stood, the only real problem was the wrecked main sail. We prepared and dropped another anchor in shallow water. The whole group then rowed back to Rum Cove, the closest approach to Ben Gunn’s hiding place for the treasure.

That was Flint’s treasure that we had come so far to seek and that had cost already the lives of seventeen men from the Hispaniola. How many it had cost in the amassing, what blood and sorrow, what good ships scuttled on the deep, what brave men walking the plank blindfold, what shot of cannon, what shame and lies and cruelty, perhaps no man alive could tell.

The immense cost of gathering it – the bloodshed, the suffering, the good ships deliberately sunk, the brave men forced to walk the plank blindfolded, the cannon fire, the dishonesty, the deception, and the brutality – was likely beyond anyone’s ability to know.

Gray and Ben Gunn came and went with the boat, while the rest during their absences piled treasure on the beach. Two of the bars, slung in a rope’s end, made a good load for a grown man—one that he was glad to walk slowly with.

As a result, we advanced the work efficiently. Gray and Ben Gunn handled the boat trips, while the rest of us piled treasure on the beach during their absences. Just two gold bars tied together were a hefty load for a man, making him prefer to move at a slow pace. Because I wasn't particularly strong at carrying, I spent the entire day inside the cave, occupied with putting the loose coins into canvas bread bags. It was an extraordinary assortment, resembling Billy Bones's collection in its mix of currencies, but far grander and more varied, which I found immensely satisfying to sort through. There were English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese coins – Georges, Louises, doubloons, double guineas, moidores, and sequins – displaying the likenesses of European monarchs from the previous century, alongside peculiar Eastern pieces stamped with designs that appeared like tangled string or spiderwebs. The collection featured coins of different shapes – round, square, and some perforated in the middle, as if intended to be worn around the neck – truly, I believe nearly every type of money from across the globe was present. Regarding the quantity, I am certain they were as numerous as autumn leaves, causing my back to ache from bending and my fingers to become weary from separating them.

So, we worked at a steady pace. Gray and Ben Gunn handled the boat trips, while the rest of us loaded treasure onto the beach while they were gone.

There were coins of every sort: round and square, with portraits of European kings from the last hundred years, and even ones with holes seemingly meant to be worn as necklaces. It seemed as though every type of coin in the world had ended up together here, so numerous they were like fallen autumn leaves, and sorting them gave me a sore back and fingers. We continued this work for several days; every evening, a fortune was safely loaded onto our ship, with more waiting for the next day. All the while, we heard nothing from the three surviving mutineers."

It was only a snatch that reached our ears, followed by the former silence.\n“Heaven forgive them,” said the doctor; “’tis the mutineers!”\n“All drunk, sir,” struck in the voice of Silver from behind us.\nSilver, I should say, was allowed his entire liberty, and in spite of daily rebuffs, seemed to regard himself once more as quite a privileged and friendly dependent. Indeed, it was remarkable how well he bore these slights and with what unwearying politeness he kept on trying to ingratiate himself with all. Yet, I think, none treated him better than a dog, unless it was Ben Gunn, who was still terribly afraid of his old quartermaster, or myself, who had really something to thank him for; although for that matter, I suppose, I had reason to think even worse of him than anybody else, for I had seen him meditating a fresh treachery upon the plateau. Accordingly, it was pretty gruffly that the doctor answered him.\n“Drunk or raving,” said he.\n“Right you were, sir,” replied Silver; “and precious little odds which, to you and me.”\n“I suppose you would hardly ask me to call you a humane man,” returned the doctor with a sneer, “and so my feelings may surprise you, Master Silver. But if I were sure they were raving—as I am morally certain one, at least, of them is down with fever—I should leave this camp, and at whatever risk to my own carcass, take them the assistance of my skill.”\n“Ask your pardon, sir, you would be very wrong,” quoth Silver. “You would lose your precious life, and you may lay to that. I’m on your side now, hand and glove; and I shouldn’t wish for to see the party weakened, let alone yourself, seeing as I know what I owes you. But these men down there, they couldn’t keep their word—no, not supposing they wished to; and what’s more, they couldn’t believe as you could.”\n“No,” said the doctor. “You’re the man to keep your word, we know that.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "After some time, I believe it was the third night, the doctor and I were taking a walk on the side of the hill that overlooked the lower parts of the island. From the heavy darkness below, the wind carried up a sound that was somewhere between a scream and singing. We only heard a brief part of it before the previous silence returned. The doctor exclaimed, \"May Heaven forgive them; that must be the mutineers!\" Silver's voice suddenly spoke from behind us, saying, \"They're all drunk, sir.\" It's worth mentioning that Silver was allowed full freedom. Despite being constantly rejected, he still seemed to see himself as a favored and friendly subordinate. It was remarkable how well he tolerated being slighted and how persistently and politely he kept trying to gain everyone's favour. Yet, I don't think anyone treated him much better than a dog, except perhaps Ben Gunn, who was still terrified of his old quartermaster, or myself, who felt I had something to thank him for. Though, on reflection, I suppose I had more reason than anyone else to dislike him, as I had seen him plotting further treachery on the plateau. Consequently, the doctor answered him quite roughly. \"Drunk or delirious,\" he said. \"You're right, sir,\" Silver replied, \"and frankly, it makes very little difference which it is, to you and me.\" \"I doubt you would expect me to call you a compassionate man,\" the doctor retorted with a sneer, \"so my feelings might surprise you, Master Silver. But if I were certain they were raving—and I am quite sure that at least one of them is down with a fever—I would leave this camp, and at whatever risk to my own body, go and offer them the help of my skills.\" \"Begging your pardon, sir, you would be making a big mistake,\" said Silver. \"You would definitely lose your valuable life, you can be certain of that. I'm completely on your side now, working closely with you; and I wouldn't want our group to be weakened, least of all you, especially since I know what I owe you. But those men down there, they couldn't keep their word—no, even if they wanted to; and furthermore, they wouldn't believe that you could.\" \"Indeed,\" said the doctor. \"You're known for keeping your word, we are aware of that.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Finally—if I remember correctly, it was on the third night—the doctor and I were walking along the hillside where we could see the lowlands of the island below. Suddenly, carried on the wind from the darkness beneath us, there came a sound that was somewhere between a loud cry and a song. We only heard a brief snippet of it before quiet returned. \n\n\"Heaven forgive them,\" the doctor said, \"It’s the mutineers!\"\n\n\"They’re all drunk, sir,\" came Silver’s voice from behind us.\n\nI should explain that Silver had been granted complete freedom, and despite being snubbed by everyone daily, he acted as though he was still a valued and friendly member of the group. It was actually impressive how calmly he accepted these insults and how tirelessly he kept trying to win everyone's favor. Still, I don’t think anybody treated him better than they would a dog, except maybe Ben Gunn, who remained very frightened of his former superior, or myself, since I owed Silver a favor; although, truthfully, I had more reason than anyone to distrust him, because I had witnessed him plotting new betrayals on the plateau. So, the doctor replied to him in a rather blunt manner.\n\n\"Drunk or mad,\" he said.\n\n\"You’re right, sir,\" Silver replied, \"and it doesn’t make much difference to the likes of us.\"\n\n\"I doubt you expect me to call you a compassionate man,\" the doctor shot back sarcastically, \"so my feelings might surprise you, Mr. Silver. But if I were certain they were delirious—as I’m pretty sure at least one is sick with fever—I would leave this camp, and despite the risk to myself, go down and help them with my medical skills.\"\n\n\"Begging your pardon, sir, but that would be a big mistake,\" Silver said. \"You would lose your life for sure, you can depend on it. I’m on your side now, fully committed; I wouldn’t want to see any casualties—especially not you, since you’ve helped me. But those men down there, they couldn’t keep a promise even if they truly wanted to, and what’s more, they wouldn’t believe that you could keep one either.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the doctor. \"You’re the one we trust to keep his word, we know that.\""

Prior to that, we had already loaded the treasure onto the ship, taken on enough water and the remaining goat meat to last us through any difficulties, and finally, on a pleasant morning, we managed to raise the anchor, which was about the limit of our capability, and sailed out of North Inlet, flying the identical flag the captain had proudly flown and fought under at the stockade.",

The doctor hailed them and told them of the stores we had left, and where they were to find them. But they continued to call us by name and appeal to us, for God’s sake, to be merciful and not leave them to die in such a place.\nAt last, seeing the ship still bore on her course and was now swiftly drawing out of earshot, one of them—I know not which it was—leapt to his feet with a hoarse cry, whipped his musket to his shoulder, and sent a shot whistling over Silver’s head and through the main-sail.\nAfter that, we kept under cover of the bulwarks, and when next I looked out they had disappeared from the spit, and the spit itself had almost melted out of sight in the growing distance.

I believe it saddened all of us to leave them in such a desperate state; however, we could not risk another rebellion, and returning them home merely for execution would have been a harsh form of mercy. The doctor called out to them, informing them about the provisions we had left behind and indicating where they could find them. Despite this, they continued to call out our names, begging us, for the sake of God, to be merciful and not leave them to die in that place. Eventually, seeing that the ship was still proceeding on its course and rapidly moving out of earshot, one of them – I couldn't tell which one – sprang to his feet with a rough shout. He quickly raised his musket to his shoulder and fired a shot that whistled over Silver's head and went through the mainsail. Following this, we took shelter behind the ship's bulwarks. When I looked out again, they had disappeared from the sandbar, and the sandbar itself had almost faded from view in the increasing distance. That, at least, was the end of that ordeal.

It pained us all, I believe, to leave them in such misery; but we couldn’t risk another rebellion, and it seemed cruel in a way to bring them back only for them to be hanged. The doctor shouted to them, telling them where we had left supplies for them and how they could find them. Still, they continued to call out to us by name, begging us for mercy so we wouldn’t abandon them to die on the island.

The former castaway had secretly helped him escape in a small boat hours earlier, now explaining he did it to save our lives, which would have been lost if 'the man with one leg' had remained on the ship. But that wasn’t all. The ship’s cook hadn’t left empty-handed. Without anyone noticing, he had cut through a wall and taken one of the bags of coins—worth maybe three or four hundred guineas—to aid him in his travels. I think we were all glad to be rid of him at such a small cost."

            "Ben Gunn was given a thousand pounds, which he rapidly spent or lost within nineteen days, finding himself begging by the twentieth. He was then provided with a position as a lodge-keeper, as he had once feared on the island, and became a popular, though somewhat ridiculed, local character, known for his singing in church.",
            "No further information about Long John Silver ever reached them. Jim expresses a hope that Silver reunited with his former black companion and perhaps lives comfortably, given that his prospects for spiritual comfort in the afterlife seemed slim.",
            "Jim believes the remaining silver bars and weapons are still buried where Flint interred them, and he harbors no desire to ever revisit the accursed island.",
            "He is persistently troubled by nightmares featuring the sound of the surf on its coasts and the terrifying memory of Captain Flint's characteristic exclamation concerning silver coins."

Five men only of those who had sailed returned with her. “Drink and the devil had done for the rest,” with a vengeance, although, to be sure, we were not quite in so bad a case as that other ship they sang about: With one man of her crew alive, What put to sea with seventy-five.\nAll of us had an ample share of the treasure and used it wisely or foolishly, according to our natures. Captain Smollett is now retired from the sea. Gray not only saved his money, but being suddenly smit with the desire to rise, also studied his profession, and he is now mate and part owner of a fine full-rigged ship, married besides, and the father of a family. As for Ben Gunn, he got a thousand pounds, which he spent or lost in three weeks, or to be more exact, in nineteen days, for he was back begging on the twentieth. Then he was given a lodge to keep, exactly as he had feared upon the island; and he still lives, a great favourite, though something of a butt, with the country boys, and a notable singer in church on Sundays and saints’ days.\nOf Silver we have heard no more. That formidable seafaring man with one leg has at last gone clean out of my life; but I dare say he met his old Negress, and perhaps still lives in comfort with her and Captain Flint. It is to be hoped so, I suppose, for his chances of comfort in another world are very small.\nThe bar silver and the arms still lie, for all that I know, where Flint buried them; and certainly they shall lie there for me. Oxen and wain-ropes would not bring me back again to that accursed island; and the worst dreams that ever I have are when I hear the surf booming about its coasts or start upright in bed with the sharp voice of Captain Flint still ringing in my ears: “Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "In short, we successfully recruited a few sailors, had a smooth journey back, and the Hispaniola arrived in Bristol just as Mr. Blandly was making plans for another ship to accompany her. Only five of the original crew members made it back. Most of the others, it seems, were finished off by 'drink and the devil' with severe consequences, although, truthfully, our situation wasn't quite as dire as that depicted in a song about another ship that set sail with seventy-five men and returned with only one survivor. We all received a generous portion of the treasure and used it according to our individual natures, whether wisely or foolishly. Captain Smollett has since retired from the sea. Gray not only kept his earnings but, suddenly motivated to improve his standing, also studied his maritime skills. He is now the mate and a part-owner of a fine, fully-rigged vessel, in addition to being married with children. As for Ben Gunn, he was given a thousand pounds, which he either spent or lost within three weeks, or to be precise, in nineteen days, as he was back asking for money on the twentieth. Subsequently, he was given a position looking after a lodge, exactly as he had feared while on the island. He remains there, quite popular but often teased by the local boys, and is known for his strong singing voice in church on Sundays and holy days. We never heard from Silver again. That intimidating one-legged sailor is finally out of my life completely. However, I imagine he probably reunited with his old Negress and possibly still lives comfortably with her and Captain Flint (the parrot). I suppose one must hope so, as his chances of comfort in the next world are very slim. The silver bars and weapons, as far as I know, are still lying where Flint buried them; and they will certainly stay there as far as I am concerned. Nothing, not even oxen and thick ropes, could drag me back to that cursed island. My worst nightmares involve hearing the sound of the waves crashing against its shores or waking up abruptly in bed with the sharp voice of Captain Flint echoing in my ears: 'Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "In short, we managed to get a crew together and sailed safely back home, with the Hispaniola arriving in Bristol just as Mr. Blandly was considering preparing another ship. Only five of our original crew made it back. \"Drink and the devil\" had claimed the rest, though we fared better than the ship in the old song that returned with only one survivor out of seventy-five. We all received a fair portion of the treasure and spent it according to our own dispositions. Captain Smollett has now retired from sailing. Gray not only saved his share but was inspired to further his career and is now the mate and part owner of a large, well-equipped ship. He is also married with children. Ben Gunn was given a thousand pounds, which he quickly squandered or lost in just nineteen days, and he was soon begging again. He was then given a lodge to look after, just as he feared on the island, and he still lives there, well-liked if somewhat ridiculed by the local boys, and is known for singing in church. We haven’t heard anything more about Silver; the fearsome one-legged sailor has disappeared from my life, though perhaps he found his old companion and lives comfortably with her and Captain Flint. If so, it's probably better for him, as his prospects in the hereafter are dim. The silver and weapons that Flint hid, as far as I know, remain buried where they were, and I have no intention of returning to that cursed island—not for anything. My worst nightmares are of hearing the waves on its shore or waking at night to Captain Flint’s parrot still crying, \"Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!\""
