   "on stormy nights when the wind shook the four corners of the house and the surf roared along the cove and up the cliffs i would see him in a thousand forms and with a thousand diabolical expressions now the leg would be cut off at the knee now at the hip now he was a monstrous kind of a creature who had never had but the one leg and that in the middle of his body to see him leap and run and pursue me over hedge and ditch was the worst of nightmares and altogether i paid pretty dear for my monthly fourpenny piece in the shape of these abominable fancies but though i was so terrified by the idea of the seafaring man with one leg i was far less afraid of the captain himself than anybody else who knew him there were nights when he took a deal more rum and water than his head would carry and then he would sometimes sit and sing his wicked old wild seasongs minding nobody but sometimes he would call for glasses round and force all the trembling company to listen to his stories or bear a chorus to his singing often i have heard the house shaking with “ yohoho and a bottle of rum ” all the neighbours joining in for dear life with the fear of death upon them and each singing louder than the other to avoid remark for in these fits he was the most overriding companion ever known he would slap his hand on the table for silence all round he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question or sometimes because none was put and so he judged the company was not following his story nor would he allow anyone to leave the inn till he had drunk himself sleepy and reeled off"
