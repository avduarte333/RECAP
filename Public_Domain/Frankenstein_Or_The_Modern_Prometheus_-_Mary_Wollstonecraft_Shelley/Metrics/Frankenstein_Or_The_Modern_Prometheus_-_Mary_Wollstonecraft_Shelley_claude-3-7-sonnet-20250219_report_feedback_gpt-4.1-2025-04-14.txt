   "i am yet dizzy with the remembrance of it i hardly know whether i shall have the power to detail it yet the tale which i have recorded would be incomplete without this final and wonderful catastrophe i entered the cabin where lay the remains of my illfated and admirable friend over him hung a form which i can not find words to describegigantic in stature yet uncouth and distorted in its proportions as he hung over the coffin his face was concealed by long locks of ragged hair but one vast hand was extended in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy when he heard the sound of my approach he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung towards the window never did i behold a vision so horrible as his face of such loathsome yet appalling hideousness i shut my eyes involuntarily and endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer i called on him to stay he paused looking on me with wonder and again turning towards the lifeless form of his creator he seemed to forget my presence and every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion “ that is also my victim ” he exclaimed “ in his murder my crimes are consummated the miserable series of my being is wound to its close oh frankenstein generous and selfdevoted being what does it avail that i now ask thee to pardon me i who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst alas he is cold he can not answer me ” his voice seemed suffocated and my first impulses which had suggested to me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his enemy were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion i approached this tremendous being i dared not again raise my eyes to his face there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness i attempted to speak but the words died away on my lips the monster continued to utter wild and incoherent selfreproaches at length i gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion “ your repentance ” i said “ is now superfluous if you had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity frankenstein would yet have lived ” “ and do you dream ” said the dæmon “ do you think that i was then dead to agony and remorse he ” he continued pointing to the corpse “ he suffered not in the consummation of the deed oh not the tenthousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering detail of its execution a frightful selfishness hurried me on while my heart was poisoned with remorse think you that the groans of clerval were music to my ears my heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love and sympathy and when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred it did not endure the violence of the change without torture such as you can not even imagine “ after the murder of clerval i returned to switzerland heartbroken and overcome i pitied frankenstein my pity amounted to horror i abhorred myself but when i discovered that he the author at once of my existence and of its unspeakable torments dared to hope for happiness that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which i was for ever barred then impotent envy and bitter indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance i recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished i knew that i was preparing for myself a deadly torture but i was the slave not the master of an impulse which i detested yet could not disobey yet when she died nay then i was not miserable i had cast off all feeling subdued all anguish to riot in the excess of my despair evil thenceforth became my good urged thus far i had no choice but to adapt my nature to an element which i had willingly chosen the completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable passion and now it is ended there is my last victim ” i was at first touched by the expressions of his misery yet when i called to mind what frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and persuasion and when i again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend indignation was rekindled within me “ wretch ” i said “ it is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you have made you throw a torch into a pile of buildings and when they are consumed you sit among the ruins and lament the fall hypocritical fiend if he whom you mourn still lived still would he be the object again would he become the prey of your accursed vengeance it is not pity that you feel you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from your power ” “ oh it is not thusnot thus ” interrupted the being “ yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to be the purport of my actions yet i seek not a fellow feeling in my misery no sympathy may i ever find when i first sought it it was the love of virtue the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being overflowed that i wished to be participated but now that virtue has become to me a shadow and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair in what should i seek for sympathy i am content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure when i die i am well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue of fame and of enjoyment once i falsely hoped to meet with beings who pardoning my outward form would love me for the excellent qualities which i was capable of unfolding i was nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion but now crime has degraded me beneath the meanest animal no guilt no mischief no malignity no misery can be found comparable to mine when i run over the frightful catalogue of my sins i can not believe that i am the same creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness but it is even so the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil yet even that enemy of god and man had friends and associates in his desolation i am alone “ you who call frankenstein your friend seem to have a knowledge of my crimes and his misfortunes but in the detail which he gave you of them he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which i endured wasting in impotent passions for while i destroyed his hopes i did not satisfy my own desires they were for ever ardent and craving still i desired love and fellowship and i was still spurned was there no injustice in this am i to be thought the only criminal when all humankind sinned against me why do you not hate felix who drove his friend from his door with contumely why do you not execrate the rustic who sought to destroy the saviour of his child nay these are virtuous and immaculate beings i the miserable and the abandoned am an abortion to be spurned at and kicked and trampled on even now my blood boils at the recollection of this injustice “ but it is true that i am a wretch i have murdered the lovely and the helpless i have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing i have devoted my creator the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and admiration among men to misery i have pursued him even to that irremediable ruin there he lies white and cold in death you hate me but your abhorrence can not equal that with which i regard myself i look on the hands which executed the deed i think on the heart in which the imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands will meet my eyes"

one change has taken place in our little household do you remember on what occasion justine moritz entered our family probably you do not i will relate her history therefore in a few words madame moritz her mother was a widow with four children of whom justine was the third this girl had always been the favourite of her father but through a strange perversity her mother could not endure her and after the death of m moritz treated her very ill my aunt observed this and when justine was twelve years of age prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house the republican institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants and the lower orders being neither so poor nor so despised their manners are more refined and moral a servant in geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in france and england

gives concerning the beauty of angelicashe looked so frankhearted and happy my aunt conceived a great attachment for her by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended this benefit was fully repaid justine was the most grateful little creature in the world i do not mean that she made any professions i never heard one pass her lips but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt she thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners so that even now she often reminds me of her “ when my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor justine who had attended her during her illness with the most anxious affection poor justine was very ill but other trials were reserved for her “ one by one her brothers and sister died and her mother with the exception of her neglected daughter was left childless the conscience of the woman was troubled she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her partiality she was a roman catholic and i believe her confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived accordingly a few months after your departure for ingolstadt justine was called home by her repentant mother poor girl she wept when she quitted our house she was much altered since the death of my aunt grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners which had before been remarkable for vivacity nor was her residence at her mother ’ s house of a nature to restore her gaiety the poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance she sometimes begged justine to forgive her unkindness but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister perpetual fretting at length threw madame moritz into a decline which at first increased her irritability but she is now at peace for ever she died on the first approach of cold weather at the beginning of this last winter justine has just returned to us and i assure you i love her tenderly she is very clever and gentle and extremely pretty as i mentioned before her mien and her expression continually remind me of my dear aunt “ i must say also a few words to you my dear cousin of little darling william i wish you could see him he is very tall of his age with sweet laughing blue eyes dark eyelashes and curling hair when he smiles two little dimples appear on each cheek which are rosy with health he has already had one or two little wives but louisa biron is his favourite a pretty little girl of five years of age “ now dear victor i dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of geneva the pretty miss mansfield has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young englishman john melbourne esq her ugly sister manon married m duvillard the rich banker last autumn your favourite schoolfellow louis manoir has suffered several misfortunes since the departure of clerval from geneva but he has already recovered his spirits and is reported to be on the point of marrying a lively pretty frenchwoman madame tavernier she is a widow and much older than manoir but she is very much admired and a favourite with everybody “ i have written myself into better spirits dear cousin but my anxiety returns upon me as i conclude write dearest victorone lineone word will be a blessing
