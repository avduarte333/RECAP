Do you understand this feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes. Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his native river.",

I got here yesterday, and my first priority is to let you know I'm well and increasingly confident about the success of what I'm doing. I'm already far north of London. As I walk through the streets of Petersburgh, a cool northern wind touches my face, invigorating me and filling me with happiness. Can you understand this sensation? This wind, having traveled from the regions I'm heading towards, gives me a preview of those frozen places. This promising breeze heightens my excitement and makes my hopes even more intense and clear. I can't bring myself to believe the pole is a place of ice and emptiness; my imagination always pictures it as a region of beauty and joy. Up there, Margaret, the sun never sets; its wide disc just grazes the horizon, casting constant brilliance. There—and I'll trust what earlier explorers have said, if you'll allow it, my sister—snow and frost are gone. We can sail across a calm sea to a land that surpasses all other known places on Earth in its marvels and beauty. Its plants and features might be unlike anything seen before, just as the sights in the sky are undoubtedly unique in those unexplored lonely areas. What amazing things can't be expected in a place of endless light? I might discover the amazing force that guides the compass needle and refine countless astronomical observations that only need this trip to make their current inconsistencies perfectly clear forever. I will satisfy my intense curiosity by seeing a part of the world no one has visited and may step onto land no human foot has ever touched. These things motivate me, and they are enough to conquer any fear of danger or death and make me eagerly begin this challenging journey, feeling the same joy a child experiences when setting out in a small boat with friends on a discovery trip up their local river.",

I am already well north of London and, as I stroll through the streets of Petersburg, I feel the cold northern breeze on my face, which invigorates me and fills me with happiness. Can you relate to this sensation? This wind, which comes from the direction I am heading, gives me a taste of those icy lands ahead. Energized by this promising breeze, my imagination grows more vivid and enthusiastic. I can’t convince myself that the polar regions are just cold and bleak; instead, they seem beautiful and delightful to me. There, Margaret, the sun is always visible, grazing the horizon and spreading constant light. According to previous explorers—whose accounts I trust—snow and ice are absent there, and as we sail on calm seas, we may reach a land more wonderful and beautiful than any yet known to humans. The animals, plants, and sights may be completely unique, just as the movements of the stars are in those uncharted areas. What discoveries could await in a place of endless daylight? I might unlock the secret force that draws the compass needle or solve mysteries about the stars that this trip could explain. I long to see a part of the world no one has ever visited and step on land never before touched by humans. These dreams are motivation enough to overcome all fears of danger or death and make me as excited to begin this challenging journey as a child starting an adventure with friends up their home river."

This expedition has been my greatest aspiration since my childhood. I have avidly read accounts of the various voyages made with the aim of reaching the North Pacific Ocean through the seas surrounding the pole. You might recall that our kind Uncle Thomas's whole library consisted of histories of voyages of discovery. My formal education was neglected, yet I was extremely fond of reading.

This journey has been my cherished dream since childhood. I have eagerly read about the many expeditions aimed at reaching the North Pacific through the polar seas. You might recall that our Uncle Thomas's library contained only histories of such exploratory voyages. Though my schooling was lacking, I loved reading deeply. I pored over those books day and night, and the more I knew them, the deeper grew my disappointment that, due to my father's final wishes, my uncle could not let me pursue the life of a sailor."

I shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas’ books of voyages. At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native country. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen.

I have no friend, Margaret. When I am excited by success, there will be no one to share in my happiness; if I face setbacks, no one will be there to support me when I'm feeling down. While I can record my thoughts on paper, that method is inadequate for truly conveying emotions. I long for the company of someone who understands me, whose eyes would respond to mine. You might think I'm overly sentimental, dear sister, but I deeply feel this lack of a friend. I have no one close by who is both gentle and brave, possessing both a well-developed and a broad intellect, with tastes similar to my own, who could either endorse my plans or suggest improvements. How such a friend could correct the shortcomings of your poor brother! I am too quick to act and too impatient with challenges. But an even greater disadvantage for me is my self-education; for the first fourteen years of my life, I explored freely and only read travel books by our Uncle Thomas. It wasn't until I was fourteen that I discovered celebrated British poets. However, I only recognized the necessity of learning more languages than just my native tongue when it was too late to gain the most significant advantages from such knowledge. Now I am twenty-eight, and honestly, I am less informed than many boys of fifteen. It's true that I have contemplated more deeply and my imaginative ideas are grander, but they lack (to use an artist's term) 'keeping,' a sense of balance. I desperately need a friend with enough sense not to dismiss me as overly imaginative, and enough affection to help guide my thinking.",

When I succeed and feel joyful, there is no one to share my happiness with; when I suffer disappointment, there is no one to comfort me. Although I write down my thoughts, it’s a poor substitute for sharing real feelings. I long for someone who could understand and empathize with me, someone whose eyes would respond to mine. You might think I’m being sentimental, dear sister, but I feel this absence of friendship deeply. There’s no one around me who is both gentle and brave, intelligent and broad-minded, someone who shares my interests and could advise me on my plans. Such a friend would help correct my faults, as I am too eager in implementation and too impatient with obstacles. An even bigger issue is my education: for the first fourteen years of my life, I was undisciplined, reading nothing but travel books from our Uncle Thomas. Later, I discovered our nation’s famous poets, but I only realized too late how important it was to know other languages. Now I am twenty-eight and, in truth, less educated than many fifteen-year-old boys. I have certainly thought a lot and my dreams are grand, but they lack structure or coherence. I desperately need a friend who wouldn’t look down on my idealism, but would care enough to help guide me."

This circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made me very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved a young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover, instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young woman’s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations. “What a noble fellow!” you will exclaim. He is so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command.",

These qualities, combined with his well-known honesty and bravery, made me very eager to hire him. Growing up isolated, and spending my formative years under your tender and gentle care, has refined my character so much that I strongly dislike the harshness typically found on ships. I've never believed such brutality is necessary, and when I learned of a sailor equally famous for his compassionate heart and the respect and obedience he receives from his crew, I considered myself incredibly fortunate to secure his services. I first heard about him in a rather dramatic way, from a woman whose happiness in life he made possible. His story, in short, is this: Several years ago, he was in love with a young Russian woman of modest means. After he accumulated a significant amount of prize money, her father agreed to their marriage. He met his beloved one time before the scheduled wedding; however, she was crying profusely and, falling to her knees before him, begged him to release her, admitting at the same time that she was in love with someone else, but that her true love was poor and her father would never approve of their union. My generous friend comforted the pleading woman and, upon learning the name of her lover, immediately stopped pursuing her. He had already bought a farm with his earnings, where he planned to spend the rest of his life. Instead, he gave the entire property to his rival, along with the rest of his prize money to help buy livestock, and then he himself asked the young woman’s father to allow her to marry the man she loved. But the elderly father flatly refused, feeling a duty of honor to my friend. When my friend realized the father would not change his mind, he left his homeland and did not return until he heard that his former love had married according to her own wishes. You might exclaim, 'What a remarkable man!' And indeed, he is; but he is completely uneducated. He is very quiet, like a Turk, and possesses a sort of simple indifference, which, while making his actions more astounding, diminishes the interest and sympathy he might otherwise inspire.",

Combined with his integrity and bravery, these traits made me very eager to enlist him. Having spent my youth in isolation and benefited from your gentle care, I have developed a deep aversion to the harsh treatment often seen aboard ships; I've never thought it necessary. Hearing of a sailor respected for both his kindness and the loyalty he inspires in his crew, I felt particularly lucky to secure his help. I first learned about him in a rather romantic way: a lady whose happiness was owed to him told me his story. Years ago, he loved a modestly wealthy Russian woman. After earning significant prize money, he secured the father's approval to marry her. However, at their only meeting before the wedding, the woman tearfully begged to be released from the engagement, admitting she loved someone else who was poor and thus unacceptable to her father. Generously, my friend gave up his suit, and after learning the identity of her true love, gifted the rival both the farm and the rest of his money to help him start out. He even tried to get the father to approve the match, but the man refused, feeling obliged to my friend. When further persuasion failed, my friend left the country and didn't return until he learned the woman had married as she wished. \"What a remarkable man!\" you might say. Indeed, he is. But he is entirely uneducated, notably reserved, and somewhat carelessly ignorant, which makes his actions even more surprising but somewhat lessens the interest and sympathy he might otherwise inspire."

When he had in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and attended on him as much as my duty would permit. I never saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he is generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.\nWhen my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose. Once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle.\nHis countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and he replied, “To seek one who fled from me.”\n“And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?”\n“Yes.”\n“Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.”\nThis aroused the stranger’s attention, and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had pursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, “I have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.”\n“Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.”\n“And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have benevolently restored me to life.”\nSoon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge. I replied that I could not answer with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time; but of this I could not judge.",

Once he had somewhat recovered, I moved him to my cabin and cared for him as much as my duties permitted. He was the most captivating individual I had ever encountered. His eyes typically held a wild, almost insane look, yet at times, when someone showed him kindness or even a minor service, his entire face would light up with a warmth and gentleness that I had never seen equaled. However, he was generally downcast and without hope, sometimes grinding his teeth as if frustrated by the heavy weight of his troubles. When my guest was a little better, I had difficulty keeping the men away, as they were eager to question him extensively. I prevented them from bothering him with their pointless curiosity, understanding that his recovery, both physical and mental, clearly depended on complete rest. On one occasion, however, the lieutenant asked why he had traveled so far on the ice in such an unusual conveyance. His face immediately grew intensely somber, and he replied, \"To search for someone who ran away from me.\" The lieutenant asked if the man he was pursuing traveled the same way. He confirmed he did. The lieutenant then commented, \"Then I believe we saw him, for the day before we found you, we observed a man on a sledge pulled by dogs crossing the ice.\" This statement drew the stranger's attention, and he asked numerous questions about the path the \"demon,\" as he called him, had taken. Later, when we were alone, he remarked, \"I'm sure I've sparked your curiosity, as well as that of these good men; but you are too considerate to inquire.\" I replied, \"Indeed, it would be quite rude and unkind of me to trouble you with my own curiosity.\" He responded, \"And yet you saved me from a strange and dangerous situation; you generously restored me to life.\" Shortly after this, he asked if I thought the melting ice had destroyed the other sledge. I answered that I couldn't say for certain, as the ice hadn't broken up until nearly midnight, and the traveler might have reached a safe place before then; but I couldn't judge this matter definitively.",

Once he started to recover, I moved him to my own cabin and cared for him as much as my duties allowed. I had never met a more intriguing person: his eyes usually looked wild and almost mad, but when someone showed him even a small kindness, his face would brighten with a rare gentleness and sweetness. Still, most of the time he seemed sad and hopeless, sometimes even grinding his teeth as if burdened by his troubles.\n\nWhen he was a bit better, I had a hard time keeping the crew from bombarding him with questions, since they were very curious about him, but I insisted he be left in peace to help him recover. Yet, the lieutenant once asked why he had traveled so far over the ice in such a peculiar way. Immediately, the stranger looked very gloomy and answered that he was searching for someone who had escaped him. When asked if the person he pursued traveled in the same way, he confirmed. The lieutenant then mentioned that they had seen a man with a dogsled the day before rescuing him. This made the stranger very interested, and he asked many questions about where the person—whom he called the \"dæmon\"—had gone.\n\nLater, when we were alone, he told me he was aware that he had sparked curiosity, but he appreciated my restraint in not questioning him. I assured him I would not intrude on his privacy. He observed that I had saved him from a dangerous situation and had kindly brought him back to life. Shortly after, he asked if I thought the other sledge might have been destroyed when the ice broke. I said I could not be sure, since the ice broke late at night and the other traveler may have reached safety beforehand, but I couldn't say for certain."

Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all interested in him, although they have had very little communication with him. For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. He must have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable.\nI said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart.\nI shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should I have any fresh incidents to record.",

He showed immense eagerness to be on deck, hoping to watch for the sledge that had appeared earlier. However, I managed to persuade him to remain in the cabin, as he is far too feeble to withstand the sharpness of the atmosphere. I gave him my word that someone would keep watch on his behalf and inform him instantly if any new object came into sight. This concludes my journal entries regarding this peculiar event up to the current day. The stranger has slowly regained his health but remains very reserved and seems uncomfortable when anyone other than myself enters his cabin. Nevertheless, his mannerisms are so agreeable and kind that the sailors are all interested in him, despite having had very limited interaction with him. Personally, I am beginning to feel a brotherly affection for him, and his constant, deep sorrow fills me with empathy and compassion. He must have been a remarkable individual in his prime, being even now, in his deteriorated state, so captivating and pleasant. My dear Margaret, I mentioned in one of my letters that I didn't expect to find a friend on the vast sea; however, I have found a man whom, before his spirit was broken by misfortune, I would have been happy to consider a cherished brother. I plan to continue my journal about the stranger periodically, should there be any new occurrences to record.",

The stranger's health is gradually getting better, though he remains quiet and seems uncomfortable around anyone besides me. However, his pleasant and kind behavior has made the sailors curious about him, even though they've barely interacted. Personally, I am growing very fond of him, feeling a brotherly bond and deep sympathy for his ongoing sorrow. It's clear he must have been a remarkable person in happier times, for even in his weakened state, he is still charming and good-natured. I once wrote to you, dear Margaret, that I did not expect to find a friend out at sea; yet I have met someone whom, had circumstances been different, I would have gladly called a brother.

He has frequently conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without disguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken to secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my enterprise. One man’s life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race.

Even though he is clearly unhappy, he still shows genuine concern for others and takes a keen interest in my own plans, about which I have spoken candidly. He listens attentively and thoughtfully considers every detail and argument I present regarding my hopes for success. His sympathetic nature encourages me to open up honestly and passionately about my ambitions—so much so that I confess I would willingly give up my fortune, my life, even my dearest hopes, to achieve my goals. I say that a single life, or even death, is a small sacrifice for such important knowledge and the control over nature that could result. As I speak, my listener’s face darkens; he tries to hide his emotions, covering his eyes, and I notice tears running between his fingers and hear a painful groan from him. I stop speaking, and eventually, in a faltering voice, he addresses me: “Unhappy man! Do you share my madness? Have you, too, been intoxicated by ambition?

Such a man has a double existence: he may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.\nWill you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine wanderer? You would not if you saw him. You have been tutored and refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore somewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man. Sometimes I have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew.

The stars, the sea, and everything visible in these amazing places still seem capable of lifting his soul from earthly concerns.

Will you find my enthusiasm for this extraordinary wanderer amusing? You wouldn't if you saw him. Your education and separation from the world through books have made you refined and somewhat particular, but this only makes you better suited to appreciate the remarkable qualities of this wonderful man. Sometimes I have tried to figure out what quality he possesses that lifts him so far above anyone else I have ever known.

If my admiration for this remarkable traveler seems excessive, you would not think so if you met him. Your thoughtful background gives you a sensitivity that would let you fully value his exceptional qualities. Sometimes I try to pinpoint what sets him apart from everyone I have known; I think it’s his natural insight, his swift and accurate judgment, his ability to understand underlying causes, and, in addition, his eloquence and a voice so musical and expressive that it deeply affects the listener."

I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you in case of failure.

There was a sense of justice in my father’s upright mind which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her. Everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through.

I, their eldest child, was born at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained for several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother’s tender caresses and my father’s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something better—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled their duties towards me.

I have described myself as always having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied. Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted appeared even to my boy’s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.\nThe untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted with their practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little more. He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. He might dissect, anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him. I had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and ignorantly I had repined.\nBut here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more. I took their word for all that they averred, and I became their disciple. It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth century; but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favourite studies. My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a child’s blindness, added to a student’s thirst for knowledge. Under the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher’s stone and the elixir of life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention. Wealth was an inferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I could banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death!\nNor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors.

I have mentioned my lifelong intense desire to uncover the mysteries of nature. Despite the significant effort and amazing findings of contemporary scientists, my own reading always left me feeling unhappy and unfulfilled. Sir Isaac Newton is said to have admitted that he felt like a child collecting pebbles beside the vast, unknown expanse of truth. Even to my young mind, his followers in every area of natural philosophy seemed like beginners engaged in the same quest. The uneducated farmer observed the elements around him and understood their practical uses. The most educated scholar knew only slightly more.

Wealth was a less important goal, but how glorious the discovery would be if I could eliminate sickness from people's bodies and make humans immune to everything except a violent end! These weren't my only pursuits. Summoning spirits or demons was a promise generously offered by my favorite authors, which I most ardently tried to achieve. When my magic spells never worked, I blamed the failure on my own lack of experience and errors rather than on my teachers' lack of skill or honesty.

The uneducated farmer observed and used the elements around him for practical purposes, and even the most learned philosophers barely knew more––they could reveal a little about nature, but her true form remained mysterious. Scientists could analyze and identify parts, but the deeper reasons and causes remained hidden from them. I saw the obstacles that prevented people from fully understanding nature, and in my ignorance, I was frustrated by these limits.\nHowever, I found inspiration in books and the people who seemed to know more. I accepted their claims without question and became their follower. It might seem odd for this to happen in the eighteenth century, but, although I attended Geneva's schools, I taught myself most of what truly interested me. My father was not scientific, so as a child I struggled to learn, driven by curiosity but lacking proper guidance. Under the influence of these writers, I devoted myself to looking for the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life, soon focusing solely on the latter. Wealth did not interest me as much as the enormous recognition I could earn by eradicating human disease and making people safe from all but fatal injuries.\nBut my ambitions went even further. These beloved writers promised the possibility of summoning ghosts or devils, and I pursued such goals with great enthusiasm. When my attempts failed, I blamed my own lack of skill rather than any fault with their methods. Thus, for a time, I was absorbed in discredited ideas, mixing numerous conflicting theories and stumbling through a chaos of knowledge, led more by imagination and childish reasoning than by understanding, until an unexpected event again shifted my thinking."

It advanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained, while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight. As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing remained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the next morning, we found the tree shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood. I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed.\nBefore this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity. On this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me. All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable. By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former occupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a would-be science which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge. In this mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.",

It originated from behind the Jura mountains, and the thunder erupted simultaneously and deafeningly from different parts of the sky. I stayed and watched the storm develop, feeling both interested and pleased. Standing by the door, I suddenly saw a bolt of fire shoot out from a beautiful old oak tree located about twenty yards from our house. As soon as the blinding flash disappeared, the oak was gone, leaving only a charred stump. When we examined it the following morning, we found the tree was destroyed in a remarkable way. It hadn't been splintered by the impact, but was completely reduced to fine strips of wood. I had never seen anything so completely demolished. I already had some basic knowledge of the fundamental principles of electricity. During this event, a deeply knowledgeable man in natural philosophy was with us, and spurred by the destruction of the tree, he began explaining a theory he had developed about electricity and galvanism, which struck me as both novel and astonishing. Everything he said completely eclipsed the ideas of Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, who had previously dominated my thoughts. However, by some twist of fate, the discrediting of these figures made me reluctant to continue my usual studies. It felt as though nothing could ever truly be understood. All the subjects that had held my attention for so long suddenly seemed worthless. In a typical display of the impulsiveness often found in young people, I immediately abandoned my previous pursuits, dismissing natural history and all related fields as a flawed and failed endeavor.

Suddenly, all the subjects that had held my attention seemed worthless and disappointing.

I had hitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it necessary for the completion of my education that I should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my native country. My departure was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurred—an omen, as it were, of my future misery.\nElizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was in the greatest danger. During her illness many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had at first yielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She attended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemper—Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver. On the third day my mother sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert her. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself. “My children,” she said, “my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be the consolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to my younger children. Alas! I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all? But these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.”\nShe died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death. I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the soul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance. It is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed for ever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear can be hushed, never more to be heard. These are the reflections of the first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences. Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection? And why should I describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time at length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a sacrilege, is not banished. My mother was dead, but we had still duties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized.",

Up to that point, I had attended schools in Geneva, but my father believed it was essential for my education to be completed by experiencing customs beyond those of my homeland. My departure was scheduled for a near date, but before that day arrived, the first misfortune of my life occurred – foreshadowing my future misery. Elizabeth became ill with scarlet fever; her condition was severe, and she was in critical danger. During her illness, considerable effort was made to persuade my mother not to attend to her. Initially, she agreed to our pleas, but upon hearing that the life of her favorite was threatened, she could no longer suppress her worry. She cared for her at her sickbed; her diligent attention overcame the severity of the illness – Elizabeth was saved, but this risky action proved fatal to her rescuer. On the third day, my mother fell ill; her fever presented alarming symptoms, and the expressions of her doctors indicated the worst outcome. Even on her deathbed, the strength and kindness of this wonderful woman did not waver. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself. “My children,” she said, “my deepest hopes for future happiness were placed on the prospect of your marriage. This expectation will now be a comfort to your father. Elizabeth, my dear, you must take my place in caring for my younger children. Alas! I regret being taken from you; and, having been so happy and loved, isn't it difficult to leave you all? But these thoughts are not fitting for me; I will try to accept death cheerfully and cherish the hope of meeting you in another world.” She died peacefully, and her face showed affection even in death. There is no need to describe the feelings of those whose closest connections are severed by that most irreversible harm, the emptiness felt in the soul, and the despair visible on the face. It takes so long for the mind to accept that someone we saw daily, whose very existence felt like part of our own, could be gone forever – that the light in a beloved eye could be extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and precious could be silenced, never to be heard again. These are the thoughts of the initial days; but when the passage of time confirms the reality of the loss, then the true bitterness of grief begins. Yet, whose life has not been touched by that harsh hand, tearing away some dear relationship? And why should I describe a sorrow that everyone has experienced and must feel? The time eventually arrives when grief is less a necessity and more something we allow ourselves; and the smile that appears on the lips, while it might feel sacrilegious, is not suppressed. My mother was gone, but we still had obligations to fulfill; we had to continue our lives alongside others and learn to consider ourselves fortunate as long as someone remained untouched by death's grasp.",

Plans were quickly made for my departure; however, before I could leave, the first tragedy of my life struck, foreshadowing future sorrow.\n\nElizabeth fell ill with scarlet fever, and her condition became dire. Although we all tried to persuade my mother not to care for Elizabeth due to the risk of infection, she could not stay away once she learned how grave the situation was. Thanks to her devoted care, Elizabeth survived, but my mother’s selflessness cost her dearly—she contracted the disease herself. Within three days, my mother fell seriously ill with symptoms that alarmed her doctors. While dying, she remained courageous and kind, bringing Elizabeth and me together and expressing her wish for our happiness and for Elizabeth to look after my younger siblings. My mother accepted her fate calmly and hoped we would meet again in another life.\n\nShe passed away peacefully, still showing affection even in death. I will not attempt to put into words the grief of losing such a close, irreplaceable bond—the feeling of emptiness and despair when someone so central to our lives is gone forever. At first, it is hard to accept that a beloved person is truly lost, their voice and presence gone for good. Over time, the pain becomes real and the sorrow deepens. Yet, everyone eventually experiences such loss, and so I need not dwell on it. Eventually, grief becomes less overwhelming, and even a smile returns, though it feels almost wrong. Though my mother was gone, we still had responsibilities and had to carry on, appreciating those loved ones who remained with us."

These were my thoughts as I began my journey; but as I traveled, my spirits and hopes lifted. I intensely desired the acquisition of knowledge. Often, when at home, I had thought it unfair to remain confined in one place during my youth and had longed to enter the world and take my place among other people. Now my wishes were being fulfilled, and it truly would have been foolish to feel regret. I had plenty of time for these and many other reflections during my journey to Ingolstadt, which was lengthy and exhausting. At last, the town's high white steeple came into view. I got out and was escorted to my solitary room to spend the evening as I wished.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The day finally came for me to leave. Clerval spent the last evening with us. He had tried to convince his father to let him go with me and study alongside me, but his efforts failed. Clerval’s father, being a narrow-minded businessman, saw only laziness and disaster in his son’s hopes and ambitions. Henry felt the pain of being denied a broad education. He didn’t say much, though his passionate eyes and lively expression revealed a silent, determined resolve not to be trapped by the dreary life of commerce.\n\nWe stayed up late, unable to say goodbye or part from one another. Eventually, though, we said our farewells and went to bed pretending we were going to rest, each of us thinking the other hadn’t noticed our sadness. But at dawn, when I came downstairs to the carriage waiting to take me away, my father was there again to give me his blessing, Clerval was there to shake my hand one last time, and Elizabeth was there to urge me to write often and to give me her final affectionate attentions.\n\nI climbed into the carriage and let myself be immersed in melancholy thoughts. I, who had always been surrounded by kind friends and constant mutual happiness, was now alone. At the university I was going to, I would have to find new friends and look after myself. My life until now had been quiet and home-centered, which had made me resistant to meeting new people. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and Clerval—their faces were comfortingly familiar—but I felt completely out of place with strangers. These were my thoughts as I started my journey, but as I traveled, my spirits lifted and my hopes grew. I eagerly wanted to learn. Often, while still at home, I had been frustrated to spend my youth in one place, longing to experience the world and find my own place in it. Now my wish was granted, and I knew it would be foolish to regret it.\n\nI had ample time for such thoughts on my tiring, lengthy trip to Ingolstadt. Eventually, I saw the town’s tall white steeple in the distance. I got out and was taken to my lonely room to spend the evening however I wished."

Chance—or rather the evil influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father’s door—led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy. He was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. He asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy. I replied carelessly, and partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal authors I had studied. The professor stared. “Have you,” he said, “really spent your time in studying such nonsense?”\nI replied in the affirmative. “Every minute,” continued M. Krempe with warmth, “every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost. You have burdened your memory with exploded systems and useless names. Good God! In what desert land have you lived, where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they are ancient? I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.”\nSo saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural philosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he omitted.\nI returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape. M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits. In rather a too philosophical and connected a strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come to concerning them in my early years. As a child I had not been content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural science. With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists. Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy. It was very different when the masters of the science sought immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now the scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.",

Fate—or rather the destructive force that seemed to exert complete control over me from the moment I reluctantly left my father's house—led me first to M. Krempe, the professor of natural philosophy. He was a rude man but profoundly knowledgeable in his field. He inquired about my progress in various areas of natural philosophy. I answered dismissively, even scornfully, naming my alchemists as the primary authors I had studied. The professor was stunned. \"Have you,\" he asked, \"actually spent your time studying such rubbish?\" I replied affirmatively. \"Every minute,\" M. Krempe continued with fervor, \"every second you've wasted on those books is utterly lost. You've burdened your memory with outdated systems and worthless names. Good heavens! Where on earth have you lived that no one was kind enough to tell you these fantasies you've so eagerly absorbed are a thousand years old and as moldy as they are ancient? In this enlightened, scientific era, I hardly expected to find a follower of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear sir, you must completely restart your studies.\" With that, he stepped aside and wrote a list of several books on natural philosophy that he advised me to acquire. He dismissed me after mentioning that he planned to start a course of lectures on the general aspects of natural philosophy early the following week, and that M. Waldman, another professor, would lecture on chemistry on the days he did not. I returned home not disappointed, as I had already considered the authors the professor condemned to be useless. However, I wasn't any more inclined to return to these studies in any form. M. Krempe was a short, stout man with a harsh voice and an unpleasant appearance; thus, the teacher didn't make me favour the subject. Perhaps I have explained the conclusions I reached in my younger years concerning them in a rather overly philosophical and structured manner. As a child, I wasn't satisfied with the results promised by modern natural science professors. Due to my extreme youth and lack of a guide in such matters, my ideas were confused; I revisited the historical path of knowledge, trading the discoveries of recent investigators for the fantasies of forgotten alchemists. Furthermore, I disdained the practical applications of modern natural philosophy. It was quite different when the masters of the science sought immortality and power; such aims, though impractical, were grand. But now the situation had changed.

By chance—or perhaps by the malicious influence that had guided my fate since I left my father’s house—I was first introduced to M. Krempe, a professor of natural philosophy. He was a rough man but very knowledgeable in his field. He asked me about my studies in the different areas related to natural philosophy. I answered casually and even mockingly, mentioning that the main authors I had read were old alchemists. The professor looked at me incredulously and asked, “Have you really wasted your time on such nonsense?” I admitted that I had. M. Krempe, becoming heated, told me that any time spent on those books was completely wasted. He said that I had filled my mind with outdated ideas and useless names, expressing surprise that in this modern age, someone would still be a follower of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. He insisted I must start my studies from the very beginning. With that, he wrote a list of books on natural philosophy he wanted me to get and told me that he would start a new series of lectures the following week, while his colleague M. Waldman would be lecturing on chemistry on alternate days. I went home, not disappointed, since I had already regarded those old authors as pointless, but I also had no greater desire to return to those studies. I found M. Krempe, a short man with a gruff voice and unappealing appearance, not at all inspiring, and he did not make his subject seem attractive to me. Looking back, perhaps too philosophically, I remember that as a child, the results promised by modern scientists did not satisfy me. Because of my youth and lack of guidance, I had looked to the knowledge of the past, favoring the dreams of alchemists over current scientific discoveries. I also had little respect for the practical purposes of modern science. In the past, scientists sought immortality and power—goals that, while unrealistic, were noble and thrilling. Now, scientific ambition seemed focused only on disproving those grand visions, and I found myself asked to trade dreams of immense possibility for a reality that felt trivial."

But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And although I could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M. Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.\nPartly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very unlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. His person was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard. He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. He then took a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of its elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments, he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I shall never forget:\n“The ancient teachers of this science,” said he, “promised impossibilities and performed nothing. The modern masters promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places. They ascend into the heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of the air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.”\nSuch were the professor’s words—rather let me say such the words of the fate—enounced to destroy me. As he went on I felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception, one purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein—more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "These were my thoughts during the initial couple of days of my time in Ingolstadt, which I spent primarily getting to know the area and the main inhabitants of my new home. However, as the following week began, I considered the information M. Krempe had provided about the lectures. And although I couldn't bring myself to go and listen to that arrogant little man lecturing, I recalled what he had mentioned about M. Waldman, whom I hadn't met since he had been out of town until then. Partly out of curiosity and partly due to a lack of anything else to do, I entered the lecture hall, where M. Waldman arrived shortly after. This professor was very different from his colleague. He appeared to be around fifty years old but had an expression showing great kindness; a few strands of grey hair were at his temples, but the hair at the back of his head was almost black. He was short but stood remarkably straight, and his voice was the sweetest I had ever encountered. He began his lecture by summarizing the history of chemistry and the various improvements made by different learned individuals, pronouncing the names of the most notable discoverers with passion. He then briefly surveyed the current state of the science and explained many of its basic terms. After performing a few preliminary experiments, he concluded with a strong commendation of modern chemistry, the words of which I will never forget: “The earlier teachers of this science,” he said, “made impossible promises and accomplished nothing. The modern masters promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transformed and that the elixir of life is an impossible fantasy, but these scientists, whose hands seem only meant for handling dirt and whose eyes are strained from peering through the microscope or into a crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into nature's hidden places and reveal how she operates in her secret locations. They ascend into the skies; they have discovered how blood circulates and the nature of the air we breathe. They have gained new and almost limitless abilities; they can command the forces of lightning, imitate earthquakes, and even challenge the unseen world with its own illusions.” Such were the professor’s words—or rather, let me say, the words of destiny—spoken to destroy me. As he continued, I felt as if my spirit was wrestling with a tangible adversary; one by one, the various elements that formed the structure of my being were activated; principle after principle was awakened, and soon my mind was filled with a single idea, one concept, one purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein—more, far more, I will achieve; by following the steps already laid out, I will open a new path, explore unknown powers, and reveal the deepest secrets of creation to the world.",

Although I was not eager to listen to that self-important man speak, I remembered his mention of M. Waldman, whom I had yet to meet because he had been away. Driven partly by curiosity and partly by lack of anything better to do, I attended a lecture, and soon after, Professor Waldman arrived. He was very different from M. Krempe—about fifty years old with a kind expression, gray hair at his temples but darker hair elsewhere, short yet very upright, and possessing the most pleasant voice I had heard. He started his lecture by reviewing the history of chemistry and highlighting the most notable scientists. Waldman then discussed the current state of chemistry, defined basic terms, performed some introductory experiments, and concluded with strong praise for modern chemistry. He noted that ancient scientists made promises they could not fulfill, whereas modern scientists are more realistic, though their achievements have been remarkable—they have uncovered nature’s secrets, studied the universe, discovered the circulation of blood, analyzed air, and harnessed great powers such as electricity and earthquakes, even imitating the mysteries of the unseen world. These words seemed almost fateful to me; as he spoke, I felt an inner struggle, each part of my mind awakened, until I became consumed by a single idea and ambition. If so much had already been accomplished, I thought, then I would go even further; following in these footsteps, I would break new ground, discover unknown forces, and reveal to the world the greatest mysteries of creation."

There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a natural talent. On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit. His manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public, for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. I gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had given to his fellow professor. He heard with attention the little narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had exhibited. He said that “These were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.” I listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours. I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to procure.\n“I am happy,” said M. Waldman, “to have gained a disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success. Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not neglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics.”\nHe then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his various machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and promising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in the science not to derange their mechanism.

He added that work done by brilliant individuals, even when misguided, usually ends up benefiting humanity in some way. I listened as he spoke humbly, and I then told him that his lecture had helped me overcome any biases I had against modern chemists; I made sure to speak respectfully and modestly as befitted a student, and I hid any excitement I felt about my prospective work. I then asked his advice on what books to get.\n\nM. Waldman replied that he was pleased to have gained a student and, if I worked as hard as my ability suggested, he was certain I would succeed. He explained that chemistry was the field in natural science with the greatest progress and potential for advancement, which was why he focused on it, though he also kept up with other sciences. He cautioned that someone would make a poor chemist if they focused only on chemistry, and advised that anyone who wanted to be a true man of science, rather than just an experimenter, should learn all areas of natural philosophy, including mathematics.\n\nHe then showed me around his laboratory, explaining his equipment, telling me what I should get for myself, and promising to let me use his own after I had learned enough not to damage them. He also gave me a book list as I had asked. I then left.\n\nThat day proved to be hugely significant for me, as it set the course for my future."

Anyone with average intelligence who concentrates closely on one subject is bound to become very skilled in it; and I, constantly striving towards a single goal and totally consumed by it, improved so quickly that after two years, I made some advances in improving chemical equipment. This earned me considerable respect and admiration at the university.

Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed? It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless I had been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this study would have been irksome and almost intolerable. To examine the causes of life, we must first have recourse to death. I became acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body. In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared the apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become food for the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused, examining and analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret.",

I often pondered the source of the life principle itself. This was a daring question, historically regarded as an impenetrable mystery. Yet, we are frequently on the verge of breakthroughs, held back only by timidity or indifference. Reflecting on this, I resolved to dedicate myself more intently to the branches of natural science focused on the functions and activities of living organisms. Without being driven by an almost otherworldly passion, pursuing this study would have been burdensome and nearly unbearable. To investigate the origins of life, one must first turn to death. I gained knowledge of anatomy, but this proved insufficient; I needed to observe the process of natural decay and corruption in the human body. During my upbringing, my father took great care to ensure my mind was free from irrational fears. I honestly don't recall ever feeling afraid of a ghost story or fearing the appearance of a spirit. Darkness held no power over my imagination, and a cemetery was, to me, simply a repository for bodies that had lost life, transforming from vessels of beauty and strength into sustenance for worms. However, I was now compelled to study the cause and progression of this decomposition, forced to spend days and nights in burial vaults and charnel houses. My focus was fixed on sights most repellent to human sensibility. I witnessed the deterioration and waste of the human form; I saw the corruption of death replacing the vibrant glow of life; I observed how worms claimed the wonders of the eyes and brain. I paused, analyzing and dissecting every minute aspect of causation, as demonstrated in the transition from life to death, and potentially death to life, until, from the depths of this grim study, a sudden illumination dawned upon me—a light so brilliant and astonishing, yet so straightforward, that while the vast potential it revealed made me feel dizzy, I was astonished that among the many gifted individuals who had pursued similar scientific inquiries, I alone was destined to uncover such an extraordinary secret.",

I often wondered where the spark of life actually came from. This was an ambitious and mysterious question, but I realized that there are many things just within our reach to understand if only we’re not held back by fear or laziness. Considering all this, I decided to focus my studies on the areas of science that deal with how living things work—particularly physiology. Without being driven by an almost unnatural passion, my studies would have been unbearable. In order to explore the causes of life, it was necessary to study death first. So, I learned about anatomy, but that wasn’t enough; I also needed to witness how the human body decays over time. My father worked hard during my childhood to protect me from superstitious fears and ideas of the supernatural, so I never remember being scared by ghost stories or being afraid of the dark. Graveyards never disturbed me—they were just places where bodies, once full of life and beauty, had returned to the earth. Now, I found myself compelled to study exactly how this decay happened, spending many long hours among graves and dead bodies. I focused my attention on things that would usually be unbearable for most people. I saw firsthand how the body breaks down after death, how beautiful features waste away, and how even worms consume what were once the eyes and brain. I stopped often to analyze in detail every step and cause behind the transformation from life to death, and from death, potentially, back to life. Then, unexpectedly, I had a sudden, bright insight—a realization so impressive but so simple that I was overwhelmed by just how vast its implications were. I was astonished that, after so many brilliant people had studied this science, it was I alone who uncovered such an incredible secret."

Although I could impart life, the process of constructing a body to receive it, with all its intricate components like muscles, tissues, and blood vessels, remained incredibly challenging and demanding. Initially, I questioned whether I should create a simple organism or one as complex as a human. However, my imagination, fueled by my initial success, was too elevated to allow me to doubt my capacity to animate a creature as sophisticated and marvelous as man. The resources I currently had access to seemed barely adequate for such a daunting project, yet I felt confident I would ultimately triumph. I prepared myself for numerous failures; my efforts might be repeatedly thwarted, and my final creation could be flawed. Nevertheless, considering the constant advancements in science and engineering, I was encouraged to believe that my current endeavors would at least pave the way for future accomplishments. Nor did I see the sheer size and complexity of my undertaking as proof that it was impossible. It was with these thoughts that I commenced the creation of a human-like being. Because working with small parts significantly slowed me down, I decided, contrary to my original plan, to make the creature enormous, specifically about eight feet tall and proportionally large. After making this decision and successfully spending several months gathering and organizing my supplies, I began the work.",

Even though I was able to give life, constructing a body capable of receiving it—with all its complex tissues, muscles, and veins—remained extremely difficult and demanding. At first, I wondered if I should try to create a being like myself or something simpler, but my excitement from my initial achievement convinced me that I could bring to life a creature as intricate and amazing as a human. The resources I currently had seemed barely enough for such a big task, but I believed I would succeed in the end. I expected to face many setbacks and failures and that my final result might be flawed, but as I thought about the constant advancements in science and technology, I felt hopeful that my efforts would at least pave the way for future progress.

Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs. Pursuing these reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible) renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.\nThese thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking with unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my person had become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realise. One secret which I alone possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. Who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It was indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had returned to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel-houses and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house, and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase, I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials; and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work near to a conclusion.",

I viewed life and death as mere conceptual limits that I was destined to overcome first, so I could flood our shadowed world with a torrent of enlightenment. A new form of life would honor me as its creator and origin; many creatures, full of happiness and excellence, would owe their existence to me. No father could earn the gratitude of his child as completely as I would deserve theirs. While contemplating these ideas, I thought that if I could impart vitality to lifeless matter, I might eventually (though it seemed impossible at the time) restore life to bodies that death had seemingly condemned to decay. These reflections sustained my enthusiasm as I pursued my project with unwavering dedication. My complexion had become pale from study, and my body had grown thin from being shut away. Sometimes, just as I felt certainty was within reach, I failed; yet, I still clung to the hope that the very next day or hour might bring success. My singular secret was the ambition to which I had committed myself; and the moon witnessed my efforts through the night as I relentlessly and breathlessly delved into nature's hidden processes. Who can grasp the horrors of my clandestine labor as I handled the unsettling dampness of graves or subjected living animals to suffering to animate inert clay? My limbs now tremble, and my vision blurs at the memory; but back then, an irresistible, almost frenzied impulse drove me onward; I seemed to have lost all spirit or sensation except for this single pursuit. It was indeed just a fleeting state of intense focus, which only made me feel with renewed intensity as soon as the unnatural drive ceased and I returned to my usual routines. I gathered bones from places holding human remains and, with irreverent hands, intruded upon the profound mysteries of the human body. In a secluded room, or rather a cell, at the very top of the house, separated from all other areas by a hallway and stairs, I maintained my workshop for this repulsive creation; my eyes bulged with the intensity of focusing on the minute details of my task. Dissection rooms and slaughterhouses provided many of the materials I needed; and often, my human sensibilities recoiled with disgust from my work, yet, still propelled by an ever-increasing eagerness, I brought my project closer to completion.",

I dreamed of creating a new kind of being that would honor me as its maker; many noble and joyful lives would come into existence thanks to me. No father could ever deserve a child’s gratitude as much as I anticipated theirs. As I reflected, I considered that if I could give life to the lifeless, perhaps in time I might even restore life where death seemed final. These thoughts kept my spirits high as I relentlessly pressed on with my work. Studying so intently had left me pale and thin from long hours indoors. Sometimes, right when I was close to a breakthrough, I failed; but I always held on to hope that success might come at any moment. The secret knowledge I alone possessed became the focus of my dedication, and under the moon’s gaze in the middle of the night, I continued my experiments with unwavering passion, relentlessly seeking nature’s deepest secrets. Who could imagine the horror of my hidden labor as I worked with graveyard dampness or experimented on living animals to bring dead matter to life? Now, simply remembering makes me tremble, but at the time, I was overwhelmed by a wild and irresistible drive, barely aware of anything else. It was a brief obsession, after which, once the unnatural excitement faded, I returned to my previous ways with even deeper sensitivity. I gathered bones from burial sites, violating the mysteries of the human body with my hands. In an isolated room at the top of the house, cut off from the rest, I maintained my filthy workshop; I strained my eyes over the details of my task. Both dissecting rooms and slaughterhouses provided me with materials, and often my own humanity filled me with disgust at my work; still, my relentless obsession grew stronger as I neared my goal."

          "text_segment": "The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in one pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. And the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had not seen for so long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them, and I well remembered the words of my father: “I know that while you are pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall hear regularly from you. You must pardon me if I regard any interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally neglected.”\nI knew well therefore what would be my father’s feelings, but I could not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. I wished, as it were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature, should be completed.\nI then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from blame. A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind. If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections, Greece had not been enslaved, Cæsar would have spared his country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.\nBut I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my tale, and your looks remind me to proceed.\nMy father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before. Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not watch the blossom or the expanding leaves—sights which before always yielded me supreme delight—so deeply was I engrossed in my occupation. The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had succeeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment. Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime. Sometimes I grew alarmed at the wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone sustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myself both of these when my creation should be complete.",

It was a magnificent season, with fields producing an exceptional harvest and vines yielding a plentiful vintage. However, I was blind to the beauty of the natural world around me. This same intense focus that caused me to disregard nature also led me to neglect my distant friends, whom I hadn't seen in a long time. I understood that my lack of communication concerned them, and I vividly recalled my father's words: 'I know that as long as you are content with yourself, you will remember us with affection, and we will hear from you regularly. Please understand if I view any break in your correspondence as a sign that your other duties are also being neglected.'\n\nTherefore, I was well aware of how my father would feel, but I couldn't pull my thoughts away from my work, which, though inherently repulsive, had completely captivated my mind. I wanted, in a sense, to put off dealing with my emotional connections until the completion of this major goal that had consumed every aspect of my being.\n\nAt the time, I thought my father would be unfair to attribute my inattention to vice or personal failing, but I now accept that he was right to believe I wasn't entirely blameless. An ideal human being should always maintain a calm and peaceful state of mind and never let passion or fleeting desires disrupt their inner peace. I don't believe the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule. If the studies you undertake tend to weaken your bonds of affection and destroy your appreciation for simple, uncorrupted pleasures, then that study is certainly wrong – that is, it is not suitable for the human mind. If this principle were always followed, if no one allowed any pursuit to interfere with the peace of their family relationships, Greece would not have been enslaved, Caesar would have spared his country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the empires of Mexico and Peru would not have been destroyed.\n\nBut I am getting sidetracked by moralizing at the most interesting point of my story, and your expressions remind me to continue.\n\nMy father did not explicitly criticize me in his letters; he merely acknowledged my silence by asking about my activities in more detail than before. Winter, spring, and summer passed as I worked. I didn't notice the blossoms or the unfolding leaves – sights that used to bring me immense joy – because I was so completely absorbed in my task. The leaves of that year had already fallen before my work was close to completion, and each day now more clearly showed me how successful I had been. However, my excitement was overshadowed by anxiety, and I seemed less like an artist engrossed in their favorite project and more like someone condemned to the grueling labor of mining or some other unhealthy occupation. Every night I suffered from a persistent fever, and my nerves became agonizingly sensitive; the sound of a falling leaf startled me, and I avoided other people as if I were guilty of a crime. Sometimes I was alarmed by the physical and mental ruin I could see in myself; only the intensity of my purpose kept me going. My work would soon be finished, and I was convinced that exercise and entertainment would then cure the developing illness. I promised myself both once my creation was complete.",

The same obsession that made me ignore my surroundings also caused me to forget about my distant friends whom I hadn't seen in a long time. I was aware that my lack of contact troubled them and remembered my father's words: he expected to hear from me regularly as a sign of my good character, and any pause in my correspondence would make him suspect I was neglecting other duties as well. I understood how disappointed my father must have felt, but I was unable to break away from my work, unpleasant as it was, because it had such a powerful hold on my imagination. I kept postponing any emotional thoughts until I had finished my all-consuming task. At the time, I thought my father would be unfair to blame me, but now I realize he was right to feel I was not blameless. A perfect person should always maintain a peaceful mind and not allow obsessive pursuits to disrupt their tranquility—even the pursuit of knowledge shouldn't be an exception. If your studies make you less affectionate or unable to enjoy simple pleasures, those studies are harmful and unsuitable for people. If everyone followed this rule and didn't let their ambitions disrupt their peace and family ties, history might have been very different: Greece would not have been conquered, Caesar might have spared Rome, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the empires of Mexico and Peru might have survived. But I digress from my story. My father's letters never criticized me; he only asked more about what I was doing, noticing my silence. The seasons passed as I worked. I ignored the natural changes I once loved, so absorbed was I in my task. Autumn came before my project neared completion, and each day I saw more evidence of my success. Yet, my excitement was diminished by anxiety; I felt like a prisoner forced into hard labor, not an enthusiastic artist. Every night, I suffered from a low fever and became extremely nervous—so much so that even the sound of a falling leaf frightened me, and I avoided other people as if I were a criminal. Sometimes I was alarmed at how much I had deteriorated, but my sheer determination kept me going. I told myself the work would soon be done, and then I could restore my health through rest and amusement after I finished my creation."

I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. At length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness. But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest dreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in the streets of Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her, but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel. I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window shutters, I beheld the wretch—the miserable monster whom I had created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs. I took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I had so miserably given life.",

I had devoted nearly two years to intense effort with the sole goal of bringing life into an inanimate form. This pursuit had cost me my rest and well-being. I had desired its completion with an enthusiasm that went far beyond moderation; but now that it was finished, the charm of my vision disappeared, replaced by sheer horror and revulsion that gripped my heart. Unable to stand the appearance of the being I had brought into existence, I fled the room and spent a long time moving back and forth in my bedroom, unable to calm my mind enough to sleep. Eventually, exhaustion followed the internal chaos I had endured, and I threw myself onto the bed fully dressed, hoping for a few moments of oblivion. But it was fruitless; I did fall asleep, but my rest was plagued by the wildest nightmares. I dreamed I saw Elizabeth, radiant with health, walking through the streets of Ingolstadt. Overjoyed and surprised, I embraced her, but as I pressed the first kiss onto her lips, they turned the ghastly pale colour of death; her features seemed to transform, and I thought I was holding the corpse of my deceased mother in my arms; a shroud wrapped her body, and I saw grave worms crawling within the folds of the fabric. I awoke from my sleep in horror; a cold sweat covered my forehead, my teeth chattered, and every limb convulsed uncontrollably; then, in the faint, yellowish light of the moon, as it struggled through the window shutters, I saw the miserable creature—the wretched monster I had created. He held back the bed curtain; and his eyes, if they could be called eyes, were fixed upon me. His mouth opened, and he mumbled some indistinct sounds, while a grin creased his cheeks. He might have said something, but I did not hear; one hand was extended, appearing to try and stop me, but I escaped and rushed down the stairs. I took refuge in the enclosed courtyard belonging to the house I was occupying, where I stayed for the remainder of the night, pacing back and forth in extreme distress, listening intently, fearing every sound as if it were about to announce the approach of the demonic creature to whom I had so tragically given life.",

I couldn't bear to look at the being I had made, so I ran from the room and paced my bedroom for a long time, unable to sleep or calm my thoughts. Eventually, exhaustion overcame my turmoil and I collapsed onto my bed still dressed, hoping for a brief escape in sleep. Sleep came, but brought disturbing dreams: I saw Elizabeth, healthy and full of life, in Ingolstadt's streets. Joyful, I embraced her, but as I kissed her, her lips turned the color of death and her features transformed. Suddenly, I was holding my dead mother's corpse, wrapped in a shroud crawling with worms. I awoke in terror, sweating and shaken. Then, in the faint moonlight coming through the shutters, I saw my creation—the wretched monster I had made. He held back my bed curtain, his gaze fixed on me, mouth opening to mumble unintelligibly, a grimace twisting his face. He stretched his hand toward me as if to stop me, but I fled in panic and ran downstairs. I hid in the house's courtyard, too agitated to rest, pacing nervously and listening fearfully to every sound, dreading that it might be the approach of the terrible being I had brought to life."

I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial manner, and we walked towards my college. Clerval continued talking for some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to Ingolstadt. “You may easily believe,” said he, “how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping; and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch schoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: ‘I have ten thousand florins a year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.’ But his affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge.”\n“It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left my father, brothers, and Elizabeth.”\n“Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from you so seldom.

I walked with a quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my apartment might still be there, alive and walking about. I dreaded to behold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him. Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs, I darted up towards my own room.

Clerval chatted for a while about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in finally being allowed to come to Ingolstadt. He explained how difficult it was to convince his father that valuable knowledge existed beyond the 'noble art of bookkeeping,' admitting his father probably remained unconvinced, often repeating the sentiment of the Dutch schoolmaster from The Vicar of Wakefield: 'I earn a fortune without needing Greek, and I eat well without Greek.' However, his father's love eventually outweighed his disapproval of higher education, allowing him to embark on this 'voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge.' I told him how glad I was to see him and asked about the well-being of my father, brothers, and Elizabeth. He confirmed they were all fine and happy, though slightly worried by my infrequent letters. 'I intend to scold you about that myself later,' he added. Then, stopping and looking intently at me, he exclaimed, 'But, my dear Frankenstein, I just noticed how ill you look – so thin and pale. You seem like you haven't slept in days.' I admitted he was right, explaining that a recent intense project had prevented me from getting enough rest, but expressing sincere hope that this work was finally finished and I was free. I began to shake uncontrollably, unable to bear thinking about, let alone mentioning, what had happened the previous night. I quickened my pace, and we soon reached my college. A terrifying thought made me shiver: the creature I had abandoned in my room might still be there, alive and moving around. I dreaded encountering the monster myself, but the prospect of Henry seeing him filled me with even greater fear. Therefore, I asked Henry to wait at the bottom of the stairs for a few minutes and rushed up towards my room. My hand was on the doorknob before I fully processed what I was doing. I paused, a wave of cold fear washing over me. I yanked the door open forcefully, like a child expecting a ghost to be waiting on the other side, but the room was empty.

Clerval told me how my family was well, though a bit worried about my infrequent letters, and teased that he would scold me for it. Suddenly, he stopped and looked at me, surprised by how sickly I appeared. I admitted I’d been working intently without enough rest, but hoped that such exhausting work was over. I was still shaken by the events of the previous night and did not want to talk about it. Walking quickly, we soon reached my college. It then occurred to me that the creature I had left behind might still be in my room; I was terrified at the thought of encountering the monster—or worse, of Clerval finding him. I asked Clerval to wait downstairs and rushed to my room. With my hand on the doorknob, I hesitated, filled with dread, but when I entered, the room was empty.

More than just happiness overwhelmed me; I felt an intense physical sensitivity, causing my flesh to tingle and my heart to race. I couldn't remain in one spot for even a second, leaping over furniture, clapping my hands, and laughing loudly. Initially, Clerval thought my unusual high spirits were simply delight at his arrival. However, as he watched me more closely, he noticed a disturbing wildness in my gaze that he couldn't comprehend, and my loud, uncontrollable, and chilling laughter frightened and confused him.\n\n“Victor, my dear friend,” he exclaimed, “for heaven’s sake, what is wrong? Please stop laughing like that. You look terribly ill! What is causing all this?”\n\n“Don't ask me,” I cried, covering my eyes with my hands, as I imagined the terrifying spectre gliding into the room. “He can explain it. Oh, save me! Help me!” I hallucinated the monster attacking me; I thrashed violently and then collapsed in a seizure.\n\nPoor Clerval! How terrible his experience must have been. A meeting he had eagerly anticipated with such happiness had turned so terribly bitter. But I was unconscious of his distress, as I was lifeless and didn't regain consciousness for a considerable time.\n\nThis event was the onset of a nervous fever that confined me for several months. Throughout that entire period, Henry was my sole caregiver. I later discovered that he had concealed the seriousness of my condition from my father and Elizabeth. He knew my father was too old and frail for such a long journey and how much my illness would devastate Elizabeth. By hiding the extent of my ailment, he spared them this suffering. He understood that no one could be a more caring and diligent nurse than himself. Confident in the hope of my recovery, he was certain he was acting in their best interest, rather than causing harm, by undertaking the role he did.",

I was overwhelmed not just with joy, but with a heightened sensitivity that made my skin tingle and my heart race. I was so restless that I couldn’t stay still for even a moment; I leaped over chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed out loud. At first, Clerval thought my behavior was just excitement at seeing him, but as he watched me more closely, he noticed a wildness in my eyes and my uncontrollable, hollow laughter, which both alarmed and bewildered him.\n\n\"My dear Victor,\" he exclaimed, \"what on earth is wrong with you? Please don’t laugh like that. You’re very ill! What’s causing this?\"\n\n\"Don’t ask me,\" I replied, covering my eyes with my hands, because I thought I saw the terrifying apparition in the room; \"he can tell you. Oh, save me! Save me!\" I imagined that the creature grabbed me, so I fought desperately and then collapsed, unconscious.\n\nPoor Clerval! How must he have felt? He had looked forward to our reunion so happily, but now it was so suddenly painful. But I didn’t witness his sorrow, because I was insensible and didn’t regain consciousness for a very long time.\n\nThis was the beginning of a nervous illness that kept me bedridden for months. Throughout my sickness, Henry was my sole caretaker. I later learned that, knowing my father was too old for such a long trip and how much my illness would upset Elizabeth, Henry spared them from further grief by not telling them how ill I truly was. He believed I couldn’t have a more caring nurse than himself, and, confident that I would recover, he felt that keeping the truth from my family was the kindest choice he could make for them."

The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever before my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my words surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.\nBy very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and grieved my friend, I recovered. I remember the first time I became capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window. It was a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.\n“Dearest Clerval,” exclaimed I, “how kind, how very good you are to me. This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you promised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. How shall I ever repay you? I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I have been the occasion, but you will forgive me.”\n“You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but get well as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I may speak to you on one subject, may I not?”\nI trembled. One subject! What could it be? Could he allude to an object on whom I dared not even think?\n“Compose yourself,” said Clerval, who observed my change of colour, “I will not mention it if it agitates you; but your father and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own handwriting. They hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at your long silence.”\n“Is that all, my dear Henry?

The image of the monstrous being I had brought into existence was always in my sight, and I raved non-stop about him. My friend Henry was undoubtedly surprised by my words; initially, he thought they were the confused thoughts of my troubled mind, but the persistence with which I kept returning to the same subject convinced him that my illness did indeed stem from some unusual and dreadful experience. Through very slow stages, and with frequent setbacks that worried and distressed my friend, I got better. I recall the first moment I was capable of observing things around me with any sense of enjoyment; I noticed that the fallen leaves had vanished and that young buds were appearing on the trees that overshadowed my window. It was a beautiful spring, and the season greatly helped in my recovery. Feelings of happiness and affection also began to reawaken within me; my sadness lifted, and soon I became as cheerful as I had been before that destructive obsession afflicted me. “My dearest Clerval,” I exclaimed, “how kind, how incredibly good you have been to me. This entire winter, which you had planned to spend studying, has instead been spent in my sickroom. How will I ever repay you? I feel immense regret for the disappointment I caused, but please forgive me.” “You will fully repay me if you don't distress yourself, but recover as quickly as you can,” replied Clerval. “And since you seem to be in such good spirits, I may talk to you about one matter, may I not?” I trembled. One matter! What could it possibly be? Could he be referring to a being I didn't even dare to think about? “Calm yourself,” said Clerval, who noticed my face change color. “I won't mention it if it upsets you; but your father and cousin would be very happy to get a letter from you written in your own hand. They hardly know how ill you were and are worried about your long silence.” “Is that all, my dear Henry?

It was from my own Elizabeth:\n“My dearest Cousin,\n“You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear kind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account. You are forbidden to write—to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor, is necessary to calm our apprehensions. For a long time I have thought that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. I have prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to perform it myself! I figure to myself that the task of attending on your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor cousin. Yet that is over now: Clerval writes that indeed you are getting better. I eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own handwriting.\n“Get well—and return to us. You will find a happy, cheerful home and friends who love you dearly. Your father’s health is vigorous, and he asks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not a care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance. How pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our Ernest! He is now sixteen and full of activity and spirit. He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter into foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his elder brother returns to us. My uncle is not pleased with the idea of a military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your powers of application. He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his time is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the lake. I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.\n“Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken place since you left us. The blue lake and snow-clad mountains—they never change; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts are regulated by the same immutable laws. My trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing none but happy, kind faces around me. Since you left us, but one change has taken place in our little household. Do you remember on what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family? Probably you do not; I will relate her history, therefore in a few words. Madame Moritz, her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the third. This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and after the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt observed this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house. The republican institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it. Hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are more refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in France and England. Justine, thus received in our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.\n“Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica—she looked so frank-hearted and happy. My aunt conceived a great attachment for her, by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended. This benefit was fully repaid; Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress. Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate, yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt. She thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.\n“When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness with the most anxious affection. Poor Justine was very ill; but other trials were reserved for her.\n“One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless. The conscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her partiality. She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived. Accordingly, a few months after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her repentant mother. Poor girl! She wept when she quitted our house; she was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable for vivacity. Nor was her residence at her mother’s house of a nature to restore her gaiety. The poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance. She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness, but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister. Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is now at peace for ever. She died on the first approach of cold weather, at the beginning of this last winter. Justine has just returned to us; and I assure you I love her tenderly. She is very clever and gentle, and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her expression continually remind me of my dear aunt.\n“I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling William. I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair. When he smiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with health. He has already had one or two little wives, but Louisa Biron is his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.\n“Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of Geneva. The pretty Miss Mansfield has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq. Her ugly sister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn. Your favourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes since the departure of Clerval from Geneva. But he has already recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a lively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier. She is a widow, and much older than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with everybody.\n“I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety returns upon me as I conclude. Write, dearest Victor,—one line—one word will be a blessing to us. Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his kindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerely grateful. Adieu! my cousin; take care of yourself; and, I entreat you, write!\n“Elizabeth Lavenza.\n“Geneva, March 18th, 17—.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Clerval then presented me with the following letter, which was written by my dear Elizabeth:\n\n\"Dearest Cousin,\n\nYou have been seriously ill, and even the regular letters from kind Henry are not enough to ease my worry about you. You are currently unable to write or hold a pen; yet, a single word from you, dear Victor, is essential to calm our fears. I have long hoped that each mail delivery would bring this line, and I have managed to dissuade my uncle from making the trip to Ingolstadt. I prevented him from facing the difficulties and possible dangers of such a long journey, but I often regret not being able to undertake it myself! I picture your sickbed being attended by some impersonal old nurse who could never understand your needs or care for you with the tenderness and devotion of your poor cousin. However, that period is over now; Clerval writes that you are indeed improving. I anxiously await the confirmation of this news soon in your own handwriting.\n\nGet well and come back to us. You will return to a cheerful, happy home surrounded by friends who love you deeply. Your father is in robust health and only wants to see you and be certain you are well; no worries will ever cloud his kind face. How pleased you would be to see how much our Ernest has improved! He is now sixteen, full of energy and spirit. He wishes to be a true Swiss man and join foreign military service, but we cannot let him go, at least not until his elder brother returns home. Our uncle is not fond of the idea of a military career in a distant land, but Ernest never had your ability for focused study. He views learning as a hateful restriction; he spends his time outdoors, climbing mountains or rowing on the lake. I fear he will become unproductive unless we agree to his wishes and allow him to pursue the career he has chosen.\n\nLittle has changed since you left, apart from our children growing up. The unchanging blue lake and snow-covered mountains remain the same; and I believe our peaceful home and content hearts are governed by these same constant principles. My small daily tasks fill my time and entertain me, and my efforts are rewarded by seeing only happy, kind faces around me. Only one change has occurred in our small household since you left. Do you recall when Justine Moritz became part of our family? Perhaps you don't; therefore, I will briefly tell you her story. Madame Moritz, her mother, was a widow with four children, with Justine being the third. Justine had always been her father's favorite, but strangely, her mother could not stand her and treated her very poorly after M. Moritz's death. My aunt noticed this and, when Justine was twelve, persuaded her mother to let her live with us. The republican structure of our country has created simpler and happier customs than those found in the large monarchies around us. Consequently, there is less separation between different social classes; and the working people, being neither as impoverished nor as looked down upon, have more refined and moral manners. A servant in Geneva is not the same as a servant in France or England. When Justine was welcomed into our family, she learned the duties of a servant, a position which, in our fortunate country, does not involve ignorance or sacrificing one's human dignity.\n\nJustine, as you might recall, was one of your favorites; and I remember you once saying that if you were in a bad mood, one look from Justine could cheer you up, for the same reason Ariosto gives for Angelica's beauty—she looked so open-hearted and joyful. My aunt developed a strong affection for her, which led her to provide Justine with a better education than she had initially planned. This kindness was fully repaid; Justine was the most grateful little person imaginable. I don't mean she made any verbal declarations—I never heard one pass her lips—but you could see in her eyes that she practically adored her guardian. Although she had a lively and often thoughtless nature, she paid the closest attention to my aunt's every gesture. She considered her the perfect example of excellence and tried to copy her way of speaking and her behavior, so much so that even now she often reminds me of her.\n\nWhen my dearest aunt passed away, everyone was too consumed by their own sorrow to pay much attention to poor Justine, who had nursed her during her illness with the most devoted affection. Poor Justine herself was very sick; but other misfortunes were still in store for her.\n\nOne by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, left with only the daughter she had neglected, was childless. The woman's conscience became troubled; she began to believe that the deaths of her favorite children were a divine punishment to correct her bias. She was Catholic; and I believe her confessor confirmed the idea she had formed. As a result, a few months after you left for Ingolstadt, Justine was summoned home by her mother, who was now repentant. Poor girl! She cried when she departed our house; she had changed a lot since my aunt's death; grief had given a gentle softness and a charming mildness to her manner, which had previously been noted for its liveliness. Nor did her time at her mother's house help restore her cheerfulness. The poor woman's repentance was very inconsistent. She would sometimes ask Justine to forgive her past unkindness, but much more often accused her of being the cause of her siblings' deaths. Constant distress eventually caused Madame Moritz to fall into a decline, which initially worsened her irritability, but she is now at peace forever. She died with the first arrival of cold weather, at the beginning of this past winter. Justine has just returned to us; and I assure you I care for her deeply. She is very intelligent, gentle, and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her appearance and expression constantly bring my dear aunt to mind.\n\nI must also tell you a little about our sweet little William, my dear cousin. I wish you could see him; he is very tall for his age, with lovely laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curly hair. When he smiles, two small dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with health. He has already had one or two little 'wives', but five-year-old Louisa Biron is his favorite, a pretty little girl.\n\nNow, dear Victor, I imagine you might enjoy a bit of local gossip about the good people of Geneva. The lovely Miss Mansfield has already received congratulations on her upcoming marriage to a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq. Her less attractive sister, Manon, married the wealthy banker M. Duvillard last autumn. Your former schoolmate, Louis Manoir, has experienced several setbacks since Clerval left Geneva. But he has since recovered his spirits and is reportedly about to marry a lively, attractive Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier. She is a widow and considerably older than Manoir; but she is widely admired and liked by everyone.\n\nWriting this has lifted my spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety returns as I reach the end. Please write, dearest Victor—one line—a single word will be a great comfort to us. Countless thanks to Henry for his kindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are truly grateful. Farewell! my cousin; take care of yourself; and, I beg you, write!\n\nElizabeth Lavenza.\n\nGeneva, March 18th, 17—.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Clerval handed me a letter from Elizabeth. She wrote expressing deep concern for my health, as even Henry's reassuring letters had not put her mind at ease. She longed to hear directly from me, even though I was forbidden to write. Elizabeth described how difficult it was not to visit or care for me herself during my illness, worrying that a hired nurse could not provide the personal attention she would give. She was relieved to hear from Clerval that I was recovering, and dearly hoped I would soon confirm my improved health with a letter. Elizabeth spoke of our happy, loving home awaiting my return, noting that my father's health was good and Ernest had grown lively and ambitious, wanting to join foreign service—a choice the family hesitated to support, as he lacked academic focus and preferred spending time outdoors. She recounted the recent years since I left, mentioning the growth of the family’s children and the unchanging beauty of their home. Elizabeth told the story of Justine Moritz, a girl who had joined their household after being neglected by her mother, received an education, and gained the family’s affection, especially after caring for Elizabeth’s aunt during her final illness. Following more family tragedies and her mother's passing, Justine had returned to them, changed by sorrow but still beloved. Elizabeth also shared news about young William, describing his cheerful nature, and updated me on acquaintances in Geneva and their life events. She concluded the letter by expressing her persistent concern for me, gratitude for Henry's kindness, and a heartfelt plea that I write soon."

In doing this, I underwent a kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained. Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy. When I was otherwise quite restored to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms. Henry saw this, and had removed all my apparatus from my view. He had also changed my apartment; for he perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory. But these cares of Clerval were made of no avail when I visited the professors. M. Waldman inflicted torture when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I had made in the sciences. He soon perceived that I disliked the subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What could I do? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt. Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn. I thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I saw plainly that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in him that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.\nM. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. “D—n the fellow!” cried he; “why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has outstript us all. Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. A youngster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly as in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.—Ay, ay,” continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering, “M. Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man. Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was myself when young; but that wears out in a very short time.”\nM. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.",

This process was somewhat harsh, poorly suited to the mental trauma I had suffered. Ever since that fateful night when my work concluded and my troubles began, I had developed an intense aversion to everything related to natural philosophy. Even after being fully restored to health in other ways, seeing a chemical instrument would trigger the return of my distressing nervous symptoms. Henry observed this and removed all my scientific equipment from my sight. He also arranged for me to move to a different room, recognizing that I had come to dislike the place where my laboratory had been. However, Clerval's thoughtful efforts were ineffective when I visited the professors. M. Waldman unintentionally caused me suffering by warmly and kindly praising the incredible advancements I had made in the sciences. He quickly noticed my discomfort with the topic, but not understanding the real reason, he mistook my reaction for modesty. He then shifted the conversation from my achievements to the scientific field itself, clearly trying to get me to talk more. What could I do? He intended to please me, but he was actually agonizing me. It felt as though he was deliberately presenting me, one by one, with the very tools that would later be used for my slow, agonizing execution. I inwardly flinched at his words but didn't dare show my pain. Clerval, always perceptive of others' feelings, guided the conversation away, claiming complete ignorance of the subject as his excuse, and the discussion became more general. I was profoundly grateful to my friend in my heart, though I remained silent. I could tell he was surprised, but he never tried to pry my secret from me. And even though my love and respect for him were boundless, I could never bring myself to tell him about the event that constantly occupied my thoughts, fearing that recounting it to someone else would only make the painful memory more deeply ingrained.",

Even after my physical health had returned, seeing any chemical equipment would trigger my anxiety once more. Aware of this, Henry had removed all my scientific tools from sight and even arranged for me to move rooms, knowing I had grown to hate my old lab. Despite Clerval’s efforts, visiting the professors brought all my distress back. M. Waldman caused me pain when he warmly praised my scientific progress. Sensing my discomfort, but not understanding it, he thought I was just being modest and tried to engage me in conversation about the science itself. His attempts to please only made me more miserable, as if he was deliberately displaying the tools of my suffering. I struggled to hide my pain, but Clerval, always sensitive to others’ feelings, changed the topic, saying he knew nothing of the sciences, and so the conversation became more general. I was grateful to him, though I said nothing, and although he was clearly curious, he never pressed me to share my secret. Despite my deep friendship and admiration for him, I couldn’t bring myself to reveal the painful event that haunted me. \n\nM. Krempe was much less considerate, and in my hypersensitive state, his blunt praise hurt me even more than Waldman’s kind approval. He loudly proclaimed to Clerval how I had surpassed everyone at the university, a fact he found remarkable given my former naïveté. Seeing my discomfort, he attributed it to shyness—a trait he claimed would soon pass in youth. M. Krempe then switched to praising himself, which fortunately shifted the conversation away from the distressing topic."

He came to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had marked out for himself. Resolved to pursue no inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise. The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on the same studies. Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists. I did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary amusement. I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well repaid my labours. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of any other country. When you read their writings, life appears to consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,—in the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. How different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!\nSummer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was fixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several accidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable, and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring. I felt this delay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved friends. My return had only been delayed so long, from an unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become acquainted with any of its inhabitants.

He concentrated on Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit, and I readily joined him in these pursuits. I always disliked being idle, and at this time, I wanted to avoid dwelling on my thoughts and hated my previous studies. I found great comfort in studying alongside my friend and discovered both knowledge and solace in the writings of Eastern scholars. Unlike him, I didn't aim for a deep, critical understanding of the languages, as I only intended to use them for temporary entertainment. I simply read to grasp their meaning, and they richly rewarded my effort. Their sadness offers a calm feeling, and their happiness is uplifting in a way I had never experienced when reading authors from other countries. When you read their works, life seems to be about warm sunshine and rose gardens, the changing moods of a beautiful love interest, and the passionate suffering within your own heart. This is quite distinct from the strong and heroic poetry of ancient Greece and Rome! Summer passed while we were engaged in these studies. My journey back to Geneva was planned for late autumn, but various mishaps caused delays. Winter arrived with snow, the roads became impassable, and my departure was put off until the following spring. I was deeply unhappy about this delay because I eagerly wanted to return to my hometown and see my cherished friends.

Study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children. Excellent friend! how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own. A selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature who, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care. When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations. A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy.

Being engrossed in a selfish pursuit had constricted and narrowed my focus, but his kindness and care softened and expanded my perception. I became the happy person I was a few years before, when I was loved by everyone and had no worries or sorrows. When I was happy, even lifeless nature had the power to give me the most wonderful feelings. A clear sky and green fields filled me with intense joy.

The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged our walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone on before, were not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat until they should return. Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen his brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and afterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.\n“This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house. He was not there. We returned again, with torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night; Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the morning I discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and active in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the print of the murder’s finger was on his neck.\n“He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to see the corpse. At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted, and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, ‘O God! I have murdered my darling child!’\n“She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again lived, it was only to weep and sigh. She told me, that that same evening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that she possessed of your mother. This picture is gone, and was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed. We have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William!\n“Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weeps continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her words pierce my heart. We are all unhappy; but will not that be an additional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter? Your dear mother! Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she did not live to witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!\n“Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin, but with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of festering, the wounds of our minds. Enter the house of mourning, my friend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not with hatred for your enemies.\n“Your affectionate and afflicted father,\n“Alphonse Frankenstein.\n“Geneva, May 12th, 17—.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Upon my return, I discovered a letter from my father. He began by acknowledging that I was likely awaiting his letter to confirm my travel plans home, and admitted he was initially tempted to just give a date. However, he decided against it, fearing my shock and sorrow upon arriving expecting joy but instead finding tears and misery. He wondered how he could possibly convey our terrible misfortune, knowing that distance couldn't have made me indifferent to the family's happiness or sadness, and how painful it would be to deliver such news to me after my long absence. He stated his wish to prepare me, though he knew it was impossible, suggesting I was probably already scanning the page for the dreadful message. The horrifying news: William is dead! He described our beloved youngest child, whose smiles brought such delight and warmth, so gentle yet so lively, as having been murdered. Refusing to attempt consolation, he simply recounted the events. The previous Thursday, May 7th, he, Elizabeth, and my two younger brothers took a walk in Plainpalais. The pleasant, mild evening led them to walk further than usual, and it was nearly dark when they decided to turn back. They then realized William and Ernest, who had gone ahead, were missing. They waited on a bench, and soon Ernest returned, asking if they had seen his brother. He explained they were playing, William had run off to hide, and he couldn't find him after searching, nor had William reappeared after a long wait. This story worried them, and they continued searching until night fell. Elizabeth then thought he might have returned home, but he wasn't there. They went back to search again, carrying torches, as my father couldn't bear the thought of his sweet boy lost and exposed to the night's dampness and dew; Elizabeth was also deeply distressed. Around five in the morning, my father found my lovely son, whom he had seen full of health and energy the evening before, lying motionless and discolored on the grass. The mark of the murderer's finger was on his neck. He was brought home, and the visible grief on my father's face revealed the tragedy to Elizabeth. She was determined to see the body despite his initial attempts to stop her. Upon entering the room and quickly examining the victim's neck, she clasped her hands and cried out, 'Oh God! I have murdered my darling child!' She fainted and was revived with great difficulty. When she regained consciousness, she could only weep and sigh. She then told my father that William had begged her earlier that evening to let him wear a precious miniature portrait of my mother that she owned. This picture is now gone and is undoubtedly what tempted the killer. Despite their constant efforts, they have found no trace of the murderer, but these efforts cannot bring back my dear William. My father urged me to come home, dear Victor, saying only I could console Elizabeth. She cries constantly and wrongly blames herself for his death, which deeply pains my father. While the whole family is unhappy, he suggested this should be another reason for me to return and comfort them. He then lamented my dear mother's passing, saying, 'Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she did not live to witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!' He concluded by pleading with me to come home, Victor, not filled with thoughts of revenge against the killer, but with feelings of peace and kindness that will help heal the family's emotional wounds, rather than letting them worsen. He asked me to enter our grieving home, my friend, with affection for those who love me, not with hatred for enemies. The letter was signed by 'Your affectionate and afflicted father, Alphonse Frankenstein' from Geneva, dated May 12th, 17—.",

However, that would have been too cruel. Imagine expecting a joyful welcome, only to be faced with tears and sadness instead. How can I break our terrible news to you? I know that even though you’ve been away, you aren’t indifferent to our happiness or suffering. I hesitate to hurt my son, who has been gone so long. I want to prepare you for devastating news, but I know I can’t. I’m sure as you read this, you’re searching the page for the shocking event I must share.\n\n\"William is dead!—that dear child whose smile brought me such happiness and warmth, the gentle and lively boy—Victor, he has been murdered!\n\n\"I won't try to soothe you; I will just explain what happened.\n\n\"Last Thursday, May 7th, I went walking in Plainpalais with my niece and your two brothers. It was a pleasant evening, and we stayed out longer than usual. By the time we decided to go home, it was almost dark and William and Ernest, who had walked ahead, were missing. We waited on a bench for them. Soon, Ernest returned and asked if we had seen William—he said they were playing, that William ran off to hide, and that he couldn’t find him despite searching and waiting.\n\n\"This alarmed us, and we kept looking for William until it was dark. Elizabeth hoped he had gone home, but he wasn’t there. We searched again with torches, desperate since my sweet boy was missing and vulnerable outdoors all night. Elizabeth was also tormented. Around five in the morning, I finally found my precious William—whom I had seen healthy the night before—lying cold and lifeless on the grass, with the marks of a murderer’s fingers on his neck.\n\n\"We brought him home, and when Elizabeth saw my grief, she guessed the truth. She insisted on seeing his body. Initially, I tried to stop her, but she went into the room, quickly examined his neck, and cried out, 'Oh God! I have killed my beloved child!'\n\n\"She fainted and was difficult to revive. When she recovered, she just cried. She told me that William had begged to wear a precious miniature portrait she owned of your mother that evening, and now the picture is missing—it must have tempted the killer. We have no clues yet, though we refuse to give up searching; but nothing can bring back my dear William.\n\n\"Come home, Victor. You are the only one who can console Elizabeth, who weeps constantly and blames herself unfairly for William’s death—her grief is heartbreaking. We are all in misery. Won’t this give you even more reason, my son, to come home and comfort us? Your beloved mother—oh, Victor! I am grateful she did not live to see her youngest’s terrible death.\n\n\"Come back, Victor; come not with vengeful thoughts, but with the peace and kindness that will help heal us. Come into this grieving home with love for your family, not hatred for those who’ve wronged us.\n\n\"Your loving and heartbroken father,\n\n\"Alphonse Frankenstein.\n\n\"Geneva, May 12th, 17—.\""

          "text_segment": "But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a cabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.\nMy journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed through scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years. How altered every thing might be during that time! One sudden and desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; I dared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble, although I was unable to define them.\nI remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I contemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the snowy mountains, “the palaces of nature,” were not changed. By degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey towards Geneva.\nThe road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I approached my native town. I discovered more distinctly the black sides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc. I wept like a child. “Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your wanderer? Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and placid. Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?”\nI fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative happiness, and I think of them with pleasure. My country, my beloved country! who but a native can tell the delight I took in again beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely lake!\nYet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still more gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human beings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "As soon as the horses were ready, I quickly got into a carriage and said goodbye to my friend. My journey was very sad. Initially, I wanted to rush forward to be with and comfort my dear, grieving friends, but as I got closer to my hometown, I slowed down. I could barely handle the intensity of the emotions flooding my mind. I passed places I knew well from my youth, but hadn't seen in almost six years. How much everything might have changed in that time! One major, devastating event had occurred, but countless smaller things might have caused other gradual changes, which, though quieter, could be just as significant. Fear paralyzed me; I didn't dare move forward, terrified of countless unspecified misfortunes that made me shake, even though I couldn't name them. I stayed in Lausanne for two days in this distressed state. I looked at the lake: the water was calm; everything around was peaceful; and the snow-capped mountains, 'nature's grand structures,' hadn't altered. Slowly, the peaceful and beautiful scene restored me, and I continued my journey towards Geneva. The road followed the side of the lake, which became narrower as I got nearer my hometown. I could see the dark slopes of the Jura mountains and the bright peak of Mont Blanc more clearly. I cried like a child. \"Beloved mountains! My own beautiful lake! How do you welcome your returning traveler? Your peaks are clear; the sky and lake are blue and calm. Does this predict peace, or is it mocking my sorrow?\" I worry, my friend, that I'm becoming tedious by dwelling on these initial events; but they were relatively happy days, and I remember them with pleasure. My homeland, my cherished country! Only a native can understand the joy I felt seeing your rivers, your mountains, and especially your lovely lake again! Yet, as I got closer to home, sadness and fear overwhelmed me again. Night also fell, and when I could barely see the dark mountains, I felt even more despondent. The scene seemed like a vast, shadowy landscape of misfortune, and I vaguely sensed that I was destined to become the most miserable person alive. Sadly, I predicted correctly, and my only mistake was that in all the suffering I imagined and dreaded, I didn't grasp even a hundredth of the pain I was fated to experience.",

The road followed the narrowing lake to my native town, revealing the dark Jura mountains and the shining peak of Mont Blanc more clearly. I wept, overwhelmed by emotion, wondering if the tranquil scenery meant peace or mocked my sorrow. I hope I do not bore you by recalling these moments, but, compared to what followed, they were days of happiness I remember fondly. There is a special joy in seeing one’s homeland, something only a native truly understands. However, as I drew closer, sorrow and fear returned. Night fell, making everything seem even gloomier; I felt surrounded by darkness and had a sense of foreboding, as though I was fated to become utterly miserable. Sadly, I was right—I foresaw my suffering, but never imagined the full extent of the agony I would endure."

The sky was serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot where my poor William had been murdered. As I could not pass through the town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais. During this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont Blanc in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to approach rapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its progress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.\nI quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head. It was echoed from Salêve, the Juras, and the Alps of Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash. The storm, as is often the case in Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of Copêt. Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked mountain to the east of the lake.\nWhile I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with a hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my hands, and exclaimed aloud, “William, dear angel! this is thy funeral, this thy dirge!” As I said these words, I perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy dæmon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could have destroyed the fair child. He was the murderer! I could not doubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the south. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.",

The town gates were already closed, so I had to spend the night in Secheron, a village located about half a league from the city. The sky was clear, and since I couldn't sleep, I decided to visit the spot where my poor brother William had been killed. Unable to go through the town, I had to cross the lake by boat to get to Plainpalais. During this short journey, I watched the lightning create beautiful shapes on the peak of Mont Blanc. The storm seemed to be approaching quickly. After landing, I climbed a small hill to observe its progress. It advanced, the sky became clouded, and soon I felt large, slow drops of rain, which rapidly increased in intensity. I left my spot and continued walking, even as the darkness and storm intensified each minute and thunder exploded directly overhead with a terrifying sound. The sound echoed off Salêve, the Juras mountains, and the Savoy Alps. Intense flashes of lightning temporarily blinded me, illuminating the lake so it looked like a massive sheet of fire; then for a moment, everything seemed utterly black until my eyes recovered from the previous flash. As is common in Switzerland, the storm appeared to be active in different parts of the sky simultaneously. The most severe storm was located directly north of the town, over the section of the lake between the promontory of Belrive and the village of Copêt. Another storm sent faint flashes over the Jura mountains, while another obscured and sometimes revealed the Môle, a pointed mountain east of the lake. As I watched the tempest, which was both beautiful and dreadful, I walked on quickly. This grand display of nature's power in the sky lifted my spirits. I clasped my hands together and cried out, 'William, my dear angel! This storm is your funeral, this is your mournful song!' As I said these words, I saw a figure in the darkness emerge stealthily from behind a group of trees nearby. I froze, staring intently; I couldn't be mistaken. A flash of lightning illuminated the figure, clearly showing its form. Its enormous size and appearance, more hideously deformed than anything human, instantly made me realize it was the wretched, vile creature I had brought into existence. What was he doing there? Could he possibly be (I shuddered at the thought) the one who murdered my brother? The moment that idea crossed my mind, I was absolutely convinced it was true. My teeth chattered, and I had to lean against a tree for support. The figure moved past me quickly, and I lost sight of him in the darkness. No human being could have destroyed that beautiful child. He was the killer! I had no doubt. The very presence of the idea felt like undeniable proof. I considered chasing the monster, but it would have been useless, as another flash revealed him clinging to the rocks of the nearly vertical slope of Mont Salêve, a hill that borders Plainpalais to the south.

Thunder crashed loudly overhead, echoing off the surrounding mountains—Salêve, the Juras, and the Alps of Savoy—while brilliant flashes of lightning lit up the lake, making it look momentarily like a giant field of fire. Each flash was followed by a brief interval of complete darkness. It seemed as though storms were raging in different directions at the same time: the most intense storm was north of the city, another cast dim light over the Jura, and a third alternately revealed and hid the distant Môle mountain to the east.\n\nAs I watched this awe-inspiring and frightening storm, I walked quickly onward, moved by the wild scene in the sky. I raised my hands and called out, \"William, dear angel! This is your funeral, your funeral song!\" At that moment, I noticed a figure moving out from behind some nearby trees. I stopped and stared; I couldn't mistake it. Lightning illuminated the figure, and I saw clearly that its huge size and unnatural appearance marked it as the evil creature I had made. Was he there? Could he be my brother's killer? The thought horrified me, but I instantly believed it. I trembled, needing to lean against a tree. The figure quickly disappeared into the darkness. I was sure—no one human could have killed the innocent child. It had to be him. The thought alone convinced me. I considered chasing him, but another flash showed him climbing the steep rocks of Mont Salêve. He quickly reached the top and vanished from sight."

I revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget: the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of the works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure. Two years had now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and was this his first crime? Alas! I had turned loose into the world a depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not murdered my brother?\nNo one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair. I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to me.\nDay dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates were open, and I hastened to my father’s house. My first thought was to discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be made. But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. I remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited as to persuade my relatives to commence it. And then of what use would be pursuit? Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of Mont Salêve? These reflections determined me, and I resolved to remain silent.\nIt was about five in the morning when I entered my father’s house.",

My mind went over the events I had tried to put behind me: the entire process that led to the creature's creation; the sight of the being I had made standing by my bed; its leaving. Almost two years had passed since the night it first came to life. Could this really be its first crime? Oh, no! I had unleashed a wicked monster upon the world, one that enjoyed killing and causing suffering; had it not already killed my brother?",

Almost two years had passed since the night I gave it life—was this the first terrible act it had committed? Sadly, I had unleashed a corrupted creature into the world, one who found pleasure in violence and suffering. Had he not killed my own brother? No one can imagine the torment I endured the rest of the night, standing outside in the cold and rain. But the discomfort of the weather hardly mattered; my mind was full of dreadful and hopeless thoughts. I thought of the being I had made and given the desire and ability to commit such horrors as he had now done. I saw him almost as a kind of vampire or a spirit of mine let loose from the grave, doomed to destroy everything I cared for. When daylight came, I made my way to the town. The gates were open, and I hurried to my father’s house. My initial plan was to figure out what was known about the murderer and to immediately organize a search. But I hesitated when I realized what I would have to say: that a creature of my own making, brought to life by me, had confronted me at midnight in a remote mountain pass. I also remembered the nervous fever I suffered at the time of the creature’s creation, which would make my story sound like insanity. I knew that if someone else told me such a story, I would think them mad. Besides, the strange being would evade any attempt to catch him, even if my family believed me enough to try searching. And even then, what would be the point? Who could possibly capture something capable of climbing the sheer slopes of Mont Salêve? Considering all this, I decided to stay silent. I arrived at my father’s house at about five in the morning."

Beloved and venerable parent! He still remained to me. I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the mantel-piece. It was an historical subject, painted at my father’s desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale; but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the sentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my tears flowed when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me: “Welcome, my dearest Victor,” said he. “Ah! I wish you had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and delighted. You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.—Poor William! he was our darling and our pride!”\nTears, unrestrained, fell from my brother’s eyes; a sense of mortal agony crept over my frame. Before, I had only imagined the wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and a not less terrible, disaster. I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more minutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.\n“She most of all,” said Ernest, “requires consolation; she accused herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her very wretched. But since the murderer has been discovered—”\n“The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could attempt to pursue him? It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. I saw him too; he was free last night!”\n“I do not know what you mean,” replied my brother, in accents of wonder, “but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery. No one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would credit that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family, could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?”\n“Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?”\n“No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear, leaves no hope for doubt. But she will be tried today, and you will then hear all.”\nHe then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William had been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her bed for several days. During this interval, one of the servants, happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer. The servant instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition, Justine was apprehended.

Six years had gone by, feeling like a dream save for one persistent memory, and I found myself in the exact spot where I had embraced my father before my departure for Ingolstadt. My beloved and respected father was still with me. I gazed at the portrait of my mother, which hung over the mantelpiece. It depicted a historical theme, commissioned at my father's request, and showed Caroline Beaufort in deep anguish, kneeling beside her deceased father's coffin. Her attire was simple and rural, and her cheek was pale, yet there was an air of dignity and beauty that made feelings of pity difficult. Beneath this painting was a miniature of William, and tears welled up as I looked at it. While I was thus occupied, Ernest entered; he had heard my arrival and hurried to welcome me. \"Welcome, my dearest Victor,\" he said. \"Ah! I wish you had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all happy and joyous. You come to us now to share in a grief that nothing can alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems overcome by his misfortune, and your efforts will persuade poor Elizabeth to stop her futile and agonizing self-reproach.—Poor William! he was our darling and our pride!\" Tears flowed freely from my brother's eyes, and a sense of mortal pain crept over me. Previously, I had only imagined the misery of my devastated home; the reality descended upon me as a new and equally dreadful catastrophe. I tried to calm Ernest; I inquired more specifically about my father and mentioned my cousin. \"She most of all,\" said Ernest, \"needs comfort; she blamed herself for causing my brother's death, and that made her very unhappy. But since the murderer has been discovered—\" \"The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could possibly catch him? It is impossible; you might as well try to catch the wind or confine a mountain stream with a piece of straw. I saw him myself last night! he was free!\" \"I do not know what you mean,\" replied my brother, with a look of astonishment, \"but for us the discovery we have made only deepens our sorrow. No one believed it at first; and even now Elizabeth is not convinced, despite all the evidence. Indeed, who would believe that Justine Moritz, who was so pleasant and loved by the entire family, could suddenly be capable of such a terrible, so shocking a crime?\" \"Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the one accused? But it must be wrong; everyone knows that; surely no one believes it, Ernest?\" \"No one did initially,\" he replied, \"but several circumstances have come to light that have almost compelled us to believe it; and her own behavior has been so confused as to add such weight to the evidence of facts that, I fear, leaves no room for doubt. But she will be tried today, and you will then hear everything.\" He then recounted that, on the morning poor William's murder was found, Justine had become ill and remained in bed for several days.

He was still a beloved and respected figure to me. I looked at a painting of my mother over the mantelpiece, which my father had commissioned. It showed Caroline Beaufort, in deep despair, kneeling by her father's coffin. She looked pale and wore simple clothes, but retained a dignified beauty that almost prevented me from pitying her. There was also a small portrait of William below it, and I began to cry when I saw it. As I was lost in thought, Ernest came in. He’d heard I had returned and hurried to greet me. 'Welcome, my dearest Victor,' he said. 'If only you had arrived three months ago, you would have found us happy. Now, you have come to share our sorrow—a sorrow that nothing can ease. Still, your presence might help our father, who seems to be fading under the weight of his grief. Maybe you can convince Elizabeth to stop blaming herself. Poor William! He was our favorite.' Ernest started to cry openly, and I felt an overwhelming agony. Until now, I had only imagined how tragic things had become at home, but the harsh reality struck me like a fresh and equally awful blow. I tried to comfort Ernest, asking about our father and mentioning our cousin. 'More than anyone, she needs comforting,' Ernest said. 'She feels responsible for William's death, and it has made her miserable. But since they've found the murderer—' 'The murderer has been found? My God! How is that possible? Who could catch him? That's as likely as catching the wind or stopping a river with a straw. I saw him just last night! He was free!' 'I don’t understand,' Ernest replied in amazement. 'But whoever we believe responsible, the discovery has only deepened our misery. At first, no one could believe it, and even now Elizabeth refuses to accept it, despite all the evidence. After all, who could imagine that Justine Moritz—so kind and close to the family—could commit such a terrible crime?' 'Justine Moritz! That poor girl—is she accused? But it must be a mistake. Everyone must know that, right, Ernest?' 'No one believed it at first, but some new evidence has convinced almost everyone. Her own confused behavior has made things worse, and now the case against her seems hopeless. Her trial is today—you’ll hear the details then.' Ernest went on to explain that the morning William's murder was found, Justine became ill and was bedridden for several days. During that time, a servant, inspecting her clothes from the night of the murder, found the painting of my mother in her pocket—the thing believed to have motivated the killing. The servant showed it to another, who went straight to the magistrate. Because of their statements, Justine was arrested. When she was confronted, her nervous demeanor made the suspicion against her seem even stronger."

Justine, poor, good Justine, is innocent.”\nAt that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply impressed on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and, after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced some other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed, “Good God, papa! Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor William.”\n“We do also, unfortunately,” replied my father, “for indeed I had rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly.”\n“My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.”\n“If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to be tried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.”\nThis speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. I had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong enough to convict her. My tale was not one to announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as madness by the vulgar. Did any one indeed exist, except I, the creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance which I had let loose upon the world?\nWe were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had altered her since I last beheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of her childish years. There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect. She welcomed me with the greatest affection. “Your arrival, my dear cousin,” said she, “fills me with hope. You perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless Justine. Alas! who is safe, if she be convicted of crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do upon my own. Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate. If she is condemned, I never shall know joy more. But she will not, I am sure she will not; and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little William.”\n“She is innocent, my Elizabeth,” said I, “and that shall be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her acquittal.”\n“How kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her guilt, and that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible: and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing.” She wept.\n“Dearest niece,” said my father, “dry your tears. If she is, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the activity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "This report was strange, but it did not weaken my conviction; I responded with strong feeling, saying, \"You are all mistaken; I know who the murderer is.

After we had exchanged our sorrowful welcomes, he would have steered the conversation away from our tragedy, if Ernest had not cried out, \"My God, Father! Victor says he knows who killed poor William.\"\n\"Unfortunately, we do as well,\" my father answered, \"for truly I would rather have remained ignorant forever than discover such wickedness and lack of gratitude in someone I esteemed so highly.\"\n\"My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.\"\n\"If she is, may God forbid that she should suffer as if she were guilty. She is scheduled for trial today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be cleared.\"\nThis statement brought me calm. I was absolutely certain in my own mind that Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this specific murder. Therefore, I had no fear that any indirect evidence could be presented that would be strong enough to convict her. My story was not one that could be shared publicly; its shocking horror would be seen as madness by the common people. Did anyone else truly exist, besides me, its creator, who would believe, unless directly convinced by their senses, in the reality of the living embodiment of arrogance and careless ignorance that I had unleashed upon the world?\nSoon after, Elizabeth joined us. Time had changed her since I last saw her; it had given her a beauty that surpassed that of her childhood years. She still possessed the same frankness, the same energy, but it was now coupled with an expression of greater emotion and understanding. She welcomed me with the deepest affection. \"Your arrival, my dear cousin,\" she said, \"fills me with optimism. Perhaps you can find some way to clear the name of my poor, innocent Justine. Alas! who is safe, if she is convicted of a crime? I am as sure of her innocence as I am of my own. Our misfortune is twice as painful for us; we have not only lost that lovely cherished boy, but this poor girl, whom I genuinely love, is to be taken away by an even worse fate. If she is condemned, I will never know happiness again. But she will not be, I am sure she will not; and then I will be happy once more, even after the sad death of my little William.\"\n\"She is innocent, my Elizabeth,\" I told her, \"and that will be proven; have no fear, but let your spirits be lifted by the assurance of her acquittal.\"\n\"How kind and noble you are! Everyone else believes in her guilt, and that made me feel utterly wretched, because I knew that it was impossible. And to see everyone else so gravely prejudiced made me feel hopeless and despairing.\" She began to weep.\n\"Dearest niece,\" my father said, \"dry your tears. If she is, as you believe, innocent, trust in the fairness of our legal system and the efforts I will make to prevent the slightest hint of bias.\"",

Justine, poor and kind Justine, is not guilty.” Just then, my father walked in. His face showed clear signs of sorrow, but he tried to greet me warmly. After our somber reunion, he tried to change the subject to distract us from our tragedy, but Ernest suddenly said, “Father, Victor claims to know who killed William.” My father answered, “So do we, sadly. I almost wish I had never learned the truth, rather than know someone I cared for could act with such evil and betrayal.” I responded, “Father, you are mistaken; Justine is blameless.” He replied, “If that is true, may God prevent her from suffering as if she were guilty. Her trial is today, and I sincerely hope for her acquittal.” His words brought me some comfort. I was completely sure Justine, and indeed all people, were innocent of the crime. I was not afraid that there would be enough circumstantial evidence to condemn her. My own story was far too incredible to speak aloud; people would call it insanity. Was there anyone but myself—her creator—who could possibly believe in the living being I had unleashed, unless they saw it with their own eyes? Soon Elizabeth joined us. Time had changed her—she was even more beautiful and intelligent than before, but still honest and lively. She greeted me with deep affection, saying, “Your arrival gives me hope, dear cousin. Maybe you can help prove Justine’s innocence. If she is found guilty, who among us is safe? I trust her innocence as I trust my own. Our pain is doubled—we have not only lost dear William, but also risk losing someone I truly care for. If Justine is condemned, I can never be happy again. But she won’t be—I’m confident—and once she is freed, I will find happiness again, even after losing William.” I assured her, “Elizabeth, she is innocent, and that will be proven. Have courage—rest assured she will be found not guilty.” She replied, “You are so kind. Everyone else has been convinced of her guilt, and it made me miserable, because I knew it couldn’t be true. To see everyone so unfairly prejudiced made me feel hopeless.” She began to cry. My father gently said, “My dear niece, dry your tears. If Justine is indeed innocent as you believe, trust in the fairness of the law and know that I will act to ensure absolute impartiality.”"

Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised to render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious grave, and I the cause! A thousand times rather would I have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have exculpated her who suffered through me.\nThe appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning, and her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her feelings, exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in innocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by thousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were seated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness.",

My father and the rest of my family were required to testify, so I joined them at the courthouse. Throughout this horrific pretense of justice, I experienced unbearable torment. The proceedings would determine if my reckless curiosity and forbidden experiments would result in the deaths of two people: an innocent, joyful child and another individual brutally murdered with added layers of disgrace designed to make the crime horrifyingly memorable. Justine was also a virtuous young woman with admirable qualities that promised a happy life; now, all of it was to be extinguished in a shameful grave, and I was responsible! I would have gladly confessed to the crime attributed to Justine a thousand times over, but I was elsewhere when it happened, and such a statement would have been dismissed as the ravings of a lunatic, offering no exoneration for the one who suffered because of me. Justine seemed composed when she appeared. She was dressed in black, and her face, always pleasant, was made exquisitely beautiful by the gravity of her emotions. Still, she seemed certain of her innocence and did not tremble, despite being stared at and reviled by crowds, as any goodwill her appearance might have generated was overcome in the spectators' minds by the enormity of the act she was presumed to have committed. She was serene, though her calmness was clearly forced; having had her previous distress presented as proof of her guilt, she resolved to project an image of courage. Upon entering the court, she surveyed the room and quickly spotted where we were seated. A tear appeared to cloud her eyes when she saw us, but she quickly regained her composure, and a look of sad affection seemed to affirm her complete innocence.",

Since my father and the rest of the family had to appear as witnesses, I went with them to the court. Throughout this miserable travesty of justice, I endured excruciating emotional pain. The question at hand was whether my own reckless curiosity and unlawful actions would ultimately take the lives of two innocent people: first, a happy and innocent child, and second, someone murdered in a way so horrible and disgraceful that the crime would be forever infamous. Justine, too, was a deserving girl with the potential for a happy life, but now all that was to be erased by a shameful execution, and it was my fault! I would have much preferred to admit guilt for the crime attributed to Justine, but since I was away when it happened, such a confession would have been dismissed as the ravings of a lunatic and wouldn't have absolved her, even though she suffered because of me.\n\nJustine looked calm as she appeared. She wore mourner’s clothes, and though her face was always attractive, the seriousness of the occasion made her appear especially beautiful. Even though thousands of people looked on her and cursed her name—any sympathy her looks might have inspired replaced by the horror of the crime she was accused of—she held herself with composed confidence in her innocence and did not tremble. Still, it was clear her calm was forced, and as her previous confusion had been used as evidence of guilt, she forced herself to seem brave. When she came into the court, she looked around and quickly saw us. A tear seemed to form in her eye when she saw our faces, but she quickly composed herself again, and her sorrowful, affectionate gaze seemed to proclaim her complete innocence."

Justine's suffering wasn't as great as mine; she was supported by her innocence, while the grip of remorse tore at my heart and wouldn't release its hold. I spent a night of complete misery. The next morning, I returned to the court, my lips and throat dry. I didn't dare ask the dreadful question, but I was recognized, and the officer knew why I was there.

The crowd, in fact, turned against Justine even more angrily, accusing her of terrible ingratitude. Justine cried as Elizabeth spoke but did not reply. Throughout the trial, I was overwhelmed by anxiety and anguish. I knew she was innocent—I was certain of it. Could the demon who, I was sure, had murdered my brother, also have framed the innocent Justine for his own wicked amusement? The horror of the situation was unbearable. When I saw the crowd and the judges had already decided against her, I left the court in agony. My suffering was even greater than hers; she was kept strong by her innocence, whereas I was tormented by guilt and remorse that would not let me go. I spent a night in complete misery. The next morning, I returned to the court, feeling parched and unable to ask what had happened. However, the officer knew why I was there. The results were already in: every vote was against Justine, and she had been condemned."

She exclaimed her wish to die alongside Justine, feeling she could not continue living in such a miserable world. Justine managed to appear cheerful, although she struggled to suppress her deep sadness. She embraced Elizabeth and, with a voice trembling with emotion, said goodbye, addressing her as 'sweet lady,' 'dearest Elizabeth,' and 'my beloved and only friend.' She prayed for heaven's abundant blessings and protection upon her, hoping this would be the last misfortune Elizabeth would endure, and urged her to live, be happy, and bring happiness to others. The following day, Justine was executed. Elizabeth's powerful and emotionally charged pleas could not convince the judges to change their minds about the guilt of the seemingly innocent woman. My own impassioned and furious arguments were likewise ineffective. When I received their unsympathetic responses and heard their harsh, unfeeling reasoning, the confession I had intended to make remained unsaid.

My own emotional protests also had no effect. Their cold and unfeeling responses silenced me; I could have declared my own madness, but I could not undo the judgment and save Justine.

She was a stark contrast to the happy person she had been in her youth, when she roamed with me along the lake's edge and enthusiastically discussed our future hopes. This was her first significant sorrow, the type that serves to lessen our attachment to worldly concerns, and its darkening effect extinguished her most cherished smiles.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Our home was filled with grief. My father's health had suffered greatly because of the terrible things that had happened. Elizabeth was deeply sad and downcast; she no longer enjoyed her usual activities. She felt that any happiness would be disrespectful to those who had died, and believed that endless mourning and sorrow were the only proper response to such innocent lives being lost. She was no longer the joyful person from our youth who would walk with me by the lake and excitedly discuss our future. The first sorrow meant to separate us from worldly happiness had come to her, and its shadow had dimmed her brightest smiles."

Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other’s blood. Yet I am certainly unjust. Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures. For the sake of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend, a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if it had been her own! I could not consent to the death of any human being, but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men. But she was innocent. I know, I feel she was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me. Alas! Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can assure themselves of certain happiness? I feel as if I were walking on the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. William and Justine were assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free, and perhaps respected. But even if I were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with such a wretch.”\nI listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. I, not in deed, but in effect, was the true murderer. Elizabeth read my anguish in my countenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, “My dearest friend, you must calm yourself. These events have affected me, God knows how deeply; but I am not so wretched as you are. There is an expression of despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me tremble. Dear Victor, banish these dark passions. Remember the friends around you, who centre all their hopes in you. Have we lost the power of rendering you happy? Ah! While we love, while we are true to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native country, we may reap every tranquil blessing—what can disturb our peace?”",

She explained that before this tragedy, she had viewed accounts of wrongdoing and unfairness she encountered in books or heard from others as merely old stories or imaginary evils, distant issues that were easier to grasp intellectually than emotionally. However, now that suffering had struck close to home, she saw people as brutal monsters eager to harm each other. She admitted this might be unfair, given that everyone had believed the poor girl was guilty. If Justine had actually committed the crime for which she suffered, Elizabeth conceded, she would have been the most corrupt human being imaginable – murdering the son of her benefactor and friend, a child she had cared for since birth and seemed to love like her own, all for some jewelry. While Elizabeth said she could never endorse anyone’s death, she would have considered such a person unfit to live among others. Yet, she firmly believed Justine was innocent, stating she knew it and felt it, and that my agreement confirmed her conviction. She lamented, Victor, how terrifying it is when lies are so convincing that it becomes impossible to feel secure in one’s happiness. She felt as though she were precariously balanced on the edge of a cliff, with countless people trying to push her into the abyss. She pointed out that both William and Justine were victims, yet the murderer was free, walking among them and perhaps even respected. But she insisted she would never trade places with that wicked person, even if she were facing execution for the same crimes. I listened to her words with extreme anguish, knowing that I, in effect if not by direct action, was the true murderer. Elizabeth saw the torment on my face. Kindly taking my hand, she urged me to calm down. She acknowledged that these events had deeply affected her, but stated she was not as miserable as I appeared. She told me that the look of despair, sometimes even revenge, in my eyes frightened her. She pleaded with me to abandon these dark feelings, reminding me of our friends and family who depended entirely on me. She asked if we had lost the ability to make me happy. She concluded by expressing hope that as long as we loved and were loyal to each other, here in our peaceful and beautiful homeland, we could enjoy every quiet blessing, suggesting that nothing else could possibly disrupt our peace.",

Previously, she considered stories of wrongdoing and injustice, whether read or heard, as distant or even fictional, scarcely believable. However, now that suffering had come close to home, she saw people as capable of great cruelty. She admitted she might be judging too harshly, since everyone had believed Justine was guilty; had Justine truly committed such a crime, she would have been the most corrupt of humans. The idea of someone killing a child she cared for and loved, just for a few jewels, seemed monstrous. Elizabeth declared she could never approve of killing anyone, but if Justine were guilty, she would have thought her unworthy of society. Yet she was convinced Justine was innocent, and Victor’s agreement reassured her. Elizabeth lamented how easily lies can seem like truth, making real happiness feel unattainable, as if she were standing on a cliff’s edge among many eager to push her over. She grieved for William and Justine, both victims, while their true murderer remained free, possibly even respected. She insisted that even if she were to suffer punishment for those same crimes, she would not want to trade places with such a villain.\n\nVictor listened in intense pain, feeling responsible for the deaths, at least in effect. Elizabeth noticed his distress and, taking his hand, gently encouraged him to calm himself. She acknowledged her own deep pain but noted that Victor seemed even more tormented. She said she saw despair and sometimes thoughts of revenge in his expression, which frightened her, and urged him to let go of such feelings. Elizabeth reminded him of the friends and family who cared for him and hoped for his happiness, wondering if their love was no longer enough to comfort him. She reassured him that, as long as they had love and loyalty in their peaceful homeland, nothing should disturb their happiness."

They elevated me from all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my grief, they subdued and tranquillised it. In some degree, also, they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last month. I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were, waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I had contemplated during the day. They congregated round me; the unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods, and ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds—they all gathered round me and bade me be at peace.\n",

I visited the source of the Arveiron river, which begins at a glacier that is slowly moving down from the mountaintops to block the valley. Imposing mountains with steep sides rose before me; the glacier's icy face hung overhead; a few damaged pine trees were scattered about; and the profound quiet of this magnificent, royal natural setting was interrupted only by the sound of the rushing water or the crash of a large chunk falling, the thundering roar of an avalanche, or the cracking noises, echoing through the mountains, of the built-up ice. This ice, constantly fractured and split apart by the silent operation of unchanging natural laws, seemed as if it were merely a toy in nature's grasp. These awe-inspiring and splendid sights provided me with the greatest comfort I was capable of experiencing. They raised me above any insignificant feelings, and although they didn't eliminate my sorrow, they calmed and quieted it. To some extent, they also shifted my focus away from the thoughts that had consumed me for the past month. When I went to bed that night, it felt as though my sleep was watched over and cared for by the collection of grand shapes I had observed during the day. They seemed to gather around me: the pure white snowy peak, the sparkling summit, the pine forests, the rugged empty ravine, the eagle soaring among the clouds—they all converged around me and urged me to find peace.",

Surrounded by the steep cliffs of massive mountains and overshadowed by the glacier’s icy wall, I noticed a few broken pine trees scattered about; the only sounds breaking the profound silence of nature’s majestic domain came from the rushing stream, the crash of falling rocks, the thunderous roar of an avalanche, or the splitting and echoing of the ice as it was torn apart by unchanging natural forces, as if it were nothing in their grip. Witnessing these awe-inspiring and grand natural wonders gave me the deepest comfort I could feel. They lifted me above petty emotions; although my sorrow remained, it was calmed and softened. These sights also distracted me somewhat from the troubling thoughts that had occupied me for the past month. That night, as I went to sleep, the majestic images I’d observed during the day seemed to watch over me. They appeared in my dreams: the spotless snow-covered peaks, the sparkling summits, the pine forests, the rough barren ravines, and the eagle soaring in the sky—all surrounded me, offering me a sense of peace."

The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines of snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw destruction upon the head of the speaker.

Why do people pride themselves on having more feeling than animals? It only makes us more vulnerable. If our instincts were only hunger, thirst, or desire, we could be almost free; but as it is, we’re affected by every passing event or random word. We rest, but a dream can disturb our sleep. We wake up, and one stray thought can taint our day. Whether we feel, think, laugh, cry, hold on to sorrow, or push our troubles away, the feeling always leaves us eventually.

As soon as morning dawned I crept from my kennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could remain in the habitation I had found. It was situated against the back of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig sty and a clear pool of water. One part was open, and by that I had crept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on occasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and that was sufficient for me.\n“Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I retired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power. I had first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf of coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by my retreat. The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm.\n“Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until something should occur which might alter my determination. It was indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence, the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. I ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel. The girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found cottagers and farmhouse servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair hair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad. I lost sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail, which was now partly filled with milk. As she walked along, seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence. Uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the cottage himself. She followed, and they disappeared. Presently I saw the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I withdrew to this spot and lay down, relieved to have found a refuge, even a poor one, from the harsh weather and, more importantly, from cruel humans. At dawn, I crawled out of my small hiding place to get a look at the nearby cottage and determine if I could safely stay where I was. My refuge was located against the back wall of the cottage, with a pigpen and a clean water source flanking its open sides. It had an opening through which I had entered. I now used stones and wood to block any gaps through which I could be seen, making sure I could still move them to exit. The only light came through the pigpen, which was enough. After setting up my living space and covering the floor with fresh straw, I withdrew because I saw a man in the distance and, remembering how I had been treated the previous night, I didn't dare risk being seen by him. First, though, I secured food for the day by stealing a loaf of rough bread and obtained a cup, which allowed me to drink the clear water flowing nearby more easily than using my hands. The floor was slightly elevated, keeping it dry, and its closeness to the cottage's chimney provided some warmth. With my needs met, I decided to stay in this small shelter until circumstances changed. It felt like a paradise compared to the desolate forest I had previously lived in, with its dripping trees and damp ground. I ate my breakfast with satisfaction and was about to move a board to get some water when I heard footsteps. Peeking through a small crack, I saw a young woman walking past my hiding spot with a bucket on her head. She was young and seemed kind, unlike other country folk and farm workers I encountered later. Despite this, she was poorly dressed, wearing only a simple blue skirt and linen top. Her blonde hair was braided but unadorned. She appeared both patient and sad. She went out of view, but returned about fifteen minutes later carrying the bucket, which now contained some milk. As she walked, appearing to struggle with the weight, she met a young man who looked even more sorrowful than she did. He said a few mournful words, took the pail from her, and carried it to the cottage himself. She followed him inside, and they were gone from my sight. Soon after, I saw the young man again, carrying tools, crossing the field behind the house. The girl was also busy, sometimes inside the cottage and sometimes outside in the yard.",

At dawn, I quietly left my makeshift home to observe the nearby cottage and see if I could continue to stay in the spot I found. My shelter leaned against the back of the cottage, shielded on its open sides by a pigsty and a clear pond. The entrance was open, letting me sneak inside, but now I blocked every hole where I might be noticed with stones and wood, making sure I could always remove them if I needed to exit; all my light came through the pigsty, but it was enough.\n\nAfter organizing my home and lining it with clean straw, I lay low because I spotted a man in the distance and, recalling how badly I’d been treated the previous night, dared not risk an encounter. First, I made sure I’d have something to eat that day: I stole a rough loaf of bread and found a cup so I could drink the clear water flowing nearby, which was easier than using my hands. The floor was slightly raised, so it stayed dry, and thanks to its closeness to the cottage’s chimney, it stayed fairly warm.\n\nWith these preparations complete, I decided I would remain in this hut unless something convinced me otherwise. Compared to my last home—the chilly forest with dripping branches and soggy ground—this felt like a paradise. I enjoyed my breakfast and was about to move a plank to fetch water when I heard footsteps. Peering out through a narrow crack, I saw a young woman carrying a pail on her head walking past my shelter. She was young and gentle in manner, not like the cottagers and farmhands I later came to know. Though poorly dressed—in a simple blue skirt and linen jacket—her fair hair was braided but unadorned, and she appeared both patient and sad. After she passed out of view, she returned about fifteen minutes later, her pail now partly filled with milk. She appeared to struggle under its weight until a young man with a sorrowful expression met her, took the pail, and carried it into the cottage. She followed, and both disappeared.

It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet.

He then picked up a musical instrument and began to play, producing sounds more beautiful than those of any bird. It was a beautiful scene, even for me, a miserable being who had never witnessed anything lovely before. The elderly man's silver hair and kind face earned my respect, while the girl's gentle demeanor drew my affection. He played a sweet, sad tune that I noticed brought tears to the eyes of his pleasant companion. The old man seemed not to notice until she began to sob audibly. He then spoke a few words, and the beautiful girl put down her work and knelt at his feet. He helped her up and smiled with such warmth and tenderness that I felt emotions I had never before experienced, intensely and overwhelmingly.

I could not understand the reason for their sorrow, but it affected me deeply. If such beautiful people could be miserable, it was less surprising that I, a flawed and solitary being, should be wretched. But why were these gentle souls unhappy? From my perspective, they had a lovely dwelling and every comfort; a fire for warmth when cold, delicious food when hungry, excellent clothing, and, most significantly, they enjoyed each other's company and conversation, sharing affectionate and kind looks daily. What did their tears mean? Were they truly in pain? I was initially unable to answer these questions, but constant observation and the passage of time clarified many things that were at first confusing. It took a significant amount of time before I discovered one of the main reasons for this kind family's distress: it was poverty, and they experienced it to a very painful extent. Their only food came from the vegetables in their garden and the milk from one cow, which produced very little during the winter when they struggled even to feed the animal. I believe they often suffered intensely from hunger, particularly the two younger members, as I frequently saw them give food to the old man while leaving none for themselves.",

I couldn’t see a reason for their sadness, but seeing them unhappy affected me deeply. If these wonderful people were suffering, it made sense that I, who was lonely and flawed, would also be unhappy. Still, I wondered why these kind people were so sad. From what I could see, they had a lovely home and seemed to have everything: warmth from the fire, tasty food when they were hungry, good clothes, and, most importantly, each other’s company and daily expressions of love and kindness. What did their tears mean? Were they really in pain? At first, I didn’t understand, but after watching them closely for a while, I began to figure out the mysteries that had confused me. After some time, I learned one of the main reasons for this family’s distress: poverty, which they endured in a very severe way. Their diet was limited to vegetables from their garden and the milk from one cow, which in winter produced very little, barely enough to keep it alive. They frequently experienced hunger, particularly the two younger family members, since I often saw them giving what food they had to the old man and keeping none for themselves."

The old man, I could perceive, often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that he called them, to cast off their melancholy. He would talk in a cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me. Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father. It was not thus with Felix. He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends. But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old man.\n“I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked the dispositions of these amiable cottagers. In the midst of poverty and want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. Early in the morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and brought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand.

I observed the old man, their father, often attempting to lift his children's spirits when they seemed sad. He would speak cheerfully with a kind expression that was pleasant even to me. Agatha listened attentively, sometimes wiping away tears she tried to conceal, but her face and mood were usually brighter after hearing her father's words. Felix, however, was different. He consistently seemed the most downcast among them, and even to my untrained senses, he appeared to have experienced profound suffering. Yet, although his face showed more sorrow, his voice was more cheerful than his sister's, particularly when addressing the old man.\n\nI could recount numerous examples, though small, that revealed the character of these amiable residents. Despite their poverty and hardship, Felix joyfully brought his sister the first tiny white flower that emerged from beneath the snow.

I later found out that these tasks, carried out by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; on one or two occasions, I heard them express wonder, using phrases like 'good spirit' or 'wonderful,' although I did not understand the meaning of these terms at that time.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As the sun grew warmer and the days lengthened, the snow disappeared, revealing the leafless trees and dark ground. Around this time, Felix became busier, and the worrying signs that they might run out of food went away. I later learned their meals were simple but nourishing, and they always had enough to eat. New plants began to grow in the garden, which they tended, and with the arrival of spring, signs of their comfort increased daily.\n\nThe old man, supported by his son, would walk outside at noon each day when it wasn’t raining—a term I learned described when water fell from the sky. Rain happened often, but strong winds would soon dry the ground, making the season much more pleasant than before.\n\nMy days in my shelter followed a routine. In the mornings, I watched the activities of the cottage dwellers, and when they went off to their tasks, I slept. The rest of my day was spent observing them. After they had gone to bed, if there was moonlight or a clear, starry sky, I would go into the woods to gather my own food and collect wood for the cottage. Whenever necessary, I would clear their path of snow and perform other chores I had seen Felix do. Later, I discovered that the cottage family was quite surprised by these unseen acts of kindness; more than once, I overheard them say words like ‘good spirit’ and ‘wonderful,’ though at the time, I didn’t understand what they meant."

I thought (foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people. When I slept or was absent, the forms of the venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix flitted before me. I looked upon them as superior beings who would be the arbiters of my future destiny. I formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of me. I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle demeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and afterwards their love.\n“These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language. My organs were indeed harsh, but supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease. It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved better treatment than blows and execration.\n“The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the earth. Men who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation. The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves began to bud forth on the trees. Happy, happy earth! Fit habitation for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome. My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil, and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy.”",

I believed (what a fool I was!) that perhaps I possessed the ability to restore happiness to these worthy people. When I was asleep or elsewhere, the images of the kind blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix filled my mind. I viewed them as superior beings who would decide my future. I created countless mental images of introducing myself to them and how they might receive me. I imagined they would be repulsed at first, but that through my calm behavior and comforting speech, I would gradually gain their favor and eventually their love. These thoughts uplifted me and spurred me to redouble my efforts in learning language. My voice was rough, but adaptable, and although it sounded very different from their pleasant tones, I could pronounce words I understood with reasonable ease. It was like the difference between a donkey and a lap-dog, yet surely the gentle donkey with good intentions, despite its awkward mannerisms, deserved better treatment than abuse and curses. The welcome rain and warmth of spring significantly transformed the appearance of the world. People who seemed to have been hidden away before this change emerged and were busy with various farming tasks. The birds sang with happier notes, and leaves began to appear on the trees. Oh, happy, happy earth! A fitting home for divine beings, which only a short while ago was desolate, wet, and unhealthy. My mood was elevated by the enchanting look of nature; the past was erased from my memory, the present was calm, and the future was illuminated by bright rays of hope and joyful anticipation.",

Whether I was asleep or away, I kept envisioning the respected blind father, the kind Agatha, and the admirable Felix. I saw them as superior beings who would decide my fate in the future. In my imagination, I came up with countless scenarios of revealing myself to them, picturing how they might receive me. I thought at first they would be horrified at my appearance, but hoped that, through kindness and gentle words, I could slowly earn their trust and, eventually, their love.\n\nThese musings filled me with happiness and motivated me to study language more passionately. Even though my voice was harsh and very different from their pleasant speech, my flexible voice allowed me to pronounce the words I had learned fairly well. It was like the difference between a donkey and a lap-dog; still, a gentle, well-meaning donkey, though a bit clumsy, deserved kindness rather than rejection and cruelty.\n\nThe warm and gentle rains of spring transformed the landscape. People who had previously seemed to hide away now came outside and busied themselves with farming and other tasks. Birds sang more cheerfully and new leaves appeared on the trees. The world seemed so joyful and beautiful – a place worthy of gods – whereas before it had been bleak and unpleasant. The beauty of nature lifted my spirits; I forgot the past, enjoyed the peace of the present, and looked forward to the future with hope and happiness."

I shall relate events that impressed me with feelings which, from what I had been, have made me what I am.\n“Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies cloudless. It surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure. My senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty.\n“It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested from labour—the old man played on his guitar, and the children listened to him—that I observed the countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father paused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his son’s sorrow. Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door.\n“It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide. The lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black veil. Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix. Her voice was musical but unlike that of either of my friends. On hearing this word, Felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression. Her hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with a lovely pink.\n“Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I thought him as beautiful as the stranger. She appeared affected by different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. She did not appear to understand him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, and dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage. Some conversation took place between him and his father, and the young stranger knelt at the old man’s feet and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her and embraced her affectionately.\n“I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds and appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood by nor herself understood the cottagers. They made many signs which I did not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists. Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian. Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances, expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend. Presently I found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the same instructions to the same end. The stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I had before understood, but I profited by the others.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I will now move on to the more impactful section of my account. I will recount the occurrences that instilled in me feelings that have molded me into the being I am today, differing significantly from my former state. 'Spring arrived swiftly; the weather turned pleasant, and the sky was clear. I was astonished to see the landscape, which had been barren and desolate, now blossoming with the most exquisite flowers and foliage. My senses were delighted and invigorated by countless lovely sights and pleasant aromas. 'During one of these days, when the residents of the cottage took their regular break from work—the elder played his guitar while the younger ones listened—I noticed that Felix's expression was intensely sorrowful; he sighed often, and at one point his father paused his music. By his demeanor, I inferred that he was asking the reason for his son's sadness. Felix responded in a cheerful voice, and the old man was about to resume playing when someone knocked at the door. 'It was a woman on horseback, guided by a local man. She wore dark clothing and was concealed by a thick black veil. Agatha posed a question, to which the visitor simply replied by uttering Felix's name in a gentle voice. Her voice was melodious, but distinct from those of my two companions. Upon hearing his name, Felix hurried over to the woman, who, seeing him, lifted her veil, and I saw a face of angelic beauty and expression. Her hair was a shiny, dark black, intricately braided; her eyes were dark yet kind, and lively; her features were perfectly proportioned, and her complexion wonderfully fair, with a charming pink blush on each cheek. 'Felix appeared overwhelmed with joy when he saw her; all traces of sadness vanished from his face, and it immediately showed a degree of ecstatic happiness I could scarcely have believed possible; his eyes sparkled and his cheeks flushed with pleasure; and in that instant, I thought he was as beautiful as the stranger. She seemed to be experiencing different emotions; wiping away a few tears from her beautiful eyes, she extended her hand to Felix, who kissed it passionately and called her, from what I could make out, his sweet Arabian. She did not seem to understand him but smiled. He helped her dismount, dismissed her guide, and led her into the cottage. Some discussion occurred between him and his father, and the young visitor knelt before the old man and attempted to kiss his hand, but he lifted her up and embraced her warmly. 'I soon realized that despite uttering clear sounds and seemingly having her own language, the visitor was neither understood by the cottagers nor did she understand them. They used many gestures that I did not grasp, but I saw that her presence brought happiness to the cottage, dispelling their gloom like the sun disperses the morning fog. Felix seemed especially happy and welcomed his Arabian with joyful smiles. Agatha, always gentle, kissed the lovely visitor's hands and, pointing to her brother, made signs that I interpreted as meaning he had been sad until her arrival. Several hours passed in this way, during which their faces conveyed joy, the source of which I did not understand. Soon, I noticed by the frequent repetition of a sound that the visitor echoed after them, that she was trying to learn their language; and the thought immediately struck me that I should use the same method to achieve the same goal. The visitor learned about twenty words in her first lesson; most of these were, in fact, words I already knew, but I benefited from the others.",

Spring quickly arrived, bringing pleasant, clear weather. I was amazed to see the once-barren and bleak land now flourishing with vibrant flowers and greenery, delighting my senses with wonderful sights and smells. On one such day, while the cottagers were resting—the old man playing guitar as the children listened—I noticed that Felix appeared incredibly sad. He often sighed, and at one point, his father stopped playing and seemed to ask about his sorrow. Felix responded in a cheerful tone, and the music was about to resume when a knock sounded at the door. It was a woman on horseback, guided by a countryman. She wore a dark outfit and a thick black veil. Agatha asked her something, and the woman responded softly, gently saying Felix’s name, her musical voice unlike that of the others. Felix hurried to her; as she lifted her veil, I saw an extraordinarily beautiful face with lustrous dark hair, kind dark eyes, harmonious features, and fair cheeks tinged with pink. Felix was overcome with joy at her presence, his sadness replaced by delight; I thought he appeared as beautiful as the newcomer. She was moved in a different way; wiping tears from her eyes, she held out her hand for Felix to kiss, calling her his sweet Arabian, although she didn’t seem to understand and simply smiled. He helped her down and, after dismissing the guide, took her inside. Felix spoke with his father, and the stranger knelt as if to kiss the old man’s hand, but he lifted her and hugged her warmly. I soon realized the stranger had her own language and wasn’t understood by, nor did she understand, the cottagers. Although I did not understand their signing, it was clear her presence brought happiness, chasing away their sadness like sunlight dispels mist. Felix in particular was delighted, and Agatha kindly kissed the stranger’s hand, seeming to communicate that Felix had been sad before she arrived. Many hours passed in shared joy, though I didn’t understand the cause. I noticed the stranger often repeated certain sounds after them, trying to learn their language, and I immediately thought I could also learn from their lessons. She picked up about twenty words at first, most of which I already knew, but I learned new ones as well."

Safie was always cheerful, and both she and I made swift progress in learning the language, so much so that after two months I understood most of what my companions said.\n\nDuring this time, the once-black earth became lush with plants, and the green riverbanks were dotted with countless fragrant and beautiful flowers, glowing like pale stars beneath the moonlit trees. The weather grew warmer, the nights were clear and pleasant, and I greatly enjoyed my nighttime walks, although they became shorter because the sun set later and rose earlier. I never went out during the day, afraid I would be treated as harshly as I had been in my first encounter with villagers.\n\nI spent my days focused on learning the language, and I could even claim I progressed faster than Safie, who still spoke haltingly while I could understand and replicate almost everything that was said. As I learned to speak, I also received instruction in reading and writing, which revealed to me a vast world of fascination and joy."

I should not have understood the purport of this book had not Felix, in reading it, given very minute explanations. He had chosen this work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the Eastern authors. Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different nations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early Romans—of their subsequent degenerating—of the decline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings. I heard of the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants.\n“These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so vicious and base? He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike. To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm. For a long time I could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and loathing.",

He chose this book, he explained, because its oratorical style resembled that of Eastern writers. From this work, I gained a basic understanding of history and the world's current empires, learning about the customs, political systems, and faiths of various peoples. I heard about the indolent nature of Asians, the incredible intellect and energy of the Greeks, and the early Romans' military campaigns and impressive virtue, followed by their moral decay and the fall of their vast empire, as well as the eras of chivalry, Christianity, and monarchies. I also learned about the exploration of the Americas and mourned with Safie the tragic fate of its native peoples.\n\nThese fascinating stories filled me with conflicting emotions. Could humans truly be simultaneously so mighty, upright, and splendid, yet also so wicked and depraved? They seemed at times to be mere offshoots of evil and at others the epitome of nobility and divinity. To achieve greatness and virtue struck me as the highest honor a sentient creature could attain, while sinking into baseness and vice, as many historical figures had, appeared to be the ultimate disgrace, a state more wretched than a blind mole or a harmless worm. For a long while, I couldn't comprehend why one person would kill another, or even the need for laws and governments; but after hearing accounts of wickedness and violence, my confusion vanished, replaced by revulsion and deep dislike.",

The book exposed me to the customs, governments, and religions of various nations. I learned about the supposedly lazy Asiatics, the remarkable intelligence and creativity of the Greeks, the heroism and conflicts of early Rome, its eventual moral decline, and the fall of that great empire, as well as about chivalry, Christianity, and monarchs. I also heard about the European discovery of the Americas and, together with Safie, felt sorrow for the tragic fate of its native people.\n\nHearing these stories filled me with unusual emotions. I wondered if humanity could really be so powerful, virtuous, and brilliant, but also so corrupt and wicked. At times, humans seemed to be entirely evil, yet at other times they seemed noble and godlike. To be a great and good person seemed to me the highest honor possible, whereas being corrupt and vile seemed the most degraded existence—even worse than that of blind moles or harmless worms. For a long time, I couldn’t understand how one person could kill another, or why laws and governments were necessary. But after learning about human vice and violence, I was no longer surprised; instead I felt repulsed and disgusted."

While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the Arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me. I heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.\n“The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and unsullied descent united with riches. A man might be respected with only one of these advantages, but without either he was considered, except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few! And what was I? Of my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides, endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even of the same nature as man. I was more agile than they and could subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs. When I looked around I saw and heard of none like me. Was I, then, a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?\n“I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with knowledge.

As I heard Felix instructing the Arabian woman, the complex structure of human society was explained. I learned about the division of possessions, the vast gap between immense wealth and extreme poverty, and the significance humans placed on status, lineage, and noble birth. These revelations prompted me to examine myself. I discovered that the qualities most highly valued by your species were high social standing and an unblemished ancestry, combined with riches. Someone might be respected with only one of these advantages, but without either, they were generally considered, except in very rare cases, to be a homeless wanderer and a subordinate being, condemned to use their efforts for the benefit of a select few. And where did I fit in? I knew nothing of how I was made or who created me, but I was certain I possessed no money, no companions, and no form of property. Furthermore, I was endowed with an appearance that was horribly disfigured and repulsive; I wasn't even the same kind of creature as humans. I was quicker than them and could survive on a simpler diet; I tolerated extreme heat and cold with less harm to my physical form; my height significantly surpassed theirs. When I surveyed my surroundings, I saw and heard of no one like me. Was I, then, a monstrous being, a flaw on the earth from whom everyone fled and whom everyone disowned? I cannot articulate the torment these reflections inflicted upon me; I tried to dismiss them, but my sorrow only deepened with increased understanding. Oh, if only I had remained forever in my original dwelling place in the woods, knowing and feeling nothing beyond the basic sensations of hunger, thirst, and temperature!",

I discovered that people valued those with noble heritage and wealth most highly. A person could earn respect if he had either of these, but lacking both, he was usually seen as little more than a vagabond and a servant, forced to work for the benefit of a privileged minority. Who was I, then? I understood nothing about where I came from or who made me. I knew I had no money, no companions, and nothing I could call my own. On top of that, I was terribly deformed and repulsive; I was not even like other men. I was stronger and more resilient, able to survive on rougher food, and could endure extreme temperatures better than humans could. I was much larger than they were. Wherever I looked, I found no one like myself. Did that mean I was a monster, someone to be shunned and rejected by all people?\n\nI can't express how much pain these thoughts caused me; I tried to rid myself of them, but the more I learned, the sadder I became. I wished I had stayed forever in the woods where I was born, never knowing or experiencing anything beyond hunger, thirst, and warmth."

          "text_segment": "“I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They produced in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In the Sorrows of Werter, besides the interest of its simple and affecting story, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a never-ending source of speculation and astonishment. The gentle and domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which were for ever alive in my own bosom. But I thought Werter himself a more divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character contained no pretension, but it sank deep. The disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder. I did not pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely understanding it.\n“As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and condition. I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely unlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I was a listener. I sympathised with and partly understood them, but I was unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none. ‘The path of my departure was free,’ and there was none to lament my annihilation. My person was hideous and my stature gigantic. What did this mean? Who was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was my destination? These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to solve them.\n“The volume of Plutarch’s Lives which I possessed contained the histories of the first founders of the ancient republics. This book had a far different effect upon me from the Sorrows of Werter. I learned from Werter’s imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages. Many things I read surpassed my understanding and experience. I had a very confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers, and boundless seas. But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and large assemblages of men. The cottage of my protectors had been the only school in which I had studied human nature, but this book developed new and mightier scenes of action. I read of men concerned in public affairs, governing or massacring their species. I felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these feelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa, Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus. The patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should have been imbued with different sensations.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "It's difficult to convey how profoundly these books affected me. They filled my mind with an endless stream of fresh ideas and emotions, sometimes lifting me to moments of intense happiness, but more often plunging me into profound sadness. Goethe's *The Sorrows of Werter*, beyond its compelling and moving narrative, explored so many ideas and shed so much light on topics that had previously been unclear to me. It became a constant source of contemplation and amazement. The gentle, everyday life it depicted, combined with noble thoughts and feelings focused on others, resonated deeply with my experiences living with my guardians and with the persistent longing in my own heart. However, I viewed Werter himself as a being more divine than any I had ever encountered or imagined; his character lacked pretense but had a deep impact. The discussions about death and suicide sparked immense wonder in me. While I didn't feel qualified to judge the issues themselves, I found myself leaning towards the perspective of the protagonist, whose end I mourned without fully grasping it.\n\nAs I read, I often related the content to my own emotions and circumstances. I saw similarities between myself and the characters I was reading about, whose conversations I overheard, yet at the same time, I felt profoundly different from them. I felt empathy for them and partially understood their situations, but my mind was still undeveloped; I was beholden to no one and had no family ties. 'My path into the world was unhindered,' and there was no one who would grieve my disappearance. My appearance was monstrous, and my size enormous. What did this signify? Who was I? What kind of being was I? Where did I come from? What was my purpose? These questions plagued me constantly, but I was unable to find answers.\n\nThe volume of *Plutarch's Lives* I possessed contained the histories of the founders of ancient republics. This book had a very different impact on me compared to *The Sorrows of Werter*. Werter's stories had instilled in me feelings of hopelessness and despair, but Plutarch inspired noble thoughts; he lifted me beyond the misery of my own thoughts, allowing me to admire and cherish the heroes of the past. Much of what I read surpassed my comprehension and experience. My understanding of kingdoms, vast territories, mighty rivers, and infinite oceans was very vague. But I was completely unfamiliar with cities and large gatherings of people. My guardians' cottage had been the only place where I had observed human behavior, but this book revealed new and grander scopes of action. I read about men involved in public affairs, ruling or massacring their fellow humans. I felt a strong desire for virtue emerge within me, and a loathing for vice, based on my understanding of those terms, which I connected solely to concepts of pleasure and pain. Driven by these feelings, I naturally came to admire peaceful lawmakers like Numa, Solon, and Lycurgus, favoring them over figures like Romulus and Theseus. My protectors' simple, family-focused lives reinforced these impressions deeply in my mind; perhaps, if my first exposure to humanity had been through a young soldier consumed by the desire for glory and bloodshed, my feelings would have been quite different.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "It is difficult for me to express how deeply these books affected me. They filled my mind with countless new ideas and emotions—sometimes I felt overjoyed, but more often I was cast into deep sadness. In reading The Sorrows of Werter, I was struck not only by the moving story but also by the many perspectives it offered on subjects I had not understood before, giving me endless material to ponder. Its depiction of gentle home life and noble feelings, focused away from self-interest, matched my own experiences with those who cared for me and mirrored my innermost desires. I came to view Werter as a being more extraordinary than any I had seen or imagined; his genuine character resonated with me. The discussions in the book about death and suicide amazed me, and though I did not fully grasp their complexity, I leaned toward Werter’s views and mourned his loss, even without completely understanding why.\n\nAs I read, I related much of what I learned to my own feelings and situation. I found that I was like, yet very unlike, the people described and whose conversations I followed in books. I could partly relate to them, but I was mentally immature, independent of others, and had no relations. My future was open, and there was no one to mourn if I vanished. My appearance was dreadful, and I was enormous—what did that signify? Who was I? What was I? Where did I come from, and where was I meant to go? These questions haunted me, and I could not answer them.\n\nThe copy of Plutarch’s Lives I read told stories about the founders of ancient republics and impacted me very differently than Werter had. While Werter taught me to feel despair, Plutarch inspired me with lofty thoughts, lifting me above my misery and allowing me to admire the heroes of history. Much of what I read about kingdoms, vast lands, powerful rivers, and endless seas, I could scarcely grasp, being unfamiliar with towns and crowds of people. The simple home of my benefactors was my only education in human behavior until this book revealed larger, more dramatic scenes. I read about individuals who shaped societies, leading or even destroying their fellow men. These tales stirred in me a longing for virtue and a dislike for vice, as I understood these concepts largely through their connection to pleasure and pain. Because of this, I found myself admiring peaceful lawmakers like Numa, Solon, and Lycurgus over warriors like Romulus and Theseus. My experience living with my protectors reinforced these impressions, though I realized that if I had first learned of humanity through a young soldier seeking glory, my feelings might have turned out differently."

Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine in every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone. Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within me.\n“Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. Soon after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress which I had taken from your laboratory. At first I had neglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in which they were written, I began to study them with diligence. It was your journal of the four months that preceded my creation. You minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences. You doubtless recollect these papers. Here they are. Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own horrors and rendered mine indelible. I sickened as I read. ‘Hateful day when I received life!’ I exclaimed in agony. ‘Accursed creator! Why did you form a monster so hideous that even you turned from me in disgust? God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the very resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire and encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.’",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "However, Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" stirred different and much more profound emotions within me. Like the other books I had found, I believed it to be a factual account. The depiction of an all-powerful God battling against his own creations filled me with awe and wonder. I frequently compared the situations described to my own experiences when I saw parallels. Similar to Adam, I seemed unconnected to any other living thing; however, his circumstances were vastly different from mine in every other way. He emerged perfect, joyful, and blessed from God's hand, protected and able to learn from higher beings, while I was miserable, powerless, and isolated. I frequently saw Satan as a more suitable symbol of my plight, for often, just like him, observing the happiness of those who sheltered me ignited bitter envy within me. My feelings were further intensified and confirmed by another event. Shortly after moving into the small dwelling, I found some documents in the clothing I had taken from your workspace. Initially, I paid them no mind, but once I could understand the writing, I began to examine them closely. They contained your diary from the four months leading up to my creation. In these writings, you described your work's progress in meticulous detail, mixing this account with notes on your daily life. You surely remember these papers. I have them here. They recount everything pertaining to my dreadful beginning, laying bare the entire sequence of repulsive events that brought me into being; they also include the most precise description of my repulsive and disgusting appearance, using language that reflected your own revulsion and made my horror at myself permanent. Reading this made me feel physically ill. \"Cursed be the day I was given life!\" I cried out in anguish. \"Damned creator! Why did you fashion such a monstrous being that even you recoil from me? God, out of compassion, made man beautiful and appealing in his own likeness; but my shape is a foul imitation of yours, made even more terrifying by the similarity. Satan had fellow devils to admire and support him, but I am alone and despised.\"",

I often saw parallels between the situations in the book and my own experiences.

Adam was created perfectly by God and was happy, protected, and watched over, allowed to learn from beings superior to himself. In contrast, I was miserable, powerless, and alone. Many times I thought Satan was actually a better representation of my situation, as I, too, would feel overwhelming envy whenever I saw my protectors’ happiness.\n\nMy feelings were intensified by another discovery. Soon after coming to the hut, I found some papers in the pocket of the coat I had taken from your laboratory.

I felt ill as I read. In anguish, I lamented the day I was given life. I cried out, condemning you, my creator, for making me a monster so hideous that even you recoiled in disgust. God, out of compassion, gave man beauty and charm in His own image, but I am a filthy imitation of you, more horrible because of the resemblance. At least Satan had others like him to share his misery and encourage him, but I am alone and despised."

The servants were gone to a neighbouring fair. All was silent in and around the cottage; it was an excellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my limbs failed me and I sank to the ground.

I knew that every minute was precious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence the interview, when the old man addressed me.\n‘By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman; are you French?’\n“‘No; but I was educated by a French family and understand that language only. I am now going to claim the protection of some friends, whom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some hopes.’\n“‘Are they Germans?’\n“‘No, they are French. But let us change the subject. I am an unfortunate and deserted creature, I look around and I have no relation or friend upon earth. These amiable people to whom I go have never seen me and know little of me. I am full of fears, for if I fail there, I am an outcast in the world for ever.’\n“‘Do not despair. To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, but the hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, are full of brotherly love and charity. Rely, therefore, on your hopes; and if these friends are good and amiable, do not despair.’\n“‘They are kind—they are the most excellent creatures in the world; but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me. I have good dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree beneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they ought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable monster.’\n“‘That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot you undeceive them?’\n“‘I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I feel so many overwhelming terrors. I tenderly love these friends; I have, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily kindness towards them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, and it is that prejudice which I wish to overcome.’\n“‘Where do these friends reside?’\n“‘Near this spot.’\n“The old man paused and then continued, ‘If you will unreservedly confide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of use in undeceiving them. I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but there is something in your words which persuades me that you are sincere. I am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure to be in any way serviceable to a human creature.’\n“‘Excellent man! I thank you and accept your generous offer. You raise me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid, I shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow creatures.’\n“‘Heaven forbid! Even if you were really criminal, for that can only drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue. I also am unfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although innocent; judge, therefore, if I do not feel for your misfortunes.’\n“‘How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor? From your lips first have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall be for ever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success with those friends whom I am on the point of meeting.’\n“‘May I know the names and residence of those friends?’",

The cool outdoor air revitalized me, and with renewed resolve, I approached the door of their dwelling.I knocked. \"Who is it?\" the old man asked. \"Enter.\" I went inside. \"Forgive my intrusion,\" I said; \"I am a traveller in need of some rest; I would be very grateful if you would permit me to stay by the fire for a little while.\" \"Come in,\" replied De Lacey, \"and I will do my best to assist you with your needs; however, my children are unfortunately out, and as I am blind, I worry it may be hard for me to find food for you.\" \"Please don't trouble yourself, my kind host; I have food; I only require warmth and a place to rest.\" I sat down, and a silence followed. I knew every moment was vital to me, yet I hesitated, unsure how to begin the conversation, when the old man spoke to me.\"Judging by your speech, stranger,\" he said, \"I assume you are from my country; are you French?\" \"No,\" I replied, \"but I was raised by a French family and only understand that tongue. I am now seeking the support of some friends, whom I genuinely care for, and whose acceptance I have some hope of gaining.\" \"Are they German?\" \"No, they are French. But let us discuss something else. I am a miserable and abandoned being; I look around and have no family or companion anywhere on earth. These kind individuals I am going to have never met me and know little about me. I am filled with apprehension, for if I am rejected there, I will be forever an outcast in the world.\" \"Do not lose hope. Being without friends is indeed a misfortune, but human hearts, when not clouded by obvious self-interest, are filled with compassion and brotherly affection. Therefore, rely on your hopes; and if these friends are kind and gentle, do not despair.\" \"They are kind—they are the most wonderful people in the world; but, sadly, they hold a strong bias against me. I have good intentions; my existence has so far been harmless and somewhat helpful; but a terrible prejudice blinds their sight, and where they should see a compassionate and friendly soul, they perceive only a repulsive monster.\"\"That is truly regrettable; but if you are truly without fault, can you not convince them otherwise?\" \"I am about to attempt that very task; and that is why I feel such overwhelming dread. I deeply cherish these friends; I have, without their knowledge, performed daily acts of kindness towards them for many months; but they are convinced I intend to harm them, and that is the prejudice I aim to conquer.\" \"Where do these friends live?\" \"Close by.\" The old man paused, then continued, \"If you will share the full details of your story with me openly, perhaps I can help to change their minds. I cannot see your face because I am blind, but there is something in your voice that convinces me of your truthfulness. I am poor and an exile myself, but it would bring me genuine joy to be of service to another human being in any way.\" \"Wonderful man! I thank you and accept your generous proposal. You lift me up from despair with this kindness; and I trust that, with your help, I will not be rejected by the community and compassion of your fellow creatures.\" \"Absolutely not! Even if you were truly guilty, that would only drive you to despair, not encourage virtue. I too am unfortunate; my family and I were sentenced unjustly, though innocent; therefore, you can imagine how much I sympathize with your troubles.\" \"How can I express my gratitude to you, my greatest and only helper? From your voice, I have heard kindness directed towards me for the very first time; I will be eternally thankful; and your compassion right now reassures me of success with the friends I am about to meet.\" \"May I know the names and location of these friends?\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "One day, when the sun was shining on the red leaves scattered across the ground, creating a cheerful atmosphere despite the lack of warmth, Safie, Agatha, and Felix left for a long walk in the countryside. By his own wish, the old man remained alone in the cottage. After his children left, he picked up his guitar and played some tunes that were both sad and sweet—more so than any I had previously heard from him. At first, his face showed happiness, but as he continued, he became thoughtful and somber; finally, he put the instrument aside and sat quietly, deep in thought. My heart raced, knowing this was the critical moment that would either fulfill my hopes or confirm my fears. With the servants away at a nearby fair, the cottage and its surroundings were completely silent—an ideal chance for my plan. Yet, as I tried to carry it out, my strength failed and I collapsed. I gathered myself, picked up my courage, and removed the boards hiding my shelter. The fresh air revived me, and determined, I walked to the cottage door. I knocked. The old man asked who was there and told me to enter. I apologized for intruding, explaining that I was a traveler who needed some rest, and asked if I could sit by the fire for a few minutes. De Lacey welcomed me in, explaining that his children were away and, as he was blind, it would be hard for him to provide food. I told him not to worry as I had my own food, and only needed warmth and rest. I sat down and there was a silence. I knew my time was short but hesitated, unsure how to begin. Then the old man spoke, asking if I was French, since my language suggested so. I replied that, though not French, I had been raised by a French family and only knew their language. I added that I was seeking protection from some friends I cared for, and whom I hoped would welcome me. He asked if they were German, and I said no, they were French, but I wanted to change the subject, explaining that I was alone and had no friends or family. The people I wanted to approach had never seen me and barely knew anything about me, so I was very afraid—if I failed with them, I'd be completely alone. The old man reassured me, saying that being without friends is hard, but people are often compassionate and generous if not motivated by self-interest, so I shouldn't give up hope if my friends were good people. I said they were, but unfortunately were prejudiced against me. I assured him my intentions and past actions were good, but a powerful bias kept them from seeing me as anything but a monster. He said that was sad, but asked if I couldn't clear up their mistaken ideas. I said I planned to try, and the idea filled me with fear, because although I loved them and had been secretly doing good for them for months, they believed I meant them harm, and that misjudgment was what I wanted to overcome. He then asked where my friends lived. I answered, nearby. The old man paused and then offered to help, saying that if I trusted him with my story, he might help correct their mistaken beliefs. He said he was blind and couldn't judge by appearances, but that my words sounded honest. Though poor and an exile himself, he would gladly help another human being. I thanked him deeply, saying his kindness lifted my spirits, and I hoped with his help I wouldn't be rejected by society. He replied that heaven forbid it; even if I truly were guilty, being outcast could only lead to desperation, not make me better. He explained that he and his family had been wrongly condemned despite their innocence, so he understood misfortune. I expressed my gratitude, saying his kindness was the first I had ever received and that I would always be grateful; his generosity gave me hope that my friends would accept me. He closed by asking if he might know the names and home of these friends."

I would have gladly obliterated the cottage and the people within it, satisfying myself with their screams and suffering. At nightfall, I left my hiding place and roamed the forest. Now, unafraid of being seen, I released my torment through terrifying roars. I felt like a wild animal that had escaped its trap, tearing apart anything in my path and moving through the trees with incredible speed, like a deer. What a dreadful night it was! The indifferent stars seemed to mock me, and the bare branches of the trees swayed above me. Occasionally, the pleasant sound of a bird broke the total silence. Everything else, except for me, was either peaceful or content. I, however, carried an internal agony like that of the devil himself, and feeling utterly alone and unpitied, I longed to rip up the trees, wreak chaos and destruction everywhere, and then simply witness the devastation. But this intense emotional state couldn't last. I grew weary from my extreme physical efforts and collapsed onto the wet grass, feeling the miserable helplessness of despair.

My father's life is in extreme danger because of the terrible event I told you about. My wife and sister are permanently scarred by their fear. I beg you not to argue with me any further. Take back your property, and let me escape this place.' Felix was trembling violently as he spoke. He and his companion went into the cottage, stayed for only a few minutes, and then left. I never saw any of the De Lacey family again.",

I slipped into my shelter and waited quietly for the usual time when the family would get up. However, that time went by, the sun was high in the sky, but no one from the family appeared, leaving me fearful that something terrible had happened. The cottage was dark and still, and my anxiety grew in this uncertain silence. Soon, two local men walked past and stopped near the cottage, speaking animatedly in a language I didn’t understand. Not long after, Felix showed up with another man, which surprised me because I knew Felix hadn't left the cottage that morning. I listened intently, hoping to learn what had caused all these strange events. Felix's companion asked him if he realized that he’d have to pay three months’ rent and lose the crops from the garden, but also assured him to take some time to decide. Felix replied that it was pointless, as they could never live in the cottage again because of some terrible event he had described, and he begged not to be persuaded otherwise, asking the man to repossess the house and let him leave. Felix, clearly shaken, went into the cottage with the man briefly and then they both left. I never saw the De Lacey family again."

I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a human being. Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless; rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter. Oh, earth! How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being! The mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall and bitterness. The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow fell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not. A few incidents now and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I often wandered wide from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed me no respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived on the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth and the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.\n“I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was secured by night from the view of man. One morning, however, finding that my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey after the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring, cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of the air. I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long appeared dead, revive within me. Half surprised by the novelty of these sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy. Soft tears again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with thankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.\n“I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring. Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade of a cypress. I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running towards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from someone in sport. She continued her course along the precipitous sides of the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the rapid stream. I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour, from the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore. She was senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic, who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. On seeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms, hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood. I followed speedily, I hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun, which he carried, at my body and fired.

A few events occasionally showed me the way, and I had a map of the region; but I frequently strayed far from my intended path. The torment of my emotions gave me no peace; there was no event from which my fury and despair could not draw fuel; but one incident that occurred when I reached the borders of Switzerland, when the sun's warmth had returned and the earth began to look green again, particularly reinforced the bitterness and dread I felt.\n\n\"I generally rested during the day and traveled only when the darkness of night protected me from being seen by people. One morning, however, finding that my route led through a dense forest, I risked continuing my journey after the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring, uplifted even me with the beauty of its sunshine and the pleasantness of the air. Emotions of kindness and happiness, which had seemed dead for a long time, came back to life within me.

Tears fell from my eyes, and I gratefully looked up to the sun, which brought me such joy.\n\nI wandered along winding forest paths until I reached the edge, bordered by a swift, deep river, with budding trees leaning over it.

I followed, not really knowing why, but when he noticed me coming closer, he aimed his gun at me and shot. I collapsed, wounded, as my attacker fled quickly into the trees."

          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "So this was the result of my kindness! Although I had saved someone’s life, my reward was to suffer terribly from a wound that damaged both my flesh and bone. The kindness I had just felt was quickly replaced by intense anger and bitterness. The pain stoked my fury, and I swore to hate and seek revenge on all humans forever. Yet, the pain soon overwhelmed me, and I lost consciousness.\n\nFor several weeks, I lived miserably in the forest, trying to tend to the wound. The bullet had entered my shoulder, but I couldn’t tell if it was still inside or had passed through, and I had no way to remove it. My suffering was made worse by the heavy feeling of being treated unfairly and with ingratitude. Every day, I pledged to get revenge—a deep, deadly retribution that alone could make up for the torment and cruelty I had endured.\n\nEventually, my wound healed after some weeks and I went on my way. The difficult journey ahead couldn’t be brightened by spring’s sunlight or gentle breezes anymore; every happy thing only reminded me of how alone and miserable I was, making the thought of joy feel like a cruel joke."

I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of Jura.\n“At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection, which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came running into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of infancy. Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that this little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity. If, therefore, I could seize him and educate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in this peopled earth.\n“Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him towards me. As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his face and said, ‘Child, what is the meaning of this? I do not intend to hurt you; listen to me.’\n“He struggled violently. ‘Let me go,’ he cried; ‘monster! Ugly wretch! You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces. You are an ogre. Let me go, or I will tell my papa.’\n“‘Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.’\n“‘Hideous monster! Let me go. My papa is a syndic—he is M. Frankenstein—he will punish you. You dare not keep me.’\n“‘Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy—to him towards whom I have sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.’\n“The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a moment he lay dead at my feet.",

I was weighed down by exhaustion and hunger, and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle evening air or the sight of the sun setting behind the magnificent Jura mountains. At this moment, a brief period of sleep offered some relief from my painful thoughts, but I was soon awakened by the arrival of a lovely child who playfully ran into my chosen hiding spot. As I watched him, an idea suddenly occurred to me: this small being was innocent and had not lived long enough to develop a fear of disfigurement. Therefore, if I could capture him and raise him as my friend and companion, I would not feel so utterly alone in this inhabited world. Driven by this thought, I grabbed the boy as he passed and pulled him towards me. The moment he saw my appearance, he covered his eyes with his hands and let out a piercing shriek. I forcefully removed his hands from his face and asked, 'Child, why are you reacting this way? I don't intend to harm you; please listen to me.' He struggled fiercely, crying, 'Let me go! Monster! Horrible creature! You want to eat me and tear me apart. You are an ogre. Let me go, or I'll tell my dad.' 'Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.' 'Ugly monster! Let go of me. My father is a public official—he is M. Frankenstein—he will punish you. You wouldn't dare keep me.' 'Frankenstein!

At that moment, I fell into a brief sleep, which offered some relief from my troubled thoughts. My rest was interrupted by the arrival of a beautiful child, who ran playfully into my hiding place. As I watched, it struck me that this child was too young to have developed any prejudice against me because of my appearance; perhaps if I could take him and teach him to be my friend and companion, I would not be so lonely in this world full of people. Acting on this thought, I grabbed the boy as he passed by and pulled him toward me. Upon seeing me, he immediately covered his eyes and screamed loudly. I pulled his hand away and tried to explain that I meant him no harm, asking him to listen. He fought to escape and cried out, calling me a monster and threatening to tell his father. I told him he would never see his father again and that he had to come with me. When he shouted that his father was M.

Overcome by these emotions, I left where I had committed the murder and found a more hidden place—a barn I thought was empty. Inside, a young woman slept on some straw. She wasn’t as lovely as the woman in the portrait but was still attractive and youthful. I thought bitterly how people like her would smile kindly at everyone but me. I bent down and whispered to her, wishing she would wake and love me, desperate for her affection. When she stirred, I was struck with fear—if she awoke and saw me, surely she would scream and call me a murderer. The idea drove me wild; it was not I, but she who should suffer for my misery. Because of her, I had lost what I could never have, so she should bear the blame. Influenced by what I had learned from Felix and human law, I knew how to harm.

Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my creator, would tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I should pity man more than he pities me? You would not call it murder if you could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame, the work of your own hands. Shall I respect man when he condemns me? Let him live with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury I would bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance. But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union. Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery. I will revenge my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear, and chiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear inextinguishable hatred. Have a care; I will work at your destruction, nor finish until I desolate your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of your birth.”\nA fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently he calmed himself and proceeded—\n“I intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me, for you do not reflect that you are the cause of its excess. If any being felt emotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and a hundredfold; for that one creature’s sake I would make peace with the whole kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised. What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it is all that I can receive, and it shall content me. It is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more attached to one another. Our lives will not be happy, but they will be harmless and free from the misery I now feel. Oh! My creator, make me happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit! Let me see that I excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my request!”",

You, my creator, would gladly tear me apart and revel in my destruction; keep that in mind, and then explain why I should feel more compassion for humans than they show for me? If you could toss me into one of those icy crevasses and annihilate this body, crafted by your very hands, you wouldn't consider it murder. Why should I respect humanity when they condemn me? If they were to interact with me kindly, I wouldshower them with every imaginable kindness in return, weeping with thankfulness for their acceptance. But that is impossible; human senses create impassable barriers between us. Yet, I will not submit to abject servitude. I will avenge the wrongs done to me; if I cannot inspire affection, I will instill terror, and it is primarily towards you, my ultimate foe, my creator, that I swear an eternal hatred. Be cautious; I will diligently work towards your ruin, and I will not cease until I have utterly broken your spirit, making you curse the moment of your birth.”\nA monstrous fury consumed him as he spoke; his face twisted into expressions too terrifying for human eyes to bear; but then he regained his composure and continued—\n“I intended to speak reasonably.

My request of you is sensible and moderate; I ask for a being of the opposite sex, but one who is as grotesque as I am; this satisfaction is minor, but it is the only one I can receive, and it will be enough for me. It is true, we will be outcasts, isolated from everyone else; but because of that, we will be even more devoted to one another. Our existence will not be joyful, but it will be harmless and free from the anguish I currently endure. Oh! My creator, grant me happiness; let me feel gratitude towards you for this one favor!

Even you, my creator, would destroy me and feel victorious about it; consider this, and explain why I should feel any more compassion for humans than they do for me. If you could kill me by casting me into those ice crevices, would it even be called murder, since I am your own creation? Why should I honor humanity when I am condemned by it? If people would treat me with kindness, I would respond in kind, offering nothing but gratitude and benefits in return. But that is impossible; humans will never overcome their revulsion towards me, making true connection between us unreachable. Still, I will not submit in humiliation. Instead, I will avenge myself for my suffering; if I cannot earn love, I will instill fear, especially in you, my enemy and creator. I vow to hate you forever. Beware—I will dedicate myself to your ruin and not rest until your heart is broken and you regret your very existence.\"\n\nHis rage twisted his face into a grotesque expression, terrifying to witness, but then he calmed himself and continued—\n\n\"I wanted to be rational. This rage only hurts me, but you must remember that you have caused my overwhelming frustration. If anyone had shown me kindness, I would have returned it many times over; for a single friend, I could forgive all humanity. But those hopes are impossible. What I am asking from you is fair: I want a companion as deformed as I am. My desires are small, and this single act could satisfy me. Yes, we would both remain monsters, isolated from the world, but that would make our bond even greater. We would not find happiness, but our existence would be harmless and I would no longer be in pain. Creator, please, make me content; give me reason to feel thankful to you for at least this one gift. Let me know that I can arouse compassion from at least one being. Please, do not refuse me this request!\""

I understood I should hurry down the mountain quickly, as night would soon envelop me. However, my heart was burdened, and I moved slowly. Navigating the small mountain paths and ensuring my footing was steady as I progressed was difficult, as my mind was consumed by the powerful emotions brought on by the day's events. It was well into the night when I reached the halfway resting point and sat down beside the fountain. The stars shone intermittently as clouds drifted past them; dark pine trees loomed before me, and here and there a fallen tree lay on the ground. The scene was profoundly solemn and sparked strange thoughts within me. I cried uncontrollably, and wringing my hands in anguish, I cried out, 'Oh, stars, clouds, and winds, you are all about to mock me! If you genuinely pity me, destroy my sensation and memory; let me become nothing. But if not, leave, leave, and abandon me in darkness.' These thoughts were wild and miserable, but I cannot convey how the perpetual twinkling of the stars oppressed me, or how I listened to each gust of wind as if it were a heavy, dreadful sirocco coming to annihilate me. Dawn broke before I arrived at the village of Chamounix. I did not rest but immediately returned to Geneva. Even within my own mind, I could not express my feelings; they burdened me with a mountain's weight, and their overwhelming intensity crushed my anguish beneath them.",

Navigating the narrow mountain paths was difficult because I was preoccupied with the intense emotions the day's events had caused. It was late at night when I finally reached the halfway stop and sat down by the spring. The stars would appear now and then as the clouds shifted, tall dark pine trees stood around me, and broken trees lay scattered on the ground; the somber scene filled me with unusual thoughts. Overcome with grief, I cried and, wringing my hands in despair, cried out to the stars, clouds, and winds, begging them either to take away my pain and memories or to leave me in darkness. My thoughts were wild and miserable, but I can't truly express how the endless sparkle of the stars weighed on me, or how every gust of wind felt threatening, as if it was out to destroy me. It was morning by the time I got to Chamounix, and without resting, I went straight back to Geneva. Even within myself, I couldn't put my feelings into words—they pressed on me like a mountain, and their intensity numbed my suffering."

I feared the vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me. I found that I could not compose a female without again devoting several months to profound study and laborious disquisition. I had heard of some discoveries having been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was material to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my father’s consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to me. A change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. My father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy, which every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At these moments I took refuge in the most perfect solitude. I passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the rippling of the waves, silent and listless.

And yet you are still unhappy and still avoid our society.

Although I dreaded the retribution of the disappointed creature, I couldn't overcome my strong aversion to the task I was obligated to undertake. I realized that creating a female would necessitate months of dedicated research and arduous intellectual effort once more. I had learned about some recent discoveries by an English philosopher that were crucial for my project's success, and I occasionally considered asking my father for permission to travel to England for this purpose. However, I grasped at every excuse to postpone, hesitant to take the initial step in an endeavor whose immediate necessity seemed less pressing to me now. Indeed, a change had occurred within me; my health, which had previously worsened, was now significantly better, and my spirits, whenever not weighed down by the memory of my unfortunate promise, lifted accordingly. My father was pleased by this transformation and began contemplating the best way to eliminate the remnants of my sadness, which would occasionally resurface in episodes, casting a bleak shadow over the approaching good mood. During these periods, I sought refuge in complete solitude. I spent entire days alone on the lake in a small boat, quietly and passively observing the clouds and listening to the gentle sound of the waves. Yet, the fresh air and bright sunlight usually managed to restore a degree of calm, and upon my return, I greeted my friends with a more genuine smile and a lighter heart.\nIt was after returning from one of these solitary excursions that my father, calling me aside, spoke to me. “My dear son,” he began, “I am happy to observe that you have returned to your former interests and appear to be becoming yourself again.

Creating a female companion would require me to immerse myself once again in months of intense study and effort. I had heard that important advances had been made by an English philosopher, knowledge that could be crucial for my success, and I occasionally considered asking my father's permission to travel to England for that reason. However, I seized every possible excuse to delay and hesitated to take any definitive action, as the urgency of my promise seemed less pressing. Something had changed within me: my health, which had previously been poor, was now mostly restored, and my spirits improved whenever I wasn’t thinking about my unfortunate agreement. My father noticed this positive change and was glad. He focused on finding ways to eliminate the lingering gloom that occasionally overtook me. When those dark moments returned, I sought solitude, spending entire days alone on the lake in a small boat, watching the sky and listening to the waves in silence. Yet, the fresh air and sunshine usually helped me regain some peace of mind, and when I returned, I could greet my friends with a more sincere smile and a lighter heart.\n\nAfter one of these solitary outings, my father called me aside and said, \"I’m pleased to see you returning to your old enjoyments and seeming more like your true self, but I can tell you’re still troubled and you continue to avoid our company.

You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any wish that she might become your wife. Nay, you may have met with another whom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in honour to Elizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear to feel.”\n“My dear father, reassure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly and sincerely. I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my warmest admiration and affection. My future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of our union.”\n“The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor, gives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced.

You are younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent fortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future plans of honour and utility that you may have formed.

However, human experience is so fallible that what I thought would best facilitate my plan might have completely ruined it.

Yet, human judgement is flawed, and what I thought would achieve my goal may have actually ruined it. Perhaps you only see her as a sister, with no wish to marry her.

The latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my loathsome task in my father’s house while in habits of familiar intercourse with those I loved. I knew that a thousand fearful accidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to thrill all connected with me with horror.

How could I celebrate when the burden of this unfulfilled obligation was weighing me down? I had to finish my task and let the monster leave with his companion before I could enjoy marriage and the peace I hoped would come from it.\n\nI also remembered that it was necessary for me to either travel to England or correspond with scientists there, since their expertise was crucial to my work. Writing letters back and forth would take too long and would not suffice. More than that, the thought of conducting my repulsive work at my father's home, surrounded by loved ones, was unbearable.

If I were alone, would he not at times force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to contemplate its progress?\nTo England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return. My father’s age rendered him extremely averse to delay. For myself, there was one reward I promised myself from my detested toils—one consolation for my unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when, enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and forget the past in my union with her.\nI now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me which filled me with fear and agitation. During my absence I should leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my departure. But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go, and would he not accompany me to England? This imagination was dreadful in itself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends. I was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of this might happen. But through the whole period during which I was the slave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his machinations.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I was permitted to choose the length of my absence, anticipating it would be a few months, or at most a year. My father had thoughtfully taken one step to guarantee I would have a companion. Without informing me beforehand, he had, in agreement with Elizabeth, arranged for Clerval to meet me in Strasburg. This interfered with the solitude I desired for pursuing my task; however, at the beginning of my journey, my friend's company was not an obstacle, and I was genuinely relieved that I would avoid many hours of solitary, maddening contemplation. Indeed, Henry might even protect me from my enemy's intrusion. If I were alone, wouldn't the creature sometimes impose his detested presence on me to remind me of my task or monitor its development? Consequently, I was bound for England, and it was agreed that my marriage to Elizabeth would take place immediately upon my return. My father's age made him strongly against any delay. For myself, there was one prize I expected from my loathed work—one comfort for my unprecedented hardships: the anticipation of that day when, liberated from my miserable enslavement, I could claim Elizabeth and forget the past through our union. I then prepared for my journey, but I was haunted by a feeling that filled me with dread and anxiety. During my time away, I would leave my friends unaware of their adversary and exposed to his attacks, potentially worsened by my leaving. But he had promised to follow me everywhere; would he not come with me to England? This idea was terrifying in itself, yet also reassuring in that it suggested my friends' safety. I was tormented by the thought that the reverse might be true. Nevertheless, throughout the entire period I was under my creature's control, I allowed myself to be guided by the whims of the moment; and my current strong intuition indicated that the monster would follow me, thereby sparing my family from his wicked intentions.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The length of my time away was for me to decide; I expected to be gone for several months, or at most a year. My father, thinking ahead with kindness, made sure I wouldn’t be alone by secretly arranging, with Elizabeth’s help, for Clerval to meet me in Strasburgh. While this meant I couldn’t have the isolation I had wanted to focus on my work, I was actually glad at the start of my journey to have a friend with me. His company would save me from hours of miserable solitude, and possibly even protect me from my enemy’s unwelcome visits. If I traveled alone, might not the monster confront me, remind me of my duties, or interfere with my work? \n\nSo I was set to travel to England, and there was an agreement that I would marry Elizabeth as soon as I returned home. My father, growing older, was reluctant to postpone our union. For myself, the one hope sustaining me through my dreadful labor was the thought that, once I was finally free, I could marry Elizabeth and leave my suffering behind.\n\nAs I made preparations for my trip, one thought continued to disturb and frighten me: by leaving, I would be abandoning my loved ones, who were unaware of the creature’s existence and would be vulnerable to his anger if he felt provoked by my absence. However, he had promised to follow me wherever I went, so perhaps he would go with me to England and my friends would be safe. Though this idea frightened me, it at least suggested that my friends might be spared. I agonized at the possibility that things might turn out otherwise. Still, during my time as my creature’s unwilling servant, I was largely controlled by my immediate feelings, and right now my instincts told me the monster would trail me, and thus my family would escape his vengeance."

During this voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns. We stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from Strasburgh, arrived at Mainz. The course of the Rhine below Mainz becomes much more picturesque. The river descends rapidly and winds between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. We saw many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by black woods, high and inaccessible. This part of the Rhine, indeed, presents a singularly variegated landscape. In one spot you view rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with the dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory, flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river and populous towns occupy the scene.\nWe travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers as we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the bottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had been transported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man. “I have seen,” he said, “the most beautiful scenes of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay appearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be on the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain, where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud; but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. The mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled. Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village half hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our own country.”\nClerval! Beloved friend! Even now it delights me to record your words and to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. He was a being formed in the “very poetry of nature.” His wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only in the imagination. But even human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external nature, which others regard only with admiration, he loved with ardour:—\n——The sounding cataract\nHaunted him like a passion: the tall rock,\nThe mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,\nTheir colours and their forms, were then to him\nAn appetite; a feeling, and a love,\nThat had no need of a remoter charm,\nBy thought supplied, or any interest\nUnborrow’d from the eye.\n\n[Wordsworth’s “Tintern Abbey”.]\nAnd where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely being lost for ever? Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the life of its creator;—has this mind perished? Does it now only exist in my memory? No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and consoles your unhappy friend.\nPardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart, overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates.

During this trip, we sailed past numerous islands dotted with willows and saw several charming towns. We spent a day in Mannheim, and on the fifth day after leaving Strasburgh, we arrived at Mainz. The Rhine's course becomes significantly more scenic downstream from Mainz. The river flows swiftly and winds its way between hills that are not high but are steep and beautifully shaped. We observed many ruined castles perched on cliff edges, surrounded by dense, dark woods, appearing inaccessible. Indeed, this section of the Rhine presents a remarkably varied landscape. In one view, you see rugged hills and crumbling castles overlooking terrifying drops, with the dark Rhine rushing below; then, rounding a sudden turn of a headland, the scene changes to flourishing vineyards on gently sloping green banks, a winding river, and bustling towns. We traveled during the grape harvest season and could hear the laborers singing as we drifted along the stream. Even I, burdened by a heavy mind and constantly disturbed by grim thoughts, was pleased. I lay in the boat's bottom and, looking up at the clear blue sky, felt as though I was absorbing a peace I hadn't known for a long time. And if those were my feelings, who could possibly describe Henry's? He felt as if he had been transported to a magical realm and experienced a happiness rarely encountered by people. \"I have seen,\" he said, \"the most beautiful sights in my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the snow-covered mountains drop almost straight into the water, casting deep, dark shadows that would create a gloomy and sad appearance were it not for the extremely green islands that cheer the eye with their bright look; I have seen this lake during a tempest, when the wind whipped up whirlwinds of water and gave an idea of what a waterspout must be like on the vast ocean; and the waves fiercely crash against the base of the mountain, where the priest and his beloved were buried by an avalanche and where their dying sounds are still said to be heard in the quiet moments of the night wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud; but this region, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. The mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but the banks of this divine river possess a charm I have never seen equaled before. Look at that castle that overlooks that cliff there; and that one too, on the island, almost hidden among the leaves of those lovely trees; and now, that group of workers coming from among their grapevines; and that village half concealed in the mountain's hollow. Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits and protects this place has a soul more in tune with humanity than those that build glaciers or retreat to the unreachable peaks of our homeland's mountains.\" Clerval! My beloved friend! Even now, it brings me joy to write down your words and dwell on the praise you so richly deserve. He was a being formed in the \"very poetry of nature.\" His wild and passionate imagination was refined by the sensitivity of his heart. His soul overflowed with deep affections, and his friendship was of that devoted and wonderful kind that cynical people tell us can only be found in stories. But even human connections were not enough to satisfy his eager mind. The beauty of the external world, which others merely admire, he loved intensely: --The sounding cataract Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock, The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood, Their colours and their forms, were then to him An appetite; a feeling, and a love, That had no need of a remoter charm, By thought supplied, or any interest Unborrow’d from the eye.

As we traveled, we passed by numerous islands draped with willows and saw many charming towns along the river. We paused for a day in Mannheim, and five days after leaving Strasburgh, reached Mainz. After Mainz, the Rhine’s scenery becomes even more beautiful, as the river moves swiftly between steep yet gracefully shaped hills. Along the way, there were many ancient castles in ruins, perched atop cliffs surrounded by dense and unreachable forests. This region of the Rhine offers a particularly varied landscape: in some places, there are rough hills, castles in ruins overlooking steep drops, and the dark river below; while in other areas, the scene shifts to thriving vineyards on green sloping banks, a winding river, and busy towns. We happened to travel during the grape harvest, and as we drifted downstream, we listened to the songs of the workers. Even though I felt sorrowful and emotionally unsettled, I found enjoyment in the journey. Lying at the bottom of the boat, gazing up at the clear blue sky, I experienced a sense of peace I hadn’t felt for a long time. If even I could feel such calm, then Henry’s joy must have been even greater. He felt as if he were in a magical land, experiencing a rare happiness. He told me that although he has seen the most breathtaking sights of his homeland—lakes in Switzerland with dramatic mountains dropping straight into the water, creating dark shadows softened by bright green islands, and violent storms on the lakes—he found the Rhine even more beautiful. For Henry, while the Swiss mountains were grand and remarkable, something about the Rhine’s riverbanks was even more enchanting. He pointed out castles clinging to cliffs, those hidden on islands among trees, groups of vineyard workers, and villages tucked into mountain recesses, saying that the spirit of this place feels more in tune with humanity than the remote, harsh peaks of Switzerland. My dear friend Clerval! Even now, recalling his words and praising his character brings me joy. He was truly a person shaped by nature’s poetry, with a fervent imagination tempered by his caring heart. His emotions were strong and generous, and his friendship was so devoted that it was almost unbelievable outside of stories. Even then, human companionship was not enough for him; he loved nature with a passion and depth others rarely feel. Waterfalls, towering rocks, mountains, and dark woods inspired in him not just admiration, but hunger and love. And now, I wonder where he is—has such a beautiful soul, full of creativity and passion, truly vanished forever? Does he live on only in my memory? No, your physical form is gone, Henry, but your spirit remains to comfort your grieving friend. Please forgive this outpouring of sadness; while my words are an inadequate tribute to your unmatched worth, they soothe the pain your memory brings. Now, let me continue my story."

This part of our journey lacked the picturesque views we had enjoyed earlier, but within a few days we reached Rotterdam, where we boarded a ship to England. It was on a bright morning late in December when I first glimpsed Britain's white cliffs. As we traveled along the Thames, the scenery changed to level yet fruitful land, and almost every town we passed reminded us of some historical tale. We noticed Tilbury Fort and thought of the Spanish Armada, along with other familiar places like Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich, which I had heard of back in my homeland. Eventually, we arrived in London, the city's many church steeples visible in the distance, with St. Paul's Cathedral standing tallest and the historic Tower also prominent."

But a blight had come over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound. Company was irksome to me; when alone, I could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace. But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to my heart. I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and Justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish.\nBut in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive and anxious to gain experience and instruction. The difference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and amusement. He was also pursuing an object he had long had in view. His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had in his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of European colonization and trade. In Britain only could he further the execution of his plan. He was for ever busy, and the only check to his enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind. I tried to conceal this as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection. I often refused to accompany him, alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone.

If this trip had taken place during my earlier, happier days of study, it would have brought me immeasurable joy. However, a shadow had fallen over my life, and I only visited these people out of necessity for the information they might provide on the subject that consumed me so terribly.

I felt an insurmountable divide between myself and others, a barrier sealed by the deaths of William and Justine, and contemplating the events linked to their names filled me with anguish. Yet, in Clerval, I saw a reflection of my former self; he was curious and keen to acquire experience and knowledge. The differences in customs he observed were an endless source of learning and entertainment for him. He was also pursuing a long-held ambition. His plan was to travel to India, believing that his knowledge of its various languages and understanding of its society would be instrumental in advancing European colonization and trade. He could only further his plans in Britain. He was constantly busy and cheerful, and the only check on his happiness was my sorrowful and dejected state. I tried to hide this as much as possible to prevent him from being deprived of the simple pleasures of someone starting a new chapter in life, unburdened by worries or painful memories. I often declined to accompany him, claiming other commitments, so that I could be by myself. It was at this time that I also began assembling the materials needed for my new creation, a task that felt like the torment of water torture, with single drops constantly falling.

My main focus was obtaining the knowledge I needed to fulfill a promise, and I quickly made use of my letters of introduction to renowned natural philosophers. Had this journey happened during happier, more scholarly times in my life, I would have found it wonderfully enjoyable. However, a cloud now hung over me, and I sought outothers only for the information they might have relating to my grave interest. I found socializing burdensome; solitude allowed me to lose myself in the beauty around me, and Henry's friendly presence helped me find fleeting moments of peace. But the hustle and cheerful faces I saw only deepened my sorrow, reminding me of the permanent divide between myself and society—a rift tainted by the tragic deaths of William and Justine, thoughts of whom tormented me deeply. In Clerval, however, I saw echoes of who I used to be; his curiosity and desire for knowledge and new experiences were endless. The differences and customs he observed delighted and taught him endlessly. He also had a purpose: he wanted to travel to India, believing his linguistic skills and insights into its society could help European expansion and trade, and only in Britain could he prepare for this goal. He was constantly occupied, and only my unhappiness dimmed his enjoyment. I tried to hide my misery so I wouldn't spoil his happiness as he explored a new phase of life, free from worry or painful memories. Often I made excuses not to go with him, so I could be alone. During this time, I began gathering the materials for my new creation—an experience that became a mental torment, like the drip of water steadily driving me mad.

This was a new scene to us mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of stately deer were all novelties to us.\nFrom thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city, our minds were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted there more than a century and a half before. It was here that Charles I. had collected his forces. This city had remained faithful to him, after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of Parliament and liberty. The memory of that unfortunate king and his companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they might be supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps. If these feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration. The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters, which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and domes, embosomed among aged trees.\nI enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the past and the anticipation of the future. I was formed for peaceful happiness. During my youthful days discontent never visited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by ennui, the sight of what is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate elasticity to my spirits. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has entered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what I shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity, pitiable to others and intolerable to myself.\nWe passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves. We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the field on which that patriot fell. For a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments and the remembrancers. For an instant I dared to shake off my chains and look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my miserable self.",

For us, being from a mountainous region, this was an unfamiliar landscape; the imposing oak trees, the abundance of wildlife, and the groups of graceful deer were all novel sights. Following that, we continued on to Oxford. Upon entering the city, our thoughts were occupied with the historical events that had occurred there over 150 years prior. This was the location where Charles I had gathered his army. The city had remained loyal to him even after the rest of the country abandoned his cause to support Parliament and freedom. The memory of the ill-fated king and his associates—the pleasant Falkland, the arrogant Goring, his wife, and son—lent a special significance to every place in the city where they were thought to have resided. The atmosphere of past eras seemed to live on here, and we enjoyed tracing its presence. Even without this imaginative historical connection, the city's appearance alone was sufficiently beautiful to earn our admiration. The university buildings are old and scenic; the streets are quite impressive; and the lovely River Isis, which runs alongside the city through lush green fields, widens into a calm body of water reflecting its grand collection of towers, spires, and domes nestled among ancient trees. I found pleasure in this setting, yet my enjoyment was tinged with sadness, influenced by both the remembrance of past events and the anticipation of what was to come. I was naturally inclined towards a life of peaceful happiness. During my youth, discontent never troubled me, and if ever boredom overcame me, the beauty of nature or the study of humanity's great and inspiring creations could always capture my interest and revitalise my spirit. However, I am now like a tree struck by lightning; a destructive force has pierced my being. I felt at that moment that I would endure merely to represent what I would soon cease to be—a pathetic demonstration of a ruined human being, an object of pity for others and unbearable to myself. We spent a considerable amount of time in Oxford, exploring its surroundings and attempting to locate every spot that might relate to one of the most exciting periods in English history. Our explorations were often extended by the successive sights we encountered. We visited the burial place of the distinguished Hampden and the battleground where that patriot died. For a brief moment, my spirit was lifted from its degrading and miserable anxieties to consider the noble concepts of liberty and self-sacrifice, which these locations commemorated and represented. For an instant, I dared to attempt shedding my burdens and viewing my surroundings with a liberated and noble mindset, but the pain had become too deeply ingrained, and I quickly sank back, trembling and without hope, into my own wretched state.",

Oxford seemed steeped in history, and we enjoyed imagining where these figures might have been. Even if our imaginations hadn't been so inspired, the city itself was beautiful: the ancient, charming colleges, the impressive streets, and the serene River Isis, flowing through lush green fields, its calm waters mirroring the towers, spires, and domes nestled among old trees. I took pleasure in this scene, yet my happiness was shadowed by sorrowful memories and fears about the future. I was made for a peaceful life; in my youth, I was never troubled by dissatisfaction, and any sadness could always be lifted by nature's beauty or great human achievements. But now I felt deeply damaged, as if I were a tree struck by lightning, sensing I would live on only as a wretched remnant, pitied by others and unbearable to myself. We spent quite some time in Oxford, exploring its surroundings and seeking out locations tied to the most stirring period in English history. Our small journeys of exploration were often extended by the many fascinating sights we encountered. We visited the grave of the famous Hampden and the battlefield where he died. These places briefly lifted my spirits and reminded me of noble ideals like liberty and self-sacrifice.

The country in the neighbourhood of this village resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of distant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my native country. We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix. The latter name made me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.\nFrom Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in Cumberland and Westmorland. I could now almost fancy myself among the Swiss mountains. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me. Here also we made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness. The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors. “I could pass my life here,” said he to me; “and among these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.”\nBut he found that a traveller’s life is one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments. His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.\nWe had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them to travel on. For my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected my promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the dæmon’s disappointment. He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance on my relatives. This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiend followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion. When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment, but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of his destroyer.

Clerval's joy surpassed mine; his mind expanded greatly in the company of accomplished individuals, and he discovered more capabilities and strengths within himself than he had realized while primarily interacting with those he considered his inferiors. He remarked to me, 'I could happily spend my entire life here, and among these mountains, I would hardly feel the loss of Switzerland and the Rhine.' However, he soon learned that a traveler's life, despite its pleasures, is also fraught with difficulties. One's emotions are constantly strained, and just as one begins to find peace in a place, they are compelled to leave it for something new, which occupies their attention only to be abandoned for yet another novelty. We had barely finished visiting the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland and developed an fondness for some of the residents when the time appointed for meeting our Scottish friend drew near, prompting us to leave. Personally, I felt a sense of relief. I had delayed fulfilling my promise for a considerable time and dreaded the potential consequences of the dæmon's frustration. He might remain in Switzerland and exact revenge on my family. This terrifying thought plagued and tormented me incessantly, preventing me from finding any moment of rest or peace. I awaited my letters with intense anxiety; any delay plunged me into despair and overwhelming fear, and when they arrived, seeing the familiar handwriting of Elizabeth or my father, I was almost afraid to read them and learn my fate. At times, I suspected the fiend was following me and might expedite my delay by murdering my companion. When these ideas consumed me, I refused to leave Henry's side for an instant, following him like a shadow to shield him from the wrath I imagined his destroyer harbored. I felt as though I had committed a grave offense, and the awareness of it constantly haunted me. Although technically innocent, I truly believed I had brought a terrible, deadly curse upon myself, one as fatal as that incurred by actual crime.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "We departed from Oxford with reluctance and made our way to Matlock, which was our next stop. The landscape around this village reminded me greatly of Switzerland, though everything appeared in a more modest form—the hills were green but lacked the majestic, snow-capped Alps that adorned the pine-covered peaks of my homeland. We explored an impressive cave and small collections of natural history, the displays of which were reminiscent of those at Servox and Chamounix. Hearing Henry say the latter name unsettled me, and I was eager to leave Matlock because of the unpleasant memories now tied to it.\n\nContinuing north from Derby, we spent two months in Cumberland and Westmorland. Amidst the mountains, with their lingering snow patches, the lakes, and the swiftly flowing streams, I felt almost as if I were back in Switzerland. We also got to know some locals, whose company nearly made me forget my troubles and experience real happiness. Clerval was even more delighted; surrounded by intelligent people, he realized he had abilities and qualities he had never known while in less stimulating company. He remarked to me that he could happily stay there for life, hardly missing Switzerland or the Rhine in such beautiful surroundings.\n\nHowever, life as a traveler brought with it as much hardship as pleasure. One’s emotions are constantly stirred, and whenever one starts to feel at peace in a place, it becomes necessary to leave, seeking new experiences that are also eventually left behind for others.\n\nWe had just begun to appreciate the lakes and people of Cumberland and Westmorland when it was time to meet our friend in Scotland, so we said farewell and continued on our journey. Personally, I wasn’t unhappy to go; I had already delayed fulfilling my promise for too long and dreaded the consequences of the creature’s anger. I feared he might return to Switzerland and harm my loved ones. This fear haunted me relentlessly, robbing me of the chance for rest or peace. I waited anxiously and impatiently for letters, despairing if they were late, and when I received ones from Elizabeth or my father, I hesitated to open them, afraid of what news they might bring. Sometimes I imagined the monster was following us and might punish my procrastination by hurting Henry. When such fears took over, I stayed close to Henry at all times, determined to protect him from any possible threat. I carried the heavy burden of guilt, as if I had committed a terrible crime, though I was innocent—yet I truly felt as if I was cursed, tormented as much as any criminal."

It was a place fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were continually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when they indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from the mainland, which was about five miles distant.\nOn the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of these was vacant when I arrived. This I hired. It contained but two rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury. The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the door was off its hinges. I ordered it to be repaired, bought some furniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and squalid poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations of men.\nIn this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening, when the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet. It was a monotonous yet ever-changing scene. I thought of Switzerland; it was far different from this desolate and appalling landscape. Its hills are covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the plains. Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.\nIn this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but as I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and irksome to me. Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night in order to complete my work. It was, indeed, a filthy process in which I was engaged. During my first experiment, a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings. But now I went to it in cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.\nThus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I grew restless and nervous. Every moment I feared to meet my persecutor. Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing to raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much dreaded to behold. I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.\nIn the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably advanced.

She might become ten thousand times more malicious than her male partner and take delight, purely for pleasure, in murder and misery. He had sworn to leave human populated areas and hide himself in uninhabited regions, but she had made no such pledge. And she, who in all likelihood was to become a thinking and reasoning creature, might refuse to abide by an agreement made before she was even created. They might even come to despise each other; the creature who already existed detested his own physical deformity, and might he not feel a greater repulsion for it when it was presented before his eyes in a female shape? She too might recoil from him in disgust, turning instead to the greater beauty of man. She might leave him, and he would be alone again, infuriated by the new insult of being deserted by someone of his own kind.\nEven if they were to depart from Europe and inhabit the deserted areas of the new world, one of the first results of the emotional connections for which the dæmon longed would be offspring, and a race of devils would spread across the earth who might make the very survival of humanity a precarious and terrifying condition. Did I have the right, for my own benefit, to impose this curse upon endless generations? I had previously been swayed by the clever arguments of the being I had created; his diabolical threats had struck me senseless. But now, for the first time, the wickedness of my promise fully dawned upon me. I shuddered at the thought that future ages might curse me as their plague, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace perhaps at the cost of the entire human race's existence.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "One evening, I was sitting in my laboratory after sunset, with only the rising moon providing some light. It was too dim to work properly, so I paused to consider whether I should stop working for the night or continue pushing myself. While I sat there, I began thinking deeply about the consequences of my current actions. Three years earlier, I had been engaged in a similar task and ended up creating a monster whose cruelty had shattered my heart and filled me with lasting guilt. Now, I was about to create another being, and I knew nothing of what her personality might be; she could turn out to be far worse than the first and could take pleasure in violence and suffering. The original creature had promised to live away from humanity, but she hadn’t made any promises; as a thinking and reasoning being, she might refuse to honor any agreement made before her existence. The two might even hate each other; the original creature already detested his own appearance, and he might hate it even more when he saw it reflected in a female form. She might also be repelled by him and instead prefer humans, leaving him alone once again, made even more bitter by being abandoned by his own kind. Even if they left Europe to live in distant lands, one of the first outcomes of the bond they craved would be the birth of children, who could become a new, dangerous race threatening mankind’s safety. Did I have the right to unleash such a curse upon countless generations for my own benefit? Previously, I had been swayed by the arguments of my first creation and frightened by his threats, but now I finally realized the evil of the promise I had made. I trembled at the thought that future generations might condemn me as the source of their suffering, someone whose selfishness had endangered the entire human race just for some peace of mind."

But I had let him get away, and he had gone towards the mainland. I trembled thinking about who would be the next person to fall victim to his insatiable need for revenge. Then, I thought again of his promise: \"I will be with you on your wedding-night.\" That, I realized, was the appointed time for my destiny to be fulfilled. At that specific moment, I would die, thus both fulfilling and ending his malice. This impending death did not frighten me; however, when I considered my cherished Elizabeth, thinking of her weeping and profound sorrow when she found her lover so cruelly taken from her, tears—the first I had shed in a long time—streamed from my eyes, and I decided I would not surrender to my enemy without a difficult fight. The night ended, and the sun rose over the sea; my emotions became less turbulent, though this state was more the settling of intense rage into deep despair than true calmness. I left the house, the dreadful location of the previous night's confrontation, and walked along the beach. I saw the sea almost as an unbreachable wall separating me from other people; in fact, the desire that this isolation would become a reality crept into my mind. I wished that I could live out my days on that barren rock, enduring a weary existence, yes, but free from any sudden blow of misery.

My mind returned to his threat—\"I will be with you on your wedding-night.” That, it seemed, was the time chosen for my fate to be fulfilled. During that moment, I believed I would die and in doing so, end his hatred. Strangely, this did not fill me with fear; but when I thought of my dear Elizabeth, of her sorrow and tears after losing me so cruelly, I began to cry—my first tears in months—and I resolved not to let my enemy take me down without a fierce fight.\n\nThe night passed, and dawn rose over the sea; my emotions settled somewhat, though it was a kind of calmness born of despair rather than peace. I left the house, which now felt tainted by the horrors of the previous night, and wandered along the shore, almost feeling as if the sea was a barrier cutting me off from other people—and in some moments, even wishing it was. I thought perhaps it would be better to endure a lonely, dull life on this desolate rock, free from sudden, terrible pain.

Friends he had made in London had written asking him to come back to finalise the business deal they had started for his venture in India. He couldn't postpone leaving any longer, but since his trip to London would likely be followed, perhaps sooner than he expected, by his longer sea journey, he pleaded with me to spend as much time with him as possible.

The next morning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door of my laboratory. The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had mangled the living flesh of a human being. I paused to collect myself and then entered the chamber. With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments out of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly put them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them up, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the meantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus.\nNothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon. I had before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film had been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw clearly. The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. I had resolved in my own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different conclusion.\nBetween two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore. The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land, but I sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my fellow creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of darkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound as it sank and then sailed away from the spot.

          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "However, before leaving, I had a task that I found terrifying to contemplate: I had to gather my chemical apparatus. This meant re-entering the room where my repulsive creation took place and handling the tools that made me feel ill just looking at them. The following morning, at dawn, I gathered enough resolve to unlock my laboratory door. The scattered fragments of the creature I had abandoned lay on the floor, and it felt horrifyingly as though I had mutilated a living person. I paused to steady myself before stepping inside. With unsteady hands, I carried the instruments out. However, I realized I couldn't leave the remnants of my work to potentially alarm or arouse suspicion among the local villagers. So, I placed them in a basket with a large number of stones, planning to discard them into the sea that very night. In the meantime, I waited on the shore, occupied with cleaning and organizing my chemical equipment. There was a total transformation in my emotions since the night the being first appeared. Previously, I had viewed my promise with a heavy sense of hopelessness, as something that had to be done regardless of the outcome. But now, it was as if a veil had been lifted from my eyes, and I was seeing clearly for the first time. The idea of resuming my experiments didn't even cross my mind. Although the creature's threat weighed heavily on me, I didn't consider that I could voluntarily act to prevent it. I was firmly convinced that creating another being like the monster I had initially made would be the most despicable and monstrously selfish act possible, and I dismissed any thought that might lead to a different conclusion. Between two and three in the morning, the moon rose. I then placed my basket into a small boat and rowed out about four miles from the coast. The area was completely deserted; a few boats were heading back to land, but I moved away from them. I felt as though I was committing a terrible crime and nervously avoided any contact with other people. At one point, the moon, which had been clear, was suddenly obscured by a dense cloud. I used this moment of darkness to throw my basket into the sea. I listened as it gurgled and sank, then sailed away from the spot.

The next morning, at dawn, I managed to find enough courage to open my laboratory. On the floor lay the pieces of the half-finished creature I had destroyed, and I felt as though I had destroyed a living person. I paused to regain my composure, then went into the room. With shaking hands, I carried out my instruments, realizing I couldn't leave behind the remains of my creation to cause fear or questions among the villagers. So I placed them in a basket with many stones, planning to throw them into the ocean that night. Until then, I sat on the shore, cleaning and organizing my chemistry tools.\n\nMy feelings had changed completely since the night the monster appeared to me. Previously, I saw my promise as a grim fate I was bound to fulfill, no matter the consequences. Now, it was as if I could see clearly for the first time. I never considered resuming my work; though the monster's threat troubled me, I didn't think that my own decision could prevent it. I had made up my mind: creating another being like the original was a profoundly selfish and wicked act, and I dismissed any thoughts that might convince me otherwise.\n\nAround two or three in the morning, the moon rose. I took my basket, boarded a small boat, and rowed about four miles from shore. It was completely lonely; a few boats were heading back toward the land, but I steered away from them. I felt I was about to do something terrible, and anxiously avoided meeting anyone. At one point, the clear moon was hidden by a thick cloud, so I used that darkness to dump my basket into the sea. I listened as it sank and then left the area. Clouds covered the sky, but the air was pure, though cold because of the rising northeast wind."

I was afraid, admitting to myself a sense of terror—without a compass and hardly any knowledge of the area, even the sun was little help. I might be swept into the open Atlantic, facing starvation, or be swallowed by the vast, wild sea. I had been adrift for hours and was already tormented by thirst, the first sign of further suffering.

They seemed much surprised at my appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they spoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language. “My good friends,” said I, “will you be so kind as to tell me the name of this town and inform me where I am?”\n“You will know that soon enough,” replied a man with a hoarse voice. “Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste, but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.”\nI was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of his companions. “Why do you answer me so roughly?” I replied. “Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably.”\n“I do not know,” said the man, “what the custom of the English may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.”\nWhile this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly increase. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which annoyed and in some degree alarmed me. I inquired the way to the inn, but no one replied. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Come, sir, you must follow me to Mr. Kirwin’s to give an account of yourself.”\n“Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is not this a free country?”\n“Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate, and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night.”\nThis answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself. I was innocent; that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence and was led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy or death.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "While I was busy securing the boat and setting up the sails, a group of people gathered nearby. They seemed quite taken aback by my presence, but rather than helping me, they huddled together, whispering and gesturing in a way that ordinarily might have made me feel a bit uneasy. However, at that moment, I simply noticed they were speaking English, so I spoke to them in that language. \"My good people,\" I said, \"would you be so kind as to tell me the name of this town and where exactly I am?\" \"You'll find that out soon enough,\" a man with a rough voice replied. \"Perhaps you've arrived at a place you won't care for much, but rest assured, you won't be given a choice about where you stay.\" I was extremely taken aback by such a rude reply from a stranger, and I was also troubled by the scowling, angry faces of the others. \"Why are you answering me so harshly?\" I asked. \"Surely, it's not typical for Englishmen to treat strangers so unwelcomingly.\" \"I don't know,\" the man responded, \"what the custom of the English might be, but the custom of the Irish is to detest villains.\" As this strange conversation continued, I saw the crowd rapidly grow. Their faces showed a mix of curiosity and anger, which bothered and somewhat worried me. I asked for directions to the inn, but no one answered. I then started to move forward, and a low murmur rose from the crowd as they followed and closed in around me. Then, a man with an unpleasant look approached, tapped my shoulder, and said, \"Come along, sir, you must accompany me to Mr. Kirwin's to give an account of yourself.\" \"Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why must I explain myself? Isn't this a free country?\" \"Yes, sir, free enough for decent folk. Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate, and you are needed to account for the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night.\" This answer shocked me, but I quickly regained my composure. I was innocent; that would be simple to prove. Therefore, I followed my guide without speaking and was led to one of the town's finest houses. I felt ready to collapse from exhaustion and hunger, but being surrounded by people, I thought it wise to summon all my strength, so that no physical weakness could be mistaken for fear or a guilty conscience. Little did I anticipate the disaster that was about to strike moments later, obliterating all fear of disgrace or death in horror and despair.",

Instead of helping, they talked among themselves in a way that might have made me anxious under different circumstances. I noticed that they spoke English, so I addressed them politely, asking the name of the town and where I was. One of them, speaking in a rough voice, told me abruptly that I would find out soon enough, and that I probably wouldn’t be happy with the place—my preferences wouldn’t be considered. I was shocked by his rudeness and unsettled by the hostile expressions of the others. I questioned why they were so unfriendly, pointing out that I thought English people were usually welcoming to strangers. The man responded that he didn’t know about the English, but the Irish had no love for villains. As we continued talking, the crowd grew, many appearing both curious and angry, which made me uneasy. I asked how to get to the inn, but no one answered. When I started walking, the crowd murmured and surrounded me. A rough-looking man approached, tapped my shoulder, and told me to come with him to Mr. Kirwin’s to explain myself. I asked who Mr. Kirwin was and why I needed to account for myself, questioning if the country wasn’t free. The man replied that it was free for honest people and explained that Mr. Kirwin was the magistrate, and I needed to answer for the murder of a man found dead the previous night. This news shocked me, but I quickly regained composure, knowing I was innocent and could prove it. I quietly followed the man to one of the nicer houses in town. Though I was exhausted and hungry, I forced myself to stay strong so my weakness wouldn’t be mistaken for guilt or fear. I had no idea that, in just moments, a disaster would befall me so great it would eclipse any fear of disgrace or death with pure horror and despair."

He looked upon me, however, with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors, he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.\nAbout half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o’clock, they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in for port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about two miles below. He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle, and his companions followed him at some distance. As he was proceeding along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his length on the ground. His companions came up to assist him, and by the light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man, who was to all appearance dead. Their first supposition was that it was the corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even that the body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it to life. It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty years of age. He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.\nThe first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for support. The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew an unfavourable augury from my manner.\nThe son confirmed his father’s account, but when Daniel Nugent was called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore; and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same boat in which I had just landed.\nA woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour before she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards found.\nAnother woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body into her house; it was not cold. They put it into a bed and rubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was quite gone.\nSeveral other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed. Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body from another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know the shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of —— from the place where I had deposited the corpse.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I was quickly taken before the magistrate, who was a kind, older gentleman with a calm and gentle demeanor. However, he looked at me with a degree of sternness before turning to those who had brought me and asking who would be presenting evidence. Around six men stepped forward, and the magistrate selected one to give his statement. The man testified that the previous night, he, his son, and his brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, had been fishing. Around ten o'clock, they noticed a strong northerly wind picking up, prompting them to head back to shore. It was a very dark night because the moon hadn't risen yet. Instead of landing at the main harbor, they docked at a small inlet about two miles away, as they usually did. The witness went ahead first, carrying some fishing gear, with his companions following some distance behind. As he walked along the beach, he tripped over something and fell flat. His companions came to help him, and using their lantern's light, they discovered he had fallen onto a man's body, which appeared to be dead. Their initial thought was that it was someone who had drowned and been washed ashore, but upon checking, they found his clothes were dry and the body hadn't even turned cold yet. They immediately took the body to a nearby old woman's cottage and tried unsuccessfully to revive him. The deceased seemed to be a handsome young man, about twenty-five years old. He seemed to have been strangled, as there were no other signs of injury besides black finger marks on his neck. The initial part of this testimony didn't affect me, but when the finger marks were mentioned, the murder of my brother came to mind, and I became extremely distressed. My limbs trembled, and my vision blurred, forcing me to lean on a chair for support. The magistrate observed me closely, and naturally, he interpreted my reaction negatively. The son confirmed his father's account. However, when Daniel Nugent testified, he swore he saw a boat with a single person in it a short distance from the shore just before his companion fell. He stated that as far as he could tell by the faint starlight, it was the same boat I had just used to land. A woman testified that she lived near the beach and was waiting by her cottage door for the fishermen about an hour before the body was found. She saw a boat with just one man push off from the exact spot on the shore where the corpse was later discovered. Another woman confirmed that the fishermen had brought the body to her home, noting it was not cold. They put it in a bed and rubbed it, and Daniel went to town for a pharmacist, but the man was already gone. Several other men were questioned about my arrival. They agreed that given the strong north wind that had started during the night, it was highly likely I had been tossed about for many hours and been forced back near the same area from which I had departed. Furthermore, they observed that it seemed I had brought the body from somewhere else, and it was plausible that since I didn't appear familiar with the coastline, I might have entered the harbor unaware of how far the town of ---- was from the location where I had left the body.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I was soon brought before the magistrate, a kindly, elderly gentleman with a gentle and calm demeanor. Despite his general kindness, he regarded me with some seriousness before asking my escorts who would be giving testimony. About six men stepped forward, and the magistrate selected one to speak. This man stated that the previous night he had gone fishing with his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent. Around ten o’clock, as a strong wind from the north picked up, they decided to head back. The night was especially dark as the moon had not yet risen; instead of docking at the main harbor, they landed, as was their custom, at a creek about two miles away. The man walked ahead, carrying some fishing gear, and his companions were behind. While walking along the sandy shore, he tripped over something and fell. His companions helped him up, and by lantern light they discovered he had fallen on what appeared to be a dead man. At first, they thought it was a drowning victim washed up by the tide, but upon closer examination the body and its clothes were not wet, and the body was still warm. Quickly, they took it to a nearby old woman’s cottage and tried to revive him, but had no success. The deceased was a young, attractive man, about twenty-five, and seemed to have been strangled as the only physical mark was dark finger marks on his neck. This part of the testimony did not affect me much until the finger marks were mentioned, which reminded me of my brother’s murder, causing me great distress and making me physically weak, so I had to lean on a chair. The magistrate noticed my reaction and drew a negative impression from my behavior. The speaker’s son confirmed his father's story. When Daniel Nugent spoke, he strongly asserted that just before his companion’s fall, he had seen a boat with a single occupant not far from the shore, and, as best as he could tell from the stars’ light, it was the same boat I had arrived in. A local woman said that while waiting at her cottage for the fishermen’s return, she saw a boat, with only one man, leave the shore where the body was later found. Another woman confirmed the fishermen brought the body to her house; it was still warm. They laid the body on a bed and tried to revive him, and Daniel went to fetch a doctor, but the man could not be revived. Several more men testified about my arrival, agreeing that with the strong north wind that night, I had likely been at sea for hours and forced to land near where I had originally departed. They also speculated that maybe I had transported the body from somewhere else and, unfamiliar with the coastline, had come into the harbor, unaware of the distance to the town from where the body was placed."

The inspection, the presence of the official and observers, faded from my mind like a dream the moment I saw the lifeless shape of Henry Clerval lying in front of me. I struggled to breathe, and collapsing onto the body, I cried out, \"Have my destructive schemes robbed you of life as well, my dearest Henry? I have already ruined two lives; more victims are destined to suffer; but you, Clerval, my friend, my helper—\"\nMy body could no longer withstand the intense anguish I was experiencing, and I was carried out of the room in severe fits.",

Seeing Henry Clerval’s dead body, everything else—the investigation, and the people present—faded away like a dream.

At times, I pleaded with my attendants to help me kill the creature tormenting me, while at other times, I imagined the monster's hands around my throat, screaming in agony and terror. Luckily, only Mr. Kirwin understood my language, but my frantic movements and pained cries were enough to frighten the other witnesses.\nWhy didn't I die? Why didn't I find the oblivion and peace of death, being more wretched than any person ever was? Death claims many vibrant young people, the sole hopes of their devoted parents, and numerous young couples and newlyweds who were healthy and full of hope one day, only to be dead and decaying the next. What sort of being was I, able to withstand so many relentless blows that, like a continually turning wheel, renewed the torture?\nBut I was fated to live, and after two months, I awoke as if from a dream, finding myself in a prison. I lay on a miserable bed, surrounded by guards, turnkeys, bars, and all the wretched elements of a dungeon. I remember it was morning when I regained consciousness. Initially, I had forgotten the specifics of the events and only felt overwhelmed by a sudden, immense tragedy. However, when I looked around and saw the barred windows and the filthy state of the room I was in, everything flooded back into my memory, and I groaned in bitter anguish.",

For two months, I hovered close to death; later, I was told that my delirious outbursts were terrifying—I accused myself of murdering William, Justine, and Clerval. Sometimes, I begged those caring for me to help me destroy the creature that tormented me; at other times, I imagined the monster's hands strangling me, causing me to cry out in pain and fear. Thankfully, Mr. Kirwin was the only one who understood me since I spoke in my native language, but my actions and cries alone were enough to frighten the others.\n\nWhy didn’t I die? In my wretchedness, why didn’t I slip into oblivion and peace? Death often takes away cherished children from loving parents and young people in the prime of life, so why did I endure so much sorrow, constantly reliving my misery? What strength kept me alive through repeated suffering?\n\nStill, I was fated to survive. After two months, it was as if I woke from a long nightmare, finding myself in prison, lying on a miserable bed, surrounded by guards and the grim reality of a cell. I remember waking up in the morning with no clear memory of recent events, just a sense of an overwhelming disaster. But when I saw the barred windows and filthy surroundings, the memories came rushing back and I groaned in anguish."

She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise that class. The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. Her tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English, and the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings.\n“Are you better now, sir?” said she.\nI replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, “I believe I am; but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am still alive to feel this misery and horror.”\n“For that matter,” replied the old woman, “if you mean about the gentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you! However, that’s none of my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.”\nI turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a speech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed. The whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force of reality.\nAs the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me. The physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the second. Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the hangman who would gain his fee?\nThese were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had shown me extreme kindness. He had caused the best room in the prison to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who had provided a physician and a nurse. It is true, he seldom came to see me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and miserable ravings of a murderer. He came, therefore, sometimes to see that I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long intervals.",

She was a nurse employed for my care, the wife of one of the jail guards, and her face displayed the negative traits often associated with her profession. Her facial features were rough and hard, typical of people who witness suffering without feeling empathy. Her voice conveyed complete lack of concern; she addressed me in English, and her tone seemed familiar from my period of agony. \"Are you feeling better, sir?\" she asked. I responded in the same language, my voice weak, \"I believe so; but if everything that happened is real, if I wasn't dreaming, I regret still being alive to experience this pain and dread.\" \"As for that,\" the old woman replied, \"if you're referring to the gentleman you killed, I think it would be better for you if you were dead, because I suspect things will go badly for you! However, that's not my concern; I'm here to nurse you and help you recover; I perform my duty with a clear conscience; everyone should do the same.\" I recoiled with disgust from a woman capable of making such a heartless remark to someone who had just narrowly escaped death; but I felt weak and unable to process everything that had occurred. My entire life seemed like a dream; I sometimes questioned if it was all true, as it never felt genuinely real to me. As the images in my mind became clearer, I developed a fever; a sense of oppression surrounded me; no one was present to comfort me with loving words or a supportive touch. The doctor arrived, prescribed medicine, and the old woman prepared it for me; but the doctor showed complete indifference, and the nurse's face bore a clear expression of cruelty. Who could possibly care about the fate of a murderer except the executioner hoping for payment? These were my initial thoughts, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had treated me with remarkable kindness. He had arranged for the best cell in the prison to be prepared for me (even the best was dreadful); and he was the one who had provided the doctor and nurse. It is true, he rarely visited me, because although he genuinely wished to alleviate the suffering of all people, he preferred not to witness the torment and delirious ramblings of a murderer. Therefore, he would occasionally visit to ensure I was not neglected, but his visits were brief and infrequent.",

Her face was rough, shaped by years of witnessing hardship without compassion. Her voice showed she didn’t care at all; she spoke to me in English, and I recognized it from my earlier suffering. She asked, “Are you feeling better, sir?” I answered in a weak voice, also in English, that I thought I was, but if what I recalled was real and not a dream, I regretted still being alive to endure this pain and fear. The woman replied, “If you’re talking about the man you killed, it’d probably be better for you if you were dead, since things look bad for you. But that’s not my concern—I’m just here to nurse you and do my job; my conscience is clear. It’d be better if everyone did their duty as I do.” Disgusted by her heartless words, especially to someone barely rescued from death, I turned away; but I was too weak to think clearly about everything that had happened. My life felt like a surreal dream, and sometimes I doubted any of it was real, as it never seemed solid in my mind. As my memories became sharper, I grew feverish and felt engulfed by darkness. No one comforted me with kind words or gentle touch.

I was overcome by gloom and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time I considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered. His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to mine and addressed me in French,\n“I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to make you more comfortable?”\n“I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.”\n“I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, I hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.”\n“That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become the most miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and have been, can death be any evil to me?”\n“Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the strange chances that have lately occurred. You were thrown, by some surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality, seized immediately, and charged with murder. The first sight that was presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across your path.”\nAs Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me. I suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened to say,\n“Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on your person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some trace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune and illness. I found several letters, and, among others, one which I discovered from its commencement to be from your father. I instantly wrote to Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter. But you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any kind.”\n“This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event; tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am now to lament?”\n“Your family is perfectly well,” said Mr. Kirwin with gentleness; “and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.”",

I was consumed by despair and misery, often thinking that death would be preferable to living in a world that felt so full of suffering. I even considered confessing to the crime and accepting legal punishment, believing I deserved it more than the innocent Justine. While these thoughts occupied my mind, Mr. Kirwin entered my room. His face showed kindness and compassion. He pulled a chair close and asked in French if the place was upsetting me and if he could help me be more comfortable. I replied that nothing he mentioned mattered, as there was no comfort I could find anywhere on Earth. Mr. Kirwin acknowledged that a stranger's sympathy offered little relief for someone facing such a strange misfortune, but expressed hope that I would soon leave this dismal place, confident that evidence would easily clear me. I stated that the charge was the least of my worries, having become the most miserable person alive due to a series of bizarre events. I questioned if death could possibly be worse than the torture I had endured. Mr. Kirwin agreed that my recent experiences were incredibly unlucky and agonizing. He described how I had been unexpectedly shipwrecked on their hospitable shore, immediately arrested, accused of murder, and then confronted with the body of my friend, inexplicably killed and seemingly placed there by some evil force. As Mr. Kirwin spoke, despite my distress from recalling my suffering, I was surprised by his detailed knowledge of my situation. Noticing my astonishment, Mr. Kirwin quickly explained that upon my falling ill, all my personal papers were given to him. He examined them hoping to find a way to inform my family about my illness and misfortune. He found several letters, including one from my father which he recognized immediately. He wrote to Geneva right away, though nearly two months had passed since then. He added that I was still unwell, trembling, and not fit for any stressful news. I insisted that this uncertainty was a thousand times worse than the most terrible event, pleading with him to tell me what new death had occurred and whose loss I was now lamenting.

His face showed kindness and concern; he pulled up a chair next to me and spoke in French, asking if he could do something to help me feel more comfortable. I replied that nothing could comfort me, that there was nothing on earth that could help. He admitted that a stranger's sympathy would do little for someone as weighed down by misfortune as I was, but he hoped I would soon be released, as evidence could likely prove my innocence. I told him that was not my main worry—that because of all the terrible things that had happened to me, I was the most miserable person alive, and death no longer seemed frightening. Mr. Kirwin agreed that my situation was tragic and painful, recounting how by a strange accident I had ended up on this hospitable shore, arrested for murder, and faced with the body of my friend, killed in such a strange way. Hearing this, despite my distress, I was surprised at how much Mr. Kirwin knew about me. He explained that when I became ill, he examined the papers found on me to locate my family, discovering letters including one from my father, and had written to Geneva nearly two months ago. Noticing how unwell I was, he urged me to avoid further distress. I begged him to tell me what else had happened and whose death I should mourn next.

And poor Clerval—”\nThe name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too great to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.\n“Alas!

Nothing could have brought me greater comfort in that moment. I reached for him and anxiously asked if he, Elizabeth, and Ernest were safe. My father comforted me, assuring me that all were well, and tried to soothe my sadness by talking about those dear to me. Still, he soon realized that a prison is a joyless place. He looked around at the bleak cell and mournfully remarked that I had sought happiness on my journey, but instead, misfortune still haunted me, especially with Clerval’s death. Hearing Clerval’s name overwhelmed me, and I wept. I replied that some dreadful fate seemed to hang over me and that if I hadn’t a purpose left, I would have died with Henry.

It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now drawing to a close. Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also sink to rest.

I had already been three months in prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a relapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country town where the court was held. Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence. I was spared the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not brought before the court that decides on life and death.

Why did they keep such a wretched and despised life intact? Surely it was so I could fulfill my destiny, which is now nearing its end. Soon, very soon, death will stop these beats and release me from the enormous burden of anguish that weighs me down; and, by serving justice, I shall also find peace. At that time, death was distant, although the desire for it was always in my thoughts; and I often sat for hours still and silent, longing for some immense upheaval that might bury both me and the one who destroyed me in its ruins. The time for the assizes approached.

Perhaps it was so I could fulfill my destiny, which I sensed was soon to end. Death would soon end my suffering and the heavy anguish I endured, freeing me at last.

My father still desired to delay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a journey, for I was a shattered wreck—the shadow of a human being. My strength was gone. I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day preyed upon my wasted frame.\nStill, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience, my father thought it best to yield. We took our passage on board a vessel bound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores. It was midnight. I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to the dashing of the waves. I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should soon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream; yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly that I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest companion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I repassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing with my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for Ingolstadt. I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on to the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in which he first lived.

My father, seeing my ravaged condition—a shattered wreck, a mere shadow of a person, devoid of strength, a gaunt skeleton consumed by fever day and night—wanted to postpone our journey, fearing I couldn't endure it. Nevertheless, my desperate insistence and impatience to leave Ireland convinced my father to agree. We booked passage on a ship heading for Havre-de-Grace and set sail from the Irish coast under favorable winds. It was midnight. I lay on the deck, watching the stars and listening to the waves crash. I welcomed the darkness that hid Ireland from my view, and my heart beat with a feverish excitement thinking of my imminent return to Geneva. My past seemed like a terrifying nightmare; yet, the vessel I was on, the wind pushing me away from the abhorred shores of Ireland, and the sea surrounding me starkly reminded me that I was not dreaming, that my friend and dearest companion, Clerval, had indeed died because of me and the monster I created. I mentally revisited my entire life: the peaceful happiness with my family in Geneva, my mother's death, and my departure for Ingolstadt.

Although my father wanted to delay our departure, worried that my poor physical and mental health meant I couldn’t handle the journey—since I was weak, frail, and consumed by fever—my urgency convinced him otherwise. We left Ireland by ship bound for Havre-de-Grace, taking advantage of good weather. As we sailed away at midnight, I lay on deck gazing at the stars, listening to the waves, and feeling a strange joy as I welcomed the darkness that hid Ireland from view, eager to reach Geneva again. My recent experiences seemed like a terrible nightmare, but I could not deny reality as the ship, wind, and sea reminded me relentlessly that my dear friend Clerval was dead, a casualty of both myself and the creature I had brought to life. My mind replayed the story of my whole life: the peaceful times in Geneva, my mother’s death, my move to Ingolstadt, and the reckless passion that drove me to create the monster, even recalling the terrible night he came alive. Overwhelmed by emotion and unable to continue thinking clearly, I broke down in tears."

My father’s care and attentions were indefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill. He wished me to seek amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man. Oh, not abhorred! They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an angelic nature and celestial mechanism. But I felt that I had no right to share their intercourse. I had unchained an enemy among them whose joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans. How they would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world, did they know my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!\nMy father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by various arguments to banish my despair. Sometimes he thought that I felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.\n“Alas! My father,” said I, “how little do you know me. Human beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such a wretch as I felt pride. Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent as I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause of this—I murdered her. William, Justine, and Henry—they all died by my hands.”\nMy father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same assertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of delirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my convalescence. I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence concerning the wretch I had created. I had a persuasion that I should be supposed mad, and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue. But, besides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of his breast. I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was silent when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret. Yet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably from me. I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part relieved the burden of my mysterious woe.",

My father's efforts to care for me were tireless, yet he was unaware of the true source of my suffering and thus employed ineffective methods to treat my incurable condition. He encouraged me to seek diversion in social gatherings. The very sight of people repulsed me. No, not repulsed! They were my fellow humans, my kin, and I felt drawn even to those who were outwardly unpleasant, seeing them as creatures of almost divine or celestial design. However, I felt utterly undeserving of interacting with them. I had unleashed an adversary among them whose sole delight was to spill their blood and relish their agony. How intensely they would despise me and cast me out of the world, each and every one, if they only knew about my wicked deeds and the terrible acts that originated from me!",

I quickly realized that I was physically and mentally exhausted, and needed to rest before I could travel any further. My father was endlessly attentive and caring, but because he did not understand the true cause of my distress, his efforts to help me were misguided and ineffective against the deep pain I felt. He encouraged me to find distraction in social activities, but I could not bring myself to enjoy the company of others. In truth, I didn't despise humanity; they were my fellow human beings, and I felt a connection to even those I found most difficult. Still, I felt unworthy of their companionship, having let loose a menace upon them whose sole purpose seemed to be their suffering and destruction. If people were aware of my actions and the tragedies I had set in motion, they would surely hate me and drive me away from society forever.\n\nEventually, my father conceded to my wish for solitude and tried in many ways to dispel my sadness. He sometimes suspected I was troubled by the shame and humiliation of being accused of murder and attempted to persuade me that pride was meaningless. I replied to him, \"Oh, Father, you truly do not understand me. It would shame the nature of humanity if a person as wretched as I could feel any pride. Justine was guiltless, as was I, yet she suffered from the same accusation; she died because of it—and it was my fault. I am responsible for the deaths of William, Justine, and Henry.\"\n\nDuring my imprisonment, I had said similar things many times. My father, upon hearing my self-accusations, sometimes appeared to want an explanation, but at other times thought them to be the confused ramblings of a fevered mind. He may have believed that some delusion had gripped me during my illness, the memory of which lingered as I recovered. I refused to clarify or discuss the monster I'd brought to life. I worried that people would think me insane if I revealed the truth, and that fear alone kept me silent. More than that, I couldn’t bring myself to reveal something so horrifying that it would only terrify those I told. I suppressed my desperate need for compassion and kept my terrible secret, although at times, I could not help but let slip words like those above.

I admitted that I was responsible for the deaths of innocent people, that my own schemes had caused their end, and that I would have willingly given my own life many times over to save them—but I couldn't, because I couldn't sacrifice all of humanity. Hearing my words, my father became certain I was mentally disturbed, quickly changed the subject, and tried to steer my thoughts elsewhere. He wanted to erase all memory of what had happened in Ireland and wouldn't let me speak about my troubles. As time went by, I managed to regain my composure; though misery was still inside me, I stopped rambling about my guilt. Merely being aware of my crimes was enough for me. With great effort, I subdued the urge to confess publicly, and my behavior became more stable and controlled than it had been since my trip to the Arctic."

My poor cousin, how much you must have suffered! I expect to see you looking even more ill than when you quitted Geneva. This winter has been passed most miserably, tortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of comfort and tranquillity.\n“Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable a year ago, even perhaps augmented by time. I would not disturb you at this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a conversation that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some explanation necessary before we meet.\nExplanation! You may possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain? If you really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied. But you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet be pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the case, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin.\n“You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of your parents ever since our infancy. We were told this when young, and taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take place. We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I believe, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older. But as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each other without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our case? Tell me, dearest Victor. Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual happiness, with simple truth—Do you not love another?\n“You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at Ingolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last autumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every creature, I could not help supposing that you might regret our connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of your parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations. But this is false reasoning. I confess to you, my friend, that I love you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant friend and companion. But it is your happiness I desire as well as my own when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice. Even now I weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word honour, all hope of that love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself. I, who have so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes. Ah! Victor, be assured that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be made miserable by this supposition. Be happy, my friend; and if you obey me in this one request, remain satisfied that nothing on earth will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity.\n“Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or the next day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain. My uncle will send me news of your health, and if I see but one smile on your lips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I shall need no other happiness.\n“Elizabeth Lavenza.\n“Geneva, May 18th, 17—”",

She expressed great joy upon receiving news from my uncle that I was in Paris, noting that I was no longer far away and could expect to see me within two weeks. She conveyed deep concern for my well-being, anticipating that I would appear even sicker than when I left Geneva, and described the past winter as incredibly difficult and filled with anxious uncertainty for her. She hoped that my return would bring visible peace and a sense of calm back into my life. However, she feared that the same unhappiness that plagued me a year ago might still persist, perhaps even intensified. She mentioned that a prior conversation with her uncle made it necessary to explain something before we met, despite her reluctance to add to my current burdens. She wondered if I would be surprised by the need for an explanation, viewing my reaction as potentially confirming her suspicions or doubts. Given the distance and the possibility of me having mixed feelings, she felt it was important to finally write what she had long wanted to say but lacked the courage to begin. She reminded me that our parents had always planned our marriage since we were infants, raising us to expect it as a certainty. While acknowledging our close relationship as children and later as friends, she questioned if our bond was more like that of siblings, lacking the desire for a more intimate union. She pleaded with me for the sake of our mutual happiness to answer honestly: did I love someone else? She reflected on my travels and time at Ingolstadt, admitting that seeing me so unhappy and withdrawn the previous autumn led her to suspect I might regret our planned marriage and feel honor-bound to proceed against my true wishes. She confessed her love for me, stating that in her ideal future, I was always her constant friend and companion. However, she emphasized that her own happiness, as well as mine, depended entirely on our marriage being my genuine choice, declaring it would make her perpetually miserable otherwise. She wept at the thought that, overwhelmed by misfortunes, I might suppress the possibility of true love and happiness by adhering strictly to a sense of 'honor,' believing this was the only way for me to recover. She worried that her selfless affection might inadvertently worsen my suffering by becoming an obstacle to my deepest desires. She assured me of her sincere love and that the idea of causing me misery through this situation was unbearable. She urged me to prioritize my own happiness, promising that if I did, her own peace of mind would be undisturbed. She asked me not to be troubled by the letter or to feel pressured to respond immediately, suggesting I could wait until we met if writing caused me pain. She concluded by stating that news of my health from her uncle and seeing even a single smile on my face upon our reunion would be sufficient happiness for her.",

My poor cousin, I can only imagine your suffering! I expect you may look even worse now than when you left Geneva. This winter has been unbearably difficult, filled with anxious waiting; yet I look forward to seeing peace on your face and hope your heart has found some comfort.\n\n“Still, I worry that the same feelings that made you unhappy last year remain, or may even have grown stronger. I hesitate to trouble you now, when you are burdened by so many troubles, but a conversation I had with my uncle before he left makes it necessary for me to clear some things up before we see each other again.\n\n“You might wonder, ‘What could Elizabeth have to explain?’ If you really feel that way, then my concerns are settled. But since you are not here, you might have mixed emotions about what I wish to say; and since this might be the case, I can’t delay any longer writing what I've often wanted to tell you while you were away, but never found the courage to share.\n\n“You know well, Victor, that our families always hoped we would marry, ever since we were children. We were told this from a young age and taught to expect it to happen one day. We were affectionate childhood companions, and I think we have been dear friends as we grew older. But, just as a brother and sister might care deeply for each other without wanting to marry, could that not be true for us too? Tell me honestly, Victor. For our happiness, I beg you—do you love someone else?\n\n“You have traveled and spent several years studying at Ingolstadt; and I admit, when I last saw you—so unhappy, seeking solitude—I wondered if you might regret our engagement, feeling obligated to honor your parents’ wishes even if they go against your own feelings. But such reasoning is false. I confess, my dear friend, that I love you, and in my dreams of the future, you have always been by my side. But I want your happiness as well as mine, and I must say that I could never be happy in our marriage if it didn’t truly come from your own choice. Even now, I am saddened by the thought that, weighed down by so much misfortune, you might let a sense of duty suppress all hope for the happiness only love can bring back. With a love so genuine, I could only make you more unhappy if I were to stand in the way of your wishes. Please, Victor, know that I care too sincerely for you to be happy if I might be a cause of your pain. Be happy, my friend; and if you grant this one request, know that my peace could never be disturbed.\n\n“Don’t let this letter trouble you; don’t reply tomorrow, or the next day, or until you see me, if it would cause you distress. My uncle will inform me of your health, and if I see you smile even once when we meet, whether because of this or for any reason connected to me, that will be enough for my happiness.\n\n“Elizabeth Lavenza. Geneva, May 18th, 17—”\n"

On that night he had determined to consummate his crimes by my death. Well, be it so; a deadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he were victorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end. If he were vanquished, I should be a free man. Alas! What freedom? Such as the peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his cottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless, penniless, and alone, but free. Such would be my liberty except that in my Elizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death.\nSweet and beloved Elizabeth! I read and reread her letter, and some softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the angel’s arm bared to drive me from all hope. Yet I would die to make her happy. If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet, again, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate. My destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer should suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge. He had vowed to be with me on my wedding-night, yet he did not consider that threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately after the enunciation of his threats. I resolved, therefore, that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my father’s happiness, my adversary’s designs against my life should not retard it a single hour.",

He had chosen that night to finalize his crimes by killing me. Let it be so; a fatal confrontation would undoubtedly occur. If he triumphed, I would finally be at peace, and his power over me would end. If I defeated him, I would gain freedom. Alas! What kind of freedom? It would be like the freedom of a peasant whose family has been massacred before his eyes, whose home is burned, whose land is devastated, and who is left homeless, penniless, and alone, but technically free. My freedom would be much the same, except for Elizabeth, who represented a treasure, but this treasure was unfortunately overshadowed by the terrifying remorse and guilt that would plague me until my death.",

He had chosen that night to commit his ultimate crime by killing me. Very well, I thought; a fatal confrontation would surely occur, and if he won, I would find peace and his hold over me would end. If I defeated him, I would be free. But what sort of freedom would that be? It would be similar to that of a peasant whose family has been killed before his eyes, his home burned, his lands devastated, and who is left wandering, destitute and utterly alone—yet technically free. That would be my situation, except I still had Elizabeth, my greatest treasure, though shadowed by the guilt and regret that would haunt me forever. Dearest Elizabeth! I read her letter again and again, and my heart softened, allowing myself to dream for a moment of love and happiness; but I knew my loss was inevitable, like having already tasted the forbidden fruit and being cast out from paradise. Still, I would gladly die to ensure her happiness. If the monster carried out his threat, my death was certain; but I also wondered if going through with the marriage would only hasten my end. Maybe I would die a few months earlier, but if I delayed the marriage because of the monster's warnings, he would probably find other, possibly worse, ways to exact his revenge. His vow to be with me on my wedding-night did not mean he would refrain from violence beforehand, as he clearly demonstrated by murdering Clerval after making that original threat. I concluded, therefore, that if marrying my cousin immediately would bring happiness to her or to my father, I would not let my enemy's plans delay it by even an hour."

Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life and my endeavours for contentment. I have one secret, Elizabeth, a dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with horror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only wonder that I survive what I have endured.

But until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it. This I most earnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.”\nIn about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth’s letter we returned to Geneva. The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw a change in her also. She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks of compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as I was.\nThe tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure. Memory brought madness with it, and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessed me; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and despondent. I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless, bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.\nElizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human feelings when sunk in torpor. She wept with me and for me. When reason returned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with resignation. Ah! It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the guilty there is no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.",

I expressed my fear that little happiness remained for us on Earth, yet asserted that any potential future joy was centered entirely on her. I urged her to dispel her unnecessary worries, assuring her that I dedicated my life and my efforts towards finding contentment solely for her. I mentioned having a dreadful secret, Elizabeth, one whose revelation would fill her with horror and make her understand my misery, perhaps even wonder how I had survived what I endured. I promised to share this painful and terrifying story the day after our marriage, emphasizing that perfect trust was essential between us. But until then, I earnestly implored her not to mention or allude to it, confident she would respect my request. About a week after Elizabeth\nelizabeth\n\n\nlizabeth’s letter arrived, we returned to Geneva.

I noticed a change in her too; she was thinner and seemed to have lost much of the radiant energy that had previously charmed me. However, her tenderness and sympathetic look made her a more fitting companion for someone as broken and unhappy as I was. The peace I briefly experienced did not last. My memory brought madness with it, and dwelling on what had happened plunged me into true insanity. Sometimes I was consumed by furious rage, at other times I was utterly despondent. I would sit motionless, overwhelmed by my many sorrows, neither speaking nor looking at anyone. Only Elizabeth had the power to pull me out of these fits. Her gentle voice could soothe me when I was overcome with passion and inspire me with human feeling when I was sunk in apathy. She wept alongside me and grieved for my condition.

Please set aside your unnecessary worries; I dedicate my life and search for happiness to you alone. I carry a terrible secret, Elizabeth; when I finally share it, it will fill you with dread, and you will not be surprised by my suffering—rather, you will wonder how I have survived it.

Until that moment, I ask you sincerely not to mention or hint at it. I beg you this, and I know you will honor my request.\" \n\nAbout a week after Elizabeth replied, we went back to Geneva. She greeted me with deep affection, but tears came as she saw how thin I had become and the feverish flush on my face. I noticed she had changed, too—she was thinner and no longer had the sparkling energy that once enchanted me. Despite this, her kindness and gentle sympathy made her an even better companion for someone as broken and miserable as I was.\n\nThe peace I felt soon faded. Memories made me feel mad, and thinking of what had happened drove me to fits of wild anger or deep despair. I sat still, overwhelmed by all my miseries, avoiding everyone and everything around me.\n\nOnly Elizabeth could reach me out of these dark states. Her soft words soothed me when I was enraged and reminded me of my humanity when I felt numb. She cried both with me and for me. When clarity returned, she gently reasoned with me, encouraging resignation. Yet, it's easy for the unfortunate to surrender to fate, but for those who feel guilty, there can be no true peace. The pain of guilt ruins any comfort one might otherwise find in grief."

I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with delight. Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin.”\n“My dear Victor, do not speak thus. Heavy misfortunes have befallen us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love for those whom we have lost to those who yet live. Our circle will be small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune. And when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly deprived.”\nSuch were the lessons of my father. But to me the remembrance of the threat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as invincible, and that when he had pronounced the words “I shall be with you on your wedding-night,” I should regard the threatened fate as unavoidable. But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were balanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful countenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined, the seal to my fate.\nGreat God! If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish intention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself for ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage. But, as if possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real intentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I hastened that of a far dearer victim.",

He asked, \"Do you have feelings for someone else?\" I replied, \"Absolutely no one else. I deeply love Elizabeth and eagerly anticipate our marriage. Let's set the date then; on that day, I will dedicate myself, whether I live or die, to making my cousin happy.\" My father said, \"My dear Victor, please don't talk like that. We've faced terrible misfortunes, but let's hold on tightly to what we have left and shift the love we felt for those we lost to those who are still with us. Our immediate family may be small, but we will be closely connected by love and shared sorrow. And as time eases your grief, new and precious people will enter our lives to fill the void left by those tragically taken from us.\" These were my father's attempts to comfort me. However, the memory of the creature's threat haunted me; considering how powerful and destructive the monster had already proven to be, it's understandable that I almost saw him as unbeatable. Thus, when he declared, \"I shall be with you on your wedding-night,\" I felt the threatened outcome was unavoidable. Yet, death didn't seem so terrible if it meant sparing Elizabeth, so I calmly, even cheerfully, agreed with my father that if Elizabeth consented, the wedding would happen in ten days, believing this decision marked my own inevitable end. Almighty God! If for even a moment I had grasped the horrifying purpose of my devilish enemy, I would have preferred to permanently exile myself from my homeland and roam the earth without a friend than to consent to this dreadful marriage. But, as if wielding some dark magic, the monster had blinded me to his true plan; thinking I was arranging only my own demise, I instead hastened the death of someone far more precious.",

He asked if I was in love with someone else, but I assured him I loved Elizabeth and looked forward to our marriage, asking for a wedding date to be set, and promising to devote myself to her happiness. My father replied, urging me not to speak so gravely, and encouraged us to cherish those we still have and shift our affection from those we've lost. He believed that with time, our pain would lessen and we would find new sources of happiness. These were the lessons my father offered, but I couldn't forget the creature's threat. Considering how powerful and deadly the monster had been, it's understandable I saw him as unstoppable, and the warning that he would be with me on my wedding night felt inevitable. However, losing Elizabeth seemed a worse fate than dying myself, so I cheerfully agreed to the wedding if Elizabeth did, planning for it to take place in ten days, not realizing this decision was sealing my destiny. In hindsight, if I had guessed the real intent of my monstrous enemy, I would have exiled myself from home rather than agree to this doomed marriage. But the monster had, as if by magic, kept me from seeing his actual plan; while I believed I was risking only my own life, I was actually hastening the death of someone I loved even more."

She looked forward to our union with placid contentment, not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed, that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.\nPreparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received, and all wore a smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as I could, in my own heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness into the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the decorations of my tragedy.

It was agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa Lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake near which it stood.\nIn the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the fiend should openly attack me.

Preparations for the event were underway, congratulations were received, and everything seemed joyful. I tried my best to hide the intense anxiety within me, and I participated in my father's plans with apparent enthusiasm, even though they felt like mere decorations for my impending disaster. Thanks to my father's efforts, the Austrian government returned some of Elizabeth's inheritance, including a small estate on the shores of Lake Como. It was decided that after the wedding, we would go to Villa Lavenza to spend our first days of married life by the beautiful lake. Meanwhile, I took every precaution to protect myself in case the creature attacked me openly. I constantly carried pistols and a dagger and remained vigilant against any trickery, which brought me a greater sense of peace.

Thanks to my father's efforts, Elizabeth regained some of her inheritance from the Austrian government—a small property by Lake Como—where we planned to spend our honeymoon right after the wedding.

But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her; and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had promised to reveal to her on the following day. My father was in the meantime overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only recognised in the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.\nAfter the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my father’s, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our journey by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our voyage on the following day. The day was fair, the wind favourable; all smiled on our nuptial embarkation.\nThose were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the feeling of happiness. We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw Mont Salêve, the pleasant banks of Montalègre, and at a distance, surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.\nI took the hand of Elizabeth. “You are sorrowful, my love. Ah! If you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this one day at least permits me to enjoy.”\n“Be happy, my dear Victor,” replied Elizabeth; “there is, I hope, nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not painted in my face, my heart is contented. Something whispers to me not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I will not listen to such a sinister voice. Observe how fast we move along and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise above the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more interesting. Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom. What a divine day! How happy and serene all nature appears!”\nThus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon melancholy subjects. But her temper was fluctuating; joy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place to distraction and reverie.\nThe sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the lower hills. The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary. The spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.\nThe wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity, sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the shore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and hay. The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched the shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp me and cling to me for ever.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Elizabeth appeared content, and my calm demeanor significantly helped to settle her unease. However, on the very day meant to fulfill my hopes and fate, she was downcast, feeling a sense of impending misfortune. Perhaps she was also thinking about the terrifying secret I had promised to reveal to her the following day. Meanwhile, my father was overjoyed, and amidst the flurry of arrangements, he saw his niece's melancholy only as the shyness typical of a bride. Following the wedding ceremony at my father’s house, a large gathering convened. It was decided that Elizabeth and I would begin our trip by water, spending that night in Evian and continuing our journey the next day. The day was bright, the wind favorable; everything seemed to bless our departure for the marriage voyage. These hours were the final ones in my life when I experienced happiness. We moved swiftly. The sun was warm, but a canopy protected us from its rays as we enjoyed the beautiful scenery. At times, on one side of the lake, we observed Mont Salêve, the pleasant slopes of Montalègre, and in the distance, towering above everything, the magnificent Mont Blanc and the cluster of snowy mountains that fail to match its grandeur. At other times, we traveled along the opposite shore, seeing the mighty Jura mountain range presenting its dark face against the ambition of those who would leave their homeland, serving as an almost impassable obstacle to any invader seeking to conquer it. I took Elizabeth's hand. “You seem sad, my love. Oh, if you only knew what I have endured and what I might still face, you would try to let me savor the peace and freedom from despair that this one day, at least, allows me to enjoy.” “Be happy, my dear Victor,” Elizabeth replied. “I hope there is nothing to trouble you. And rest assured, even if lively joy isn't evident on my face, my heart is content. Something whispers to me not to rely too heavily on the future before us, but I refuse to listen to such a foreboding voice. See how quickly we are moving and how the clouds, which sometimes hide and sometimes float above Mont Blanc's summit, make this beautiful view even more captivating. Look too at the countless fish swimming in the clear water, where we can see every stone on the bottom. What a wonderful day! How happy and peaceful all of nature appears!” Thus, Elizabeth attempted to steer our thoughts away from sad subjects. But her mood shifted; joy briefly shone in her eyes, but it was constantly replaced by distraction and thoughtful quiet. The sun dropped lower in the sky. We passed the Drance river, observing its course through the deep cuts in the higher mountains and the valleys in the lower hills. Here, the Alps are closer to the lake, and we approached the mountain range that forms its eastern border like an amphitheater. The spire of Evian gleamed among the woods surrounding it and the layers of mountains looming above. The wind, which had carried us along remarkably fast until then, lessened to a gentle breeze at sunset. The soft air barely disturbed the water and created a pleasant rustling among the trees as we neared the shore, carrying the delightful scent of flowers and hay. The sun dipped below the horizon as we disembarked, and as my feet touched the land, those worries and fears that would soon seize and hold me forever began to resurface.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Elizabeth appeared content, and my calm behavior helped soothe her worries. However, on the day meant to realize my deepest hopes and mark my future, Elizabeth became gloomy, overcome by a feeling that something bad would happen, perhaps also reminded of the terrible secret I had promised to share with her the next day. Meanwhile, my father was ecstatic; in the flurry of preparations, he believed his niece's sadness was just normal bridal anxiety. After the wedding, many guests gathered at my father's home, but it was decided that Elizabeth and I would start our trip by boat, spending the night at Evian and continuing our journey the next day. The weather was beautiful and the wind favorable, making our wedding departure seem blessed by good fortune. These were the final moments in my life where I truly felt happiness. We traveled swiftly, shielded from the hot sun by a canopy, and took in the stunning scenery: on one side of the lake, Mont Salêve and the attractive Montalègre banks, with the majestic Mont Blanc towering above all—even the other snowy mountains seemed unable to match its beauty. On the opposite shore, the imposing Jura mountain range stood as a dark barrier, resisting any who might wish to conquer it. I took Elizabeth's hand and remarked on her sadness, telling her that if she knew the suffering I had experienced and might still endure, she would let me enjoy this rare moment of peace at least for a day. Elizabeth tried to reassure me, saying she hoped nothing troubled me, and although her face did not show joy, her heart was content. Still, she confided that something warned her not to place too much trust in our hopeful future, but she tried to ignore such negative thoughts. She pointed out how swiftly we moved along and how the clouds around Mont Blanc made the landscape even more striking, as well as the countless fish swimming in the clear water beneath which every pebble was visible. She marveled at how beautiful and tranquil everything seemed that day. Elizabeth did her best to keep both our minds from sadness, but her mood remained unsettled, shifting quickly from brief happiness to distraction and contemplation. As the sun set, we drifted past the river Drance, watching as it wound through the mountains and valleys. The Alps drew closer to the lake as we neared the semicircle of mountains marking its eastern edge. Evian's church spire shone amidst the surrounding woods and tiered mountains. At sunset, the strong wind that had carried us faded to a gentle breeze that stirred the water and trees, bringing with it the sweet fragrance of flowers and hay from the shore. When the sun disappeared below the horizon and I set foot on land, my old anxieties and fears returned, ready to take hold of me forever."

His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their delight—his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with all that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. Cursed, cursed be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste in wretchedness! He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to rise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.\nWhat then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes, indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a dungeon. Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my prison. For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.",

My narrative has been one of terror upon terror; I have reached the absolute peak of suffering, and anything else I must now recount will likely feel tedious to you. Please understand that, one by one, my companions were taken from me, leaving me utterly alone. My own strength is gone, and I must summarize, in just a few words, what remains of my dreadful tale.\nI reached Geneva to find my father and Ernest still living, but my father could not bear the news I brought and quickly declined. I can still picture him, that wonderful and respected old man! His eyes were vacant, having lost their liveliness and joy, as they mourned his Elizabeth, who was more than a daughter, whom he cherished with the deep affection of a man late in life who, having few attachments, clings even more fiercely to those he has left. May the monster who brought suffering upon his elderly years and condemned him to waste away in misery be cursed! He could not survive the horrors that had piled up around him; the very springs of his life suddenly failed. He became unable to get out of bed and died in my arms within days.\nWhat became of me then? I do not know; I lost all sensation, and only chains and darkness seemed real to me. Occasionally, I would dream I was strolling through pleasant meadows and lovely valleys with my friends from youth, only to awaken and find myself in a prison cell. Melancholy followed, but gradually I began to understand my suffering and my circumstances, and then I was released from my confinement. This was because I had been deemed insane, and as I later learned, a solitary cell had been my home for many months.",

Just know that, one after another, my friends were taken from me, leaving me alone. My own strength was gone, and I must summarize the rest of my dreadful tale. When I reached Geneva, my father and Ernest were still alive, but my father could not bear the awful news I brought. I remember him now, a good and respected old man—his eyes empty, having lost what made them bright: his beloved Elizabeth, who was more than a daughter to him. He cherished her dearly, especially in old age, when fewer loved ones remain. Curse the monster who brought him such pain, forcing him to suffer in misery until he died! He couldn't survive the horrors surrounding him; his life faded quickly, and he died just days later, as I held him. What happened to me next? I can't say; I lost all feeling, aware only of darkness and restraint. At times I dreamt I was in peaceful fields with my childhood friends, but would always wake up in a prison. Deep sadness followed, but gradually I understood my grief and my situation, and was eventually released. I was told I had been considered insane, and for many months I lived alone in a cell."

It is indeed a tale so strange that I should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth which, however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.” My manner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life. I now related my history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.\nThe magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted on his countenance.\nWhen I had concluded my narration, I said, “This is the being whom I accuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your whole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions on this occasion.”\nThis address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own auditor. He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity returned. He, however, answered mildly, “I would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where no man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered or what region he may now inhabit.”\n“I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois and destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts; you do not credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert.”\nAs I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated. “You are mistaken,” said he. “I will exert myself, and if it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you have yourself described to be his properties, that this will prove impracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should make up your mind to disappointment.”\n“That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. My revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. My rage is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned loose upon society, still exists. You refuse my just demand; I have but one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to his destruction.”\nI trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy in my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of devotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of madness. He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.\n“Man,” I cried, “how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom! Cease; you know not what it is you say.”\nI broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on some other mode of action.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "My hatred quickly moved beyond fruitless desires; I started thinking about how best to capture him. About a month after being freed, I went to a criminal magistrate in town to report a crime. I told him I knew who had ruined my family and demanded he use his full authority to arrest the killer. The official listened politely and attentively. He assured me that he would make every possible effort to find the perpetrator. I thanked him and asked him to hear my testimony. I explained that my story was so extraordinary that I would worry he wouldn't believe it, were it not for the compelling power of truth, which can make even incredible things believable. The account was too coherent to be mistaken for a dream, and I had no reason to lie. My demeanor as I spoke was impactful yet composed. I had resolved internally to hunt my destroyer to the very end, and this determination eased my anguish, offering a temporary peace with life. I then recounted my history succinctly but steadily and precisely, detailing the timeline accurately without resorting to angry attacks or emotional outbursts. Initially, the magistrate seemed completely disbelieving. However, as I continued, he grew more attentive and engaged. I saw him occasionally recoil in horror, and at other times, a clear surprise, free from skepticism, showed on his face. After finishing my narrative, I stated, \"This is the creature I am accusing, and I implore you to use all your power to seize and punish him. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I trust and hope that your human feelings will not prevent you from fulfilling these responsibilities now.\" This request significantly altered the judge's expression. He had listened to my account with a sort of hesitant belief, like one might give to stories of ghosts or the supernatural. But when faced with the need to take official action, his complete disbelief returned. Nevertheless, he responded gently, saying he would gladly assist me in my pursuit. However, he added that the being I described seemed to possess capabilities that would defy any efforts he could make. He questioned who could possibly follow a creature that could travel across the frozen sea and live in caves and dens where no human would dare venture. Furthermore, he pointed out that several months had passed since the crimes, and no one could guess where the creature had gone or where it might now reside. I insisted that I was sure the creature remained close to where I lived, and if it had indeed sought refuge in the Alps, it could be hunted like a mountain goat and killed like a predator. But I could see what he was thinking: he didn't believe my story and had no intention of pursuing my enemy for the punishment he deserved. As I spoke, my eyes blazed with fury; the magistrate looked intimidated. He countered, \"You are mistaken. I will do my utmost, and if I can possibly capture the monster, rest assured he will be punished according to his crimes. But based on the characteristics you yourself described, I fear this will prove impossible. Therefore, while every appropriate step will be taken, you should prepare yourself for disappointment.\" \"That cannot happen,\" I retorted, \"but anything I say will probably make little difference. My need for revenge is insignificant to you. Yet, while I admit it is a flaw, I confess it is the consuming and only passion in my soul. My fury is indescribable when I consider that the murderer, whom I unleashed upon the world, is still alive. You are denying my rightful request. I have only one course left, and I dedicate myself, whether living or dead, to his destruction.\" I trembled uncontrollably as I declared this. There was a wild intensity in my manner, and undoubtedly something of the proud fierceness attributed to ancient martyrs. However, to a Genevan magistrate whose mind was focused on matters quite different from religious devotion or heroism, this elevated passion seemed very much like insanity. He attempted to calm me as a nurse might soothe a child and referred to my story as merely the product of delusion. \"Man,\" I exclaimed, \"how ignorant you are in your arrogance of knowledge! Stop; you do not understand what you are saying.\" I left the house, feeling angry and agitated, and withdrew to contemplate a different course of action.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "My resentment soon turned into action as I considered how best to apprehend him. About a month after being set free, I approached a local criminal judge and told him I had a serious accusation: I knew who had destroyed my family and needed his full authority to bring the murderer to justice. The magistrate listened carefully and kindly, assuring me he would spare no effort to find the culprit. I thanked him and explained that while my story sounded unbelievable, it was entirely true and consistent, so much so that truth itself compelled belief. I recounted my tale calmly and accurately, without any sensationalism, precisely recounting events and dates. At first, the magistrate was skeptical, but as I continued, he became increasingly attentive and sometimes horrified or surprised by what I described. When I finished, I insisted he use all his power to apprehend and punish the being I accused, appealing both to his duty and his humanity.\n\nThis declaration visibly changed the magistrate’s expression. Though he had half-believed my story as one might a ghost tale, being asked to act officially restored his disbelief. Still, he responded politely, saying he would help if possible, but doubted success—after all, the creature I described seemed able to survive where no man could and had long since vanished. I insisted the creature must be nearby and could be hunted like wild game, but sensed the magistrate didn’t believe me or intend to help. My anger became evident, intimidating the judge, who nevertheless promised he would try, but warned me that the creature’s abilities would likely make capture impossible, so I should prepare for disappointment. \n\nRefusing to accept this, I declared that vengeance was my sole focus, even if I acknowledged it was wrong, and I would dedicate myself entirely—living or dead—to destroying the monster. My agitation was intense, and I spoke with a passion that made the magistrate think me mad; he tried to calm me and dismissed my account as delirium. I rebuked him for his ignorance and pride, then left in anger to consider what else I might do."

I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone endowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise delirium or death would have been my portion.\nMy first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when I was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became hateful. I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother, and departed.\nAnd now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life. I have traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet. How I have lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon the sandy plain and prayed for death. But revenge kept me alive; I dared not die and leave my adversary in being.\nWhen I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled, and I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain what path I should pursue. As night approached I found myself at the entrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father reposed. I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their graves. Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested observer. The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to cast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the mourner.\nThe deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to rage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived, and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on the grass and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, “By the sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the dæmon who caused this misery, until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict. For this purpose I will preserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun and tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my eyes for ever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering ministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work. Let the cursed and hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now torments me.”\nI had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, but the furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance.\nI was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish laugh. It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed it, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter. Surely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I was reserved for vengeance. The laughter died away, when a well-known and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an audible whisper, “I am satisfied, miserable wretch! You have determined to live, and I am satisfied.”\nI darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil eluded my grasp. Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than mortal speed.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "At this time, I was completely consumed by rage, unable to think of anything else. Only revenge gave me the strength and control I needed, shaping my emotions and allowing me to remain clear-headed and focused when I otherwise would have descended into madness or perished. My immediate decision was to leave Geneva permanently. My homeland, which I cherished when I was happy and loved, now felt repulsive to me in my misfortune. I gathered some money and a few pieces of my mother's jewelry before leaving. My journey of wandering then began, a journey that will only end with my death. I have traveled across a large part of the world, suffering all the difficulties typically faced by those traveling through harsh and uncivilized lands. I barely understand how I survived, often lying on the ground with my exhausted body, wishing for death. But revenge kept me alive; I couldn't bear to die while my enemy still lived. Upon leaving Geneva, my first priority was to find a way to track my monstrous foe. However, my plans were unclear, and I spent hours wandering near the town's edge, unsure of which direction to take. As darkness fell, I found myself at the entrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father were buried. I went in and approached their tomb. The only sound was the gentle rustling of leaves in the wind; the night was almost completely dark, and the scene was solemn and moving, even to a stranger. It felt as though the spirits of the dead hovered nearby, casting an invisible but palpable shadow around me. The profound sorrow this sight initially brought on quickly turned into fury and hopelessness. They were gone, while I remained alive; their killer also lived, and to end him, I had to prolong my miserable life. I knelt on the grass, kissed the ground, and declared with trembling lips, \"By the holy earth I kneel upon, by the spirits around me, by my deep and unending sorrow, I swear; and by you, Night, and the spirits who govern you, I vow to hunt the creature who caused this suffering until one of us dies in a deadly struggle. For this quest, I will stay alive; to achieve this vital revenge, I will continue to see the sun and walk the earth's green surface, which otherwise I would never look upon again. And I summon you, spirits of the deceased, and you, agents of vengeance, to help guide my mission. Let the accursed and evil beast suffer intense pain; let him experience the same despair that tortures me now.\" I started my solemn vow with a sense of awe, almost certain that the ghosts of my dead friends heard and supported my dedication, but by the end, utter rage overwhelmed me, making it hard to speak. The quiet night was broken by a loud, evil laugh. It echoed in my ears for a long time, bounced off the mountains, and made me feel as though the entire underworld was mocking and laughing at me. At that moment, I surely should have lost my mind and ended my wretched life, except that my vow had been heard, and I was destined for vengeance. The laughter faded, replaced by a familiar and hated voice, seemingly right beside my ear, whispering distinctly, \"I am pleased, wretched creature! You have decided to live, and that pleases me.\" I lunged towards the source of the sound, but the creature escaped me. Suddenly, the large moon appeared, its light fully revealing his horrifying and deformed shape as he fled with superhuman speed.",

Consumed by anger, only my desire for revenge gave me strength and allowed me to remain composed, making me capable of planning calmly at times when I might otherwise have broken down or died. My first decision was to leave Geneva forever; the homeland I once cherished now filled me with loathing in my misery. With some money and a few of my mother's jewels, I left. My restless travels then began—journeys that would only end with my death. I crossed great distances and endured the hardships that befall those who travel through wild and desolate lands. I survived somehow, though often I lay exhausted, hoping for death, but revenge kept me going; I could not let myself die while my enemy lived. When I left Geneva, my first objective was to find any sign or clue that could lead me to my monstrous adversary. Lacking a firm plan, I spent hours wandering around the town, uncertain where to go. As night fell, I arrived at the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father lay. Entering, I approached their shared grave. The night was almost dark, everything silent except for leaves rustling in the wind. The scene was so solemn it would have moved even someone without connection. I felt as if the spirits of the dead hovered near, casting an intangible shadow over my grieving form. My initial deep sadness quickly turned to rage and hopelessness. My loved ones were dead, I still lived, and so did their killer. To destroy him, I would have to go on living. I knelt on the grass, kissed the earth, and swore aloud, calling on the departed spirits and the night itself to witness my vow: I would not rest until either the creature or I was destroyed, persisting in life only to achieve my revenge. I asked the spirits for strength in my mission, wishing pain and torment upon the monster that had ruined me. Though I began my oath solemnly, hoping my lost loved ones heard my words, my fury overtook me at the end, making me unable to speak properly. Suddenly, in the quiet of the night, a loud, evil laugh pierced the air, echoing from the mountains. It felt as if every fiend from hell mocked me. I nearly lost my mind and ended my own life, but my vow held me back, keeping me alive for revenge. When the laughter faded, I heard, close to my ear, the hated voice of the monster himself, whispering that he was satisfied I had chosen to live. I rushed toward the source of the voice, but he escaped. As the moon rose, its light revealed his hideous figure as he fled faster than any human."

          "text_segment": "I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task. Guided by a slight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly. The blue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea. I took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.\nAmidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I have ever followed in his track. Sometimes the peasants, scared by this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself, who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die, left some mark to guide me. The snows descended on my head, and I saw the print of his huge step on the white plain. To you first entering on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand what I have felt and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue were the least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good followed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes, when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me. The fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had invoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the few drops that revived me, and vanish.\nI followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the dæmon generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the country chiefly collected. In other places human beings were seldom seen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my path. I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers by distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed, which, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for cooking.\nMy life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during sleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often, when most miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of happiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of this respite, I should have sunk under my hardships. During the day I was sustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth’s voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should come and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends. What agonising fondness did I feel for them! How did I cling to their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and persuade myself that they still lived! At such moments vengeance, that burned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the destruction of the dæmon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the mechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the ardent desire of my soul.\nWhat his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, he left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided me and instigated my fury. “My reign is not yet over”—these words were legible in one of these inscriptions—“you live, and my power is complete. Follow me; I seek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of cold and frost, to which I am impassive. You will find near this place, if you follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed. Come on, my enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable hours must you endure until that period shall arrive.”\nScoffing devil! Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee, miserable fiend, to torture and death. Never will I give up my search until he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my Elizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I pursued him, and this chase has occupied me for many months. Following a faint indication, I traced the bends of the Rhone River, but without success. The blue waters of the Mediterranean came into view, and by a strange coincidence, I observed the monster secretly board a ship heading for the Black Sea during the night. I also secured passage on the same vessel, yet he escaped in a way I cannot explain. Throughout the remote regions of Tartary and Russia, despite his constant evasion, I have always remained on his trail. Occasionally, terrified peasants who had seen this horrifying figure informed me of his path; sometimes, the creature himself, seemingly concerned that if I completely lost track of him I would lose hope and die, left markers to guide me. Snow accumulated on my head, and I saw the imprint of his massive footfall on the white landscape. To you, just beginning life, for whom hardship is unfamiliar and suffering unknown, how can you possibly comprehend what I have gone through and continue to experience? Cold, deprivation, and exhaustion were the least of the miseries I was fated to undergo; I felt cursed, as if carrying my own eternal hell with me; yet, paradoxically, a benevolent force guided my steps, and when I was most despairing, it would suddenly free me from seemingly impossible predicaments. There were moments when my body, overwhelmed by hunger, collapsed from weariness, and suddenly a meal would be prepared for me in the wilderness that revitalized and encouraged me. The food was indeed simple, the kind eaten by local peasants, but I am convinced it was placed there by the spiritual beings I had implored for assistance. Often, when everything was dry, the sky cloudless, and I was suffering from intense thirst, a small cloud would briefly darken the sky, release the few drops that revived me, and then disappear. I followed river courses whenever I could, but the creature generally avoided these areas because this is where most of the population resided. In other places, people were rarely seen, and I primarily survived on the wild animals that crossed my path. I carried money and earned the goodwill of villagers by sharing it; or, I brought food I had hunted, and after keeping a small portion for myself, I always gave the rest to those who provided me with fire and cooking tools. My life, unfolding in this manner, was truly detestable to me, and only during sleep could I find any happiness. Oh, precious sleep! Often, when I was at my lowest point of misery, I would fall into slumber, and my dreams would soothe me, sometimes even to a state of ecstasy. The spirits that watched over me provided these moments, or rather hours, of happiness so that I would retain the strength necessary to complete my quest. Without this relief, I would have succumbed to my hardships. During the day, I was sustained and inspired by the anticipation of night, because in sleep I saw my friends, my wife, and my beloved homeland; I saw again the kind face of my father, heard the gentle tones of my Elizabeth's voice, and witnessed Clerval enjoying health and youth. Frequently, when worn out by a grueling journey, I would convince myself that my current state was merely a dream until night arrived, and then I would experience true reality in the embrace of my dearest companions. What agonizing affection I felt for them! How desperately I clung to their beloved images, which sometimes even appeared during my waking hours, persuading myself that they were still alive! At such times, the desire for vengeance, which burned inside me, faded in my heart, and I continued my journey toward the creature's destruction more as a duty ordained by heaven, like the automatic drive of some power I wasn't aware of, rather than the intense longing of my own spirit. I cannot know what feelings were held by the one I pursued. Sometimes, however, he did leave messages written on tree bark or carved into stone that both directed me and provoked my rage. \"My reign is not yet over,\" these words were clearly visible in one such inscription, \"you live, and my authority is complete. Follow me; I am heading for the perpetual ice of the north, where you will experience the misery of cold and frost, to which I am immune. You will find a dead hare near this location, if you do not delay too long; eat and be refreshed. Come on, my adversary; we must still struggle for our lives, but you have many difficult and wretched hours to endure until that time arrives.\" Mocking monster! Again I swear revenge; again I consign you, wretched demon, to torment and death. I will never abandon my search until either he or I perishes; and then, with what joy shall I be reunited with my Elizabeth and my departed friends, who are even now preparing the reward for my exhausting effort and terrible pilgrimage!",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I have relentlessly pursued him for months, following faint leads along the winding course of the Rhone in vain. Eventually, I reached the Mediterranean and, by chance, witnessed the creature board a ship to the Black Sea under cover of night. I managed to secure passage on the same vessel, but he somehow escaped me. Across the remote regions of Tartary and Russia, he eluded capture, yet I continued following his trail. Sometimes frightened villagers reported his movements, and at other times he deliberately left signs for me, perhaps fearing I would despair if I lost track of him. I trudged through snowfall and saw his enormous footprints on the white terrain. For someone young and untouched by suffering, it is hard to understand the torment I endured—hunger, cold, and exhaustion being the least of my trials. I felt as if cursed, carrying a personal hell with me; and yet occasionally, helpful forces would unexpectedly deliver me from dire situations. When near collapse from hunger, I would find simple provisions, likely left by peasant hands or perhaps by supernatural aid. Thirst was sometimes relieved by a sudden, brief rainfall when no water seemed near. Though I tried to keep to rivers, the creature avoided them since people congregated there, so I survived on wild game and sometimes befriended villagers with gifts of money or meat, sharing what I could in exchange for hospitality. My existence became miserable, with sleep offering my only reprieve and happiness—dreams of home and loved ones gave me strength for my journey. The memory of my family and friends haunted even my waking hours, reducing my drive for vengeance to a duty rather than a passion. The creature sometimes left taunting messages carved on trees or stones, fueling my anger—one inscription told me he was heading for the northern ice, where he would be immune to the cold that I would suffer. Still, I swore over and over that I would not rest until I had destroyed him or died trying, anticipating reunion with my lost loved ones as my reward for this torment."

          "text_segment": "As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and the cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support. The peasants were shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to seek for prey. The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be procured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.\nThe triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. One inscription that he left was in these words: “Prepare! Your toils only begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon enter upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting hatred.”\nMy courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven to support me, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts, until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon. Oh! How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the south! Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness. The Greeks wept for joy when they beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils. I did not weep, but I knelt down and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in safety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary’s gibe, to meet and grapple with him.\nSome weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus traversed the snows with inconceivable speed. I know not whether the fiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had daily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that when I first saw the ocean he was but one day’s journey in advance, and I hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach. With new courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the seashore. I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the fiend and gained accurate information. A gigantic monster, they said, had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols, putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of his terrific appearance. He had carried off their store of winter food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the ice or frozen by the eternal frosts.\nOn hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair. He had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few of the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a genial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive. Yet at the idea that the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance returned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling. After a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered round and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey.\nI exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of the Frozen Ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I departed from land.\nI cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution burning within my heart could have enabled me to support. Immense and rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction. But again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.\nBy the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that I had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction of hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of despondency and grief from my eyes. Despair had indeed almost secured her prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery. Once, after the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue, died, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain. I strained my sight to discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known form within. Oh! With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart! Warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might not intercept the view I had of the dæmon; but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that oppressed me, I wept aloud.\nBut this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their dead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an hour’s rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly irksome to me, I continued my route. The sledge was still visible, nor did I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags. I indeed perceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days’ journey, I beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within me.\nBut now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were suddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had ever done before. A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous and terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind arose; the sea roared; and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound. The work was soon finished; in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a hideous death.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "As I pressed further north, the snow grew heavier and the cold became almost unbearably intense. Villagers stayed indoors, and only the toughest dared venture out to catch the animals desperate for food due to starvation. The rivers were frozen solid, preventing fishing, which cut off my primary food source. My adversary seemed to gain power as my efforts became harder. One message he left read: “Be ready! Your struggle has just begun; bundle up in warm clothes and get food, for we are about to travel somewhere your suffering will satisfy my endless hatred.” These mocking words fueled my courage and resolve. I vowed not to fail and, asking for divine assistance, I pushed forward tirelessly across vast empty lands until the ocean appeared on the distant horizon, marking the edge of the visible world. How different it was from the vibrant blue seas of warmer regions! Covered in ice, its wildness and ruggedness were the only things distinguishing it from land. The ancient Greeks cried with happiness seeing the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, welcoming the end of their hardships. I did not weep, but I knelt down, and with deep gratitude, I thanked the force guiding me safely to the place where, despite my opponent’s taunt, I hoped to finally confront him. Several weeks earlier, I had acquired a sledge and dogs, which allowed me to travel over the snow incredibly fast. I wasn’t sure if the creature had the same advantage, but I noticed that, unlike before when I lost ground daily, I was now catching up to him. By the time I first saw the ocean, he was only about a day ahead, and I hoped to cut him off before he reached the shore. Driven by new courage, I continued my pursuit and arrived two days later at a poor settlement by the sea. I questioned the residents about the creature and got clear information. They described a giant monster who had arrived the previous night, armed with a gun and several pistols, frightening the people of a nearby cottage with his terrifying appearance. He had taken their winter provisions, loaded them onto a sledge, and using a large group of trained dogs he had commandeered, he harnessed them. That same night, much to the relief of the terrified villagers, he had continued his journey over the sea in a direction leading nowhere, making them suspect he would soon be killed by the ice breaking up or frozen by the perpetual cold. Hearing this news, I fell into temporary despair. He had escaped, and I faced a destructive, nearly endless journey across the massive frozen sea, through cold that few could long survive and which I, from a warm, sunny climate, had little hope of enduring. Yet, the thought of the creature living and being victorious brought back my fury and desire for revenge, sweeping away all other emotions like a powerful tide. After a brief rest, during which I felt the presence of the dead urging me towards effort and retribution, I prepared for my journey. I traded my land-sledge for one suited for the uneven surface of the frozen ocean and bought a large supply of food before leaving land. I cannot tell how many days have passed since then, but I have suffered hardship that only the unending feeling of a just vengeance burning within me could have allowed me to bear. Huge, jagged mountains of ice often blocked my path, and I frequently heard the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened to destroy me. But then the cold returned, making the paths across the sea safe again. Based on the amount of food I’ve eaten, I estimate I’ve been traveling for three weeks; and the constant postponement of hope, returning to my heart, often brought bitter tears of hopelessness and sorrow to my eyes. Indeed, despair had almost claimed me, and I was close to succumbing to this misery. Once, after the exhausted animals pulling me had with incredible effort reached the top of a sloping ice hill, and one died from fatigue, I looked out at the landscape before me in agony, when suddenly my eye caught sight of a dark spot on the grey plain. I strained my vision to make out what it was and let out a wild cry of joy when I recognized a sledge with the oddly shaped figure of someone I knew inside. Oh! How a powerful surge of hope rushed back into my heart! Warm tears filled my eyes, which I quickly wiped away so they wouldn't block my view of the monster; but my vision was still blurred by the hot drops until, giving in to the overwhelming emotions, I wept openly. But there was no time for delay; I removed the dead animal from the dogs, gave them a good meal, and after an hour’s rest, which was absolutely necessary but felt incredibly tedious to me, I continued my journey. The sledge was still visible, and I didn't lose sight of it again except briefly when an ice formation temporarily hid it behind its jagged peaks. I was clearly gaining on him, and when, after almost two days of travel, I saw my enemy no more than a mile away, my heart leaped within me. But now, just as I seemed almost close enough to catch my foe, my hopes were suddenly crushed, and I lost track of him more completely than ever before. I heard the ground sea; the booming sound of its movement, as the water rolled and swelled beneath me, became more menacing and terrifying with each moment. I pushed forward, but it was useless. The wind picked up; the sea roared; and, with a tremendous and destructive force like a massive earthquake, the ice split and cracked with an overwhelming sound. It was over quickly; within minutes, a chaotic sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left drifting on a broken piece of ice that was steadily shrinking, thus setting me up for a horrible death.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As I continued my journey north, the snow became heavier and the cold more intense, nearly unbearable. The local peasants stayed inside their huts, only the bravest went out to hunt animals forced from hiding by hunger. The rivers were frozen over and there were no fish, cutting me off from a main source of food. My enemy seemed to grow stronger as my journey became harder. He left behind a message warning me that my struggles were only starting, and telling me to prepare for even greater ordeals. His taunting made me even more determined; I prayed for strength and pressed on through vast wildernesses until I reached the distant ocean, ice-covered and wild, so different from the warm southern seas. Unlike the Greeks, who rejoiced to see the Mediterranean after their trials, I could not weep, but I did give thanks for reaching this place where I hoped to finally confront my enemy. Some weeks earlier, I had gotten a sledge and dogs, which allowed me to travel quickly over the snow. I wasn’t sure if my foe had the same advantage, but as I got closer to the ocean, I found I was catching up to him—he was only a day ahead of me. Filled with new hope, I hurried on, reaching a poor village on the coast where I learned he had passed the previous night, scaring the locals and stealing their winter food, then heading out across the frozen sea with a team of dogs. The villagers believed he would soon perish on the ice. Hearing this, I felt a surge of despair, knowing I now had to cross the dangerous frozen ocean, but the thought of my enemy’s escape and victory reignited my anger and desire for revenge. After resting and resupplying with provisions and a sledge suited for the rough ice, I set off onto the sea. I lost track of time, suffering terrible hardships that only my sense of just vengeance could help me endure. Huge, jagged ice mountains blocked my path and the thunder of the sea threatened to destroy me, but the returning frost made it possible to continue. I guessed that about three weeks had passed by how much food I’d eaten, and the continual disappointment weighed heavily on my spirit. I nearly gave in to despair, especially after losing one of my sled dogs to exhaustion, but then I spotted a distant sledge and the recognizable figure of my adversary. Overcome with hope, I wept, then tended to my dogs and continued the chase. I kept the enemy’s sledge in sight, and after two days, I came within a mile of him—my heart leapt at the thought of finally catching up. Suddenly, disaster struck: a great roar signaled an upheaval in the ice as the sea broke through, separating me from my foe. In moments, a wild, tumultuous sea lay between us, and I found myself stranded on a shrinking floe, facing a grim and lonely death."

            "However, Walton's ship was heading north. He was taken aboard, utterly exhausted, on the brink of a death he still feared because his task remained unfinished.",
            "He questions when his guiding spirit will lead him to the demon and allow him rest, or if he must die with the fiend still alive.",
            "He implores Walton to swear that if he dies, Walton will seek out the fiend and avenge him through its death.",

            "He urges Walton not to listen to it, but to invoke the names of William, Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, his father, and himself (Victor), and then kill the creature, promising to guide the sword.",
            "Walton then takes over the narration in a letter to his sister, Margaret.",
            "He describes Victor's story as strange and terrific, causing his own blood to curdle with horror.",
            "He notes Victor's struggle to narrate, sometimes overcome by agony, his voice broken yet piercing, his eyes alternating between indignation and sorrow.",
            "At times, Victor related horrible events calmly, then would erupt like a volcano into expressions of wild rage and imprecations against his persecutor.",
            "Walton finds Victor's tale coherent and seemingly truthful, but the letters of Felix and Safie and the monster's appearance from the ship provided stronger conviction than Victor's assertions.",
            "He acknowledges the monster's real existence with surprise and admiration.",
            "Walton tried to learn the details of the creature's formation, but Victor remained impenetrable on this subject.",
            "Victor questioned Walton's sanity and warned him against such senseless curiosity, lest he too create a demonic enemy, urging him to learn from Victor's miseries.",
            "Victor discovered Walton was taking notes and asked to see them, correcting and augmenting them, especially to add life to his dialogues with the enemy, wishing for an accurate account for posterity.",
            "A week passed as Walton listened to this extraordinary tale, his thoughts consumed by interest in his guest, whose story and refined manners captivated him.",
            "Walton wishes to comfort Victor but doubts if he can counsel someone so utterly miserable and devoid of hope to live, believing Victor's only joy will be in death.",
            "Victor finds comfort in the belief that his dream conversations with friends are real visitations, which lends a solemnity to his reveries that Walton finds compelling.",
            "Their conversations also cover general literature, where Victor shows immense knowledge and sharp apprehension, his eloquence often moving Walton to tears.",
            "Walton marvels at what a glorious person Victor must have been in prosperity, given his nobility in ruin, noting Victor seems aware of his own worth and the magnitude of his fall.",
            "Victor reflects on his youth, when he felt destined for great achievements, possessing profound feelings and sound judgment.",
            "This self-belief supported him, as he deemed it wrong to waste talents that could benefit humanity.",

I had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded at the sight. I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and by these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in the direction of your ship. I had determined, if you were going southwards, still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my purpose. I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue my enemy. But your direction was northwards. You took me on board when my vigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied hardships into a death which I still dread, for my task is unfulfilled.\nOh! When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the dæmon, allow me the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live? If I do, swear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him and satisfy my vengeance in his death. And do I dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone? No; I am not so selfish. Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, if the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he shall not live—swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes. He is eloquent and persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; but trust him not. His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery and fiend-like malice. Hear him not; call on the names of William, Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and thrust your sword into his heart. I will hover near and direct the steel aright.\nWalton, in continuation.\nAugust 26th, 17—.\nYou have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not feel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles mine? Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his tale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with difficulty the words so replete with anguish. His fine and lovely eyes were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow and quenched in infinite wretchedness. Sometimes he commanded his countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.\nHis tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth, yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me, and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations, however earnest and connected. Such a monster has, then, really existence! I cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his creature’s formation, but on this point he was impenetrable.\n“Are you mad, my friend?” said he. “Or whither does your senseless curiosity lead you? Would you also create for yourself and the world a demoniacal enemy? Peace, peace! Learn my miseries and do not seek to increase your own.”\nFrankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he asked to see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places, but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held with his enemy. “Since you have preserved my narration,” said he, “I would not that a mutilated one should go down to posterity.”\nThus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest tale that ever imagination formed. My thoughts and every feeling of my soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale and his own elevated and gentle manners have created. I wish to soothe him, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of every hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! The only joy that he can now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and death. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and delirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his fancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a remote world. This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.\nOur conversations are not always confined to his own history and misfortunes. On every point of general literature he displays unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension. His eloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love, without tears. What a glorious creature must he have been in the days of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin! He seems to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.\n“When younger,” said he, “I believed myself destined for some great enterprise. My feelings are profound, but I possessed a coolness of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This sentiment of the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed, for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that might be useful to my fellow creatures. When I reflected on the work I had completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. But this thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopes are as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am chained in an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of analysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannot recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete. I trod heaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea of their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty ambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! My friend, if you had known me as I once was, you would not recognise me in this state of degradation. Despondency rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell, never, never again to rise.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Many dreadful hours passed in this state; several of my dogs perished, and I was on the verge of succumbing to my accumulated suffering when I saw your ship at anchor, offering a beacon of hope for rescue and survival. I had no idea vessels ever ventured so far north and was astonished. I quickly dismantled part of my sled to make oars, and with immense effort, managed to propel my ice floe towards your ship. My resolve was firm: if you were heading south, I would still risk the sea's dangers rather than abandon my goal. My hope was to persuade you to give me a boat to continue my pursuit of my enemy. However, your course was northwards. You brought me aboard when I was completely drained, saving me from a death that I still dread because my mission remains unfinished.\nOh, when will the force guiding me towards the monster finally grant me the rest I crave so deeply? Or must I die while he still lives? If I do, Walton, promise me he won't escape; swear you will find him and satisfy my need for vengeance through his death. And dare I ask you to undertake my quest, to endure the hardships I have faced? No, I am not that selfish. Yet, after I am gone, if he appears, if fate leads him to you, swear that he shall not live—swear he will not triumph over my immense sorrows and survive to commit more terrible deeds. He is articulate and convincing, and his words once even held sway over my heart; but do not trust him. His spirit is as evil as his appearance, filled with betrayal and devilish spite. Do not listen to him; invoke the names of William, Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and the unfortunate Victor, and plunge your sword into his heart. I will be close by, guiding your blade accurately.\nWalton's continuation.\nAugust 26th, 17—.\nYou have read this strange and horrifying story, Margaret; does it not make your blood run cold with terror, just as it does mine even now? Sometimes, overcome by sudden anguish, he could not continue his narrative; at other times, his voice, broken yet sharp, painfully articulated the words filled with such suffering. His beautiful eyes would flicker, sometimes illuminated by rage, sometimes softened by despair and extinguished in deep misery. Occasionally, he would regain control of his expression and tone, recounting the most terrible events calmly, showing no sign of distress; then, like an erupting volcano, his face would suddenly twist into an expression of furious rage as he shrieked curses at his tormentor.\nHis story is coherent and presented with apparent sincerity, yet I confess that the letters from Felix and Safie he showed me, and witnessing the monster from our ship, convinced me of his narrative's truth more strongly than his own earnest and consistent statements. Such a creature truly exists, then! I cannot doubt it, yet I am filled with surprise and awe. I sometimes tried to get Frankenstein to share the specific details of his creature's creation, but he was completely unwilling to discuss it.\n“Are you insane, my friend?” he asked. “Or where is your pointless curiosity leading you? Would you also create a monstrous enemy for yourself and the world? Enough! Learn from my suffering and do not seek to increase your own.”\nFrankenstein discovered I was taking notes on his history; he asked to see them and personally corrected and added to them in many places, particularly in making the conversations with his enemy more vivid and lively. “Since you are preserving my account,” he said, “I would not want a flawed version to be passed down to future generations.”\nA week has passed in this manner, while I have listened to the most extraordinary tale imaginable. My mind and every fiber of my being have been consumed by the interest in my guest, an interest generated by this story and his own refined and noble demeanor. I wish I could console him, yet how can I advise someone so utterly miserable, so devoid of any hope of comfort, to live? Oh, no! The only peace he can find now will be when he calms his troubled spirit for death. Yet, he does find one solace, a product of his solitude and delirium; he believes that when he converses with his friends in dreams and gains comfort or inspiration for revenge from these interactions, they are not merely products of his imagination but the actual spirits visiting him from a distant realm. This conviction lends a solemnity to his daydreams that makes them almost as compelling and significant to me as reality.\nOur discussions are not solely about his history and misfortunes. On all matters of general knowledge, he demonstrates immense learning and a sharp, insightful understanding. His speaking is forceful and moving; and I cannot hear him recount a touching event or try to evoke feelings of pity or affection without shedding tears. What a magnificent person he must have been during his successful years, seeing how noble and almost godlike he is even in his ruined state! He seems aware of his own worth and the magnitude of his downfall.\n“When I was younger,” he said, “I believed I was destined for some great undertaking. My emotions are deep, but I possessed a clear-headed judgment that equipped me for notable achievements. This awareness of my inherent value sustained me when others would have been overwhelmed, as I considered it wrong to waste on pointless sorrow the abilities that could benefit my fellow humans. When I reflected on the work I had completed, nothing less than the creation of a sentient and rational being, I could not consider myself among ordinary inventors. But this idea, which supported me at the start of my endeavor, now only serves to cast me deeper into despair. All my theories and aspirations amount to nothing, and like the archangel who aimed for supreme power, I am imprisoned in an everlasting hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my analytical and practical abilities were intense; through the combination of these traits, I conceived the idea and accomplished the creation of a man. Even now, thinking back on my thoughts while the work was unfinished stirs deep emotion. In my mind, I walked among the heavens, at times rejoicing in my capabilities, at times burning with anticipation of their results. From my childhood, I was filled with great hopes and lofty ambition; but how far I have fallen! Oh, my friend, if you had known me as I once was, you would not recognize me in this state of degradation. Despair seldom touched my heart; a great destiny seemed to carry me forward, until I fell, never, ever to rise again.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Many terrible hours passed like this; several of my dogs died, and I was close to succumbing to all my hardships when I spotted your ship anchored and offering me hope for rescue and survival. I never imagined ships ventured so far north and was shocked to see it. I quickly broke up part of my sled to make paddles, and with great effort, I managed to move my ice raft towards your vessel. I resolved that, even if you were sailing south, I would still rely on the sea’s mercy rather than give up my goal. I meant to persuade you to give me a boat to continue my pursuit of my enemy. But you were actually headed north. You brought me aboard when I was completely spent, and I would soon have died from my many afflictions—a fate I still fear, as my mission is not finished.\n\nOh! When will my guiding spirit, in leading me to the monster, grant me the rest I desire? Or must I die while he lives? If so, Walton, swear to me that he will not escape—that you will pursue him and carry out my vengeance on him. And do I dare ask you to take up my quest, to endure the same sufferings I have? No, I am not so selfish. Yet, should I die and he appears, if fate brings him to you, swear that he will not survive—swear he won’t triumph over my misery and live to commit more crimes. He is charming and persuasive; once, he even moved my own heart, but don’t be deceived. His soul is as evil as his appearance, full of deceit and malignant intent. Don’t listen to him; remember William, Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and Victor—strike him down. I will be with you, guiding your hand.\n\nWalton’s Narrative Continues – August 26th, 17–.\nYou have read this incredible and horrifying account, Margaret; doesn’t it fill you with horror as much as it chills my blood to recall it? Sometimes, in fits of agony, he was unable to continue his story; at other times, his voice—though broken and strained with anguish—was strong and piercing. His lovely eyes alternated between flashes of anger and moments of deep sorrow, overwhelmed by misery. At times, he controlled his expression and tone, recounting horrific events calmly while hiding any agitation. Then, like an erupting volcano, his face would contort in furious rage, and he would curse his tormentor.\n\nHis story is coherent and delivered with sincere simplicity, yet I admit that the letters from Felix and Safie he shared with me, and the monster’s appearance from our ship, convinced me of its truth more than Frankenstein’s own fervent claims. Such a creature truly exists! I can’t doubt it, but I am astounded. Sometimes, I tried to ask Frankenstein about how he made the creature, but on this topic, he would never yield.\n\n“Are you insane?” he said. “Or where does your reckless curiosity lead? Would you also create another enemy for yourself and the world? Please, learn from my misery and don’t add to your own.”\n\nFrankenstein learned that I was recording his account; he asked to read my notes and then corrected and expanded them, especially by improving the dialogues with his enemy. “Since you’ve preserved my story,” he said, “I don’t want it to be passed down incorrectly.”\n\nThus, a week has gone by while I listened to this most incredible narrative. Every thought and feeling has been absorbed by my concern for my guest—his story and his refined, gentle demeanor. I want to comfort him, but can I really advise someone so terribly unhappy, so devoid of hope, to continue living? I don’t think so. His only comfort will be when he can find peace in death. Yet, he does have one solace, borne from solitude and fevered dreams: he believes that in his dreams he actually speaks with his loved ones, gaining comfort or even inspiration for revenge, as if they’re truly visiting him from another world. This belief gives his dreams a gravity that almost makes them seem real to me.\n\nOur conversations aren’t always about his own life and suffering. On every literary topic, he shows vast knowledge and quick insight. His speeches are powerful and moving; whenever he recounts something sad, or tries to stir pity or love, I am moved to tears. What a remarkable man he must have been in happier times—so noble even in ruin! He seems aware of his value and the depth of his fall.\n\n“When I was younger,” he told me, “I believed I was meant for some great achievement. I felt things deeply but could judge calmly, which I thought suited me for great things. This feeling of my own worth kept me going when others would have given up, because I thought it wrong to waste talents that could serve others. And when I finished my work—the creation of a living, rational being—I couldn’t consider myself just another ordinary inventor. But what once inspired me now only drags me down. All my plans and hopes are worthless, and like the angel who tried to become all-powerful, I am bound in eternal torment. My imagination was always strong, and my powers of reasoning and persistence just as great; with these I conceived and executed my creation. Even now, thinking back to those dreams when my work was unfinished fills me with strong emotion. I felt like I was walking in heaven, exhilarating in what I could do, wanting to see the results. Since childhood, I’ve always had high hopes and ambition, but now I am utterly fallen. Oh, my friend, if you had known the man I once was, you would never recognize me in my current state. Despair rarely touched me then; I felt destined for greatness until I fell—never to rise again.”"

Behold, on these desert seas I have found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only to know his value and lose him. I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.\n“I thank you, Walton,” he said, “for your kind intentions towards so miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone? Can any man be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth? Even where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence, the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our minds which hardly any later friend can obtain. They know our infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified, are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. A sister or a brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early, suspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend, however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be contemplated with suspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not only through habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of Clerval will be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead, and but one feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If I were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive utility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it. But such is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I gave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die.”\nMy beloved Sister,\nSeptember 2d.\nI write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever doomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit it. I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and threaten every moment to crush my vessel. The brave fellows whom I have persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but I have none to bestow. There is something terribly appalling in our situation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me. Yet it is terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered through me. If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.\nAnd what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You will not hear of my destruction, and you will anxiously await my return. Years will pass, and you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope. Oh! My beloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is, in prospect, more terrible to me than my own death. But you have a husband and lovely children; you may be happy.

Even when deep feelings aren't stirred by outstanding qualities, childhood friends always hold a unique sway over our minds that few later companions can achieve. They know our earliest nature, which, though it may change, is never entirely gone; and they can assess our actions with greater certainty about our motives' honesty. A sister or brother can scarcely ever suspect fraud or deceit in the other, unless early signs were present, whereas another friend, no matter how devoted, might, despite themselves, be viewed with suspicion. But I had friends who were precious not just through familiarity and connection, but for their own virtues; and wherever I am, the comforting voice of my Elizabeth and Clerval’s conversation will always echo in my mind.

Our situation is terrifyingly dreadful, yet my courage and optimism haven't abandoned me. Still, it's awful to consider that the lives of all these men are jeopardized because of me. If we perish, my reckless plans are the cause.\n\nAnd how, Margaret, will you cope? You won't hear of my demise, and you will anxiously await my return. Years will pass, bringing moments of despair, yet you will also be tormented by hope. Oh!

He does his best to give me hope and acts as if he truly cherishes life. He points out that other explorers have faced similar hardships, and despite myself, he reassures me. Even the crew feels the impact of his inspiring words; when he speaks, their discouragement disappears, and their resolve is strengthened—they believe these massive icebergs are minor obstacles that can be overcome through human will. But these uplifting moments are brief; each day that hope is postponed, fear grows, and I begin to worry that their despair may lead them to revolt."

          "text_segment": "September 5th.\nA scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although it is highly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot forbear recording it.\nWe are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger of being crushed in their conflict. The cold is excessive, and many of my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of desolation. Frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire still glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenly roused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent lifelessness.\nI mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny. This morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend—his eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly—I was roused by half a dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin. They entered, and their leader addressed me. He told me that he and his companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation to me to make me a requisition which, in justice, I could not refuse. We were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they feared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and a free passage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage and lead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted this. They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn promise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my course southwards.\nThis speech troubled me. I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived the idea of returning if set free. Yet could I, in justice, or even in possibility, refuse this demand? I hesitated before I answered, when Frankenstein, who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly to have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled, and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. Turning towards the men, he said,\n“What do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you, then, so easily turned from your design? Did you not call this a glorious expedition? “And wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way was smooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and terror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth and your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and these you were to brave and overcome. For this was it a glorious, for this was it an honourable undertaking. You were hereafter to be hailed as the benefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind. And now, behold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first mighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and peril; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm firesides. Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove yourselves cowards. Oh! Be men, or be more than men. Be steady to your purposes and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it shall not. Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace marked on your brows. Return as heroes who have fought and conquered and who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.”\nHe spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed in his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can you wonder that these men were moved? They looked at one another and were unable to reply. I spoke; I told them to retire and consider of what had been said, that I would not lead them farther north if they strenuously desired the contrary, but that I hoped that, with reflection, their courage would return.\nThey retired and I turned towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor and almost deprived of life.\nHow all this will terminate, I know not, but I had rather die than return shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled. Yet I fear such will be my fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never willingly continue to endure their present hardships.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "September 5th. A remarkable event has just occurred, which I feel compelled to document, even though it's unlikely these letters will ever reach you. We remain trapped by vast sheets of ice, constantly facing the risk of being crushed. The cold is extreme, and many of my unfortunate crewmates have already perished in this bleak environment. Frankenstein's health has been deteriorating daily; a feverish intensity is still visible in his eyes, but he is utterly depleted, and any sudden demand for effort causes him to quickly relapse into a state resembling lifelessness. In my previous letter, I mentioned my concerns about a potential mutiny. This morning, while observing my friend's pale face – his eyes partially closed and his limbs slack – I was startled by six sailors who insisted on entering the cabin. They came in, and their spokesman addressed me. He explained that they and their companions had selected him and the others as representatives to present a request that, they felt, I had a duty to accept. We were confined by ice, and escape seemed improbable, but they worried that if the ice were to clear, opening a path, I might recklessly push on, leading them into further peril after they had hopefully survived this ordeal. Therefore, they demanded a solemn promise from me: that if the ship became free, I would immediately steer our course southwards. This demand unsettled me. I had not given up hope, nor had I considered turning back if we were freed. Yet, could I rightfully, or even practically, refuse their request? I paused before responding, when Frankenstein, who had initially been quiet and seemed too weak to pay attention, suddenly roused himself. His eyes brightened, and his cheeks flushed with a brief surge of energy. Turning to the men, he spoke, \"What is the meaning of this? What are you asking of your captain? Are you so easily swayed from your objective? Did you not yourselves call this a noble enterprise? And why was it considered noble? Not because the journey was smooth and calm like a southern sea, but precisely because it was fraught with danger and terror, because every new challenge required your resilience and courage to be demonstrated, because danger and death were ever-present, and you were meant to confront and conquer them. That is why this was a glorious, an honourable undertaking. You were destined to be celebrated as benefactors of humanity, your names revered as brave individuals who risked death for honour and the good of mankind. And now, look, at the first hint of danger, or rather, the first significant and fearsome test of your bravery, you recoil and are content to be remembered as men who lacked the strength to endure cold and hardship; 'and so, poor souls, they felt a chill and went back to their warm homes.' Why, that requires no such preparation; you didn't need to come this far and shame your captain with a retreat merely to prove yourselves cowards. Oh! Be men, or strive to be more than men. Be steadfast in your aims and unyielding like a rock. This ice is not as tough as your resolve should be; it is changeable and cannot defeat you if you are determined it shall not. Do not return to your families bearing the mark of dishonour on your faces. Return as victors who have fought and triumphed and who do not know what it means to flee from an enemy.\" He delivered this speech with a voice perfectly matched to the emotions he expressed, his eyes radiating lofty ambition and heroism. Is it any wonder that these men were deeply affected? They exchanged glances, unable to speak. I intervened; I told them to withdraw and reflect on what had been said, assuring them that I would not take them further north against their strong wishes, but expressing hope that, upon reflection, their courage would return. They left, and I turned back to my friend, but he had sunken back into weakness and was barely conscious. I don't know how this situation will resolve, but I would rather die than return in disgrace, my mission incomplete. Yet, I fear this may be my destiny; without the motivation of glory and honour, the men will likely never willingly continue to face these current difficulties.",

Our ship remains trapped by towering icebergs, with the constant threat of destruction. The extreme cold has already claimed the lives of several of my unfortunate crew in this desolate wasteland. Frankenstein’s health continues to deteriorate daily; a feverish intensity lingers in his gaze, but he is spent, collapsing into a deathly stillness whenever he is suddenly called to action, unable to sustain any effort for long.\n\nIn my previous letter, I expressed concerns about a possible mutiny. This morning, while I was watching my friend—his face pale, eyes half-closed, limbs limp—a group of six sailors approached and asked to enter my quarters. Once inside, their spokesman explained they had been chosen by the rest of the crew to deliver a request. Since we were trapped in the ice, our chances of escape seemed slim, but if the ice cleared and we had an opportunity to move, they feared I would recklessly continue the journey northward into further danger, instead of heading back to safety. Therefore, they wanted my solemn promise that if we became free, I would immediately steer the ship south.\n\nThe request unsettled me. I had not lost hope, nor considered turning back if we escaped, but could I, fairly or reasonably, refuse them? I hesitated, unsure how to answer. At that moment, Frankenstein, initially too weak to react, suddenly collected himself. His eyes brightened, and a flush of energy appeared on his face. Facing the men, he questioned their resolve, asking why they sought to hold their captain back. Hadn't they called this expedition noble? Was it not the dangers and hardships that made it glorious—to show courage in the face of terror and death, to risk all for the advancement of humanity? He urged them not to retreat at the first sign of peril, not to let fear tarnish their names as quitters who left because of discomfort, shaming themselves and the captain. Instead, he called upon them to be steadfast, to persevere and overcome the ice and obstacles in their path so they might return as conquering heroes, not as shamed men.\n\nFrankenstein’s passionate and impassioned speech moved the sailors, leaving them silent. I then told them to go and reflect on his words, assuring them I would not force them to continue north if they strongly objected, but expressing my hope that their bravery would return after due consideration.\n\nAfter they left, I turned to Frankenstein, but he had relapsed into weakness, nearly lifeless.\n\nAs for what lies ahead, I am unsure, but I would rather die than return home with my mission unaccomplished and in disgrace. Yet I fear the men, no longer driven by ideals of honour and glory, will not have the will to endure much longer."

'Sadly, yes; I cannot withstand their demands. I cannot lead them unwillingly into danger, and I must go back.' 'Do so, if you wish; but I will not.

I have spent my final days reflecting on my actions, and I do not find them blameworthy. In a moment of wild enthusiasm, I brought a living, thinking being into existence and owed him, as much as possible, a duty to ensure his well-being. Yet I had a greater obligation to humanity, to those like myself, as their welfare involved far deeper happiness or suffering. That belief led me to refuse to make a mate for the creature, and I feel I was right, for the monster has acted with unmatched cruelty and selfishness, killing my loved ones and seeking to destroy those capable of happiness and wisdom. I do not know where his desire for vengeance will stop. Because he makes his own life miserable, he should not have the chance to make anyone else suffer—he must die.

I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail it; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this final and wonderful catastrophe.\nI entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable friend. Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to describe—gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its proportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung towards the window. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of such loathsome yet appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily and endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer. I called on him to stay.\nHe paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion.\n“That is also my victim!” he exclaimed. “In his murder my crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its close! Oh, Frankenstein! Generous and self-devoted being! What does it avail that I now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst. Alas! He is cold, he cannot answer me.”\nHis voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. I approached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his face, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. I attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. The monster continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At length I gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.\n“Your repentance,” I said, “is now superfluous. If you had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity, Frankenstein would yet have lived.”\n“And do you dream?” said the dæmon. “Do you think that I was then dead to agony and remorse? He,” he continued, pointing to the corpse, “he suffered not in the consummation of the deed. Oh! Not the ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering detail of its execution. A frightful selfishness hurried me on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse. Think you that the groans of Clerval were music to my ears? My heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without torture such as you cannot even imagine.\n“After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken and overcome. I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I abhorred myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once of my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. I recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished. I knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the slave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could not disobey. Yet when she died! Nay, then I was not miserable. I had cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my despair. Evil thenceforth became my good. Urged thus far, I had no choice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly chosen. The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable passion. And now it is ended; there is my last victim!”\nI was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called to mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and persuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend, indignation was rekindled within me. “Wretch!” I said. “It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you have made. You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend! If he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would he become the prey, of your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that you feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from your power.”\n“Oh, it is not thus—not thus,” interrupted the being. “Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to be the purport of my actions. Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery. No sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was the love of virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being overflowed, that I wished to be participated. But now that virtue has become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding. I was nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime has degraded me beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I run over the frightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.\n“You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my crimes and his misfortunes. But in the detail which he gave you of them he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured wasting in impotent passions. For while I destroyed his hopes, I did not satisfy my own desires. They were for ever ardent and craving; still I desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned. Was there no injustice in this? Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all humankind sinned against me? Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his friend from his door with contumely? Why do you not execrate the rustic who sought to destroy the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous and immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now my blood boils at the recollection of this injustice.\n“But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely and the helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. I have devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and admiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that irremediable ruin. There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me, but your abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself. I look on the hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands will meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.\n“Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief. My work is nearly complete. Neither yours nor any man’s death is needed to consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done, but it requires my own. Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this sacrifice. I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would create such another as I have been. I shall die. I shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet unquenched. He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no more, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. I shall no longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks. Light, feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I find my happiness. Some years ago, when the images which this world affords first opened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to me, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation. Polluted by crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in death?\n“Farewell! I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these eyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert yet alive and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better satiated in my life than in my destruction. But it was not so; thou didst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness; and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think and feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than that which I feel. Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to thine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall close them for ever.\n“But soon,” he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, “I shall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt. Soon these burning miseries will be extinct. I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and exult in the agony of the torturing flames. The light of that conflagration will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. My spirit will sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus. Farewell.”\nHe sprang from the cabin-window as he said this, upon the ice raft which lay close to the vessel. He was soon borne away by the waves and lost in darkness and distance.",

As it leaned over the coffin, its face was hidden by long, messy hair, but one gigantic hand was visible, resembling a mummy's hand in its color and texture. When it heard me approach, it stopped its cries of sorrow and horror and lunged towards the window. I have never witnessed anything as terrifying as its face, so repulsive yet dreadfully hideous. I involuntarily shut my eyes and tried to remember my obligations regarding this destroyer. I ordered it to stop.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Almighty God! What a terrible event has just occurred—I can still barely process it. My mind is reeling, and I'm uncertain I can adequately recount it, yet my story would not be complete without describing this extraordinary, final calamity.\n\nI entered the room where my noble but doomed friend’s body lay. Over his coffin stooped a figure I can scarcely describe—massive in size, yet awkward and misshapen. His face was covered by tangled, unkempt hair, but one huge, mummified-looking hand extended toward the coffin. On hearing my footsteps, he stopped his desperate cries and hurried toward the window. I had never seen anything so repulsive and terrifying as his face; I instinctively closed my eyes and tried to remember my duty towards this being who had caused so much ruin. I commanded him to stop.\n\nHe hesitated, looking at me in astonishment, then turned back to the corpse of his creator, seemingly overcome with uncontrollable rage and grief. He exclaimed, \"He is my victim as well! With his death, my evil deeds are complete; my tragic existence is ending! Oh, Frankenstein! Generous, self-sacrificing man! What good is it now to plead for your forgiveness? I have utterly destroyed you by taking away everyone you loved. Alas! He is dead and cannot answer me.\"\n\nHis voice broke with emotion, and my initial impulse—to fulfill my friend’s dying wish by destroying his enemy—was overcome by curiosity and a surprising measure of pity. I moved cautiously towards the creature, unable to look at his ghastly face, and tried to speak but could not. The monster continued to blame himself wildly. Eventually, I managed to speak during a lull in his emotional storm.\n\n\"Your regret comes too late. If you had listened to your conscience earlier, if you had hesitated in your vengefulness, Frankenstein might still be alive.\"\n\n\"And do you think,\" the monster replied, \"that I was unaware of misery or remorse? He,\" pointing at Frankenstein’s body, \"did not suffer as I did. My agony during my vengeful acts was far greater than what he endured. An awful selfishness drove me on, but my heart was poisoned with regret. The pain of Clerval’s death was no comfort to me. My nature was made for love and sympathy; when that became twisted into hatred, I suffered tortures you cannot imagine.\n\n\"After killing Clerval I returned to Switzerland, broken with grief. I pitied Frankenstein and hated myself. But when I saw that he dared to seek happiness while making me miserable, I was overwhelmed with envy and a rabid hunger for vengeance. I reinforced my vow to ruin him, aware I was only increasing my own torment, but powerless to resist. When his bride died, I wasn’t even truly miserable—I simply gave myself over to despair and evil deeds. My demonic purpose became my obsession, and it’s now finished; there lies my final victim.\"\n\nAt first, I was moved by his evident anguish, but recalling Frankenstein’s warnings about his powers of persuasion, and looking at my friend’s body, I became angry again. “Wretch! Is it not ironic that you weep over desolation you created? You set the fire and now mourn its destruction. Hypocrite! If Frankenstein still lived, you would torment him again. This isn’t sorrow—it’s frustration at losing your victim to death!\"\n\n\"No, that’s not true,\" he protested, \"though I understand that’s how it appears. I do not seek compassion—for me, that hope has long vanished. At first I longed for love, virtue, and happiness. Now those things are lost to me, replaced only by bitter despair. I accept that, when I die, I will be remembered only in hate. Once I dreamed of honor and affection, imagining there might be people who would love me despite how I look. But crime has rendered me beneath all other beings. When I consider my many sins, I can barely believe I am the same creature who once thought of only goodness and beauty. I am like the fallen angel become a demon. Even Satan had companions in misery—I have none.\n\n\"You, as Frankenstein’s friend, know of my crimes. But not even he could convey the endless hours of anguish I suffered in vain. As I destroyed his happiness, I never achieved my own. I was always seeking love and companionship, always rejected. Wasn’t there injustice in that? Am I really the only criminal? Why don’t you hate Felix, who drove out his friend? Or the peasant who attacked me after I saved his child? No, they are praised as good; only I suffer contempt and abuse. Even now, the unfairness enrages me.\n\n\"I admit I am a wretch. I have killed the innocent in their sleep and murdered my loving creator’s beloved. Now he lies there, cold in death. You hate me, but I despise myself more. I look at the hands that did these deeds, and wish desperately for death to end my suffering.\n\n\"Do not worry; I shall not cause any more harm. My work is almost done; there need be no more deaths by my hand. Only my own death remains to close this tragic story. Believe me, I will not hesitate—I’ll leave your ship, travel to the far north, build my own funeral pyre, and burn this wretched body so no one will ever create such a monster again. I will die, my torment will end, and we will both soon be forgotten. No more sunlight or wind or sensations for me. Once, the beauties of the world delighted me, and I would have wept to die. Now, death is my only solace. Ridden with guilt and pain, where else do I find peace?\n\n\"Farewell! I leave you, the last man I will ever see. Farewell, Frankenstein! If you still lived and longed for revenge, you would see that my misery is worse than anything you could inflict. You sought to end my existence to spare others, and now, if you can think or feel at all beyond death, you would wish nothing worse upon me than the anguish I already suffer. My agony has always been even greater than yours, and only death can end my pain.\n\n\"But soon I shall die and feel no more. Soon these burning pains will be over. I shall climb my pyre and rejoice in the flames. My ashes will be scattered by the winds, my soul at last at peace. Farewell.\"\n\nWith that, he leapt from the window onto the ice-raft beside the ship. The waves quickly carried him away, vanishing into darkness and distance."
