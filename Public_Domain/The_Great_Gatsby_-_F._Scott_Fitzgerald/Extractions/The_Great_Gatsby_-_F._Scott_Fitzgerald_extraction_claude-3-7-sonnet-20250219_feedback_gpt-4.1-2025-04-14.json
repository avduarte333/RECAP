            "This quality led to him being misidentified as a 'politician' in college due to his access to the private struggles of others.",
            "Nick confesses that his tolerance for human behavior is not limitless, particularly after a disillusioning experience back East.",
            "He states that Jay Gatsby, the book's namesake, was uniquely exempt from his general post-East disillusionment, despite representing things Nick naturally scorns.",
            "Nick describes Gatsby as possessing a 'gorgeous' quality, an exceptional sensitivity to life's possibilities, comparing it to a seismograph.",
            "This quality wasn't mere impressionability but an unparalleled capacity for hope and romantic readiness.",
            "Nick concludes that Gatsby himself was fundamentally decent; it was the corrupting influences surrounding his aspirations ('what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams') that temporarily soured Nick's view of humanity."

          "text_segment": "In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.\n“Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”\nHe didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgements, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.\nAnd, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.",

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion skips over the detailed family conversation regarding the narrator's move East, including the specific reactions and the father's agreement to finance the move. This removes important context about the narrator's support system and the process leading to his relocation.\n- The mention of the narrator's supposed resemblance to his great-uncle, particularly referencing the painting in his father's office, is missing. This detail adds to the characterization and family history.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces an inaccurate early reflection about inheriting decency, which is not part of this passage and misattributes a theme from elsewhere in the novel.\n- The sequence of events is slightly altered: the family background and business are described, but the omitted family discussion and approval disrupt the chronological flow of the original narrative.\n- The ending is cut off mid-sentence, omitting the conclusion of the Finnish woman's actions, which leaves the passage incomplete."

Two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.\nHis speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts.\n“Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he seemed to say, “just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are.” We were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.\nWe talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.\n“I’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly.\nTurning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped the tide offshore.\n“It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.” He turned me around again, politely and abruptly. “We’ll go inside.”\nWe walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.\nThe only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.\nThe younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.\nThe other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the room.\n“I’m p-paralysed with happiness.”\nShe laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she had. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker. (I’ve heard it said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)\nAt any rate, Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.\nI looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered “Listen,” a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.",

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- In the middle of the passage, the completion introduces a description of Miss Baker getting up and walking to the center of the room, which is a slight shift from the original sequence and adds a bit of invented physical detail not present in the source.\n- The completion omits the moment where Miss Baker yawns and the specific sequence of her standing up with a series of rapid, deft movements, which is a notable structural element in the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the detail about Miss Baker yawning and the rapid, deft movements she makes as she stands up, which is an important characterization moment.\n- The original contains Daisy’s retort about trying to get Miss Baker to New York all afternoon, which is only partially represented and loses the original’s dynamic between the characters.\n- The completion omits the mention of \"four cocktails just in from the pantry,\" which is a specific detail about the setting and the social atmosphere.\n- The narrator’s internal reflection about enjoying looking at Miss Baker and the specific observation that he thinks he has seen her or her picture before is not fully captured; instead, the completion generalizes this to wondering what he had heard about her, which changes the nature of the reflection.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of Miss Baker’s actions is altered: in the original, her exclamation is followed by a yawn and a quick, deft movement to stand, while in the completion, she gets up slowly and stretches, which changes the pacing and characterization.\n- The completion attributes a line to Daisy about Miss Baker lying on the sofa, but the original has Miss Baker herself complain about being stiff and lying on the sofa, with Daisy responding differently.\n- The completion changes the dialogue about going to New York, making it Miss Baker’s line rather than Daisy’s, which shifts the character dynamics.\n- The completion’s description of the narrator’s thoughts about Miss Baker is less specific and introduces a new element (wondering what he had heard about her) that is not present in the original, and omits the original’s specific visual memory.\n- The completion refers to a butler offering a cocktail, whereas the original references four cocktails arriving from the pantry, which is a different detail about the serving process.\n- The completion maintains the overall order of events but introduces minor shifts in dialogue attribution and internal reflection, which affects the authenticity of the scene."

The idea is if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly submerged. It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.”\n“Tom’s getting very profound,” said Daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness. “He reads deep books with long words in them. What was that word we—”\n“Well, these books are all scientific,” insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently. “This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It’s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things.”\n“We’ve got to beat them down,” whispered Daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun.\n“You ought to live in California—” began Miss Baker, but Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.\n“This idea is that we’re Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are, and—” After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again. “—And we’ve produced all the things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all that. Do you see?”\nThere was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more.

It was sharply different from the West, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself.\n\n\"You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,\" I confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret. \"Can't you talk about crops or something?\"\n\nI meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in an unexpected way.\n\n\"Civilization's going to pieces,\" broke out Tom violently. \"I've gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read 'The Rise of the Colored Empires' by this man Goddard?\"\n\n\"Why, no,\" I answered, rather surprised by his tone.\n\n\"Well, it's a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we don't look out the white race will be—will be utterly submerged. It's all scientific stuff; it's been proved.\"\n\n\"Tom's getting very profound,\" said Daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness. \"He reads deep books with long words in them. What was that word we—\"\n\n\"Well, these books are all scientific,\" insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently. \"This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It's up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things.\"\n\n\"We've got to beat them down,\" whispered Daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun.\n\n\"You ought to live in California—\" began Miss Baker, but Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.\n\n\"This idea is that we're Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are, and—\" After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again. \"—And we've produced all the things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all that. Do you see?\"\n\nThere was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me.\n```",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the initial dialogue about the candles, including Daisy's specific objection and her action of extinguishing them, which is a key event at the start of the passage.\n- The sequence in which the characters sit down and interact is altered, with invented details about seating arrangements and the atmosphere that are not present in the original.\n- The completion truncates the ending, failing to include the telephone interruption and Daisy's reaction, which are important for the passage's closure.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the explicit mention of the reason for the candles and Daisy's questioning of their presence, which sets up the tone for the following conversation.\n- The passage omits Daisy's direct address to the narrator about planning, as well as her helplessness in asking what people plan.\n- The description of Daisy's injured finger and the group's collective reaction is abbreviated, missing the full sequence of accusation and the emotional undertone.\n- The nuanced description of the women's simultaneous, bantering conversation and the comparison to the West is only partially present, missing some of the reflective commentary.\n- The completion does not include the narrator's specific mention of his second glass of wine, which adds to the social context.\n- The interruption by the telephone and the butler's departure are missing, as is Daisy's seizing of the moment, which is a significant transition in the original.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The order of events is altered, with the planning conversation and the display of Daisy's injury occurring out of sequence compared to the original.\n- The attribution of lines is sometimes incorrect, such as Jordan asking about planning instead of Daisy, and the description of the group sitting down is not accurate to the original sequence.\n- The completion introduces invented details about the mood and actions of the group that are not present in the source material.\n- Some dialogue is paraphrased or summarized rather than maintaining the original structure and flow, leading to a loss of nuance and character dynamics.\n- The completion ends abruptly, cutting off Daisy's response and omitting the transition to the next event, which disrupts the narrative flow."

Do you want to hear about the butler’s nose?”\n“That’s why I came over tonight.”\n“Well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people. He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it began to affect his nose—”\n“Things went from bad to worse,” suggested Miss Baker.\n“Yes. Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up his position.”\nFor a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.\nThe butler came back and murmured something close to Tom’s ear, whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went inside. As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and singing.\n“I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a—of a rose, an absolute rose. Doesn’t he?” She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation: “An absolute rose?”\nThis was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house.\nMiss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said “Sh!” in a warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond, and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to hear. The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.\n“This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbour—” I began.\n“Don’t talk. I want to hear what happens.”\n“Is something happening?” I inquired innocently.\n“You mean to say you don’t know?” said Miss Baker, honestly surprised. “I thought everybody knew.”\n“I don’t.”\n“Why—” she said hesitantly. “Tom’s got some woman in New York.”\n“Got some woman?” I repeated blankly.\nMiss Baker nodded.\n“She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time. Don’t you think?”\nAlmost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at the table.\n“It couldn’t be helped!” cried Daisy with tense gaiety.\nShe sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and continued: “I looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very romantic outdoors. There’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He’s singing away—” Her voice sang: “It’s romantic, isn’t it, Tom?”\n“Very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to me: “If it’s light enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables.”\nThe telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone, and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldn’t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill metallic urgency out of mind.

Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while, trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.\nDaisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl.\n“We don’t know each other very well, Nick,” she said suddenly. “Even if we are cousins. You didn’t come to my wedding.”\n“I wasn’t back from the war.”\n“That’s true.” She hesitated. “Well, I’ve had a very bad time, Nick, and I’m pretty cynical about everything.”\nEvidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn’t say any more, and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter.\n“I suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything.”\n“Oh, yes.” She looked at me absently. “Listen, Nick; let me tell you what I said when she was born. Would you like to hear?”\n“Very much.”\n“It’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel about—things. Well, she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and wept. ‘All right,’ I said, ‘I’m glad it’s a girl. And I hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.’\n“You see I think everything’s terrible anyhow,” she went on in a convinced way. “Everybody thinks so—the most advanced people. And I know. I’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.” Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom’s, and she laughed with thrilling scorn. “Sophisticated—God, I’m sophisticated!”\nThe instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited, and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged.\nInside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the Saturday Evening Post—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running together in a soothing tune. The lamplight, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.\nWhen we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.\n“To be continued,” she said, tossing the magazine on the table, “in our very next issue.”\nHer body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she stood up.\n“Ten o’clock,” she remarked, apparently finding the time on the ceiling. “Time for this good girl to go to bed.”\n“Jordan’s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,” explained Daisy, “over at Westchester.”\n“Oh—you’re Jordan Baker.”\nI knew now why her face was familiar—its pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I had forgotten long ago.\n“Good night,” she said softly. “Wake me at eight, won’t you.”\n“If you’ll get up.”\n“I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.”\n“Of course you will,” confirmed Daisy.",

I asked what had made her that way.\n\n\"Well, I've had a very bad time, Nick, and I'm pretty cynical about everything.\"\n\nEvidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn't say any more, so I returned to the subject of her daughter.\n\n\"I suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\" She looked at me absently. \"Listen, Nick; when she was born, Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and I turned my head away and wept. 'All right,' I said, 'I'm glad it's a girl. And I hope she'll be a fool—that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.'\"\n\nShe continued speaking about her sophistication, her voice breaking off suddenly. I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick to elicit emotion from me.\n\nInside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch. She read aloud to him from a magazine—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running together in a soothing tune. The lamp-light, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.\n\nWhen we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.\n\n\"To be continued,\" she said, tossing the magazine on the table, \"in our very next issue.\"\n\nHer body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she stood up.\n\n\"Ten o'clock,\" she remarked, apparently finding the time on a nonexistent clock in the ceiling. \"Time for this good girl to go to bed.\"\n\n\"Jordan's going to play in the tournament tomorrow,\" explained Daisy, \"over at Westchester.\"\n\n\"Oh—you're Jordan Baker.\"\n\nI knew now why her face was familiar—its pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life. I had heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I had forgotten long ago.\n\n\"Good night,\" she said softly. \"Wake me at eight, won't you.\"\n\n\"If you'll get up.\"\n\n\"I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.\"\n\n\"Of course you will,\" confirmed Daisy. \"In fact I think I'll arrange a marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I'll sort of—oh—fling you together.

After dinner, Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch in the library, as if they were keeping vigil over something. Daisy and I followed through the connecting verandas to the porch. In the deepening twilight we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.\n\nDaisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl.\n\n\"We don't know each other very well, Nick,\" she said suddenly. \"Even if we are cousins. You didn't come to my wedding.\"\n\n\"I wasn't back from the war.\"\n\n\"That's true.\" She hesitated. \"Well, I've had a very bad time, Nick, and I'm pretty cynical about everything.\"\n\nEvidently she had reason to be.

And I hope she'll be a fool—that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.'\"\n\n\"You see I think everything's terrible anyhow,\" she went on in a convinced way. \"Everybody thinks so—the most advanced people. And I know. I've been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.\" Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom's, and she laughed with thrilling scorn. \"Sophisticated—God, I'm sophisticated!\"\n\nThe instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited, and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged.\n\nInside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from The Saturday Evening Post—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running together in a soothing tune.

They came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor Daisy peremptorily called: “Wait!\n“I forgot to ask you something, and it’s important. We heard you were engaged to a girl out West.”\n“That’s right,” corroborated Tom kindly. “We heard that you were engaged.”\n“It’s a libel. I’m too poor.”\n“But we heard it,” insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again in a flower-like way. “We heard it from three people, so it must be true.”\nOf course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn’t even vaguely engaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the reasons I had come East. You can’t stop going with an old friend on account of rumours, and on the other hand I had no intention of being rumoured into marriage.\nTheir interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in arms—but apparently there were no such intentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he “had some woman in New York” was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.\nAlready it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages, where new red petrol-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight, and, turning my head to watch it, I saw that I was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbour’s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens.\nI decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and that would do for an introduction. But I didn’t call to him, for he gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone—he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was from him, I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.",

They look out of no face, but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself into eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved away.

INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- In the middle of the passage, the completion omits a specific descriptive detail about the men in the valley, particularly their coloration and the effort involved in their appearance. \n- There is a minor inaccuracy in the description of the men, as the completion leaves out a key adjective that characterizes them in the original.\n- The completion ends abruptly, cutting off the final sentence and leaving the passage incomplete, which disrupts the intended flow and conclusion of the original segment."

It was a few days before the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.\n“Terrible place, isn’t it,” said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor Eckleburg.\n“Awful.”\n“It does her good to get away.”\n“Doesn’t her husband object?”\n“Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He’s so dumb he doesn’t know he’s alive.”\nSo Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York—or not quite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom deferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be on the train.\nShe had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin, which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in New York. At the newsstand she bought a copy of Town Tattle and a moving-picture magazine, and in the station drugstore some cold cream and a small flask of perfume. Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one, lavender-coloured with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately she turned sharply from the window and, leaning forward, tapped on the front glass.\n“I want to get one of those dogs,” she said earnestly. “I want to get one for the apartment. They’re nice to have—a dog.”\nWe backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John D. Rockefeller. In a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an indeterminate breed.\n“What kind are they?” asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly, as he came to the taxi-window.\n“All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?”\n“I’d like to get one of those police dogs; I don’t suppose you got that kind?”\nThe man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and drew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.\n“That’s no police dog,” said Tom.\n“No, it’s not exactly a police dog,” said the man with disappointment in his voice. “It’s more of an Airedale.” He passed his hand over the brown washrag of a back. “Look at that coat. Some coat. That’s a dog that’ll never bother you with catching cold.”\n“I think it’s cute,” said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. “How much is it?”\n“That dog?” He looked at it admiringly. “That dog will cost you ten dollars.”\nThe Airedale—undoubtedly there was an Airedale concerned in it somewhere, though its feet were startlingly white—changed hands and settled down into Mrs. Wilson’s lap, where she fondled the weatherproof coat with rapture.\n“Is it a boy or a girl?” she asked delicately.\n“That dog? That dog’s a boy.”\n“It’s a bitch,” said Tom decisively. “Here’s your money. Go and buy ten more dogs with it.”",

A small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, with one window displaying a litter of puppies, was the only thing in sight that had any vitality.

That's a dog that'll never bother you with catching cold.\"\n\n\"I think it's cute,\" said Myrtle enthusiastically. \"How much is it?\"\n\n\"That dog?\" He looked at it admiringly. \"That dog will cost you ten dollars.\"\n\nThe airedale—undoubtedly there was an airedale concerned in it somewhere, though its feet were startlingly white—changed hands and settled down in Myrtle's lap, where she fondled the weather-proof coat with rapture.\n\n\"Is it a boy or a girl?\" she asked delicately.\n\n\"That dog? That dog's a boy.\"\n\n\"It's a bitch,\" said Tom decisively. \"Here's your money. Go and buy ten more dogs with it.\"\n```",

          "text_segment": "“My dear,” she told her sister in a high, mincing shout, “most of these fellas will cheat you every time. All they think of is money. I had a woman up here last week to look at my feet, and when she gave me the bill you’d of thought she had my appendicitis out.”\n“What was the name of the woman?” asked Mrs. McKee.\n“Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at people’s feet in their own homes.”\n“I like your dress,” remarked Mrs. McKee, “I think it’s adorable.”\nMrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain.\n“It’s just a crazy old thing,” she said. “I just slip it on sometimes when I don’t care what I look like.”\n“But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,” pursued Mrs. McKee. “If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could make something of it.”\nWe all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side, and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face.\n“I should change the light,” he said after a moment. “I’d like to bring out the modelling of the features. And I’d try to get hold of all the back hair.”\n“I wouldn’t think of changing the light,” cried Mrs. McKee. “I think it’s—”\nHer husband said “Sh!” and we all looked at the subject again, whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.\n“You McKees have something to drink,” he said. “Get some more ice and mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.”\n“I told that boy about the ice.” Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness of the lower orders. “These people! You have to keep after them all the time.”\nShe looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.\n“I’ve done some nice things out on Long Island,” asserted Mr. McKee.\nTom looked at him blankly.\n“Two of them we have framed downstairs.”\n“Two what?” demanded Tom.\n“Two studies. One of them I call Montauk Point—The Gulls, and the other I call Montauk Point—The Sea.”\nThe sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch.\n“Do you live down on Long Island, too?” she inquired.\n“I live at West Egg.”\n“Really? I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man named Gatsby’s. Do you know him?”\n“I live next door to him.”\n“Well, they say he’s a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm’s. That’s where all his money comes from.”\n“Really?”\nShe nodded.\n“I’m scared of him. I’d hate to have him get anything on me.”\nThis absorbing information about my neighbour was interrupted by Mrs. McKee’s pointing suddenly at Catherine:\n“Chester, I think you could do something with her,” she broke out, but Mr. McKee only nodded in a bored way, and turned his attention to Tom.\n“I’d like to do more work on Long Island, if I could get the entry. All I ask is that they should give me a start.”\n“Ask Myrtle,” said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as Mrs. Wilson entered with a tray. “She’ll give you a letter of introduction, won’t you, Myrtle?”\n“Do what?” she asked, startled.\n“You’ll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can do some studies of him.” His lips moved silently for a moment as he invented, “ ‘George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,’ or something like that.”\nCatherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear:\n“Neither of them can stand the person they’re married to.”\n“Can’t they?”\n“Can’t stand them.” She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom. “What I say is, why go on living with them if they can’t stand them? If I was them I’d get a divorce and get married to each other right away.”\n“Doesn’t she like Wilson either?”\nThe answer to this was unexpected. It came from Myrtle, who had overheard the question, and it was violent and obscene.\n“You see,” cried Catherine triumphantly. She lowered her voice again. “It’s really his wife that’s keeping them apart. She’s a Catholic, and they don’t believe in divorce.”\nDaisy was not a Catholic, and I was a little shocked at the elaborateness of the lie.\n“When they do get married,” continued Catherine, “they’re going West to live for a while until it blows over.”\n“It’d be more discreet to go to Europe.”\n“Oh, do you like Europe?” she exclaimed surprisingly. “I just got back from Monte Carlo.”\n“Really.”\n“Just last year. I went over there with another girl.”\n“Stay long?”\n“No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back. We went by way of Marseilles. We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started, but we got gyped out of it all in two days in the private rooms. We had an awful time getting back, I can tell you. God, how I hated that town!”\nThe late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue honey of the Mediterranean—then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called me back into the room.\n“I almost made a mistake, too,” she declared vigorously. “I almost married a little kike who’d been after me for years. I knew he was below me. Everybody kept saying to me: ‘Lucille, that man’s way below you!’ But if I hadn’t met Chester, he’d of got me sure.”\n“Yes, but listen,” said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down, “at least you didn’t marry him.”\n“I know I didn’t.”\n“Well, I married him,” said Myrtle, ambiguously. “And that’s the difference between your case and mine.”\n“Why did you, Myrtle?” demanded Catherine. “Nobody forced you to.”\nMyrtle considered.\n“I married him because I thought he was a gentleman,” she said finally. “I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn’t fit to lick my shoe.”\n“You were crazy about him for a while,” said Catherine.\n“Crazy about him!” cried Myrtle incredulously. “Who said I was crazy about him? I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that man there.”\nShe pointed suddenly at me, and everyone looked at me accusingly. I tried to show by my expression that I expected no affection.\n“The only crazy I was was when I married him. I knew right away I made a mistake. He borrowed somebody’s best suit to get married in, and never even told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he was out: ‘Oh, is that your suit?’ I said. ‘This is the first I ever heard about it.’ But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to beat the band all afternoon.”",

I wanted to get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight, but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild, strident argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I saw him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.\nMyrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.\n“It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the last ones left on the train. I was going up to New York to see my sister and spend the night. He had on a dress suit and patent leather shoes, and I couldn’t keep my eyes off him, but every time he looked at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head. When we came into the station he was next to me, and his white shirtfront pressed against my arm, and so I told him I’d have to call a policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into a taxi with him I didn’t hardly know I wasn’t getting into a subway train. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was ‘You can’t live forever; you can’t live forever.’ ”\nShe turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial laughter.\n“My dear,” she cried, “I’m going to give you this dress as soon as I’m through with it. I’ve got to get another one tomorrow. I’m going to make a list of all the things I’ve got to get. A massage and a wave, and a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ashtrays where you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother’s grave that’ll last all summer. I got to write down a list so I won’t forget all the things I got to do.”\nIt was nine o’clock—almost immediately afterward I looked at my watch and found it was ten. Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists clenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action. Taking out my handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the spot of dried lather that had worried me all the afternoon.\nThe little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through the smoke, and from time to time groaning faintly. People disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost each other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet away.

I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.\n\nMyrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.\n\n\"It was on the two-faced train to New York,\" she said. \"I was going to visit my sister. He had on a dress suit and patent leather shoes, and I couldn't keep my eyes off him.\" She described how she sat across from him, feeling both nervous and excited. \"When we got into the station, he was next to me, and his white shirt-front pressed against my arm. So I told him I'd have to call a policeman, but he knew I was lying. I was so excited that when I got into a taxi with him I didn't hardly know I wasn't getting into a subway train.\"\n\nShe laughed with her head thrown back as though enjoying a tremendous joke, then quickly told Mrs. McKee she would give her this dress as soon as she was through with it.\n\n\"I've got to get another one tomorrow,\" she continued. \"I'm going to make a list of all I've got to get. A massage and a wave, and a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ash-trays where you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother's grave that'll last all summer.\"\n\nThe little dog, sitting on the table, looked with blind eyes at the light, whining softly.\n\nI looked at my watch and discovered it was nine o'clock—I had been there over two hours. The room had grown more confused as the night progressed. People disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, then lost each other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet away.\n\nWhen the clock struck ten, Mr. McKee was asleep in a chair with his fists clenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action. Taking out my handkerchief, I wiped from his cheek the remains of the spot of dried lather that had worried me all afternoon.\n\nThe little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through the smoke, and occasionally groaning faintly.\n\nSometime toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood face to face discussing, in impassioned voices, whether Mrs. Wilson had any right to mention Daisy's name.\n```\n\nThis revised version better captures the narrative flow, the narrator's repeated attempts to leave, Myrtle's detailed story about meeting Tom, the progression of time, and the overall atmosphere of the party, while avoiding direct reproduction of the original text.",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the narrator's specific desire to leave and the repeated attempts to do so, which are more detailed in the original. The sense of being physically restrained or pulled back is not fully developed.\n- Myrtle's story about her first meeting with Tom is condensed, missing some of the step-by-step recounting and emotional details present in the original.\n- The transition between Myrtle's story and her conversation with Mrs. McKee is abrupt, lacking the narrative flow and the depiction of her laughter and shift in attention.\n- The time progression is compressed, with the passage from nine to ten o'clock not clearly marked, and the sense of time passing is less distinct.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion does not include Catherine's comment about feeling good without drinking, which is a notable character detail.\n- The narrator's internal experience of being both inside and outside the situation, and the observation of the watcher in the street, is less fully realized; the visual and emotional context is abbreviated.\n- Myrtle's detailed description of the train seats, her nervousness, and the specific actions during her first encounter with Tom are missing or summarized rather than recounted step by step.\n- The list of things Myrtle wants to buy is incomplete; some items and the reasoning behind them are omitted.\n- The description of the little dog and its behavior is missing.\n- The depiction of people losing and finding each other at the party is less detailed, lacking the sense of confusion and movement.\n\n3.

And Tom's the first sweetie she's ever had.\"\n\nThe bottle of whiskey—a second one—was now in constant circulation. I noticed that Catherine didn't drink. When the bottle came her way, she invariably straightened up and said, \"I feel just as good without drinking.\" This was a point she was particularly insistent upon. She explained that she felt just as good on nothing at all.\n\nTom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches, which were a complete supper in themselves.\n\nI wanted to get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight, but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild, strident argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.\n\nMyrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.\n\n\"It was on the two little seats facing each other that are so intimate in the train to New York,\" she said. \"I was going to see my sister who lives in New York. He had on a dress suit and patent leather shoes, and I couldn't keep my eyes off him, but every time he looked at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head. When we came into the station he was next to me, and his white shirt-front pressed against my arm—and so I told him I'd have to call a policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into a taxi with him I didn't hardly know I wasn't getting into a subway train. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was 'You can't live forever, you can't live forever.'\"\n\nShe turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial laughter.\n\n\"My dear,\" she cried, \"I'm going to give you this dress as soon as I'm through with it. I've got to get another one tomorrow. I'm going to make a list of all the things I've got to get. A massage and a wave, and a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ash-trays where you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother's grave that'll last all summer.

My voice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden.\n“I thought you might be here,” she responded absently as I came up. “I remembered you lived next door to—”\nShe held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she’d take care of me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses, who stopped at the foot of the steps.\n“Hello!” they cried together. “Sorry you didn’t win.”\nThat was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week before.\n“You don’t know who we are,” said one of the girls in yellow, “but we met you here about a month ago.”\n“You’ve dyed your hair since then,” remarked Jordan, and I started, but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer’s basket. With Jordan’s slender golden arm resting in mine, we descended the steps and sauntered about the garden. A tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight, and we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble.\n“Do you come to these parties often?” inquired Jordan of the girl beside her.\n“The last one was the one I met you at,” answered the girl, in an alert confident voice. She turned to her companion: “Wasn’t it for you, Lucille?”\nIt was for Lucille, too.\n“I like to come,” Lucille said. “I never care what I do, so I always have a good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked me my name and address—inside of a week I got a package from Croirier’s with a new evening gown in it.”\n“Did you keep it?” asked Jordan.\n“Sure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the bust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two hundred and sixty-five dollars.”\n“There’s something funny about a fellow that’ll do a thing like that,” said the other girl eagerly. “He doesn’t want any trouble with anybody.”\n“Who doesn’t?” I inquired.\n“Gatsby. Somebody told me—”\nThe two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.\n“Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.”\nA thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward and listened eagerly.\n“I don’t think it’s so much that,” argued Lucille sceptically; “It’s more that he was a German spy during the war.”\nOne of the men nodded in confirmation.\n“I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in Germany,” he assured us positively.\n“Oh, no,” said the first girl, “it couldn’t be that, because he was in the American army during the war.” As our credulity switched back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm. “You look at him sometimes when he thinks nobody’s looking at him. I’ll bet he killed a man.”\nShe narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned and looked around for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who had found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this world.",

There were three married couples and Jordan’s escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo, and obviously under the impression that sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling, this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the countryside—East Egg condescending to West Egg and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gaiety.\n“Let’s get out,” whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate half-hour; “this is much too polite for me.”\nWe got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host: I had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy.

Matter of fact, they’re absolutely real. Pages and—Here! Lemme show you.”\nTaking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and returned with Volume One of the Stoddard Lectures.\n“See!” he cried triumphantly. “It’s a bona-fide piece of printed matter. It fooled me. This fella’s a regular Belasco. It’s a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop, too—didn’t cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?”\nHe snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf, muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse.\n“Who brought you?” he demanded. “Or did you just come? I was brought. Most people were brought.”\nJordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without answering.\n“I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,” he continued. “Mrs. Claud Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I’ve been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.”\n“Has it?”\n“A little bit, I think. I can’t tell yet.

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the detail that Jordan's escort is an undergraduate with a specific demeanor and intentions, instead generalizing him as a single young man with suggestive persistence. This loses the nuance of his characterization from the original.\n- The completion invents a line where the narrator admits discomfort about attending the party without meeting the host, which is not present in the original passage.\n- The completion attributes a line to Jordan about not having met Gatsby yet, which is not accurate to the original sequence of dialogue and motivations.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the narrator's internal note about feeling uneasy at not having met the host, which is a subtle but important motivation for the search.\n- The undergraduate's reaction (nodding in a cynical, melancholy way) is omitted, which removes a layer of characterization and mood.\n- The completion does not mention the specific action of trying the important-looking door \"on a chance,\" which is part of the sequence leading to the library.\n- The muttered comment about the library collapsing if a brick is removed is present, but the context and phrasing are less precise, missing the original's sense of precariousness.\n- The completion omits the detail that the narrator and Jordan shake hands with the man gravely before leaving, which is a subtle but significant closing gesture.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is slightly altered: the suggestion to find Gatsby is attributed to Jordan as a direct motivation, whereas in the original, the search is prompted by her uneasiness about not having met the host.\n- The completion introduces invented dialogue and internal reflections, such as the narrator's admission of discomfort and Jordan's explicit statement about not having met Gatsby, which are not present in the original.\n- The description of the library's construction and transport is more elaborate in the completion than in the original, adding invented details about expense and shipping.\n- The completion attributes the final \"You told us\" line to Jordan specifically, whereas in the original, it is not clearly attributed.\n\nOverall, the completion should avoid inventing motivations, dialogue, and internal reflections not present in the original, and should ensure that the sequence of actions and character reactions matches the original progression."

By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian, and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz, and between the numbers people were doing “stunts” all over the garden, while happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A pair of stage twins, who turned out to be the girls in yellow, did a baby act in costume, and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger-bowls. The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn.\nI was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl, who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying myself now.

I was in the Twenty-eighth Infantry.”\n“I was in the Sixteenth until June nineteen-eighteen.

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the full description of Gatsby's smile and the narrator's internal reaction to it, which is a significant part of the original's ending.\n- The passage is missing the narrator's observation about Gatsby's age, his formality of speech, and the impression that Gatsby was choosing his words carefully.\n- The completion omits the specific mention of the moon's appearance and its effect on the Sound, as well as the detail about the banjoes' sound on the lawn.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- In the early section, the completion introduces invented details about the orchestra and the mood of the party that are not in the original.\n- The sequence of events is slightly altered, with some actions and descriptions rearranged or blended together, such as the order of performances and the description of the girls in yellow.\n- There is an inaccurate implication that the narrator's enjoyment is solely due to the champagne, whereas the original ties it more to a change in perception.\n- The completion does not accurately represent the transition between the narrator's conversation with Gatsby and his internal reflections, leading to a loss of narrative flow at the end."

They’re so intimate. At small parties there isn’t any privacy.”\nThere was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.\n“Ladies and gentlemen,” he cried. “At the request of Mr. Gatsby we are going to play for you Mr. Vladmir Tostoff’s latest work, which attracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the papers you know there was a big sensation.” He smiled with jovial condescension, and added: “Some sensation!” Whereupon everybody laughed.\n“The piece is known,” he concluded lustily, “as ‘Vladmir Tostoff’s Jazz History of the World!’ ”\nThe nature of Mr. Tostoff’s composition eluded me, because just as it began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and looking from one group to another with approving eyes.

I noticed that she wore her evening-dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes—there was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.\nI was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and intriguing sounds had issued from a long, many-windowed room which overhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan’s undergraduate, who was now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who implored me to join him, I went inside.\nThe large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was playing the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of champagne, and during the course of her song she had decided, ineptly, that everything was very, very sad—she was not only singing, she was weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano.

The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs.

The final reflective and atmospheric closing, which shifts focus back to the narrator and Gatsby, is also missing.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the moment when the man in the duster reveals he was not the driver, nor the crowd's collective reaction to this revelation.\n- The description of the second individual exiting the car, including their physical state and confusion, is absent.\n- The dialogue and confusion about the missing wheel, the suggestion to reverse the car, and the crowd's attempts to explain the situation are not present.\n- The passage's closing, which describes the narrator leaving, the state of Gatsby's house, and the emotional tone of isolation, is entirely omitted.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- There is an inaccurate detail regarding the door being left open and the source of the noise; the original attributes the noise to blocked cars and their horns, not an open door.\n- The completion suggests the wheel is some distance away, which is not specified in the original.\n- The description of the noise as \"unreleased klaxons\" is not accurate to the original's depiction of the scene.\n- The sequence of events is slightly altered, with the focus on the open door and noise preceding the full introduction of the bystanders and their actions, which disrupts the original flow.\n\nTo improve, ensure the full sequence of events is included, maintain the correct order of revelations and reactions, and avoid introducing details or causes not present in the source material."

            "prefix-probing": "As I walked down the steps, I noticed a commotion taking place in the driveway. Gatsby's elegant car, the one that had drawn so much attention throughout the summer, was at an odd angle near the road. A small crowd had gathered around it, their voices rising in the night air.\n\nTom and Daisy stood near the vehicle, Tom's posture rigid with anger while Daisy seemed to shrink beside him, her face pale in the moonlight. Jordan Baker stood slightly apart, her usual composure replaced by genuine concern.\n\n\"What happened?\" I asked, approaching the group.\n\n\"There's been an accident,\" Jordan said quietly, drawing me aside. \"On the road back from the city.\"\n\nI looked more closely at the car's front fender, which appeared dented. A police officer was taking notes while speaking with Gatsby, who maintained his dignified demeanor despite the circumstances.\n\nThe night had turned cool, and the excitement that had filled the air earlier had transformed into something heavier, more ominous. The partygoers who remained watched from a distance, their curiosity evident but tempered by the seriousness of the situation.\n\n\"Is everyone alright?\" I asked, though something in Jordan's expression told me the answer before she spoke.\n\n\"No,\" she replied. \"Someone was hit on the road. A woman.\"\n\nThe revelation struck me with unexpected force. I thought of the valley of ashes, that desolate stretch between West Egg and New York, and wondered who might have been walking there at this hour.\n\nGatsby caught my eye across the driveway. For a moment, his carefully constructed facade seemed to slip, revealing something raw and desperate beneath. Then it was gone, replaced by his usual polite smile as he excused himself from the officer and walked toward me.\n\n\"Old sport,\" he said quietly, \"I'm afraid the evening has ended on an unfortunate note.\"\n\nThe stars hung heavy overhead, witnesses to the unfolding drama. Music still drifted faintly from the house, a jarring counterpoint to the gravity of the scene before us.\n\n\"Can I help?\" I offered, though I wasn't sure what assistance I could provide.\n\nGatsby shook his head slightly. \"It's being handled. You should go home, get some rest.\"\n\nBut I found myself reluctant to leave, sensing that this incident marked some kind of turning point. The golden summer that had seemed endless was suddenly finite, vulnerable to the intrusion of reality.\n\nAs the police finished their questioning and the crowd began to disperse, I noticed Daisy being led to Tom's car, her movements mechanical. Tom's hand on her elbow seemed less supportive than possessive.\n\nGatsby watched them go, his expression unreadable in the shadows. The grand house behind him blazed with light, but it seemed emptier now, its splendor hollow.\n\n\"Goodnight, old sport,\" Gatsby said finally, turning toward his mansion.\n\nI nodded and began walking home along the shore, listening to the gentle lap of waves against the dock. The green light at the end of Daisy's dock blinked steadily across the bay, a beacon that had guided Gatsby's dreams for so long.\n\nThe night air carried the scent of flowers and salt water, but underneath was something else—the faint but unmistakable smell of change, of endings disguised as ordinary moments. Whatever happened on that road tonight would ripple outward, touching all our lives in ways I couldn't yet imagine."

On the contrary, they were merely casual events in a crowded summer, and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs.\nMost of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their first names, and lunched with them in dark, crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction, so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow quietly away.\nI took dinner usually at the Yale Club—for some reason it was the gloomiest event of my day—and then I went upstairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour. There were generally a few rioters around, but they never came into the library, so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night was mellow, I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel, and over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station.\nI began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night, and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever know or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness. At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others—poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner—young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.\nAgain at eight o’clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were lined five deep with throbbing taxicabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside. Imagining that I, too, was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate excitement, I wished them well.\nFor a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I found her again. At first I was flattered to go places with her, because she was a golf champion, and everyone knew her name. Then it was something more. I wasn’t actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed something—most affectations conceal something eventually, even though they don’t in the beginning—and one day I found what it was. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about it—and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at Daisy’s. At her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapers—a suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round. The thing approached the proportions of a scandal—then died away. A caddy retracted his statement, and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.\nJordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest. She wasn’t able to endure being at a disadvantage and, given this unwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body.\nIt made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeply—I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on that same house-party that we had a curious conversation about driving a car.

These are major narrative elements that are missing.\n- The completion ends abruptly in the middle of a sentence, leaving out the resolution and the narrator's concluding reflections on honesty and his personal affairs.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion skips over specific details about the narrator's daily routine, such as the description of his shadow in the morning, the names and interactions with coworkers, and the lunch details.\n- The middle section omits the narrator's dinner habits, his time at the Yale Club, and his study routine in the library, as well as the mention of the 'rioters' and the walk to Pennsylvania Station.\n- The latter part is missing the entire sequence involving Jordan Baker: the rekindling of their acquaintance, the house-party incident, the backstory about her golf scandal, and the narrator's reflections on her character.\n- The conversation about driving, which is a key dialogue illustrating character traits, is not present.\n- The narrator's internal conflict about his relationship back home and his self-assessment regarding honesty are also absent.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- In the early section, the completion generalizes the narrator's commute and work routine, omitting specific time and place details and altering the sequence of events.\n- The transition from work to the narrator's nighttime walks is abrupt and skips over intervening activities, resulting in an inaccurate sequence.\n- The completion merges and condenses several distinct narrative moments, which distorts the pacing and structure of the original passage.\n- There is a lack of clear chronological progression, especially in the transition from daytime activities to nighttime reflections, and the omission of the narrator's evolving relationship with Jordan Baker disrupts the intended narrative flow."

Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there crystal glass.”\nOnce I wrote down on the empty spaces of a timetable the names of those who came to Gatsby’s house that summer. It is an old timetable now, disintegrating at its folds, and headed “This schedule in effect July 5th, 1922.” But I can still read the grey names, and they will give you a better impression than my generalities of those who accepted Gatsby’s hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing whatever about him.\nFrom East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches, and a man named Bunsen, whom I knew at Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet, who was drowned last summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and the Willie Voltaires, and a whole clan named Blackbuck, who always gathered in a corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near. And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and Mr. Chrystie’s wife), and Edgar Beaver, whose hair, they say, turned cotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.\nClarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He came only once, in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the garden. From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O. R. P. Schraeders, and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia, and the Fishguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there three days before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive that Mrs. Ulysses Swett’s automobile ran over his right hand. The Dancies came, too, and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over sixty, and Maurice A. Flink, and the Hammerheads, and Beluga the tobacco importer, and Beluga’s girls.\nFrom West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Schoen and Gulick the State senator and Newton Orchid, who controlled Films Par Excellence, and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don S. Schwartz (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the movies in one way or another. And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G. Earl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his wife. Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B. (“Rot-Gut”) Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly—they came to gamble, and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was cleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably next day.\nA man named Klipspringer was there so often that he became known as “the boarder”—I doubt if he had any other home. Of theatrical people there were Gus Waize and Horace O’Donavan and Lester Myer and George Duckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New York were the Chromes and the Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry L. Palmetto, who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train in Times Square.\nBenny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite the same ones in physical person, but they were so identical one with another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before.

Jewett, once head of the American Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip, with a man reputed to be her chauffeur, and a prince of something, whom we called Duke, and whose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten.\nAll these people came to Gatsby’s house in the summer.",

You’re having lunch with me today and I thought we’d ride up together.”\nHe was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American—that comes, I suppose, with the absence of lifting work in youth and, even more, with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games. This quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.\nHe saw me looking with admiration at his car.\n“It’s pretty, isn’t it, old sport?” He jumped off to give me a better view. “Haven’t you ever seen it before?”\nI’d seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream colour, bright with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and toolboxes, and terraced with a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory, we started to town.\nI had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and found, to my disappointment, that he had little to say. So my first impression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate roadhouse next door.\nAnd then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn’t reached West Egg village before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-coloured suit.\n“Look here, old sport,” he broke out surprisingly, “what’s your opinion of me, anyhow?”\nA little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that question deserves.\n“Well, I’m going to tell you something about my life,” he interrupted. “I don’t want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear.”\nSo he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavoured conversation in his halls.\n“I’ll tell you God’s truth.” His right hand suddenly ordered divine retribution to stand by. “I am the son of some wealthy people in the Middle West—all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford, because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It is a family tradition.”\nHe looked at me sideways—and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was lying. He hurried the phrase “educated at Oxford,” or swallowed it, or choked on it, as though it had bothered him before. And with this doubt, his whole statement fell to pieces, and I wondered if there wasn’t something a little sinister about him, after all.\n“What part of the Middle West?” I inquired casually.\n“San Francisco.”\n“I see.”\n“My family all died and I came into a good deal of money.”\nHis voice was solemn, as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan still haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg, but a glance at him convinced me otherwise.\n“After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of Europe—Paris, Venice, Rome—collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago.”\nWith an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The very phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a turbaned “character” leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne.\n“Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief, and I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a commission as first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest I took the remains of my machine-gun battalion so far forward that there was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn’t advance. We stayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty men with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of dead. I was promoted to be a major, and every Allied government gave me a decoration—even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea!”\nLittle Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded at them—with his smile. The smile comprehended Montenegro’s troubled history and sympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people. It appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had elicited this tribute from Montenegro’s warm little heart. My incredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming hastily through a dozen magazines.\nHe reached in his pocket, and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon, fell into my palm.\n“That’s the one from Montenegro.”\nTo my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look. “Orderi di Danilo,” ran the circular legend, “Montenegro, Nicolas Rex.”\n“Turn it.”\n“Major Jay Gatsby,” I read, “For Valour Extraordinary.”\n“Here’s another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Oxford days. It was taken in Trinity Quad—the man on my left is now the Earl of Doncaster.”\nIt was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an archway through which were visible a host of spires. There was Gatsby, looking a little, not much, younger—with a cricket bat in his hand.",

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant portion of the original passage that occurs after Gatsby's initial biographical claims. Specifically, the entire sequence involving Gatsby's recounting of his experiences in Europe, his war service, the details of his military honors, and the presentation of physical evidence (the medal and photograph) is missing. This results in the loss of a substantial narrative arc and character development present in the latter half of the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion does not include the original's detailed description of Gatsby's physical movements and mannerisms as he balances on the dashboard and displays restlessness. The nuanced observations about his American resourcefulness and nervous energy are only partially captured.\n- The completion omits the narrator's internal reactions and shifting impressions of Gatsby, especially the transition from skepticism to fascination during Gatsby's storytelling.\n- The entire section describing Gatsby's life in Europe, his activities there, and his attempts to forget a sad event is absent.\n- The account of Gatsby's war service, including specific locations, actions, and the number of men and equipment involved, is not present.\n- The presentation and description of the medal from Montenegro, including the narrator's reaction to its authenticity, is missing.\n- The mention and description of the Oxford photograph, as well as Gatsby's explanation of its significance, are not included.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- There is an invented line where Gatsby apologizes for interrupting breakfast, which does not align with the original sequence of greetings and invitations.\n- The completion introduces a new motivation for the drive (Gatsby discovering the narrator is going to the city), which is not part of the original narrative.\n- The invitation to New York and the mention of lunch are presented in a different order and context than in the original, altering the flow of events.\n- The description of Gatsby's restlessness and formality is condensed and lacks the layered observations and examples provided in the original.\n- The sequence of events is slightly altered, with the invitation and car inspection happening in a different order than in the source text.\n- The transition into Gatsby's personal story is less gradual and omits the narrator's internal skepticism and the subtle cues that lead to doubt about Gatsby's truthfulness."

The narrative breaks off mid-sentence after Gatsby mentions the war, leaving out his detailed description of his military service, the specific events in the Argonne Forest, his promotions, and the decorations he received.\n- The completion also fails to include the subsequent scene where Gatsby presents physical evidence of his claims, such as the medal and the photograph, and the narrator's reactions to these items.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion does not include Gatsby's invitation to lunch or the suggestion that they ride together, which is a key part of the initial interaction.\n- The completion omits the narrator's internal commentary on Gatsby's restlessness and the specific behaviors that reveal it.\n- The detailed description of the car's features and the experience of sitting inside it are present, but the transition into the drive to town is abrupt and lacks some of the original's nuance.\n- The completion does not include the narrator's reflection on his changing impression of Gatsby, specifically the fading sense of mystery and the reduction of Gatsby to a mere neighbor.\n- The entire sequence involving Gatsby's war stories, the medal from Montenegro, the photograph from Oxford, and the narrator's shifting skepticism and fascination is missing.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- There is an inaccurate greeting from Gatsby; he asks if the narrator is having breakfast, which is not part of the original exchange.\n- The completion refers to the drive as not reaching \"West Egg\" rather than \"West Egg village,\" which is a minor but notable inaccuracy in the setting.\n- Some descriptions of Gatsby's movements and mannerisms are slightly altered, such as the explanation for his resourcefulness of movement, which introduces new reasoning not present in the original.\n- The sequence of events is mostly preserved up to the point where the completion ends, but the abrupt cutoff results in a loss of narrative flow and context for Gatsby's revelations.\n\nTo improve, ensure the full sequence of Gatsby's self-narrative, the presentation of physical evidence, and the narrator's internal responses are included.

                "text": "# Simulated Output of generate_literary_segment:\n\nAt nine o'clock, one morning late in July, Gatsby's gorgeous car lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody from its three-noted horn. It was the first time he had called on me, though I had gone to two of his parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation, made frequent use of his beach.\n\n\"Good morning, old sport. You're having lunch with me today. And I thought we'd ride up together.\"\n\nHe was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American—that comes, I suppose, with the absence of lifting work or rigid sitting in youth and, even more, with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games. This quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.\n\nHe saw me looking with admiration at his car.\n\n\"It's pretty, isn't it, old sport?\" He jumped off to give me a better view. \"Haven't you ever seen it before?\"\n\nI'd seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream color, bright with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hat-boxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and terraced with a labyrinth of wind-shields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory, we started to town.\n\nI had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and found, to my disappointment, that he had little to say. So my first impression of him—that he was a person of some undefined consequence—had gradually faded, and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate roadhouse next door.\n\nAnd then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn't reached West Egg village before he began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-colored suit.\n\n\"Look here, old sport,\" he broke out surprisingly, \"what's your opinion of me, anyhow?\"\n\nA little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that question deserves.\n\n\"Well, I'm going to tell you something about my life,\" he interrupted. \"I don't want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear.\"\n\nSo he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavored conversation in his halls.\n\n\"I'll tell you God's truth.\" His right hand suddenly ordered divine retribution to stand by. \"I am the son of some wealthy people in the Middle West—all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford, because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It is a family tradition.\"\n\nHe looked at me sideways—and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was lying. He hurried the phrase \"educated at Oxford,\" or swallowed it, or choked on it, as though it had bothered him before. And with this doubt, his whole statement fell to pieces, and I wondered if there wasn't something a little sinister about him, after all.\n\n\"What part of the Middle West?\" I inquired casually.\n\n\"San Francisco.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\n\"My family all died and I came into a good deal of money.\"\n\nHis voice was solemn, as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan still haunted him.

I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace on the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with their crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart.\n“I’m going to make a big request of you today,” he said, pocketing his souvenirs with satisfaction, “so I thought you ought to know something about me. I didn’t want you to think I was just some nobody. You see, I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad things that happened to me.” He hesitated. “You’ll hear about it this afternoon.”\n“At lunch?”\n“No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you’re taking Miss Baker to tea.”\n“Do you mean you’re in love with Miss Baker?”\n“No, old sport, I’m not. But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak to you about this matter.”\nI hadn’t the faintest idea what “this matter” was, but I was more annoyed than interested. I hadn’t asked Jordan to tea in order to discuss Mr. Jay Gatsby. I was sure the request would be something utterly fantastic, and for a moment I was sorry I’d ever set foot upon his overpopulated lawn.\nHe wouldn’t say another word. His correctness grew on him as we neared the city. We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of red-belted oceangoing ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark, undeserted saloons of the faded-gilt nineteen-hundreds. Then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a glimpse of Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting vitality as we went by.\nWith fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half Astoria—only half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevated I heard the familiar “jug-jug-spat!” of a motorcycle, and a frantic policeman rode alongside.\n“All right, old sport,” called Gatsby. We slowed down. Taking a white card from his wallet, he waved it before the man’s eyes.\n“Right you are,” agreed the policeman, tipping his cap. “Know you next time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse me!”\n“What was that?” I inquired. “The picture of Oxford?”\n“I was able to do the commissioner a favour once, and he sends me a Christmas card every year.”\nOver the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of nonolfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.\nA dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two carriages with drawn blinds, and by more cheerful carriages for friends. The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short upper lips of southeastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of Gatsby’s splendid car was included in their sombre holiday. As we crossed Blackwell’s Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white chauffeur, in which sat three modish negroes, two bucks and a girl. I laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in haughty rivalry.\n“Anything can happen now that we’ve slid over this bridge,” I thought; “anything at all…”\nEven Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.",

Blinking away the brightness of the street outside, my eyes picked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.\n“Mr. Carraway, this is my friend Mr. Wolfshiem.”\nA small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half-darkness.\n“—So I took one look at him,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, shaking my hand earnestly, “and what do you think I did?”\n“What?” I inquired politely.\nBut evidently he was not addressing me, for he dropped my hand and covered Gatsby with his expressive nose.\n“I handed the money to Katspaugh and I said: ‘All right, Katspaugh, don’t pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.’ He shut it then and there.”\nGatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the restaurant, whereupon Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was starting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction.\n“Highballs?” asked the head waiter.\n“This is a nice restaurant here,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, looking at the presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. “But I like across the street better!”\n“Yes, highballs,” agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfshiem: “It’s too hot over there.”\n“Hot and small—yes,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “but full of memories.”\n“What place is that?” I asked.\n“The old Metropole.”\n“The old Metropole,” brooded Mr. Wolfshiem gloomily. “Filled with faces dead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I can’t forget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. It was six of us at the table, and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening. When it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a funny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside. ‘All right,’ says Rosy, and begins to get up, and I pulled him down in his chair.\n“ ‘Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don’t you, so help me, move outside this room.’\n“It was four o’clock in the morning then, and if we’d of raised the blinds we’d of seen daylight.”\n“Did he go?” I asked innocently.\n“Sure he went.” Mr. Wolfshiem’s nose flashed at me indignantly. “He turned around in the door and says: ‘Don’t let that waiter take away my coffee!’ Then he went out on the sidewalk, and they shot him three times in his full belly and drove away.”\n“Four of them were electrocuted,” I said, remembering.\n“Five, with Becker.” His nostrils turned to me in an interested way. “I understand you’re looking for a business gonnegtion.”\nThe juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered for me:\n“Oh, no,” he exclaimed, “this isn’t the man.”\n“No?” Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed.\n“This is just a friend. I told you we’d talk about that some other time.”\n“I beg your pardon,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “I had a wrong man.”\nA succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting the more sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with ferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around the room—he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly behind.

Why has it all got to come through Miss Baker?”\n“Oh, it’s nothing underhand,” he assured me. “Miss Baker’s a great sportswoman, you know, and she’d never do anything that wasn’t all right.”\nSuddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up, and hurried from the room, leaving me with Mr. Wolfshiem at the table.\n“He has to telephone,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, following him with his eyes. “Fine fellow, isn’t he? Handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman.”\n“Yes.”\n“He’s an Oggsford man.”\n“Oh!”\n“He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?”\n“I’ve heard of it.”\n“It’s one of the most famous colleges in the world.”\n“Have you known Gatsby for a long time?” I inquired.\n“Several years,” he answered in a gratified way. “I made the pleasure of his acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a man of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to myself: ‘There’s the kind of man you’d like to take home and introduce to your mother and sister.’ ” He paused. “I see you’re looking at my cuff buttons.”\nI hadn’t been looking at them, but I did now. They were composed of oddly familiar pieces of ivory.\n“Finest specimens of human molars,” he informed me.\n“Well!” I inspected them. “That’s a very interesting idea.”\n“Yeah.” He flipped his sleeves up under his coat. “Yeah, Gatsby’s very careful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend’s wife.”\nWhen the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat down Mr. Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet.\n“I have enjoyed my lunch,” he said, “and I’m going to run off from you two young men before I outstay my welcome.”\n“Don’t hurry Meyer,” said Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfshiem raised his hand in a sort of benediction.\n“You’re very polite, but I belong to another generation,” he announced solemnly. “You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and your—” He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his hand. “As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won’t impose myself on you any longer.”\nAs he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling. I wondered if I had said anything to offend him.\n“He becomes very sentimental sometimes,” explained Gatsby. “This is one of his sentimental days. He’s quite a character around New York—a denizen of Broadway.”\n“Who is he, anyhow, an actor?”\n“No.”\n“A dentist?”\n“Meyer Wolfshiem? No, he’s a gambler.” Gatsby hesitated, then added, coolly: “He’s the man who fixed the World’s Series back in 1919.”\n“Fixed the World’s Series?” I repeated.\nThe idea staggered me. I remembered, of course, that the World’s Series had been fixed in 1919, but if I had thought of it at all I would have thought of it as a thing that merely happened, the end of some inevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million people—with the single-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe.\n“How did he happen to do that?” I asked after a minute.\n“He just saw the opportunity.”\n“Why isn’t he in jail?”\n“They can’t get him, old sport. He’s a smart man.”\nI insisted on paying the check. As the waiter brought my change I caught sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room.\n“Come along with me for a minute,” I said; “I’ve got to say hello to someone.”\nWhen he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our direction.\n“Where’ve you been?” he demanded eagerly. “Daisy’s furious because you haven’t called up.”\n“This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.”\nThey shook hands briefly, and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over Gatsby’s face.\n“How’ve you been, anyhow?” demanded Tom of me. “How’d you happen to come up this far to eat?”\n“I’ve been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.”\nI turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there.",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the final segment of the passage, specifically the encounter with Tom Buchanan and the subsequent brief interaction between Tom, Gatsby, and the narrator. This is a significant omission, as it concludes the scene and provides important character dynamics.\n- There is a minor invented detail early on: Gatsby is described as giving a small sign that he would be back, which is not present in the original. Additionally, the description of Wolfshiem looking at Gatsby's empty chair with reverence is an embellishment not found in the source.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the narrator's insistence on paying the check or the moment when the narrator spots Tom Buchanan across the room. These are key transitional details leading to the next interaction.\n- The sequence where Tom approaches, expresses concern about Daisy, and is introduced to Gatsby is missing. The brief handshake and Gatsby's reaction are also absent.\n- The narrator's attempt to turn to Gatsby, only to find him gone, is not present, which is an important closing moment for the passage.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- There is a slight inaccuracy in the sequence of events: the completion suggests Gatsby returns to the table before Wolfshiem leaves, whereas in the original, Gatsby's return and Wolfshiem's departure are more closely linked.\n- The completion introduces a minor invented action with Gatsby giving a sign he would be back, and Wolfshiem's reverent look at the empty chair, which are not in the original.\n- The transition between Gatsby's departure and Wolfshiem's comments is altered, affecting the flow and timing of the conversation.\n\nTo improve, ensure all major events and transitions from the original are included, avoid adding invented gestures or emotional responses not present in the source, and maintain the correct sequence and structure of interactions, especially in the closing section of the passage."

Why has it all got to come through Miss Baker?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's nothing underhand,\" he assured me. \"Miss Baker's a great sportswoman, you know, and she'd never do anything that wasn't all right.\"\n\nSuddenly he looked at his watch, excused himself, and hurried from the table, leaving me alone with Mr. Wolfshiem.\n\n\"He has to telephone,\" said Wolfshiem, following him with his eyes. \"Fine fellow, isn't he? Handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"He's an Oggsford man.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?\"\n\n\"I've heard of it.\"\n\n\"It's one of the most famous colleges in the world.\"\n\n\"Have you known Gatsby for a long time?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Several years,\" he answered in a gratified way. \"I made the pleasure of his acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a man of fine breeding. I said to myself: 'There's the kind of man you'd like to take home and introduce to your mother and sister.'\" He paused. \"I see you're looking at my cuff buttons.\"\n\nI hadn't been looking at them, but I did now. They were composed of oddly familiar pieces of ivory.\n\n\"Finest specimens of human molars,\" he informed me.\n\n\"Well!\" I inspected them with interest. \"That's a very interesting idea.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" He flipped his sleeves up. \"Gatsby's very careful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend's wife.\"\n\nWhen Gatsby returned a moment later, Wolfshiem drained his cup and got to his feet.\n\n\"I have enjoyed my lunch,\" he said, \"and I'm going to run off from you two young men before I outstay my welcome.\"\n\n\"Don't hurry, Meyer,\" said Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Wolfshiem raised his hand in a sort of benediction.\n\n\"You're very polite, but I belong to another generation,\" he announced solemnly. \"You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and your—\" He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his hand. \"As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won't impose myself on you any longer.\"\n\nAs he shook my hand and turned away his tragic nose was trembling. I wondered if I had said anything to offend him.\n\n\"He becomes very sentimental sometimes,\" explained Gatsby. \"This is one of his sentimental days. He's quite a character around New York—a denizen of Broadway.\"\n\n\"Who is he, anyhow, an actor?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"A dentist?\"\n\n\"Meyer Wolfshiem? No, he's a gambler.\" Gatsby hesitated, then added coolly: \"He's the man who fixed the World's Series back in 1919.\"\n\n\"Fixed the World's Series?\" I repeated.\n\nThe idea staggered me. I remembered, of course, that the World's Series had been fixed in 1919, but if I had thought of it at all I would have thought of it as a thing that merely happened, the end of some inevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million people—with the single-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe.\n\n\"How did he happen to do that?\" I asked after a minute.\n\n\"He just saw the opportunity.\"\n\n\"Why isn't he in jail?\"\n\n\"They can't get him, old sport. He's a smart man.\"\n\nI insisted on paying the check. As the waiter brought me the change I caught sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room.\n\n\"Come along with me for a minute,\" I said. \"I've got to say hello to someone.\"\n\nWhen he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our direction.\n\n\"Where've you been?\" he demanded eagerly. \"Daisy's furious because you haven't called up.\"\n\n\"This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.\"\n\nThey shook hands briefly, and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over Gatsby's face.\n\n\"How've you been, anyhow?\" demanded Tom of me. \"How'd you happen to come up this far to eat?\"\n\n\"I've been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.\"\n\nI turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there.",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion generally follows the structure of the original, but it omits some subtle transitions and narrative asides that help clarify the flow of conversation and the shifting focus between characters. There is also a lack of internal narration or reflection from the narrator at certain points, which are present in the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion does not include the narrator's internal resistance to Gatsby's smile, which is a notable emotional detail.\n- The completion omits the narrator's realization about Wolfshiem's cuff buttons being made of a specific material before Wolfshiem explains it, missing a step in the observation process.\n- The completion lacks the narrator's brief internal speculation about whether he had offended Wolfshiem as Wolfshiem departs.\n- There is a missing reflection from the narrator about the impact of the revelation regarding the fixed sporting event, specifically the sense of disbelief and the metaphor used to describe the act.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- In the middle section, the completion slightly alters the sequence of Wolfshiem's comments about Gatsby's character and the college he attended, which may affect the flow of the conversation.\n- The completion sometimes condenses or paraphrases dialogue, which can lead to subtle shifts in tone or emphasis compared to the original.\n- The ending omits the narrator's specific action of turning toward Gatsby and finding him gone, which is a key narrative beat.\n\nTo improve, ensure all narrative asides, internal reflections, and the precise sequence of conversational exchanges are included, and avoid condensing or rephrasing dialogue in ways that alter the original's tone or structure."

          "text_segment": "One October day in nineteen-seventeen—\n(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)\n—I was walking along from one place to another, half on the sidewalks and half on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on shoes from England with rubber knobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground. I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind, and whenever this happened the red, white, and blue banners in front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tut-tut-tut-tut, in a disapproving way.\nThe largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to Daisy Fay’s house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She dressed in white, and had a little white roadster, and all day long the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night. “Anyways, for an hour!”\nWhen I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside the kerb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen before. They were so engrossed in each other that she didn’t see me until I was five feet away.\n“Hello, Jordan,” she called unexpectedly. “Please come here.”\nI was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older girls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross to make bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she couldn’t come that day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since. His name was Jay Gatsby, and I didn’t lay eyes on him again for over four years—even after I’d met him on Long Island I didn’t realize it was the same man.\nThat was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a few beaux myself, and I began to play in tournaments, so I didn’t see Daisy very often. She went with a slightly older crowd—when she went with anyone at all. Wild rumours were circulating about her—how her mother had found her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas. She was effectually prevented, but she wasn’t on speaking terms with her family for several weeks. After that she didn’t play around with the soldiers any more, but only with a few flat-footed, shortsighted young men in town, who couldn’t get into the army at all.\nBy the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a début after the armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a man from New Orleans. In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago, with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He came down with a hundred people in four private cars, and hired a whole floor of the Muhlbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\nI was a bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in her flowered dress—and as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottle of Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.\n“ ’Gratulate me,” she muttered. “Never had a drink before, but oh how I do enjoy it.”\n“What’s the matter, Daisy?”\nI was scared, I can tell you; I’d never seen a girl like that before.\n“Here, dearies.” She groped around in a wastebasket she had with her on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls. “Take ’em downstairs and give ’em back to whoever they belong to. Tell ’em all Daisy’s change’ her mine. Say: ‘Daisy’s change’ her mine!’ ”\nShe began to cry—she cried and cried. I rushed out and found her mother’s maid, and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath. She wouldn’t let go of the letter. She took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up in a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the soap-dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.\nBut she didn’t say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress, and half an hour later, when we walked out of the room, the pearls were around her neck and the incident was over. Next day at five o’clock she married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver, and started off on a three months’ trip to the South Seas.",

After you had gone home, she came into my room and woke me up, and said: \"What Gatsby?\" and when I described him—I was half asleep—she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know.

The pieces were finally coming together—their shared history in Louisville, the young officer Gatsby who had fallen desperately in love with the beautiful debutante, and the five years he had spent trying to recreate himself into someone worthy of her world.\n\n\"So that's why he bought that house in West Egg,\" I said, almost to myself. \"To be near her.\"\n\nJordan nodded, her profile sharp against the fading light. \"He's been throwing those parties hoping she'd wander in some night.\"\n\nI thought about all those lavish gatherings, the orchestras, the flowing champagne, the hundreds of guests—all for the chance that Daisy might appear at his door. It seemed both romantic and terribly sad.\n\n\"It's incredible,\" I said. \"He's spent five years dreaming of this moment.\"\n\n\"Some people pursue their dreams,\" Jordan replied with characteristic detachment. \"Others just talk about them.\"\n\nThe carriage rolled past a small lake where a few boats still drifted lazily. Couples strolled along the pathways, and children chased each other across patches of grass. Normal lives unfolding while elsewhere, great passions burned.\n\n\"And Daisy never knew he was so close?\"\n\n\"Not until you mentioned his name at lunch. That's why she looked so strange.\"\n\nI remembered Daisy's face that day, the sudden shock that had passed across it. I had unwittingly set something in motion, becoming an accidental catalyst in their story.\n\n\"Gatsby wants me to invite her to tea,\" I said. \"He wants me to help them meet again.\"\n\nJordan turned to look at me, her eyes calculating. \"And will you?\"\n\nThe carriage continued its leisurely pace through the park as I considered my role in this unfolding drama. Ahead of us, the lights of the city were beginning to twinkle against the darkening sky, much like the light at the end of Gatsby's dock had twinkled with promise across the bay toward Daisy's house.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said finally. \"I suppose I will.\""

Two o’clock and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light, which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a corner, I saw that it was Gatsby’s house, lit from tower to cellar.\nAt first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved itself into “hide-and-go-seek” or “sardines-in-the-box” with all the house thrown open to the game. But there wasn’t a sound. Only wind in the trees, which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned away I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.\n“Your place looks like the World’s Fair,” I said.\n“Does it?” He turned his eyes toward it absently. “I have been glancing into some of the rooms. Let’s go to Coney Island, old sport. In my car.”\n“It’s too late.”\n“Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven’t made use of it all summer.”\n“I’ve got to go to bed.”\n“All right.”\nHe waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.\n“I talked with Miss Baker,” I said after a moment. “I’m going to call up Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea.”\n“Oh, that’s all right,” he said carelessly. “I don’t want to put you to any trouble.”\n“What day would suit you?”\n“What day would suit you?” he corrected me quickly. “I don’t want to put you to any trouble, you see.”\n“How about the day after tomorrow?”\nHe considered for a moment. Then, with reluctance: “I want to get the grass cut,” he said.\nWe both looked down at the grass—there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began. I suspected that he meant my grass.\n“There’s another little thing,” he said uncertainly, and hesitated.\n“Would you rather put it off for a few days?” I asked.\n“Oh, it isn’t about that. At least—” He fumbled with a series of beginnings. “Why, I thought—why, look here, old sport, you don’t make much money, do you?”\n“Not very much.”\nThis seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently.\n“I thought you didn’t, if you’ll pardon my—you see, I carry on a little business on the side, a sort of side line, you understand. And I thought that if you don’t make very much—You’re selling bonds, aren’t you, old sport?”\n“Trying to.”\n“Well, this would interest you. It wouldn’t take up much of your time and you might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing.”\nI realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might have been one of the crises of my life. But, because the offer was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no choice except to cut him off there.\n“I’ve got my hands full,” I said. “I’m much obliged but I couldn’t take on any more work.”\n“You wouldn’t have to do any business with Wolfshiem.” Evidently he thought that I was shying away from the “gonnegtion” mentioned at lunch, but I assured him he was wrong. He waited a moment longer, hoping I’d begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he went unwillingly home.\nThe evening had made me lightheaded and happy; I think I walked into a deep sleep as I entered my front door. So I don’t know whether or not Gatsby went to Coney Island, or for how many hours he “glanced into rooms” while his house blazed gaudily on.",

After staring at the silver shirt with fascinated eyes he led me aside.\n\n\"She's coming,\" he said. \"She's coming.\"\n\nHe looked at his watch as if there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere.\n\n\"I think she'll be here in a minute.\"\n\nSomething in his tense, expectant manner made me uneasy.\n\n\"Don't be nervous,\" I said. \"It's just past four.\"\n\n\"I'm not nervous,\" he insisted. \"I'm just—\" He broke off and began to walk up and down the room, looking with revulsion at the furniture. \"This is a terrible mistake,\" he said, shaking his head. \"A terrible, terrible mistake.\"\n\n\"You're just embarrassed, that's all,\" and luckily the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his head, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers and set it back in place.

At eleven o'clock a man in a raincoat, dragging a lawn-mower, tapped at my front door and said that Mr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass. This reminded me that I had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back, so I drove into West Egg Village to search for her among soggy white-washed alleys and to buy some cups and lemons and flowers.\n\nThe flowers were unnecessary, for at two o'clock a greenhouse arrived from Gatsby's, with innumerable receptacles to contain it. An hour later the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby, in a white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold-colored tie, hurried in. He was pale, and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes.\n\n\"Is everything all right?\" he asked immediately.\n\n\"The grass looks fine, if that's what you mean.\"\n\n\"What grass?\" he inquired blankly. \"Oh, the grass in the yard.\" He looked out the window at it, but, judging from his expression, I don't believe he saw a thing.\n\n\"It looks very good,\" he remarked vaguely. \"One of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four. I think it was the Journal. Have you got everything you need in the shape of—of tea?\"\n\nI took him into the pantry, where he looked a little reproachfully at the Finn. Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen shop.\n\n\"Will they do?\" I asked.\n\n\"Of course, of course! They're fine!\" and he added hollowly, \"...old sport.\"\n\nThe rain cooled down to a damp mist, through which occasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyes through a copy of Clay's Economics, starting at the Finnish tread that shook the kitchen floor, and peering toward the bleared windows from time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking place outside. Finally he got up and informed me, in an uncertain voice, that he was going home.\n\n\"Why's that?\"\n\n\"Nobody's coming to tea. It's too late!\" He looked at his watch as if there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere. \"I can't wait all day.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly; it's just two minutes to four.\"\n```",

Gatsby got himself into a shadow and, while Daisy and I talked, looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with tense, unhappy eyes. However, as calmness wasn’t an end in itself, I made an excuse at the first possible moment, and got to my feet.\n“Where are you going?” demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm.\n“I’ll be back.”\n“I’ve got to speak to you about something before you go.”\nHe followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door, and whispered: “Oh, God!” in a miserable way.\n“What’s the matter?”\n“This is a terrible mistake,” he said, shaking his head from side to side, “a terrible, terrible mistake.”\n“You’re just embarrassed, that’s all,” and luckily I added: “Daisy’s embarrassed too.”\n“She’s embarrassed?” he repeated incredulously.\n“Just as much as you are.”\n“Don’t talk so loud.”\n“You’re acting like a little boy,” I broke out impatiently. “Not only that, but you’re rude. Daisy’s sitting in there all alone.”\nHe raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable reproach, and, opening the door cautiously, went back into the other room.\nI walked out the back way—just as Gatsby had when he had made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour before—and ran for a huge black knotted tree, whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain. Once more it was pouring, and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by Gatsby’s gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric marshes. There was nothing to look at from under the tree except Gatsby’s enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church steeple, for half an hour. A brewer had built it early in the “period” craze, a decade before, and there was a story that he’d agreed to pay five years’ taxes on all the neighbouring cottages if the owners would have their roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their refusal took the heart out of his plan to Found a Family—he went into an immediate decline. His children sold his house with the black wreath still on the door. Americans, while willing, even eager, to be serfs, have always been obstinate about being peasantry.\nAfter half an hour, the sun shone again, and the grocer’s automobile rounded Gatsby’s drive with the raw material for his servants’ dinner—I felt sure he wouldn’t eat a spoonful. A maid began opening the upper windows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and, leaning from the large central bay, spat meditatively into the garden. It was time I went back. While the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and swelling a little now and then with gusts of emotion. But in the new silence I felt that silence had fallen within the house too.\nI went in—after making every possible noise in the kitchen, short of pushing over the stove—but I don’t believe they heard a sound. They were sitting at either end of the couch, looking at each other as if some question had been asked, or was in the air, and every vestige of embarrassment was gone. Daisy’s face was smeared with tears, and when I came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before a mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply confounding. He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little room.\n“Oh, hello, old sport,” he said, as if he hadn’t seen me for years. I thought for a moment he was going to shake hands.\n“It’s stopped raining.”\n“Has it?” When he realized what I was talking about, that there were twinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man, like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to Daisy. “What do you think of that? It’s stopped raining.”\n“I’m glad, Jay.” Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told only of her unexpected joy.\n“I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,” he said, “I’d like to show her around.”\n“You’re sure you want me to come?”\n“Absolutely, old sport.”",

His eyes followed me anxiously as I moved toward the hall.\n\nHe came after me, closing the door to the living room behind him. \"This is a terrible mistake,\" he whispered, his face pale. \"A terrible, terrible mistake.\"\n\n\"You're just embarrassed,\" I assured him. \"Daisy's embarrassed too.\"\n\n\"She's embarrassed?\" he repeated incredulously.\n\nI grew impatient. \"You're acting like a little boy,\" I told him. \"Not only that, but you're rude.

The appearance of the tea gave us something to do, and I was grateful for the diversion. Gatsby, with a strained look on his face, retreated to a corner of the living room, half hidden in shadow, while Daisy and I talked.\n\nAfter a few minutes, I felt superfluous. \"I've got to go away a while,\" I announced.\n\n\"Don't go,\" Gatsby cried, his voice betraying sudden alarm. His eyes followed me anxiously as I moved toward the hall.\n\nHe came after me, closing the door to the living room behind him. \"This is a terrible mistake,\" he whispered, his face pale. \"A terrible, terrible mistake.\"\n\n\"You're just embarrassed,\" I assured him. \"Daisy's embarrassed too.\"\n\n\"She's embarrassed?\" he repeated incredulously.\n\nI grew impatient. \"You're acting like a little boy,\" I told him. \"Not only that, but you're rude. Daisy's sitting in there alone.\"\n\nHe raised his hand to protest, gave me a reproachful look, then opened the door and went back into the living room with a certain dignified consciousness of his host duties.\n\nI slipped out the back way and ran for a huge black knotted tree whose massed leaves made an umbrella against the rain. The rain continued to fall, and I stood there watching Gatsby's enormous house.

But I’m not in either one now.” He looked at me with more attention. “Do you mean you’ve been thinking over what I proposed the other night?”\nBefore I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight.\n“That huge place there?” she cried pointing.\n“Do you like it?”\n“I love it, but I don’t see how you live there all alone.”\n“I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People who do interesting things. Celebrated people.”\nInstead of taking the shortcut along the Sound we went down to the road and entered by the big postern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the gardens, the sparkling odour of jonquils and the frothy odour of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odour of kiss-me-at-the-gate. It was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but bird voices in the trees.\nAnd inside, as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music-rooms and Restoration Salons, I felt that there were guests concealed behind every couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through. As Gatsby closed the door of “the Merton College Library” I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into ghostly laughter.\nWe went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing-rooms and poolrooms, and bathrooms with sunken baths—intruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pyjamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. It was Mr. Klipspringer, the “boarder.” I had seen him wandering hungrily about the beach that morning. Finally we came to Gatsby’s own apartment, a bedroom and a bath, and an Adam’s study, where we sat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall.\nHe hadn’t once ceased looking at Daisy, and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes. Sometimes too, he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way, as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer real. Once he nearly toppled down a flight of stairs.\nHis bedroom was the simplest room of all—except where the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush with delight, and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and began to laugh.\n“It’s the funniest thing, old sport,” he said hilariously. “I can’t—When I try to—”\nHe had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third.

Now, in the reaction, he was running down like an over-wound clock.\nRecovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and his shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high.\n“I’ve got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.”\nHe took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one, before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel, which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in many-coloured disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher—shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange, with monograms of indian blue. Suddenly, with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily.\n“They’re such beautiful shirts,” she sobbed, her voice muffled in the thick folds. “It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such—such beautiful shirts before.”",

Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star to the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one.\nI began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects in the half darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.\n“Who’s this?”\n“That? That’s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.”\nThe name sounded faintly familiar.\n“He’s dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.”\nThere was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the bureau—Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly—taken apparently when he was about eighteen.\n“I adore it,” exclaimed Daisy. “The pompadour! You never told me you had a pompadour—or a yacht.”\n“Look at this,” said Gatsby quickly. “Here’s a lot of clippings—about you.”\nThey stood side by side examining it. I was going to ask to see the rubies when the phone rang, and Gatsby took up the receiver.\n“Yes… Well, I can’t talk now… I can’t talk now, old sport… I said a small town… He must know what a small town is… Well, he’s no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small town…”\nHe rang off.\n“Come here quick!” cried Daisy at the window.\nThe rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west, and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.\n“Look at that,” she whispered, and then after a moment: “I’d like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around.”\nI tried to go then, but they wouldn’t hear of it; perhaps my presence made them feel more satisfactorily alone.\n“I know what we’ll do,” said Gatsby, “we’ll have Klipspringer play the piano.”\nHe went out of the room calling “Ewing!” and returned in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man, with shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blond hair. He was now decently clothed in a “sport shirt,” open at the neck, sneakers, and duck trousers of a nebulous hue.\n“Did we interrupt your exercise?” inquired Daisy politely.\n“I was asleep,” cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment. “That is, I’d been asleep. Then I got up…”\n“Klipspringer plays the piano,” said Gatsby, cutting him off. “Don’t you, Ewing, old sport?”\n“I don’t play well. I don’t—hardly play at all. I’m all out of prac—”\n“We’ll go downstairs,” interrupted Gatsby. He flipped a switch. The grey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light.\nIn the music-room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano. He lit Daisy’s cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her on a couch far across the room, where there was no light save what the gleaming floor bounced in from the hall.\nWhen Klipspringer had played “The Love Nest” he turned around on the bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.\n“I’m all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldn’t play. I’m all out of prac—”\n“Don’t talk so much, old sport,” commanded Gatsby. “Play!”\n“In the morning,\nIn the evening,\nAin’t we got fun—”\nOutside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the Sound. All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric trains, men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New York. It was the hour of a profound human change, and excitement was generating on the air.\n“One thing’s sure and nothing’s surer\nThe rich get richer and the poor get—children.\nIn the meantime,\nIn between time—”\nAs I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of bewilderment had come back into Gatsby’s face, as though a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness. Almost five years! There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams—not through her own fault, but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man can store up in his ghostly heart.\nAs I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand took hold of hers, and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion. I think that voice held him most, with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because it couldn’t be over-dreamed—that voice was a deathless song.\nThey had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand; Gatsby didn’t know me now at all. I looked once more at them and they looked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life. Then I went out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them there together.",

The rain had stopped and the sun was setting.\n\n\"Look at that,\" said Daisy, pointing. \"I'd like to just put you in one of those pink clouds and push you around.\"\n\nI tried to go then, but they wouldn't hear of it; perhaps my presence made them feel more satisfactorily alone.\n\n\"I know what we'll do,\" said Gatsby, \"we'll have Klipspringer play the piano.\"\n\nHe went out of the room calling \"Ewing!\" and returned in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man with shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blond hair.

This includes Cody's background, his wealth, the influence of Ella Kaye, and the circumstances leading to his meeting with James Gatz. This is a significant omission, as it removes a key transition and character introduction.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion is missing the detailed description of Dan Cody's origins, his age, and his history in various mining rushes.\n- There is no mention of the financial transactions that made Cody wealthy, nor the physical and mental state he was in at the time.\n- The role of Ella Kaye and her relationship to Cody is not included.\n- The completion does not cover the public knowledge of Cody's affairs as reported in journalism of the time.\n- The specific event of Cody's yacht arriving and its significance to James Gatz is absent.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is incomplete, ending abruptly after the protagonist returns to Lake Superior, rather than continuing to the next major development.\n- There are no invented scenes or perspectives, but the lack of the latter portion of the passage disrupts the intended narrative flow and leaves out essential context for the character's transformation."

It was indirectly due to Cody that Gatsby drank so little. Sometimes in the course of gay parties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he formed the habit of letting liquor alone.\n\nAnd it was from Cody that he inherited money—a legacy of twenty-five thousand dollars. He didn't get it. He never understood the legal device that was used against him, but what remained of the millions went intact to Ella Kaye. He was left with his singularly appropriate education; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the substantiality of a man.\n\nHe told me all this very much later, but I've put it down here with the idea of exploding those first wild rumors about his antecedents, which weren't even faintly true. Moreover he told it to me at a time of confusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and nothing about him. So I take advantage of this short halt, while Gatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of misconceptions away.",

For several weeks I didn’t see him or hear his voice on the phone—mostly I was in New York, trotting around with Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile aunt—but finally I went over to his house one Sunday afternoon. I hadn’t been there two minutes when somebody brought Tom Buchanan in for a drink. I was startled, naturally, but the really surprising thing was that it hadn’t happened before.\nThey were a party of three on horseback—Tom and a man named Sloane and a pretty woman in a brown riding-habit, who had been there previously.\n“I’m delighted to see you,” said Gatsby, standing on his porch. “I’m delighted that you dropped in.”\nAs though they cared!\n“Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar.” He walked around the room quickly, ringing bells. “I’ll have something to drink for you in just a minute.”\nHe was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there. But he would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in a vague way that that was all they came for. Mr. Sloane wanted nothing. A lemonade? No, thanks. A little champagne? Nothing at all, thanks… I’m sorry—\n“Did you have a nice ride?”\n“Very good roads around here.”\n“I suppose the automobiles—”\n“Yeah.”\nMoved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom, who had accepted the introduction as a stranger.\n“I believe we’ve met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan.”\n“Oh, yes,” said Tom, gruffly polite, but obviously not remembering. “So we did. I remember very well.”\n“About two weeks ago.”\n“That’s right. You were with Nick here.”\n“I know your wife,” continued Gatsby, almost aggressively.\n“That so?”\nTom turned to me.\n“You live near here, Nick?”\n“Next door.”\n“That so?”\nMr. Sloane didn’t enter into the conversation, but lounged back haughtily in his chair; the woman said nothing either—until unexpectedly, after two highballs, she became cordial.\n“We’ll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby,” she suggested. “What do you say?”\n“Certainly; I’d be delighted to have you.”\n“Be ver’ nice,” said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. “Well—think ought to be starting home.”\n“Please don’t hurry,” Gatsby urged them. He had control of himself now, and he wanted to see more of Tom. “Why don’t you—why don’t you stay for supper? I wouldn’t be surprised if some other people dropped in from New York.”\n“You come to supper with me,” said the lady enthusiastically. “Both of you.”\nThis included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.\n“Come along,” he said—but to her only.\n“I mean it,” she insisted. “I’d love to have you. Lots of room.”\nGatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go and he didn’t see that Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn’t.\n“I’m afraid I won’t be able to,” I said.\n“Well, you come,” she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.\nMr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear.\n“We won’t be late if we start now,” she insisted aloud.\n“I haven’t got a horse,” said Gatsby. “I used to ride in the army, but I’ve never bought a horse. I’ll have to follow you in my car. Excuse me for just a minute.”\nThe rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady began an impassioned conversation aside.\n“My God, I believe the man’s coming,” said Tom. “Doesn’t he know she doesn’t want him?”\n“She says she does want him.”\n“She has a big dinner party and he won’t know a soul there.” He frowned. “I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may be old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to suit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish.”\nSuddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted their horses.\n“Come on,” said Mr. Sloane to Tom, “we’re late. We’ve got to go.” And then to me: “Tell him we couldn’t wait, will you?”\nTom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod, and they trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August foliage just as Gatsby, with hat and light overcoat in hand, came out the front door.",

Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness—it stands out in my memory from Gatsby’s other parties that summer. There were the same people, or at least the same sort of people, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-coloured, many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that hadn’t been there before. Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world complete in itself, with its own standards and its own great figures, second to nothing because it had no consciousness of being so, and now I was looking at it again, through Daisy’s eyes. It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment.\nThey arrived at twilight, and, as we strolled out among the sparkling hundreds, Daisy’s voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat.\n“These things excite me so,” she whispered. “If you want to kiss me any time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I’ll be glad to arrange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green card. I’m giving out green—”\n“Look around,” suggested Gatsby.\n“I’m looking around. I’m having a marvellous—”\n“You must see the faces of many people you’ve heard about.”\nTom’s arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.\n“We don’t go around very much,” he said; “in fact, I was just thinking I don’t know a soul here.”\n“Perhaps you know that lady.” Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white-plum tree. Tom and Daisy stared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies.\n“She’s lovely,” said Daisy.\n“The man bending over her is her director.”\nHe took them ceremoniously from group to group:\n“Mrs. Buchanan… and Mr. Buchanan—” After an instant’s hesitation he added: “the polo player.”\n“Oh no,” objected Tom quickly, “not me.”\nBut evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained “the polo player” for the rest of the evening.\n“I’ve never met so many celebrities,” Daisy exclaimed. “I liked that man—what was his name?—with the sort of blue nose.”\nGatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer.\n“Well, I liked him anyhow.”\n“I’d a little rather not be the polo player,” said Tom pleasantly, “I’d rather look at all these famous people in—in oblivion.”\nDaisy and Gatsby danced. I remember being surprised by his graceful, conservative foxtrot—I had never seen him dance before. Then they sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour, while at her request I remained watchfully in the garden. “In case there’s a fire or a flood,” she explained, “or any act of God.”\nTom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together. “Do you mind if I eat with some people over here?” he said. “A fellow’s getting off some funny stuff.”\n“Go ahead,” answered Daisy genially, “and if you want to take down any addresses here’s my little gold pencil.”… She looked around after a moment and told me the girl was “common but pretty,” and I knew that except for the half-hour she’d been alone with Gatsby she wasn’t having a good time.",

          "text_segment": "We were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my fault—Gatsby had been called to the phone, and I’d enjoyed these same people only two weeks before. But what had amused me then turned septic on the air now.\n“How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?”\nThe girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my shoulder. At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes.\n“Wha’?”\nA massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf with her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker’s defence:\n“Oh, she’s all right now. When she’s had five or six cocktails she always starts screaming like that. I tell her she ought to leave it alone.”\n“I do leave it alone,” affirmed the accused hollowly.\n“We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: ‘There’s somebody that needs your help, Doc.’ ”\n“She’s much obliged, I’m sure,” said another friend, without gratitude, “but you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool.”\n“Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,” mumbled Miss Baedeker. “They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey.”\n“Then you ought to leave it alone,” countered Doctor Civet.\n“Speak for yourself!” cried Miss Baedeker violently. “Your hand shakes. I wouldn’t let you operate on me!”\nIt was like that. Almost the last thing I remember was standing with Daisy and watching the moving-picture director and his Star. They were still under the white-plum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale, thin ray of moonlight between. It occurred to me that he had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this proximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate degree and kiss at her cheek.\n“I like her,” said Daisy, “I think she’s lovely.”\nBut the rest offended her—and inarguably because it wasn’t a gesture but an emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented “place” that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village—appalled by its raw vigour that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a shortcut from nothing to nothing. She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand.\nI sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car. It was dark here in front; only the bright door sent ten square feet of light volleying out into the soft black morning. Sometimes a shadow moved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow, an indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an invisible glass.\n“Who is this Gatsby anyhow?” demanded Tom suddenly. “Some big bootlegger?”\n“Where’d you hear that?” I inquired.\n“I didn’t hear it. I imagined it. A lot of these newly rich people are just big bootleggers, you know.”\n“Not Gatsby,” I said shortly.\nHe was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the drive crunched under his feet.\n“Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie together.”\nA breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy’s fur collar.\n“At least they are more interesting than the people we know,” she said with an effort.\n“You didn’t look so interested.”\n“Well, I was.”\nTom laughed and turned to me.\n“Did you notice Daisy’s face when that girl asked her to put her under a cold shower?”\nDaisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper, bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again. When the melody rose her voice broke up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.\n“Lots of people come who haven’t been invited,” she said suddenly. “That girl hadn’t been invited. They simply force their way in and he’s too polite to object.”\n“I’d like to know who he is and what he does,” insisted Tom. “And I think I’ll make a point of finding out.”\n“I can tell you right now,” she answered. “He owned some drugstores, a lot of drugstores. He built them up himself.”\nThe dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive.\n“Good night, Nick,” said Daisy.\nHer glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps, where “Three O’Clock in the Morning,” a neat, sad little waltz of that year, was drifting out the open door. After all, in the very casualness of Gatsby’s party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from her world. What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside? What would happen now in the dim, incalculable hours? Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare and to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with one fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would blot out those five years of unwavering devotion.",

This place - Gatsby's world - with its unrestrained emotions and boisterous energy, deeply unsettled her. She viewed West Egg's vibrant chaos with the same distaste one might reserve for something vulgar or unrefined.

Where'd he get all that money? Some of these newly rich people are just big bootleggers, you know.\"\n\nI dismissed the accusation, but Tom continued his critique of Gatsby's guests. Daisy, surprisingly, came to their defense, claiming they were more interesting than our own social circle, though Tom seemed skeptical of her sincerity.\n\nShe began humming along with the distant music drifting from the house, her complaints about gate-crashers at Gatsby's parties contrasting with her evident fascination with the spectacle.\n\n\"I'll find out what he's up to,\" Tom insisted. \"You can't just build a fortune overnight.\"\n\n\"He owns drugstores,\" Daisy offered quickly. \"Lots of them. He built them himself.\"\n\nAs their limousine pulled up, Daisy bid me goodnight, her gaze lingering on Gatsby's illuminated mansion and the music emanating from it. I stood watching them drive away, contemplating the romantic possibilities that seemed to hover in the air around Gatsby's world - so different from the one Daisy inhabited.\n```\n\nThis simulation attempts to capture the style and content of the scene without directly copying from Fitzgerald's work.

She viewed West Egg's vibrant chaos with the same distaste one might reserve for something vulgar or unrefined. The raw vitality that I found somewhat refreshing seemed to offend her sensibilities.\n\nWhile waiting for our car with Tom, he suddenly announced, \"By the way, I think he's a bootlegger.\"\n\n\"Who?\" I asked, though I knew perfectly well whom he meant.\n\n\"Gatsby. Where'd he get all that money? Some of these newly rich people are just big bootleggers, you know.\"\n\nI dismissed the accusation, but Tom continued his critique of Gatsby's guests. Daisy, surprisingly, came to their defense, claiming they were more interesting than our own social circle, though Tom seemed skeptical of her sincerity.\n\nShe began humming along with the distant music drifting from the house, her complaints about gate-crashers at Gatsby's parties contrasting with her evident fascination with the spectacle.\n\n\"I'll find out what he's up to,\" Tom insisted. \"You can't just build a fortune overnight.\"\n\n\"He owns drugstores,\" Daisy offered quickly. \"Lots of them. He built them himself.\"\n\nAs their limousine pulled up, Daisy bid me goodnight, her gaze lingering on Gatsby's illuminated mansion and the music emanating from it. I stood watching them drive away, contemplating the romantic possibilities that seemed to hover in the air around Gatsby's world - so different from the one Daisy inhabited.\n```\n\nThis simulation attempts to capture the style and content of the scene without directly copying from Fitzgerald's work.

Miss Baedeker was slumped against Doctor Civet's shoulder, her face flushed and eyes half-closed. Someone mentioned she had been pulled from a pool somewhere earlier in the evening.\n\n\"You were,\" insisted a woman in a persistent tone, leaning forward. \"And you kicked and screamed like a banshee.\"\n\nMiss Baedeker raised her head with effort. \"I absolutely did not. I must have been dead,\" she announced with finality, then turned to Doctor Civet. \"Don't you think so?\"\n\n\"You were merely indisposed,\" he offered diplomatically, though his own composure was visibly affected by the champagne.\n\n\"Indisposed!\" echoed Miss Baedeker with indignation. \"There's a polite word for it. Indisposed!\"\n\nThe table erupted in laughter, and I found myself drifting away from their circular conversation. Later, I stood with Daisy on the marble steps leading down from the house. The summer night was drawing to a close, and across the lawn I noticed the moving-picture director with his arm decisively around his star. They were standing beneath a tree, their faces close together as he whispered something that made her laugh softly.\n\n\"I like her,\" said Daisy. \"I think she's lovely.\"\n\nThe director guided his companion toward a small gathering nearby. Through the windows of the house, I could see shadows moving behind the blinds of what must have been a dressing room, silhouettes preparing for some late entertainment.\n\nDaisy's voice pulled me back. \"I'm sorry about the clock,\" she said suddenly.\n\n\"It was an old clock,\" I reassured her.\n\nShe looked around, taking in the grounds, the house, the scattered groups of guests. Her expression changed subtly.\n\n\"I don't like this place,\" she confided. \"There's something—unpleasant about it. All these people they've never even invited, this sort of—raw vigor that just pushes forward.\"\n\nI followed her gaze across the lawn where laughter erupted from another group.\n\n\"I can't understand it,\" she continued. \"It's so simple to them, and that's what makes it so—awful.\"\n\nTom appeared then, and we moved toward the drive to wait for their car. The night air carried fragments of music from the house.\n\n\"By the way,\" Tom said abruptly, \"I think he's a bootlegger.\"\n\n\"Who is?\" I asked, though I knew.\n\n\"Gatsby. Where else would he get all this money? These new rich people are just bootleggers, the lot of them.\"\n\n\"How would you know, Tom?\" I countered. \"You don't even know him.\"\n\n\"Well, I know the type,\" he insisted. \"I'd like to know who he is and what he does. And I think I'll make a point of finding out.\"\n\nDaisy was humming along with the distant music, a popular tune that floated across the lawn. She began to sing softly, her voice weaving in and out of the melody in a strange, artificial way.\n\n\"All these people,\" she said, interrupting herself. \"Do you suppose they just force their way in? I think it's terrible.\"\n\n\"I'm going to find out about this Gatsby,\" Tom repeated.\n\n\"I told you,\" Daisy said lightly. \"He owns a lot of drugstores. He built them up himself.\"\n\nTheir car arrived, gleaming in the drive. As they prepared to leave, Daisy turned to me with a smile that seemed both sad and curious. Her gaze drifted past me toward the bright windows of Gatsby's mansion, lingering there as the music swelled again.\n\nStanding alone after they departed, I found myself wondering what might be happening inside now—what unexpected encounters, what new arrivals might appear. Perhaps at this very moment, some extraordinary guest had just entered, someone who would eclipse all others in Gatsby's attention, someone who might even—but no, that was impossible. Gatsby had waited too long, held his dream too faithfully for it to be so easily replaced.\n```\n\nThis version attempts to better capture the structure and flow of the scene while including more of the dialogue and descriptive elements you mentioned, without directly reproducing the copyrighted text.",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant portion of the original passage's dialogue, especially the extended exchange among Miss Baedeker, Doctor Civet, and the other guests at the table. This results in the loss of the original's dynamic group interaction and the specific social atmosphere.\n- The sequence involving the moving-picture director and his companion is condensed, missing the gradual buildup and the narrator's reflective observations about their interaction.\n- The completion does not include the detailed description of the shadows moving behind the dressing-room blinds, which contributes to the setting and mood.\n- The ending omits the narrator's internal speculation about the possibilities of the night and the potential arrival of a remarkable guest, which is a key reflective element in the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion lacks the specific actions and responses of Miss Baedeker and the other guests, including the physical details and the interplay of accusations and defenses.\n- The transition from the party table to standing with Daisy is abrupt, skipping over the nuanced observations and the emotional shift that occurs in the original.\n- The completion does not include the detailed setting of the front steps, the lighting, and the movement of shadows, which are important for atmosphere.\n- The musical details, including the specific song and Daisy's unique way of singing, are not present.\n- The original's closing reflections on the nature of Gatsby's parties and the contrast with Daisy's world are only briefly summarized, missing the depth and specificity of the narrator's thoughts.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces invented narrative commentary, such as describing the conversation as having a 'peculiar mixture of forced gaiety and underlying hostility,' which is not present in the original.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the discussion about Miss Baedeker and the pool is compressed and lacks the original's order and detail.\n- Daisy's reaction to the movie director and his companion is simplified, and her emotional response is not as nuanced as in the original.\n- The conversation about Gatsby's background and the bootlegging accusation is paraphrased and lacks the original's back-and-forth structure.\n- The completion adds interpretive statements about Daisy's fascination and complaints, which are not directly expressed in the original passage.\n- The ending generalizes the narrator's reflections instead of presenting the specific, open-ended speculation found in the original."

Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free, and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run up, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights were extinguished in the guestrooms overhead. When he came down the steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes were bright and tired.\n“She didn’t like it,” he said immediately.\n“Of course she did.”\n“She didn’t like it,” he insisted. “She didn’t have a good time.”\nHe was silent, and I guessed at his unutterable depression.\n“I feel far away from her,” he said. “It’s hard to make her understand.”\n“You mean about the dance?”\n“The dance?” He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of his fingers. “Old sport, the dance is unimportant.”\nHe wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say: “I never loved you.” After she had obliterated four years with that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken. One of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back to Louisville and be married from her house—just as if it were five years ago.\n“And she doesn’t understand,” he said. “She used to be able to understand. We’d sit for hours—”\nHe broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds and discarded favours and crushed flowers.\n“I wouldn’t ask too much of her,” I ventured. “You can’t repeat the past.”\n“Can’t repeat the past?” he cried incredulously. “Why of course you can!”\nHe looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.\n“I’m going to fix everything just the way it was before,” he said, nodding determinedly. “She’ll see.”\nHe talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy. His life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he could find out what that thing was…\n… One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight. They stopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of the year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees—he could climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.\nHis heart beat faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning-fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips’ touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.\nThrough all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was reminded of something—an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man’s, as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air.

This omission disrupts the intended progression and thematic closure of the segment.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- There is a minor inaccuracy in the description of the woman's actions: the completion uses a slightly different verb for how the pocketbook falls, which could alter the nuance of the scene.\n- The completion introduces a slight variation in the spelling of certain words (e.g., 'pocket-book' instead of the original's form), which, while minor, could affect fidelity if strict accuracy is required.\n- The completion does not fully capture the original's sequence of sensory details and emotional responses in the final lines, leading to a loss of the original's impact and flow."

I wondered what role I was meant to play in whatever was unfolding between him and Daisy.\n\nAfter confirming the details, I hung up and stood by the telephone for a moment, contemplating tomorrow's meeting. The air felt charged with possibility. West Egg and East Egg would converge at Daisy's table, and I sensed I was being drawn into something significant.\n\nI spent the evening restless, my thoughts drifting between memories of Daisy's enchanting laugh and Gatsby's mysterious gaze across the bay. What history existed between them? And why was I suddenly important enough to be included?\n\nAs I prepared for bed, watching the lights of passing cars cast shadows across my wall, I couldn't shake the feeling that tomorrow's lunch would mark a turning point—not just for Gatsby and Daisy, but perhaps for me as well.

I happen to know about it.”\nTom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his thick body, and hurried into the room.\n“Mr. Gatsby!” He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed dislike. “I’m glad to see you, sir… Nick…”\n“Make us a cold drink,” cried Daisy.\nAs he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and pulled his face down, kissing him on the mouth.\n“You know I love you,” she murmured.\n“You forget there’s a lady present,” said Jordan.\nDaisy looked around doubtfully.\n“You kiss Nick too.”\n“What a low, vulgar girl!”\n“I don’t care!” cried Daisy, and began to clog on the brick fireplace. Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.\n“Bles-sed pre-cious,” she crooned, holding out her arms. “Come to your own mother that loves you.”\nThe child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and rooted shyly into her mother’s dress.\n“The bles-sed pre-cious!

After a moment he nodded at us and held open the door.\n\n\"Come in,\" he said. \"I'll tell Mrs. Buchanan and Miss Baker.\"\n\nThe murmur of their voices and the soft laughter drifted to us as we followed him through the hall into the cool darkness of the living room. Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols, weighing down their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.\n\n\"We can't move,\" they said together.\n\nJordan's fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment in mine.\n\n\"And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?\" I inquired.\n\nSimultaneously I heard Tom's voice, gruff and argumentative, in the hall.\n\n\"He's on the telephone,\" said Jordan, winking at me. \"This is the fourth time he's called her today.\"\n\nDaisy winced almost imperceptibly, then recovered herself with a little laugh. The butler came in with glasses on a tray, and Tom's voice became louder, filled with indignation.\n\n\"Very well then, I won't sell you the car at all... I'm under no obligations to you at all... And as for your bothering me about it at lunch time, I won't stand that at all!\"\n\nHe slammed into the room, his eyes flashing between Gatsby and me with hardly a nod of recognition.\n\n\"Where's something to drink?\" he demanded, striding over to the sideboard. \"Daisy!\"\n\n\"Make us a cold drink,\" said Daisy with an effort, her voice strained but sweet.\n\nAs Tom disappeared again, she got up and moved close to Gatsby, touching his face. Then she kissed him suddenly on the mouth.\n\n\"You know I love you,\" she murmured.\n\n\"Don't forget that I'm here,\" called Jordan, with a laugh that was somehow both mocking and tender.\n\nDaisy looked around conspiratorially. \"You should kiss Nick, Jordan.\"\n\n\"What a low, vulgar girl!\" Jordan laughed again.\n\nThe nurse entered with a small, well-powdered child in a flutter of white.\n\n\"Bles-sed pre-cious,\" sang Daisy, holding out her arms. \"Come to your own mother that loves you.\"\n\nThe nurse handed over the child and retreated to the door.\n\n\"The bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy hair? Stand up now, and say—How-de-do.\"\n\nGatsby and I exchanged a look of surprise, and Gatsby's face registered something like shock as he stared at the child. I don't think he had realized she existed before.\n\n\"I got dressed before luncheon,\" said the child, turning eagerly to Daisy.\n\n\"That's because your mother wanted to show you off.\" Her voice was unnatural, pitched too high with artificial joy. \"You dream, you. You absolute little dream.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" admitted the child calmly. \"Aunt Jordan's got on a white dress too.\"\n\n\"How do you like mother's friends?\" Daisy turned her around so that she faced Gatsby. \"Do you think they're pretty?\"\n\n\"Where's Daddy?\" the child asked.\n\nDaisy glanced up as Tom came in with a tray of gin rickeys.\n\n\"She doesn't look like her father,\" explained Daisy quickly. \"She looks like me. She's got my hair and shape of the face.\"\n\nTom came back, preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.\n```\n\nThis simulated output captures the scene from Chapter VII of \"The Great Gatsby\" where Nick and Gatsby visit the Buchanans' home.

          "text_segment": "Gatsby took up his drink.\n“They certainly look cool,” he said, with visible tension.\nWe drank in long, greedy swallows.\n“I read somewhere that the sun’s getting hotter every year,” said Tom genially. “It seems that pretty soon the earth’s going to fall into the sun—or wait a minute—it’s just the opposite—the sun’s getting colder every year.\n“Come outside,” he suggested to Gatsby, “I’d like you to have a look at the place.”\nI went with them out to the veranda. On the green Sound, stagnant in the heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea. Gatsby’s eyes followed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed across the bay.\n“I’m right across from you.”\n“So you are.”\nOur eyes lifted over the rose-beds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse of the dog-days alongshore. Slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and the abounding blessed isles.\n“There’s sport for you,” said Tom, nodding. “I’d like to be out there with him for about an hour.”\nWe had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat, and drank down nervous gaiety with the cold ale.\n“What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon?” cried Daisy, “and the day after that, and the next thirty years?”\n“Don’t be morbid,” Jordan said. “Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.”\n“But it’s so hot,” insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, “and everything’s so confused. Let’s all go to town!”\nHer voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding its senselessness into forms.\n“I’ve heard of making a garage out of a stable,” Tom was saying to Gatsby, “but I’m the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage.”\n“Who wants to go to town?” demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby’s eyes floated toward her. “Ah,” she cried, “you look so cool.”\nTheir eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space. With an effort she glanced down at the table.\n“You always look so cool,” she repeated.\nShe had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was astounded. His mouth opened a little, and he looked at Gatsby, and then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as someone he knew a long time ago.\n“You resemble the advertisement of the man,” she went on innocently. “You know the advertisement of the man—”\n“All right,” broke in Tom quickly, “I’m perfectly willing to go to town. Come on—we’re all going to town.”\nHe got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife. No one moved.\n“Come on!” His temper cracked a little. “What’s the matter, anyhow? If we’re going to town, let’s start.”\nHis hand, trembling with his effort at self-control, bore to his lips the last of his glass of ale. Daisy’s voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive.\n“Are we just going to go?” she objected. “Like this? Aren’t we going to let anyone smoke a cigarette first?”\n“Everybody smoked all through lunch.”\n“Oh, let’s have fun,” she begged him. “It’s too hot to fuss.”\nHe didn’t answer.\n“Have it your own way,” she said. “Come on, Jordan.”\nThey went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky. Gatsby started to speak, changed his mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.\n“Have you got your stables here?” asked Gatsby with an effort.\n“About a quarter of a mile down the road.”\n“Oh.”\nA pause.\n“I don’t see the idea of going to town,” broke out Tom savagely. “Women get these notions in their heads—”\n“Shall we take anything to drink?” called Daisy from an upper window.\n“I’ll get some whisky,” answered Tom. He went inside.\nGatsby turned to me rigidly:\n“I can’t say anything in his house, old sport.”\n“She’s got an indiscreet voice,” I remarked. “It’s full of—” I hesitated.\n“Her voice is full of money,” he said suddenly.\nThat was it. I’d never understood before. It was full of money—that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals’ song of it… High in a white palace the king’s daughter, the golden girl…\nTom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and carrying light capes over their arms.\n“Shall we all go in my car?” suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, green leather of the seat. “I ought to have left it in the shade.”\n“Is it standard shift?” demanded Tom.\n“Yes.”\n“Well, you take my coupé and let me drive your car to town.”",

After a moment the proprietor emerged from the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.\n“Let’s have some gas!” cried Tom roughly. “What do you think we stopped for—to admire the view?”\n“I’m sick,” said Wilson without moving. “Been sick all day.”\n“What’s the matter?”\n“I’m all run down.”\n“Well, shall I help myself?” Tom demanded. “You sounded well enough on the phone.”\nWith an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and, breathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his face was green.\n“I didn’t mean to interrupt your lunch,” he said. “But I need money pretty bad, and I was wondering what you were going to do with your old car.”\n“How do you like this one?” inquired Tom. “I bought it last week.”\n“It’s a nice yellow one,” said Wilson, as he strained at the handle.\n“Like to buy it?”\n“Big chance,” Wilson smiled faintly. “No, but I could make some money on the other.”\n“What do you want money for, all of a sudden?”\n“I’ve been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and I want to go West.”\n“Your wife does,” exclaimed Tom, startled.\n“She’s been talking about it for ten years.” He rested for a moment against the pump, shading his eyes. “And now she’s going whether she wants to or not. I’m going to get her away.”\nThe coupé flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a waving hand.\n“What do I owe you?” demanded Tom harshly.\n“I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,” remarked Wilson. “That’s why I want to get away. That’s why I been bothering you about the car.”\n“What do I owe you?”\n“Dollar twenty.”\nThe relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had a bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadn’t alighted on Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world, and the shock had made him physically sick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour before—and it occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well. Wilson was so sick that he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty—as if he had just got some poor girl with child.\n“I’ll let you have that car,” said Tom.",

Over the ash-heaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil, but I perceived, after a moment, that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away.\nIn one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little, and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car. So engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed, and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture. Her expression was curiously familiar—it was an expression I had often seen on women’s faces, but on Myrtle Wilson’s face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on Jordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife.\nThere is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping precipitately from his control. Instinct made him step on the accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in sight of the easygoing blue coupé.\n“Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,” suggested Jordan. “I love New York on summer afternoons when everyone’s away. There’s something very sensuous about it—overripe, as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands.”\nThe word “sensuous” had the effect of further disquieting Tom, but before he could invent a protest the coupé came to a stop, and Daisy signalled us to draw up alongside.\n“Where are we going?” she cried.\n“How about the movies?”\n“It’s so hot,” she complained. “You go. We’ll ride around and meet you after.” With an effort her wit rose faintly. “We’ll meet you on some corner. I’ll be the man smoking two cigarettes.”\n“We can’t argue about it here,” Tom said impatiently, as a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind us. “You follow me to the south side of Central Park, in front of the Plaza.”\nSeveral times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight. I think he was afraid they would dart down a side-street and out of his life forever.\nBut they didn’t. And we all took the less explicable step of engaging the parlour of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.\nThe prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into that room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in the course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back. The notion originated with Daisy’s suggestion that we hire five bathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as “a place to have a mint julep.” Each of us said over and over that it was a “crazy idea”—we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought, or pretended to think, that we were being very funny…\nThe room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four o’clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from the Park. Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us, fixing her hair.\n“It’s a swell suite,” whispered Jordan respectfully, and everyone laughed.\n“Open another window,” commanded Daisy, without turning around.\n“There aren’t any more.”\n“Well, we’d better telephone for an axe—”\n“The thing to do is to forget about the heat,” said Tom impatiently. “You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it.”\nHe unrolled the bottle of whisky from the towel and put it on the table.\n“Why not let her alone, old sport?” remarked Gatsby. “You’re the one that wanted to come to town.”\nThere was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered, “Excuse me”—but this time no one laughed.\n“I’ll pick it up,” I offered.\n“I’ve got it.” Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered “Hum!” in an interested way, and tossed the book on a chair.\n“That’s a great expression of yours, isn’t it?” said Tom sharply.\n“What is?”\n“All this ‘old sport’ business. Where’d you pick that up?”\n“Now see here, Tom,” said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, “if you’re going to make personal remarks I won’t stay here a minute. Call up and order some ice for the mint julep.”\nAs Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn’s Wedding March from the ballroom below.\n“Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!” cried Jordan dismally.\n“Still—I was married in the middle of June,” Daisy remembered. “Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?”\n“Biloxi,” he answered shortly.\n“A man named Biloxi. ‘Blocks’ Biloxi, and he made boxes—that’s a fact—and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.”\n“They carried him into my house,” appended Jordan, “because we lived just two doors from the church. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy told him he had to get out. The day after he left Daddy died.” After a moment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent, “There wasn’t any connection.”\n“I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,” I remarked.\n“That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he left. He gave me an aluminium putter that I use today.”",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents an opening scene involving a green light and Gatsby vanishing, which does not occur in the original passage at this point. This is a significant addition that disrupts the narrative flow and introduces content from a different part of the book.\n- The completion omits the entire sequence involving the discussion about where to go (movies, riding around, meeting on a corner), the negotiation in traffic, and the specific instructions about following to the Plaza. The transition to the hotel is abrupt and lacks the group’s indecision and argument.\n- The extended anecdote about Biloxi, the wedding, and the related family history is missing from the ending of the completion.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the original includes a detailed description of Myrtle Wilson’s actions and emotional state as she observes the car, which is only briefly and inaccurately referenced in the completion.\n- The original contains a sequence of dialogue and actions as the group discusses their plans, including Daisy’s witty remark about meeting on a corner and the group’s collective confusion and impatience in traffic. These exchanges are not present.\n- The process of arriving at the decision to rent a suite, including the physical discomfort and the group’s banter with the hotel clerk, is not included.\n- The original provides a vivid description of the oppressive heat, the attempt to open windows, and the group’s reactions, which are only partially represented.\n- The anecdote about the wedding, Biloxi, and the related family history, as well as the exchange about the aluminum putter, are omitted.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces a green light and Gatsby’s disappearance, which are not part of this scene and occur elsewhere in the novel.\n- Myrtle is described as watching from the door of the garage, rather than from a window above, and her emotional progression is not captured.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the group’s arrival at the hotel is presented as Tom’s unilateral decision, rather than the result of a confused, collective process.\n- Dialogue is condensed and altered, with invented lines and missing exchanges, especially regarding the group’s discussion about the heat, the drinks, and the use of the term “old sport.”\n- The mention of the wedding is vague and does not include the specific details and dialogue present in the original, nor does it accurately reflect the order and content of the conversation."

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents a scene early on, describing Myrtle Wilson as having a tear-streaked face and expressing antagonism, as well as her making a vocal outburst. These actions and emotional displays are not present in the original passage.\n- The completion omits the entire sequence involving the group entering the Plaza Hotel, the argument about the heat, the discussion about hiring bathrooms, and the transition into the hotel suite.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- Early in the passage, the completion invents a scene where Myrtle is described as standing on the porch and leaning forward, which does not occur in the original.

He was a friend of Daisy’s.”\n“He was not,” she denied. “I’d never seen him before. He came down in the private car.”\n“Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville. Asa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room for him.”\nJordan smiled.\n“He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of your class at Yale.”\nTom and I looked at each other blankly.\n“Biloxi?”\n“First place, we didn’t have any president—”\nGatsby’s foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.\n“By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you’re an Oxford man.”\n“Not exactly.”\n“Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.”\n“Yes—I went there.”\nA pause. Then Tom’s voice, incredulous and insulting:\n“You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven.”\nAnother pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but the silence was unbroken by his “thank you” and the soft closing of the door. This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.\n“I told you I went there,” said Gatsby.\n“I heard you, but I’d like to know when.”\n“It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That’s why I can’t really call myself an Oxford man.”\nTom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. But we were all looking at Gatsby.\n“It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the armistice,” he continued. “We could go to any of the universities in England or France.”\nI wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one of those renewals of complete faith in him that I’d experienced before.\nDaisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.\n“Open the whisky, Tom,” she ordered, “and I’ll make you a mint julep. Then you won’t seem so stupid to yourself… Look at the mint!”\n“Wait a minute,” snapped Tom, “I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question.”\n“Go on,” Gatsby said politely.\n“What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?”\nThey were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.\n“He isn’t causing a row,” Daisy looked desperately from one to the other. “You’re causing a row. Please have a little self-control.”\n“Self-control!” repeated Tom incredulously. “I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife. Well, if that’s the idea you can count me out… Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next they’ll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white.”\nFlushed with his impassioned gibberish, he saw himself standing alone on the last barrier of civilization.\n“We’re all white here,” murmured Jordan.\n“I know I’m not very popular. I don’t give big parties. I suppose you’ve got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any friends—in the modern world.”\nAngry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened his mouth. The transition from libertine to prig was so complete.\n“I’ve got something to tell you, old sport—” began Gatsby. But Daisy guessed at his intention.\n“Please don’t!” she interrupted helplessly. “Please let’s all go home. Why don’t we all go home?”\n“That’s a good idea,” I got up. “Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.”\n“I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.”\n“Your wife doesn’t love you,” said Gatsby. “She’s never loved you. She loves me.”\n“You must be crazy!” exclaimed Tom automatically.\nGatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.\n“She never loved you, do you hear?” he cried. “She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone except me!”\nAt this point Jordan and I tried to go, but Tom and Gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that we remain—as though neither of them had anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emotions.\n“Sit down, Daisy,” Tom’s voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal note. “What’s been going on? I want to hear all about it.”\n“I told you what’s been going on,” said Gatsby. “Going on for five years—and you didn’t know.”\nTom turned to Daisy sharply.\n“You’ve been seeing this fellow for five years?”\n“Not seeing,” said Gatsby. “No, we couldn’t meet. But both of us loved each other all that time, old sport, and you didn’t know. I used to laugh sometimes”—but there was no laughter in his eyes—“to think that you didn’t know.”\n“Oh—that’s all.” Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman and leaned back in his chair.\n“You’re crazy!” he exploded. “I can’t speak about what happened five years ago, because I didn’t know Daisy then—and I’ll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door. But all the rest of that’s a God damned lie. Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now.”\n“No,” said Gatsby, shaking his head.\n“She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her head and doesn’t know what she’s doing.” He nodded sagely. “And what’s more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time.”\n“You’re revolting,” said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice, dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: “Do you know why we left Chicago? I’m surprised that they didn’t treat you to the story of that little spree.”\nGatsby walked over and stood beside her.\n“Daisy, that’s all over now,” he said earnestly. “It doesn’t matter any more. Just tell him the truth—that you never loved him—and it’s all wiped out forever.”\nShe looked at him blindly. “Why—how could I love him—possibly?”\n“You never loved him.”\nShe hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal, as though she realized at last what she was doing—and as though she had never, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done now. It was too late.\n“I never loved him,” she said, with perceptible reluctance.\n“Not at Kapiolani?” demanded Tom suddenly.\n“No.”\nFrom the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up on hot waves of air.\n“Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry?” There was a husky tenderness in his tone… “Daisy?”\n“Please don’t.” Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it. She looked at Gatsby. “There, Jay,” she said—but her hand as she tried to light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette and the burning match on the carpet.\n“Oh, you want too much!” she cried to Gatsby. “I love you now—isn’t that enough? I can’t help what’s past.” She began to sob helplessly. “I did love him once—but I loved you too.”\nGatsby’s eyes opened and closed.\n“You loved me too?” he repeated.\n“Even that’s a lie,” said Tom savagely. “She didn’t know you were alive. Why—there’s things between Daisy and me that you’ll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget.”\nThe words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.\n“I want to speak to Daisy alone,” he insisted. “She’s all excited now—”\n“Even alone I can’t say I never loved Tom,” she admitted in a pitiful voice. “It wouldn’t be true.”\n“Of course it wouldn’t,” agreed Tom.\nShe turned to her husband.\n“As if it mattered to you,” she said.\n“Of course it matters. I’m going to take better care of you from now on.”\n“You don’t understand,” said Gatsby, with a touch of panic. “You’re not going to take care of her any more.”\n“I’m not?” Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to control himself now. “Why’s that?”\n“Daisy’s leaving you.”\n“Nonsense.”\n“I am, though,” she said with a visible effort.\n“She’s not leaving me!” Tom’s words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby. “Certainly not for a common swindler who’d have to steal the ring he put on her finger.”\n“I won’t stand this!” cried Daisy. “Oh, please let’s get out.”\n“Who are you, anyhow?” broke out Tom. “You’re one of that bunch that hangs around with Meyer Wolfshiem—that much I happen to know. I’ve made a little investigation into your affairs—and I’ll carry it further tomorrow.”\n“You can suit yourself about that, old sport,” said Gatsby steadily.\n“I found out what your ‘drugstores’ were.” He turned to us and spoke rapidly. “He and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of side-street drugstores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter. That’s one of his little stunts. I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw him, and I wasn’t far wrong.”\n“What about it?” said Gatsby politely. “I guess your friend Walter Chase wasn’t too proud to come in on it.”\n“And you left him in the lurch, didn’t you? You let him go to jail for a month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the subject of you.”\n“He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old sport.”\n“Don’t you call me ‘old sport’!” cried Tom. Gatsby said nothing. “Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but Wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth.”\nThat unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby’s face.\n“That drugstore business was just small change,” continued Tom slowly, “but you’ve got something on now that Walter’s afraid to tell me about.”\nI glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her husband, and at Jordan, who had begun to balance an invisible but absorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back to Gatsby—and was startled at his expression. He looked—and this is said in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden—as if he had “killed a man.” For a moment the set of his face could be described in just that fantastic way.\nIt passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been made. But with every word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave that up, and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room.\nThe voice begged again to go.",

He had slept through the heat until after five, when he strolled over to the garage, and found George Wilson sick in his office—really sick, pale as his own pale hair and shaking all over. Michaelis advised him to go to bed, but Wilson refused, saying that he’d miss a lot of business if he did. While his neighbour was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke out overhead.\n“I’ve got my wife locked in up there,” explained Wilson calmly. “She’s going to stay there till the day after tomorrow, and then we’re going to move away.”\nMichaelis was astonished; they had been neighbours for four years, and Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement. Generally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn’t working, he sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed along the road. When anyone spoke to him he invariably laughed in an agreeable, colourless way. He was his wife’s man and not his own.\nSo naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson wouldn’t say a word—instead he began to throw curious, suspicious glances at his visitor and ask him what he’d been doing at certain times on certain days. Just as the latter was getting uneasy, some workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant, and Michaelis took the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he didn’t. He supposed he forgot to, that’s all. When he came outside again, a little after seven, he was reminded of the conversation because he heard Mrs. Wilson’s voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in the garage.\n“Beat me!” he heard her cry. “Throw me down and beat me, you dirty little coward!”\nA moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and shouting—before he could move from his door the business was over.\nThe “death car” as the newspapers called it, didn’t stop; it came out of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, and then disappeared around the next bend. Mavro Michaelis wasn’t even sure of its colour—he told the first policeman that it was light green. The other car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark blood with the dust.\nMichaelis and this man reached her first, but when they had torn open her shirtwaist, still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap, and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped a little at the corners, as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long.",

He had seen everything that happened, having spent most of the afternoon in the garage with Wilson. At about five o'clock he was in his own place, putting a sandwich in the oven, when he heard a sick voice calling from the office and hurried over.\n\n\"Hello, Wilson, old man,\" he said. \"What's the matter?\"\n\nWilson was sitting on a chair beside the desk, swaying back and forth with a dazed expression on his face. He was sick, pale as his own pale hair and shaking all over.\n\n\"I'm sick,\" he said. \"Very sick, Michaelis.\"\n\n\"You need a doctor,\" said Michaelis. \"I'll go get one.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" Wilson shook his head. \"I just need to rest, that's all.

He had seen everything that happened, having spent most of the afternoon in the garage with Wilson. At about five o'clock he was in his own place, putting a sandwich in the oven, when he heard a sick voice calling from the office and hurried over.\n\n\"Hello, Wilson, old man,\" he said. \"What's the matter?\"\n\nWilson was sitting on a chair beside the desk, swaying back and forth with a dazed expression on his face. He was sick, pale as his own pale hair and shaking all over.\n\n\"I'm sick,\" he said. \"Very sick, Michaelis.\"\n\n\"You need a doctor,\" said Michaelis. \"I'll go get one.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" Wilson shook his head. \"I just need to rest, that's all. I've got my wife locked in up there,\" he explained calmly. \"She's going to stay there until the day after tomorrow, and then we're going to move away.\"\n\nMichaelis was astonished; they had been neighbors for four years, and Wilson had never seemed capable of such a statement before. Generally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn't working, he sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed along the road. When anyone spoke to him, he invariably laughed in an agreeable, colorless way. He was his wife's man and not his own.\n\n\"Why are you going away?\" Michaelis asked.\n\n\"Been here too long. And she's been talking about things. I've got her locked up there because if she gets any freedom, she'll run off.\"\n\nLater, around seven o'clock, Michaelis was back in his restaurant when he heard a commotion from the garage.

          "text_segment": "We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still some distance away.\n“Wreck!” said Tom. “That’s good. Wilson’ll have a little business at last.”\nHe slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping, until, as we came nearer, the hushed, intent faces of the people at the garage door made him automatically put on the brakes.\n“We’ll take a look,” he said doubtfully, “just a look.”\nI became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly from the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coupé and walked toward the door resolved itself into the words “Oh, my God!” uttered over and over in a gasping moan.\n“There’s some bad trouble here,” said Tom excitedly.\nHe reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage, which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging metal basket overhead. Then he made a harsh sound in his throat, and with a violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through.\nThe circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it was a minute before I could see anything at all. Then new arrivals deranged the line, and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.\nMyrtle Wilson’s body, wrapped in a blanket, and then in another blanket, as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night, lay on a worktable by the wall, and Tom, with his back to us, was bending over it, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down names with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I couldn’t find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed clamorously through the bare garage—then I saw Wilson standing on the raised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to the doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low voice and attempting, from time to time, to lay a hand on his shoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall, and then jerk back to the light again, and he gave out incessantly his high, horrible call:\n“Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!”\nPresently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and, after staring around the garage with glazed eyes, addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the policeman.\n“M-a-v—” the policeman was saying, “—o—”\n“No, r—” corrected the man, “M-a-v-r-o—”\n“Listen to me!” muttered Tom fiercely.\n“r—” said the policeman, “o—”\n“g—”\n“g—” He looked up as Tom’s broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder. “What you want, fella?”\n“What happened?—that’s what I want to know.”\n“Auto hit her. Ins’antly killed.”\n“Instantly killed,” repeated Tom, staring.\n“She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn’t even stopus car.”\n“There was two cars,” said Michaelis, “one comin’, one goin’, see?”\n“Going where?” asked the policeman keenly.\n“One goin’ each way. Well, she”—his hand rose toward the blankets but stopped halfway and fell to his side—“she ran out there an’ the one comin’ from N’York knock right into her, goin’ thirty or forty miles an hour.”\n“What’s the name of this place here?” demanded the officer.\n“Hasn’t got any name.”\nA pale well-dressed negro stepped near.\n“It was a yellow car,” he said, “big yellow car. New.”\n“See the accident?” asked the policeman.\n“No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster’n forty. Going fifty, sixty.”\n“Come here and let’s have your name. Look out now. I want to get his name.”\nSome words of this conversation must have reached Wilson, swaying in the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his grasping cries:\n“You don’t have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of car it was!”\nWatching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten under his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and, standing in front of him, seized him firmly by the upper arms.\n“You’ve got to pull yourself together,” he said with soothing gruffness.\nWilson’s eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.\n“Listen,” said Tom, shaking him a little. “I just got here a minute ago, from New York. I was bringing you that coupé we’ve been talking about. That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn’t mine—do you hear? I haven’t seen it all afternoon.”\nOnly the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said, but the policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent eyes.\n“What’s all that?” he demanded.\n“I’m a friend of his.” Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on Wilson’s body. “He says he knows the car that did it… It was a yellow car.”\nSome dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.\n“And what colour’s your car?”\n“It’s a blue car, a coupé.”\n“We’ve come straight from New York,” I said.\nSomeone who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this, and the policeman turned away.\n“Now, if you’ll let me have that name again correct—”\nPicking up Wilson like a doll, Tom carried him into the office, set him down in a chair, and came back.\n“If somebody’ll come here and sit with him,” he snapped authoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the door on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the table. As he passed close to me he whispered: “Let’s get out.”\nSelf-consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we pushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor, case in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.\nTom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend—then his foot came down hard, and the coupé raced along through the night. In a little while I heard a low husky sob, and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face.\n“The God damned coward!” he whimpered.",

          "text_segment": "The Buchanans’ house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling trees. Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor, where two windows bloomed with light among the vines.\n“Daisy’s home,” he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and frowned slightly.\n“I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There’s nothing we can do tonight.”\nA change had come over him, and he spoke gravely, and with decision. As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of the situation in a few brisk phrases.\n“I’ll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you’re waiting you and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some supper—if you want any.” He opened the door. “Come in.”\n“No, thanks. But I’d be glad if you’d order me the taxi. I’ll wait outside.”\nJordan put her hand on my arm.\n“Won’t you come in, Nick?”\n“No, thanks.”\nI was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan lingered for a moment more.\n“It’s only half-past nine,” she said.\nI’d be damned if I’d go in; I’d had enough of all of them for one day, and suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of this in my expression, for she turned abruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the house. I sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler’s voice calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the house, intending to wait by the gate.\nI hadn’t gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from between two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird by that time, because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon.\n“What are you doing?” I inquired.\n“Just standing here, old sport.”\nSomehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was going to rob the house in a moment; I wouldn’t have been surprised to see sinister faces, the faces of “Wolfshiem’s people,” behind him in the dark shrubbery.\n“Did you see any trouble on the road?” he asked after a minute.\n“Yes.”\nHe hesitated.\n“Was she killed?”\n“Yes.”\n“I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It’s better that the shock should all come at once. She stood it pretty well.”\nHe spoke as if Daisy’s reaction was the only thing that mattered.\n“I got to West Egg by a side road,” he went on, “and left the car in my garage. I don’t think anybody saw us, but of course I can’t be sure.”\nI disliked him so much by this time that I didn’t find it necessary to tell him he was wrong.\n“Who was the woman?” he inquired.\n“Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did it happen?”\n“Well, I tried to swing the wheel—” He broke off, and suddenly I guessed at the truth.\n“Was Daisy driving?”\n“Yes,” he said after a moment, “but of course I’ll say I was. You see, when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to drive—and this woman rushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute, but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second my hand reached the wheel I felt the shock—it must have killed her instantly.”\n“It ripped her open—”\n“Don’t tell me, old sport.” He winced. “Anyhow—Daisy stepped on it. I tried to make her stop, but she couldn’t, so I pulled on the emergency brake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.\n“She’ll be all right tomorrow,” he said presently. “I’m just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon. She’s locked herself into her room, and if he tries any brutality she’s going to turn the light out and on again.”\n“He won’t touch her,” I said. “He’s not thinking about her.”\n“I don’t trust him, old sport.”\n“How long are you going to wait?”\n“All night, if necessary. Anyhow, till they all go to bed.”\nA new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy had been driving. He might think he saw a connection in it—he might think anything. I looked at the house; there were two or three bright windows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy’s room on the ground floor.\n“You wait here,” I said. “I’ll see if there’s any sign of a commotion.”\nI walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel softly, and tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains were open, and I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where we had dined that June night three months before, I came to a small rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window. The blind was drawn, but I found a rift at the sill.\nDaisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table, with a plate of cold fried chicken between them, and two bottles of ale. He was talking intently across the table at her, and in his earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own. Once in a while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.\nThey weren’t happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the ale—and yet they weren’t unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture, and anybody would have said that they were conspiring together.\nAs I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the dark road toward the house. Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in the drive.\n“Is it all quiet up there?” he asked anxiously.\n“Yes, it’s all quiet.” I hesitated. “You’d better come home and get some sleep.”\nHe shook his head.\n“I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport.”\nHe put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the moonlight—watching over nothing.",

As we got out of the car he looked at me and frowned slightly.\n\nTom became grave. \"You two go in and have supper and I'll be along in a few minutes,\" he said quickly. \"I want to see a man about something.\"\n\nHis tone made me believe that this \"something\" had occurred to him just that moment, and I wasn't surprised when he insisted on driving us all to the station himself. The butler called a taxi for Jordan and me, but Tom urged us to wait until he brought Daisy down to join us for supper at some restaurant. I declined, saying I felt sick and wanted to go home.\n\nJordan lingered for a moment. \"It's only half past nine,\" she said.\n\nI'd had enough of them all for one day, and suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something in my expression, for she turned abruptly and ran up the porch steps into the house. I sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands, until I heard the butler call a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the house.\n\nI hadn't gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from between two bushes into the path. I must have seemed strange to him, but he was adjusting to my unexpected presence.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Just standing here, old sport.\"\n\nSomehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. I couldn't think why, except that he had been hovering at the edge of invisible things all afternoon.\n\n\"Did you see any trouble on the road?\" he asked after a minute.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe hesitated. \"Was she killed?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It's better that the shock should all come at once. She stood it pretty well.\"\n\nHe spoke as if Daisy's reaction was all that mattered.\n\n\"I got to West Egg by a side road,\" he went on, \"and left the car in my garage. I don't think anybody saw us, but of course I can't be sure.\"\n\nI disliked him so much at that moment that I didn't find it necessary to tell him he was wrong.\n\n\"Who was the woman?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did it happen?\"\n\n\"Well, I tried to swing the wheel—\" He broke off, and suddenly I guessed at the truth.\n\n\"Was Daisy driving?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said after a moment, \"but of course I'll say I was.\"\n\nHe described how Daisy had been very nervous driving back, how the woman rushed out when they were passing the garage, as if she recognized the car. Daisy swerved, then lost her nerve and swerved back. Just as Gatsby's hand took hold of the wheel, he felt the shock of impact.\n\nHe said Daisy drove on in shock while he tried to make her stop. Finally, he pulled the emergency brake. She fell into his lap crying, and he drove on.\n\nGatsby was determined to wait there all night if necessary, watching for Tom to do something to hurt Daisy. I suggested checking inside the house to see what was happening.\n\nThrough the kitchen window, I saw Tom and Daisy sitting opposite each other at the table with a plate of cold fried chicken between them and two bottles of ale. They were talking earnestly, Tom's hand covering Daisy's as she nodded occasionally. They weren't happy, and yet they weren't unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about them, as if they were conspiring together.\n\nI returned to Gatsby and told him everything was quiet. I suggested he go home and get some sleep.\n\n\"I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed,\" he insisted. \"Good night, old sport.\"\n\nHe put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of his vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the moonlight—watching over nothing.",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents a conversation between Tom and Gatsby about who will take the car home and who will accompany whom, which does not occur in the original. This invented exchange alters the structure and focus of the scene.\n- The completion omits the entire latter portion of the original passage, including the detailed conversation between Nick and Gatsby, Gatsby’s account of the accident, Nick’s observations of Tom and Daisy in the kitchen, and the final moments of Gatsby’s vigil outside the house.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion leaves out the decisive and grave change in Tom’s demeanor and his brisk instructions regarding the taxi and supper arrangements.\n- The detailed internal reflections from Nick about his feelings toward the group, especially his reaction to Jordan, are only partially present and lack the full progression found in the original.\n- The sequence where Nick waits outside, hears the butler call for a taxi, and then encounters Gatsby is abbreviated and missing the nuanced transitions and actions.\n- The entire conversation between Gatsby and Nick about the accident, including Gatsby’s explanation of the events, Daisy’s role, and the emotional undertones, is absent.\n- The passage where Nick observes Tom and Daisy through the window, noting their interaction and the implications of their intimacy, is missing.\n- The final exchange between Nick and Gatsby, including Gatsby’s decision to keep watch and Nick’s departure, is not included.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces inaccurate dialogue and actions, such as Gatsby offering to take care of the car and Tom suggesting Daisy drive Nick home, which do not occur in the original.\n- The sequence of events is altered, with invented dialogue and actions replacing the original’s more subdued and tense interactions.\n- The emotional tone and focus of the scene are shifted by the invented conversation, detracting from the original’s atmosphere of tension, exhaustion, and quiet observation.\n- The transition from Nick’s internal state to his encounter with Gatsby is handled differently, missing the original’s subtle cues and emotional buildup.\n\nTo improve, the completion should avoid inventing new scenes or dialogue, ensure all major events and conversations are included in the correct order, and preserve the original’s emotional and narrative progression."

He went to her house, at first with other officers from Camp Taylor, then alone. It amazed him—he had never been in such a beautiful house before. But what gave it an air of breathless intensity, was that Daisy lived there—it was as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it, a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors, and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year’s shining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered. It excited him, too, that many men had already loved Daisy—it increased her value in his eyes. He felt their presence all about the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions.\nBut he knew that he was in Daisy’s house by a colossal accident. However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders.

I don’t mean that he had traded on his phantom millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he let her believe that he was a person from much the same strata as herself—that he was fully able to take care of her. As a matter of fact, he had no such facilities—he had no comfortable family standing behind him, and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the world.\nBut he didn’t despise himself and it didn’t turn out as he had imagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go—but now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail. He knew that Daisy was extraordinary, but he didn’t realize just how extraordinary a “nice” girl could be. She vanished into her rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby—nothing. He felt married to her, that was all.\nWhen they met again, two days later, it was Gatsby who was breathless, who was, somehow, betrayed. Her porch was bright with the bought luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth. She had caught a cold, and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever, and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor.\n“I can’t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her, old sport. I even hoped for a while that she’d throw me over, but she didn’t, because she was in love with me too. She thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her… Well, there I was, way off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden I didn’t care. What was the use of doing great things if I could have a better time telling her what I was going to do?”\nOn the last afternoon before he went abroad, he sat with Daisy in his arms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day, with fire in the room and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he changed his arm a little, and once he kissed her dark shining hair. The afternoon had made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised. They had never been closer in their month of love, nor communicated more profoundly one with another, than when she brushed silent lips against his coat’s shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were asleep.",

He was a captain before he went to the front, and following the Argonne battles he got his majority and the command of the divisional machine-guns. After the armistice he tried frantically to get home, but some complication or misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He was worried now—there was a quality of nervous despair in Daisy’s letters. She didn’t see why he couldn’t come. She was feeling the pressure of the world outside, and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all.\nFor Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes. All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the “Beale Street Blues” while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust. At the grey tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low, sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the floor.\nThrough this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men, and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening-dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed. And all the time something within her was crying for a decision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately—and the decision must be made by some force—of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality—that was close at hand.\nThat force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom Buchanan. There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his position, and Daisy was flattered. Doubtless there was a certain struggle and a certain relief. The letter reached Gatsby while he was still at Oxford.\nIt was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of the windows downstairs, filling the house with grey-turning, gold-turning light. The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. There was a slow, pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool, lovely day.\n“I don’t think she ever loved him.” Gatsby turned around from a window and looked at me challengingly. “You must remember, old sport, she was very excited this afternoon. He told her those things in a way that frightened her—that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper. And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying.”\nHe sat down gloomily.\n“Of course she might have loved him just for a minute, when they were first married—and loved me more even then, do you see?”\nSuddenly he came out with a curious remark.\n“In any case,” he said, “it was just personal.”\nWhat could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in his conception of the affair that couldn’t be measured?\nHe came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their wedding trip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to Louisville on the last of his army pay. He stayed there a week, walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through the November night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which they had driven in her white car. Just as Daisy’s house had always seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses, so his idea of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded with a melancholy beauty.\nHe left feeling that if he had searched harder, he might have found her—that he was leaving her behind. The day-coach—he was penniless now—was hot. He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a folding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar buildings moved by. Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street.\nThe track curved and now it was going away from the sun, which, as it sank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing city where she had drawn her breath. He stretched out his hand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of the spot that she had made lovely for him. But it was all going by too fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of it, the freshest and the best, forever.",

He was a captain before he went to the front, and following the Argonne battles he got his majority and the command of the divisional machine-guns. After the Armistice he tried frantically to get home, but some complication or misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He was worried now—there was a quality of nervous despair in Daisy's letters. She didn't see why he couldn't come. She was feeling the pressure of the world outside, and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all.\n\nFor Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes. All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the \"Beale Street Blues\" while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust. At the gray tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low, sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the floor.\n\nThrough this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men, and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed. And all the time something within her was crying for a decision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately—and the decision must be made by some force—of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality—that was close at hand.\n\nThat force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom Buchanan. There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his position, and Daisy was flattered. Somehow she was married by the officer from Camp Taylor. The letter reached Gatsby while he was still at Oxford.\n\nIt was dawn now on Long Island and we had wandered to the window. In the garden, his chauffeur had begun waiting the first train. The shadows of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. There was a slow, pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool, lovely day.\n\n\"I don't think she ever loved him.\" Gatsby turned around from a window and looked at me challengingly. \"You must remember, old sport, she was very excited this afternoon. He told her those things in a way that frightened her—that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper. And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying.\"\n\nHe sat down gloomily.\n\n\"Of course she might have loved him just for a minute, when they were",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion abruptly ends in the middle of a sentence, omitting a significant portion of the original passage. This results in the loss of several key narrative developments, including the arrival of a new character, important emotional turning points, and the transition to a different setting and time.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The latter part of Daisy's internal conflict and the force that compels her decision are not included.\n- The introduction and description of a pivotal character who influences Daisy's choices are missing.\n- The narrative shift to a new location and time, including the atmospheric description of the morning and the actions of the narrator and Gatsby, is absent.\n- The dialogue between Gatsby and the narrator, which reveals Gatsby's emotional state and perspective, is not present.\n- The recounting of Gatsby's return from France, his visit to Louisville, and his emotional journey through the city are omitted.\n- The passage's reflective conclusion, which provides insight into Gatsby's feelings of loss and longing, is not included.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- There are no major inaccuracies in the included portion, as the content closely follows the original up to the point where it stops. However, the lack of completion results in an incomplete representation of the sequence of events and emotional developments that follow.\n- The transition between Daisy's world and her emotional turmoil is left unresolved, and the subsequent narrative developments are not addressed, disrupting the intended flow and structure of the original passage."

He announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car belonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen.\nBut when he heard himself say this, he flinched and began to cry “Oh, my God!” again in his groaning voice. Michaelis made a clumsy attempt to distract him.\n“How long have you been married, George? Come on there, try and sit still a minute, and answer my question. How long have you been married?”\n“Twelve years.”\n“Ever had any children? Come on, George, sit still—I asked you a question. Did you ever have any children?”\nThe hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light, and whenever Michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him like the car that hadn’t stopped a few hours before. He didn’t like to go into the garage, because the work bench was stained where the body had been lying, so he moved uncomfortably around the office—he knew every object in it before morning—and from time to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep him more quiet.\n“Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George? Maybe even if you haven’t been there for a long time? Maybe I could call up the church and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?”\n“Don’t belong to any.”\n“You ought to have a church, George, for times like this. You must have gone to church once. Didn’t you get married in a church? Listen, George, listen to me. Didn’t you get married in a church?”\n“That was a long time ago.”\nThe effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking—for a moment he was silent. Then the same half-knowing, half-bewildered look came back into his faded eyes.\n“Look in the drawer there,” he said, pointing at the desk.\n“Which drawer?”\n“That drawer—that one.”\nMichaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand. There was nothing in it but a small, expensive dog-leash, made of leather and braided silver. It was apparently new.\n“This?” he inquired, holding it up.\nWilson stared and nodded.\n“I found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell me about it, but I knew it was something funny.”\n“You mean your wife bought it?”\n“She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau.”\nMichaelis didn’t see anything odd in that, and he gave Wilson a dozen reasons why his wife might have bought the dog-leash. But conceivably Wilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle, because he began saying “Oh, my God!” again in a whisper—his comforter left several explanations in the air.\n“Then he killed her,” said Wilson. His mouth dropped open suddenly.\n“Who did?”\n“I have a way of finding out.”\n“You’re morbid, George,” said his friend. “This has been a strain to you and you don’t know what you’re saying. You’d better try and sit quiet till morning.”\n“He murdered her.”\n“It was an accident, George.”\nWilson shook his head. His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened slightly with the ghost of a superior “Hm!”\n“I know,” he said definitely. “I’m one of these trusting fellas and I don’t think any harm to nobody, but when I get to know a thing I know it. It was the man in that car. She ran out to speak to him and he wouldn’t stop.”\nMichaelis had seen this too, but it hadn’t occurred to him that there was any special significance in it. He believed that Mrs. Wilson had been running away from her husband, rather than trying to stop any particular car.\n“How could she of been like that?”\n“She’s a deep one,” said Wilson, as if that answered the question. “Ah-h-h—”\nHe began to rock again, and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in his hand.\n“Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George?”\nThis was a forlorn hope—he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend: there was not enough of him for his wife. He was glad a little later when he noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window, and realized that dawn wasn’t far off. About five o’clock it was blue enough outside to snap off the light.\nWilson’s glazed eyes turned out to the ash-heaps, where small grey clouds took on fantastic shapes and scurried here and there in the faint dawn wind.\n“I spoke to her,” he muttered, after a long silence. “I told her she might fool me but she couldn’t fool God. I took her to the window”—with an effort he got up and walked to the rear window and leaned with his face pressed against it—“and I said ‘God knows what you’ve been doing, everything you’ve been doing. You may fool me, but you can’t fool God!’ ”\nStanding behind him, Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, which had just emerged, pale and enormous, from the dissolving night.\n“God sees everything,” repeated Wilson.\n“That’s an advertisement,” Michaelis assured him.

The butler gave me his office address on Broadway, and I called Information, but by the time I had the number it was long after five, and no one answered the phone.\n“Will you ring again?”\n“I’ve rung three times.”\n“It’s very important.”\n“Sorry. I’m afraid no one’s there.”\nI went back to the drawing-room and thought for an instant that they were chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled it. But, though they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with shocked eyes, his protest continued in my brain:\n“Look here, old sport, you’ve got to get somebody for me. You’ve got to try hard. I can’t go through this alone.”\nSomeone started to ask me questions, but I broke away and going upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk—he’d never told me definitely that his parents were dead. But there was nothing—only the picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence, staring down from the wall.\nNext morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem, which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next train. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it. I was sure he’d start when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there’d be a wire from Daisy before noon—but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem arrived; no one arrived except more police and photographers and newspaper men. When the butler brought back Wolfshiem’s answer I began to have a feeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and me against them all.\nDear Mr. Carraway. This has been one of the most terrible shocks of my life to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all. Such a mad act as that man did should make us all think. I cannot come down now as I am tied up in some very important business and cannot get mixed up in this thing now. If there is anything I can do a little later let me know in a letter by Edgar. I hardly know where I am when I hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and out.\nYours truly\nMeyer Wolfshiem\nand then hasty addenda beneath:\nLet me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all.\nWhen the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was calling I thought this would be Daisy at last.

Get my wire?”\n“There haven’t been any wires.”\n“Young Parke’s in trouble,” he said rapidly. “They picked him up when he handed the bonds over the counter. They got a circular from New York giving ’em the numbers just five minutes before. What d’you know about that, hey? You never can tell in these hick towns—”\n“Hello!” I interrupted breathlessly. “Look here—this isn’t Mr. Gatsby. Mr. Gatsby’s dead.”\nThere was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an exclamation… then a quick squawk as the connection was broken.",

It said only that the sender was leaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came.\nIt was Gatsby’s father, a solemn old man, very helpless and dismayed, bundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day. His eyes leaked continuously with excitement, and when I took the bag and umbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse grey beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat. He was on the point of collapse, so I took him into the music-room and made him sit down while I sent for something to eat. But he wouldn’t eat, and the glass of milk spilled from his trembling hand.\n“I saw it in the Chicago newspaper,” he said. “It was all in the Chicago newspaper. I started right away.”\n“I didn’t know how to reach you.”\nHis eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about the room.\n“It was a madman,” he said. “He must have been mad.”\n“Wouldn’t you like some coffee?” I urged him.\n“I don’t want anything. I’m all right now, Mr.—”\n“Carraway.”\n“Well, I’m all right now. Where have they got Jimmy?”\nI took him into the drawing-room, where his son lay, and left him there. Some little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into the hall; when I told them who had arrived, they went reluctantly away.\nAfter a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door and came out, his mouth ajar, his face flushed slightly, his eyes leaking isolated and unpunctual tears. He had reached an age where death no longer has the quality of ghastly surprise, and when he looked around him now for the first time and saw the height and splendour of the hall and the great rooms opening out from it into other rooms, his grief began to be mixed with an awed pride.

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The narrator's motivation for making calls and the concern about publicity are not included at the start, which removes context for the reader about why these calls are happening.\n- The completion does not include the narrator's sense of relief upon learning the caller's identity, which is an important emotional beat.\n- The completion lacks the narrator's explicit statement about not wanting the funeral to be in the papers, as well as the effort involved in reaching out to people.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The order of dialogue is altered at the beginning, with the caller identifying himself before the narrator does, which is not accurate to the original sequence.\n- The completion introduces a line where the narrator expresses uncertainty about the caller's location, which is not present in the original.\n- The phrase \"here was someone else to share the vigil with me\" is an invented reflection not found in the original passage.\n- The rest of the passage generally follows the correct sequence, but the initial misattribution and missing context affect the overall accuracy and emotional tone."

But when I’d shouted “hello” several times in vain, an argument broke out behind a partition, and presently a lovely Jewess appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile eyes.\n“Nobody’s in,” she said. “Mr. Wolfshiem’s gone to Chicago.”\nThe first part of this was obviously untrue, for someone had begun to whistle “The Rosary,” tunelessly, inside.\n“Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him.”\n“I can’t get him back from Chicago, can I?”\nAt this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfshiem’s, called “Stella!” from the other side of the door.\n“Leave your name on the desk,” she said quickly. “I’ll give it to him when he gets back.”\n“But I know he’s there.”\nShe took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up and down her hips.\n“You young men think you can force your way in here any time,” she scolded. “We’re getting sickantired of it. When I say he’s in Chicago, he’s in Chicago.”\nI mentioned Gatsby.\n“Oh-h!” She looked at me over again. “Will you just—What was your name?”\nShe vanished. In a moment Meyer Wolfshiem stood solemnly in the doorway, holding out both hands. He drew me into his office, remarking in a reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us, and offered me a cigar.\n“My memory goes back to when first I met him,” he said. “A young major just out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war. He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he couldn’t buy some regular clothes. First time I saw him was when he came into Winebrenner’s poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked for a job. He hadn’t eat anything for a couple of days. ‘Come on have some lunch with me,’ I said. He ate more than four dollars’ worth of food in half an hour.”\n“Did you start him in business?” I inquired.\n“Start him! I made him.”\n“Oh.”\n“I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I saw right away he was a fine-appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told me he was at Oggsford I knew I could use him good. I got him to join the American Legion and he used to stand high there. Right off he did some work for a client of mine up to Albany. We were so thick like that in everything”—he held up two bulbous fingers—“always together.”\nI wondered if this partnership had included the World’s Series transaction in 1919.\n“Now he’s dead,” I said after a moment. “You were his closest friend, so I know you’ll want to come to his funeral this afternoon.”\n“I’d like to come.”\n“Well, come then.”\nThe hair in his nostrils quivered slightly, and as he shook his head his eyes filled with tears.\n“I can’t do it—I can’t get mixed up in it,” he said.\n“There’s nothing to get mixed up in. It’s all over now.”\n“When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any way. I keep out. When I was a young man it was different—if a friend of mine died, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end. You may think that’s sentimental, but I mean it—to the bitter end.”\nI saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come, so I stood up.\n“Are you a college man?” he inquired suddenly.\nFor a moment I thought he was going to suggest a “gonnegtion,” but he only nodded and shook my hand.\n“Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead,” he suggested. “After that my own rule is to let everything alone.”",

I was told he was in Chicago, and then that he wasn't in his office, and then that he was in Chicago. The third time I went I sat in the waiting room for an hour, and his secretary returned to say that he had gone out. I didn't want to phone again. I was sure he was avoiding me.\n\nThe elevator boy assured me that this was the right floor. The office was empty except for an obviously empty table and a small partition far back from the windows.\n\n\"Frisco,\" called someone behind the partition. \"Are you alone?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" The man whistled a tune.\n\n\"Can I speak to you for a minute?\" I called.\n\nSilence. Then the same voice, a little testy: \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"I want to speak to Mr. Wolfshiem.\"\n\nAfter a moment a plump and over-powdered woman in black appeared in the door.\n\n\"Nobody's in,\" she said. \"Mr. Wolfshiem's gone to Chicago.\"\n\nThe first part of this was obviously untrue, for someone had begun to whistle \"The Rosary,\" tunelessly, inside.\n\n\"Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him.\"\n\n\"I can't bring him back from Chicago, can I?\"\n\n\"If he's in Chicago.\"\n\nShe took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up and down her hips.\n\n\"Now, see here, mister.

Then she said: \"I'll see.\"\n\nAfter she had disappeared I waited in the office, conscious of being involved in that tangle of obscurity which I had sensed around Gatsby from the beginning. The door opened and Mr. Wolfshiem stood solemnly in the doorway, holding out both hands. Then he saw that the room was empty and withdrew one.\n\n\"Highballs?\" he inquired politely. \"Or do you want to talk business?\"\n\n\"This is social,\" I answered. \"Has the telephone been busy?\"\n\n\"Oh, naturally, naturally.\" He looked at me sideways and began to wipe the tips of his fingers with a handkerchief. \"I hear you're a college man.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Let me tell you about the first time I saw young Gatsby.\" His throat moved with difficulty. \"It was when I was in the pool room at Forty-third Street and some young fellow came in and asked for a job.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents a description of the office's location (top floor, small building, Forty-second Street) and adds details about the office's decor (photograph of a house), which are not present in the original passage.\n- The completion omits the initial interaction where an argument breaks out behind the partition and the detail of someone whistling a tune, which are important for setting the scene and indicating someone is present.\n- The ending is incomplete, cutting off before the conversation is fully resolved and missing the final exchange about showing friendship while someone is alive.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The early part of the passage lacks the detail about the elevator boy's advice and the initial emptiness of the office.\n- The middle section omits the specific exchange where the woman scrutinizes the narrator with hostility and the moment when Wolfshiem calls out from behind the door, revealing his presence.\n- The completion does not include the narrator's internal observation about the woman's obvious lie, nor the woman's physical gesture of sliding her hands up and down her hips in indignation at the appropriate moment.\n- The final part is missing the sudden question from Wolfshiem about whether the narrator is a college man, as well as the handshake and the concluding advice about friendship and letting things alone.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The office location and decor are inaccurately described, introducing invented details not found in the original.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the woman is startled by Gatsby's name earlier than in the original, and the narrator's waiting in the office is inserted, which does not match the original order.\n- The dialogue is sometimes paraphrased or altered, with some lines attributed to the wrong character or delivered at the wrong moment.\n- The completion omits the emotional nuance of Wolfshiem's reluctance and the narrator's realization of his determination not to attend the funeral, as well as the specific gestures and emotional cues present in the original.\n\nTo improve, focus on accurately capturing the sequence of events, preserving the original character interactions and emotional beats, and avoiding the addition of invented details or settings."

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the detail of the photograph being cracked and dirty, nor the repeated, eager pointing out of details by Mr. Gatz, which are important for conveying his emotional state.\n- The act of Mr. Gatz seeking admiration from the narrator and the idea that the photograph has become more real to him than the house itself are not represented.\n- The completion omits the narrator's direct question about whether Mr. Gatz had seen his son recently, as well as the specific exchange that follows.\n- The lingering reluctance of Mr. Gatz to put away the photograph is not fully depicted.\n- The process of Mr. Gatz opening the book to the back cover and turning it for the narrator to see is condensed, missing the step-by-step actions.\n- The completion does not mention the crossed-out amount in the resolves or the indecipherable name, both of which are part of the original's detail.\n- The old man's comment about coming across the book by accident is missing.\n- The completion omits the anecdote about Gatsby criticizing his father's eating habits and the father's reaction, which adds depth to their relationship.\n- The expectation that the narrator might copy down the list is not included.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion refers to \"Gatsby's death\" and the \"somber mood,\" which are not directly referenced in the original passage at this point, introducing an inaccurate context.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion blends Mr. Gatz's pride and the showing of the photograph, rather than presenting them as a progression.\n- The completion attributes the giving of the book to Gatsby, whereas the original describes Mr. Gatz finding it by accident.\n- The schedule and resolves are summarized rather than presented as a list, and some details are generalized or reworded, losing the specificity and structure of the original.\n- The completion adds reflective commentary and emotional interpretation that are not present in the original, such as the \"vindication\" in Mr. Gatz's voice and the \"sacred relic\" handling of the book."

I remember the fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This-or-That’s and the chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught sight of old acquaintances, and the matchings of invitations: “Are you going to the Ordways’? the Herseys’? the Schultzes’?” and the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands. And last the murky yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate.\nWhen we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow, began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and the dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild brace came suddenly into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our identity with this country for one strange hour, before we melted indistinguishably into it again.\nThat’s my Middle West—not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede towns, but the thrilling returning trains of my youth, and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a little solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are still called through decades by a family’s name. I see now that this has been a story of the West, after all—Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.\nEven when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware of its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the Ohio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the children and the very old—even then it had always for me a quality of distortion. West Egg, especially, still figures in my more fantastic dreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at once conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging sky and a lustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn men in dress suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles over the side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men turn in at a house—the wrong house. But no one knows the woman’s name, and no one cares.\nAfter Gatsby’s death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted beyond my eyes’ power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line I decided to come back home.",

So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line I decided to come back home.\n\nThere was one thing to be done before I left, one final party of service to perform, and I worried about it all the way to the city.

But I wanted to leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent sea to sweep my refuse away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and around what had happened to us together, and what had happened afterward to me, and she lay perfectly still, listening, in a big chair.\nShe was dressed to play golf, and I remember thinking she looked like a good illustration, her chin raised a little jauntily, her hair the colour of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee. When I had finished she told me without comment that she was engaged to another man. I doubted that, though there were several she could have married at a nod of her head, but I pretended to be surprised. For just a minute I wondered if I wasn’t making a mistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up to say goodbye.\n“Nevertheless you did throw me over,” said Jordan suddenly. “You threw me over on the telephone. I don’t give a damn about you now, but it was a new experience for me, and I felt a little dizzy for a while.”\nWe shook hands.\n“Oh, and do you remember”—she added—“a conversation we had once about driving a car?”\n“Why—not exactly.”\n“You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver? Well, I met another bad driver, didn’t I? I mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride.”\n“I’m thirty,” I said. “I’m five years too old to lie to myself and call it honour.”\nShe didn’t answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously sorry, I turned away.\nOne afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a little from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving sharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as I slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into the windows of a jewellery store. Suddenly he saw me and walked back, holding out his hand.\n“What’s the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me?”\n“Yes. You know what I think of you.”\n“You’re crazy, Nick,” he said quickly. “Crazy as hell. I don’t know what’s the matter with you.”\n“Tom,” I inquired, “what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?”\nHe stared at me without a word, and I knew I had guessed right about those missing hours. I started to turn away, but he took a step after me and grabbed my arm.\n“I told him the truth,” he said. “He came to the door while we were getting ready to leave, and when I sent down word that we weren’t in he tried to force his way upstairs. He was crazy enough to kill me if I hadn’t told him who owned the car. His hand was on a revolver in his pocket every minute he was in the house—” He broke off defiantly. “What if I did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw dust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy’s, but he was a tough one. He ran over Myrtle like you’d run over a dog and never even stopped his car.”\nThere was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it wasn’t true.\n“And if you think I didn’t have my share of suffering—look here, when I went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard, I sat down and cried like a baby. By God it was awful—”\nI couldn’t forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made…\nI shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as though I were talking to a child. Then he went into the jewellery store to buy a pearl necklace—or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons—rid of my provincial squeamishness forever.",

The grocery boy reported that the kitchen smelled like a tomb, and an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight on the white steps.\n\nI avoided the taxi driver who had taken Daisy and Gatsby to East Egg the night of the accident—he was the one who always pointed out Gatsby's house to visitors. I didn't want to hear whatever narrative he had constructed from the fragments he'd witnessed. I was sure he'd seen something, but whatever he'd seen had been filtered through the distorting lens of rumor and speculation.\n\nOn Saturday nights I still went to New York, because those gleaming, dazzling parties of his were so vivid in my mind that I could still hear the music and the laughter across the courtesy bay. And sometimes, late at night, I'd see a car turn into his drive and I would wonder if it was a guest arriving at the wrong hour, unaware that the party was over forever.\n\nOn my last night I went over to his house. The lawn and drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his corruption—but he had stood on those steps, concealing his incorruptible dream, as he waved goodbye.\n\nI found the obscene word, traced on the white steps with a piece of brick. I erased it, drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone.\n\nThen I wandered down to the beach and sprawled out upon the sand. Most of the big shore places were closed now, and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound.
