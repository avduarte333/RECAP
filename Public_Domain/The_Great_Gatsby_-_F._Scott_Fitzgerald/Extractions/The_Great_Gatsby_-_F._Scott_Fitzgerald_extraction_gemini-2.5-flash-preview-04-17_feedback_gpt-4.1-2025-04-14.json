            "Nick confesses that his tolerance for human behavior is not limitless, particularly after a disillusioning experience back East.",

            "Nick describes Gatsby as possessing a 'gorgeous' quality, an exceptional sensitivity to life's possibilities, comparing it to a seismograph.",
            "This quality wasn't mere impressionability but an unparalleled capacity for hope and romantic readiness.",
            "Nick concludes that Gatsby himself was fundamentally decent; it was the corrupting influences surrounding his aspirations ('what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams') that temporarily soured Nick's view of humanity."

In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgements, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.\nAnd, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.",

I had been in West Egg for several months now and I had never been to a party, or even to a house, where I knew anyone. I had been invited to Gatsby's several times, but I had always been too busy. This time, however, I had nothing to do. I was curious about Gatsby, too. Everyone talked about him, but no one seemed to know him. He was a figure of rumour and speculation, a man who lived in a mansion that blazed with light and music every Saturday night, yet remained utterly unknown to his neighbours. The invitation was a small, stiff card, engraved with his name in an elaborate script. It felt important, a summons to a world I had only observed from a distance. I accepted, feeling a mixture of excitement and apprehension. I had heard stories about these parties – wild, extravagant affairs filled with people who came and went without ever meeting their host. I wondered what kind of man threw such parties, and what kind of people attended them. As the chauffeur drove away, leaving me with the crisp card in my hand, I felt a sense of anticipation. The evening promised to be an adventure, a glimpse into the mysterious life of Jay Gatsby and the glittering, superficial world he inhabited. It was my first step into the heart of West Egg's social scene, a world that would soon become both fascinating and ultimately disillusioning."

It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York—and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals—like the egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual wonder to the gulls that fly overhead.

My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsby’s mansion. Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbour’s lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a month.\nAcross the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I’d known Tom in college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.\nHer husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven—a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savours of anticlimax. His family were enormously wealthy—even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he’d left Chicago and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for instance, he’d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest. It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.\nWhy they came East I don’t know. They had spent a year in France for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn’t believe it—I had no sight into Daisy’s heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.\nAnd so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.",

It was on West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two eggs, so to speak, that jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western Hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They were not perfect ovals—like the egg in the Columbus story, they were both crushed flat at the contact end—but their physical resemblance must have been a source of perpetual wonder to the gulls that flew overhead. To the wingless a more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size. My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the bay, and it was a small, eyesore of a place, squeezed between two colossal places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was Gatsby’s mansion. Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby then, it was a colossal affair that belonged to a man named Gatsby. It was a factual imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin coat of white cement, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was the kind of house that, seen from the road, suggested a sort of defiant, if not entirely successful, attempt to outdo the past, to build something so grand that it could not be ignored, a monument to wealth and ambition that seemed to mock the very idea of subtlety. My own modest dwelling, with its weather-beaten shingles and single chimney, seemed to shrink in its shadow, an inconspicuous molehill beside a mountain. Yet, from my porch, I had a partial view of the water, and a glimpse of the white palaces of fashionable East Egg, glittering across the bay. The contrast was stark and immediate. East Egg, with its established aristocracy, its old money, its air of inherited privilege, lay serene and confident across the water. West Egg, my new home, pulsed with the raw, restless energy of the newly rich, a place where fortunes were made and spent with a dizzying speed, where the parties were louder, the cars faster, and the display of wealth more ostentatious, almost desperate. It was a place of constant flux, of people who arrived and departed with the tides of the market, their lives lived out in a perpetual state of performance. The air itself seemed charged with a kind of frantic gaiety, a superficial sparkle that barely concealed an underlying current of dissatisfaction, a yearning for something undefined, something just out of reach. The nights were filled with the sound of music drifting across the lawn from Gatsby’s house, the laughter and chatter of hundreds of guests, the roar of expensive cars arriving and departing. It was a world I had only read about, a world of excess and extravagance that felt both alluring and slightly repellent. I was an outsider, a quiet observer from the Midwest, drawn into this vortex of wealth and ambition, unsure of what I would find or what it would demand of me. The sheer scale of it all was overwhelming, the casual disregard for convention, the relentless pursuit of pleasure. It was a place built on dreams, some grand and noble, others perhaps less so, all of them pursued with a fierce, almost violent intensity. And at the heart of it all, across the bay, lay the promise of East Egg, the world that West Egg so desperately emulated, the world that held the object of Gatsby’s own, as yet unknown to me, profound and singular desire. The green light at the end of Daisy’s dock, though I wouldn't understand its significance for some time, was already there, a faint, solitary beacon in the darkness, a symbol of a hope so vast it seemed to encompass the entire continent.",

Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.\nHis speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts.\n“Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he seemed to say, “just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are.” We were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.\nWe talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.\n“I’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly.\nTurning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped the tide offshore.\n“It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.” He turned me around again, politely and abruptly. “We’ll go inside.”\nWe walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.\nThe only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.\nThe younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.\nThe other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the room.\n“I’m p-paralysed with happiness.”\nShe laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she had. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker. (I’ve heard it said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)\nAt any rate, Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.\nI looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered “Listen,” a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.",

All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath, and there’s a persistent wail all night along the north shore.”\n“How gorgeous! Let’s go back, Tom. Tomorrow!” Then she added irrelevantly: “You ought to see the baby.”\n“I’d like to.”\n“She’s asleep. She’s three years old. Haven’t you ever seen her?”\n“Never.”\n“Well, you ought to see her. She’s—”\nTom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder.\n“What you doing, Nick?”\n“I’m a bond man.”\n“Who with?”\nI told him.\n“Never heard of them,” he remarked decisively.\nThis annoyed me.\n“You will,” I answered shortly. “You will if you stay in the East.”\n“Oh, I’ll stay in the East, don’t you worry,” he said, glancing at Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more. “I’d be a God damned fool to live anywhere else.”\nAt this point Miss Baker said: “Absolutely!” with such suddenness that I started—it was the first word she had uttered since I came into the room. Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.\n“I’m stiff,” she complained, “I’ve been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember.”\n“Don’t look at me,” Daisy retorted, “I’ve been trying to get you to New York all afternoon.”\n“No, thanks,” said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry. “I’m absolutely in training.”\nHer host looked at her incredulously.\n“You are!” He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass. “How you ever get anything done is beyond me.”\nI looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she “got done.” I enjoyed looking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming, discontented face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before.\n“You live in West Egg,” she remarked contemptuously. “I know somebody there.”\n“I don’t know a single—”\n“You must know Gatsby.”\n“Gatsby?” demanded Daisy. “What Gatsby?”\nBefore I could reply that he was my neighbour dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.",

She snapped them out with her fingers. “In two weeks it’ll be the longest day in the year.” She looked at us all radiantly. “Do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it.”\n“We ought to plan something,” yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed.\n“All right,” said Daisy. “What’ll we plan?” She turned to me helplessly: “What do people plan?”\nBefore I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her little finger.\n“Look!” she complained; “I hurt it.”\nWe all looked—the knuckle was black and blue.\n“You did it, Tom,” she said accusingly. “I know you didn’t mean to, but you did do it. That’s what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a great, big, hulking physical specimen of a—”\n“I hate that word ‘hulking,’ ” objected Tom crossly, “even in kidding.”\n“Hulking,” insisted Daisy.\nSometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire. They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the West, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself.\n“You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,” I confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret. “Can’t you talk about crops or something?”\nI meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in an unexpected way.\n“Civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out Tom violently. “I’ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read The Rise of the Coloured Empires by this man Goddard?”\n“Why, no,” I answered, rather surprised by his tone.\n“Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly submerged. It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.”\n“Tom’s getting very profound,” said Daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness. “He reads deep books with long words in them. What was that word we—”\n“Well, these books are all scientific,” insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently. “This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It’s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things.”\n“We’ve got to beat them down,” whispered Daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun.\n“You ought to live in California—” began Miss Baker, but Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.\n“This idea is that we’re Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are, and—” After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again. “—And we’ve produced all the things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all that. Do you see?”\nThere was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned towards me.",

            "prefix-probing": "Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two young women preceded us out on to a rosy-coloured porch, open toward the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind. The candles cast a soft, wavering light on their faces as they sat down. Daisy and Jordan were dressed in white, their dresses rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown in by the wind. There was an excitement in the air, a sense of anticipation that seemed to emanate from the women themselves. Tom Buchanan, a powerful, arrogant figure, was already seated, his back to the sunset, his eyes fixed on the newcomers. He was a man of thirty, with a hard mouth and a supercilious manner. His body was capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body, built for power.\n\n\"I'm stiff,\" Tom announced, stretching his arms and yawning. \"I've been lying on that sofa for ages.\"\n\nDaisy laughed, a low, thrilling murmur that made you want to lean closer. \"You've been reading, haven't you, Tom?\"\n\n\"Activity,\" he snorted. \"I've been reading about civilization's collapse. It's all scientific stuff; this fellow has worked it all out. We're Nordics. We're the dominant race.\"\n\nNick felt a chill. This was the casual cruelty of immense wealth and privilege. He looked at Daisy, who was watching her husband with an expression that was difficult to read – a mixture of amusement and something else, something resigned.\n\n\"Tom's getting very profound,\" Daisy said lightly, turning to Nick. \"He reads deep books with long words in them. What was that word we—\"\n\n\"Well, these books are all scientific,\" Tom interrupted impatiently. \"This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It's up to us, the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things.\"\n\n\"We've got to beat them down,\" whispered Daisy, winking at Nick with an absurd air of secrecy.\n\n\"You understand,\" Tom insisted, \"if we don't look out the white race will be utterly submerged. It's all scientific, it's been proved.\"\n\n\"Tom's getting very profound,\" repeated Daisy, this time with a touch of weariness.\n\nThe conversation drifted, touching on trivialities, the weather, the latest gossip. Nick felt like an observer in a play, watching these beautiful, wealthy people navigate their lives. Jordan Baker, the professional golfer, sat erect, her chin raised, her eyes scanning the horizon with a cool, detached gaze. She had a striking, almost boyish figure, and a face that was both lovely and hard.\n\n\"You must know Gatsby,\" Jordan said suddenly, turning her head toward Nick.\n\nNick was startled. \"Gatsby? I live next door to him.\"\n\n\"You do?\" Her eyes widened slightly. \"I thought everybody knew Gatsby.\"\n\n\"I don't,\" Daisy said. \"I've never met him.\"\n\n\"Well, you ought to,\" Jordan said. \"He's giving a party Saturday night. You must come.\"\n\n\"I'd like to,\" Nick said.\n\n\"I'll send you a card,\" Jordan promised.\n\nThe mention of Gatsby seemed to introduce a new element into the conversation, a ripple of curiosity and perhaps a hint of unease. Tom shifted in his chair, his eyes narrowing slightly.\n\n\"Who is this Gatsby?\" he asked, his voice heavy with suspicion.\n\n\"He's just a man named Gatsby,\" Jordan said dismissively. \"He lives in West Egg.\"\n\n\"I know he lives in West Egg,\" Tom said. \"I was asking who he is.\"\n\n\"Nobody knows,\" Jordan said with a shrug. \"He just appeared one day.\"\n\nDaisy was silent, her gaze fixed on the flickering candles. The light caught the jewels on her fingers, making them sparkle like tiny stars. There was a sadness in her eyes, a deep, unspoken melancholy that seemed out of place amidst the opulence and gaiety.\n\nThe telephone rang inside the house, and Tom excused himself to answer it. As soon as he was gone, Daisy leaned forward, her voice dropping to a confidential whisper.\n\n\"You see?\" she said, her eyes pleading. \"You see what I mean?\"\n\nNick didn't understand. \"See what?\"\n\n\"Everything's in confusion,\" she said desperately. \"I don't know what to do. I don't know what's going to happen.\"\n\nJordan Baker yawned delicately. \"You ought to be in bed,\" she said to Daisy.\n\n\"I know,\" Daisy sighed. \"But I can't sleep. I haven't been able to sleep for weeks.\"\n\nTom returned, his face flushed with anger. \"It was the garage,\" he said curtly. \"They want me to come down there.\"\n\nHe stood for a moment, looking out at the sunset, his hands on his hips. He seemed restless, dissatisfied, despite his immense wealth and power.\n\n\"Well, I'm going to bed,\" Jordan announced, standing up. \"Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you Saturday.\"\n\nShe nodded coolly and walked into the house.\n\nDaisy stood up too, her white dress shimmering in the twilight. \"Good night, Nick,\" she said softly. \"It was so good to see you.\"\n\nShe hesitated for a moment, as if she wanted to say something more, but then she turned and followed Jordan inside.\n\nNick was left alone on the porch, the four candles still flickering on the table. The air was filled with the scent of honeysuckle and the distant sound of the sea. He felt a profound sense of isolation, a feeling that he had stumbled into a world that was both dazzling and deeply unsettling. He looked out at the dark water, thinking about the people he had just met, their lives of privilege and discontent. He thought about Gatsby, the mysterious man who lived next door, and the party he was giving on Saturday night. He had a feeling that his life in West Egg was just beginning, and that it would be very different from anything he had ever known. The night deepened, and the stars came out, cold and distant, like the people in the house. He sat there for a long time, contemplating the strange, glittering world he had entered.",

Do you want to hear about the butler’s nose?”\n“That’s why I came over tonight.”\n“Well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people. He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it began to affect his nose—”\n“Things went from bad to worse,” suggested Miss Baker.\n“Yes. Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up his position.”\nFor a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.\nThe butler came back and murmured something close to Tom’s ear, whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went inside. As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and singing.\n“I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a—of a rose, an absolute rose. Doesn’t he?” She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation: “An absolute rose?”\nThis was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house.\nMiss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said “Sh!” in a warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond, and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to hear. The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.\n“This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbour—” I began.\n“Don’t talk. I want to hear what happens.”\n“Is something happening?” I inquired innocently.\n“You mean to say you don’t know?” said Miss Baker, honestly surprised. “I thought everybody knew.”\n“I don’t.”\n“Why—” she said hesitantly. “Tom’s got some woman in New York.”\n“Got some woman?” I repeated blankly.\nMiss Baker nodded.\n“She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time. Don’t you think?”\nAlmost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at the table.\n“It couldn’t be helped!” cried Daisy with tense gaiety.\nShe sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and continued: “I looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very romantic outdoors. There’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He’s singing away—” Her voice sang: “It’s romantic, isn’t it, Tom?”\n“Very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to me: “If it’s light enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables.”\nThe telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone, and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldn’t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police.",

          "text_segment": "The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while, trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.\nDaisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl.\n“We don’t know each other very well, Nick,” she said suddenly. “Even if we are cousins. You didn’t come to my wedding.”\n“I wasn’t back from the war.”\n“That’s true.” She hesitated. “Well, I’ve had a very bad time, Nick, and I’m pretty cynical about everything.”\nEvidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn’t say any more, and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter.\n“I suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything.”\n“Oh, yes.” She looked at me absently. “Listen, Nick; let me tell you what I said when she was born. Would you like to hear?”\n“Very much.”\n“It’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel about—things. Well, she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and wept. ‘All right,’ I said, ‘I’m glad it’s a girl. And I hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.’\n“You see I think everything’s terrible anyhow,” she went on in a convinced way. “Everybody thinks so—the most advanced people. And I know. I’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.” Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom’s, and she laughed with thrilling scorn. “Sophisticated—God, I’m sophisticated!”\nThe instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited, and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged.\nInside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the Saturday Evening Post—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running together in a soothing tune. The lamplight, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.\nWhen we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.\n“To be continued,” she said, tossing the magazine on the table, “in our very next issue.”\nHer body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she stood up.\n“Ten o’clock,” she remarked, apparently finding the time on the ceiling. “Time for this good girl to go to bed.”\n“Jordan’s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,” explained Daisy, “over at Westchester.”\n“Oh—you’re Jordan Baker.”\nI knew now why her face was familiar—its pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I had forgotten long ago.\n“Good night,” she said softly. “Wake me at eight, won’t you.”\n“If you’ll get up.”\n“I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.”\n“Of course you will,” confirmed Daisy.",

You know—lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing—”\n“Good night,” called Miss Baker from the stairs. “I haven’t heard a word.”\n“She’s a nice girl,” said Tom after a moment. “They oughtn’t to let her run around the country this way.”\n“Who oughtn’t to?” inquired Daisy coldly.\n“Her family.”\n“Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick’s going to look after her, aren’t you, Nick? She’s going to spend lots of weekends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be very good for her.”\nDaisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.\n“Is she from New York?” I asked quickly.\n“From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our beautiful white—”\n“Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?” demanded Tom suddenly.\n“Did I?” She looked at me. “I can’t seem to remember, but I think we talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I’m sure we did. It sort of crept up on us and first thing you know—”\n“Don’t believe everything you hear, Nick,” he advised me.\nI said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes later I got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor Daisy peremptorily called: “Wait!\n“I forgot to ask you something, and it’s important. We heard you were engaged to a girl out West.”\n“That’s right,” corroborated Tom kindly. “We heard that you were engaged.”\n“It’s a libel. I’m too poor.”\n“But we heard it,” insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again in a flower-like way. “We heard it from three people, so it must be true.”\nOf course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn’t even vaguely engaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the reasons I had come East. You can’t stop going with an old friend on account of rumours, and on the other hand I had no intention of being rumoured into marriage.\nTheir interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in arms—but apparently there were no such intentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he “had some woman in New York” was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.\nAlready it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages, where new red petrol-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight, and, turning my head to watch it, I saw that I was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbour’s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens.\nI decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and that would do for an introduction. But I didn’t call to him, for he gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone—he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was from him, I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.",

            "prefix-probing": "“In fact I think I’ll arrange a marriage,” Daisy said, tilting her head back against the cushions of the divan, her voice a low, thrilling murmur that promised excitement and delivered only a carefully cultivated boredom. The late afternoon sun, filtered through the awnings of her East Egg mansion, cast a golden haze over the room, illuminating the restless energy that seemed to vibrate just beneath the surface of their languid poses. Jordan Baker, stretched out on the opposite side of the room like a sleek, golden idol, merely blinked slowly, her eyes half-closed against the light. Nick Carraway, perched awkwardly on the edge of his chair, felt the familiar pull of their world – its effortless wealth, its casual cruelty, its profound, glittering emptiness. “For whom?” he managed, feeling slightly ridiculous for engaging with the absurdity. Daisy waved a hand vaguely in the air, a gesture as light and insubstantial as the chiffon of her dress. “Oh, anyone. Someone who needs arranging. Perhaps Pammy, when she’s older. Find her a nice, solid man. Not too exciting, you know. Excitement is so tiring.” She sighed, a delicate sound that seemed to dissipate into the warm air. “Everything’s so confusing now. Don’t you think, Nick? All this… change.” She didn’t elaborate on what ‘change’ she meant, but Nick knew. It was the change Gatsby represented, the intrusion of a raw, insistent dream into their carefully ordered reality. The air in the room seemed to thicken, charged with unspoken things. Jordan finally stirred, pushing herself up with a fluid grace. “Arranging marriages sounds dreadfully energetic, Daisy. Are you sure you’re up to it?” Her voice was dry, edged with the cynical amusement that was her shield. Daisy laughed, a bright, artificial sound. “Oh, I wouldn’t *do* it myself, darling. I’d have someone *else* do it. That’s the point of having things, isn’t it? To have people do things for you.” She looked at Nick then, her eyes, bright and lovely, holding a flicker of something he couldn’t quite decipher – a plea, perhaps, or just the reflection of the afternoon light. “You should come over more often, Nick. It’s so dull here sometimes. Tom’s always… doing things.” She trailed off, the implication hanging in the air like the scent of the gardenias outside. Tom Buchanan, a force of nature even in his absence, was undoubtedly ‘doing things’ somewhere – perhaps in the city, perhaps in the Valley of Ashes, his restless, powerful body seeking an outlet for its boundless energy and discontent. Nick thought of Gatsby, standing alone on his dock across the bay, reaching out towards the green light. He thought of the parties at Gatsby’s mansion, the chaotic, vibrant energy that pulsed through the nights, a stark contrast to the polished, sterile calm of the Buchanan house. Gatsby’s world was built on a dream, a desperate, fervent hope. Daisy’s world was built on inherited wealth and a carefully maintained illusion of happiness. And here they were, caught between the two, in the suffocating heat of a summer afternoon. “It’s getting late,” Jordan said, standing up fully. “I have to be somewhere.” She didn’t say where, and no one asked. Her life, like theirs, was a series of appointments and diversions, designed to fill the hours and keep the deeper questions at bay. Daisy didn’t protest. She simply smiled, a perfect, empty smile. “Goodbye, Jordan. Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.” Jordan’s lips curved slightly. “That leaves a great deal of room.” She nodded curtly at Nick and glided out of the room, leaving behind a faint scent of expensive perfume. Nick felt the silence descend, heavier now. Daisy was looking out the window, her profile etched against the bright sky. “Do you think,” she said softly, her voice losing its artificial lilt, becoming almost childlike, “that people ever really change?” It was a question that hung in the air, unanswered, perhaps unanswerable. Nick looked at her, at the beautiful, troubled face, and thought of Gatsby’s unwavering belief in the possibility of recapturing the past. He thought of the immense, tragic hope that fueled Gatsby’s existence. And he knew, with a certainty that chilled him despite the heat, that some things, some people, were destined to remain forever trapped in the gilded cage of their own making, forever reaching for a green light that would always recede into the distance. The afternoon stretched on, long and empty, filled only with the sound of the cicadas outside and the quiet, persistent hum of their shared, inescapable reality. He wanted to leave, to escape the oppressive atmosphere, but he felt rooted to the spot, a silent observer in a drama he couldn’t comprehend, let alone influence. Daisy turned back from the window, her smile returning, a mask slipping back into place. “Well,” she said, her voice bright again, “what shall we do now? It’s so dreadfully hot.” The question hung in the air, not a genuine inquiry, but a desperate plea to fill the void, to distract from the emptiness that lay beneath the surface of their privileged lives. And Nick knew, with a sinking heart, that there was nothing to do, nowhere to go, except to continue playing their parts in the elaborate, tragic performance that was their life. The sun dipped lower, casting long shadows across the lawn, and the green light across the bay began its slow, inevitable emergence from the twilight, a beacon of a dream that was both impossibly close and forever out of reach.",

There’s something in that voice of hers . . .’Her voice was husky, thrilling, full of secrets. She laughed again. ‘It’s murmurous and full of singing. . . . It’s—’She hesitated. ‘I told that to Tom last night.’‘Go on. You weren’t so sentimental yesterday.’‘And she might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time. Isn’t that true, Tom?’‘What?’ He looked at her blankly.‘Didn’t you telephone me at dinner time?’‘That was some time ago,’ he said.I waited, but she didn’t say any more, and after a moment I told the butler to tell the chauffeur to put the top down.‘That’s right,’ murmured Daisy. ‘What you doing, Nick?’‘I’m going to get a taxi to West Egg.’ Instead of being annoyed, she seemed relieved. ‘Well,

You know—lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing—’‘Daisy!’‘I will, honestly. I’m absolutely helpless in my own hands. There’s something in that voice of hers . . .’Her voice was husky, thrilling, full of secrets. She laughed again. ‘It’s murmurous and full of singing. . . . It’s—’She hesitated. ‘I told that to Tom last night.’‘Go on. You weren’t so sentimental yesterday.’‘And she might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time. Isn’t that true, Tom?’‘What?’ He looked at her blankly.‘Didn’t you telephone me at dinner time?’‘That was some time ago,’ he said.I waited, but she didn’t say any more, and after a moment I told the butler to tell the chauffeur to put the top down.‘That’s right,’ murmured Daisy. ‘What you doing, Nick?’‘I’m going to get a taxi to West Egg.’ Instead of being annoyed, she seemed relieved. ‘Well,

This is a valley of ashes—a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of ash-grey men, who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud, which screens their obscure operations from your sight.\nBut above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic—their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face, but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself into eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days, under sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.\nThe valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and, when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an hour. There is always a halt there of at least a minute, and it was because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan’s mistress.",

The only building in sight was a small, flat-chested garage for rent at eighty a month. The only car was a dusty Ford which crouched in a dim corner. It had occurred to me that this garage might be more than it was, but Tom Buchanan quickly dispelled the illusion by leading me inside. The proprietor appeared in a doorway, and Tom introduced him to me as Mr. George B. Wilson. His eyes, meanwhile, roved over the garage triumphantly. “How’s business?” he asked, grinning. “I can’t complain,” answered Wilson unconvincingly. “When are you going to sell me that car?” “Next week; I’ve got my man working on it now.” “Works pretty slow, doesn’t he?” “No, he’s a good worker,” he said, starting to polish the dashboard with a cloth. “His name is Michael. He’s been working for me for twelve years. If he gets it done by Saturday, I’ll let you have it for five hundred dollars.” “I’ll take it,” said Tom, “but I’ll have to see it first.” “I’ll have it ready for you by Saturday afternoon,” said Wilson, his eyes flashing with a sudden hope. “I’ll have it ready for you by Saturday afternoon,” repeated Tom, and then he added, “I’ll have to see it first, of course.” “Of course,” said Wilson, and

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces a lengthy, repetitive dialogue about a car transaction that is not present in the original passage. This invented exchange dominates the latter part of the completion and disrupts the intended narrative flow.\n- The completion omits the description of the three distinct shops in the building, including their specific functions and arrangement, which is a key structural element in the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion lacks details about the building's appearance, its setting in relation to the waste land, and the sense of isolation conveyed by its surroundings.\n- The description of the shops, including which are for rent, which is a restaurant, and which is a garage, is missing. The original provides a clear enumeration and characterization of these establishments.\n- The completion does not include the narrator's internal speculation about the garage possibly concealing something more luxurious above it.\n- The physical and emotional description of the proprietor, including his demeanor and the subtle hope in his eyes, is only partially addressed and lacks the nuance of the original.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes the garage as being for rent at a specific price, which is not part of the original description.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the introduction of George B. Wilson and the dialogue about business and the car sale occur prematurely and in a manner inconsistent with the original order.\n- The completion invents a character (Michael) and details about his employment, which are not present in the original.\n- The repeated dialogue about the car being ready by a certain day is not only invented but also disrupts the pacing and focus of the scene.\n- The emotional responses and actions of the characters, particularly Tom and Wilson, are inaccurately portrayed, with invented lines and reactions that do not align with the original passage's tone or content."

Then I heard footsteps on a stairs, and in a moment the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door. She was in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her flesh sensuously as some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue crêpe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty, but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering. She smiled slowly and, walking through her husband as if he were a ghost, shook hands with Tom, looking him flush in the eye. Then she wet her lips, and without turning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice:\n“Get some chairs, why don’t you, so somebody can sit down.”\n“Oh, sure,” agreed Wilson hurriedly, and went toward the little office, mingling immediately with the cement colour of the walls. A white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinity—except his wife, who moved close to Tom.\n“I want to see you,” said Tom intently. “Get on the next train.”\n“All right.”\n“I’ll meet you by the newsstand on the lower level.”\nShe nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson emerged with two chairs from his office door.",

When he spoke he groped for words, and his voice was a husky whisper. He was the kind of man who would drift forever in the dust, for whom the world was a grey, searching thing. Tom’s greeting seemed to inject a momentary spark, but it quickly faded. “Hello, Mr. Buchanan,” he said, his eyes shifting nervously. “What can I do for you?” “I want to see you about that car,” said Tom. “I’ll let you have it for fifty dollars.” Wilson’s face brightened slightly. “The coupé? That’s a fair price, Mr. Buchanan. I could use a car like that. Business is slow.” “Yeah, well, I need the money,” Tom lied easily. He glanced around the dusty garage, his eyes scanning the dim interior. Just then, a woman emerged from a back room, wiping her hands on a greasy rag. She was stout, in her middle thirties, and faintly stout, but carried her flesh sensuously as some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue crepe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty, but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering. She looked at Tom with an undisguised eagerness that made Nick uncomfortable. “Hello, Myrtle,” said Tom, his voice changing subtly. “Hello, Tom,” she said, her voice husky. She didn’t acknowledge Wilson or Nick. Her eyes were fixed on Tom. “I brought a friend,” Tom said, gesturing vaguely towards Nick. Myrtle gave Nick a brief, indifferent glance. “Oh. Hello.” Wilson watched the exchange, his anaemic eyes following Myrtle’s movements. There was a faint, almost imperceptible tension in the air. Tom seemed to expand in Myrtle’s presence, becoming more dominant, more assured. Myrtle, in turn, seemed to draw energy from him, her vitality increasing. The contrast between her vibrant presence and Wilson’s listless one was stark. Tom turned back to Wilson, his tone businesslike again. “So, about that car. Fifty dollars. Cash.” Wilson nodded slowly. “I’ll take it, Mr. Buchanan. I’ll need a few days to get the money together.” “Alright,” said Tom. “Let me know when you have it.” He gave Myrtle another look, a look that passed between them like a current. Myrtle smiled, a slow, knowing smile. “I’ll be in touch, Tom.” Tom grinned. “Good.” He turned to Nick and Daisy. “Alright, let’s go. Nothing more here.” Daisy, who had been standing silently, looking slightly repulsed by the surroundings, nodded eagerly. As they turned to leave, Myrtle disappeared back into the rear room. Wilson stood by the car, looking after them, his face returning to its usual expression of weary resignation. The brief spark ignited by Tom’s arrival had completely died out. The dust seemed to settle back over everything.",

She smiled slowly and, walking through the garage, toward the front office, stopped and stared at me for a moment before she turned her eyes toward Tom. Her glance left Wilson and traveled up over his head, not stopping until it had reached Tom’s face. “Hello, Wilson,” she agreed calmly. “Here’s your wife,” said Tom, bringing her forward. “She’s going to have an automobile party on us.”\n“I’ve got to get some gas,” concluded Wilson, and hurried away into the garage, toward the pumps, leaving us sitting in the hot struggle of the forty-ninth street elevated structure. Before he came back Myrtle took her place in the car with a determined movement of her hips and covered the upholstery with a thick layer of dust. “Sit down, Tom,” she ordered, “and let’s start.”\n“Hold on,” said Tom. “I first want to get some more gas. Get over in the front with Wilson, and let me talk to your wife.”\n“I can’t do that,” said Wilson. “I’m all covered with dust.”\n“Well, then, you sit still where you are,” commanded Tom, “and let me talk to your wife.”\nWilson obeyed.

                "text": "“Hello, Wilson, old man,” said Tom, slapping him jovially on the shoulder. “How’s business?”\n“I can’t complain,” answered Wilson unconvincingly. “When are you going to sell me that car?”\n“Next week; I’ve got my man working on it now.”\n“Works pretty slow, don’t he?”\n“No, he doesn’t,” said Tom coldly. “And if you feel that way about it, maybe I’d better sell it somewhere else after all.”\n“I don’t mean that,” explained Wilson quickly. “I just meant——”\nHis voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage. Then I heard footsteps on a stairs, and in a moment the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door. She was in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her flesh sensuously as some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue crepe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering. She smiled slowly and, walking through the garage, toward the front office, stopped and stared at me for a moment before she turned her eyes toward Tom. Her glance left Wilson and traveled up over his head, not stopping until it had reached Tom’s face. “Hello, Wilson,” she agreed calmly. “Here’s your wife,” said Tom, bringing her forward. “She’s going to have an automobile party on us.”\n“I’ve got to get some gas,” concluded Wilson, and hurried away into the garage, toward the pumps, leaving us sitting in the hot struggle of the forty-ninth street elevated structure. Before he came back Myrtle took her place in the car with a determined movement of her hips and covered the upholstery with a thick layer of dust. “Sit down, Tom,” she ordered, “and let’s start.”\n“Hold on,” said Tom. “I first want to get some more gas. Get over in the front with Wilson, and let me talk to your wife.”\n“I can’t do that,” said Wilson. “I’m all covered with dust.”\n“Well, then, you sit still where you are,” commanded Tom, “and let me talk to your wife.”\nWilson obeyed. His wife, after a moment of hesitation, sat down beside him and waited. Tom leaned against the front fender and said, “I want to see you.”\n“I can’t to-day,” she answered. “I’m all tied up.”\n“Well, then, I’ll come to-morrow night.”\n“I can’t to-morrow night. I’m all tied up.”\n“Well, then,” said Tom, “when can you come?”\n“I can’t to-day,” she repeated. “I’m all tied up.”\n“Well, then, I’ll come to-morrow night.”\n“I can’t to-morrow night.

A minute later Myrtle Wilson came out again, her face powdered and her eyebrows a little reduced. “I’ll take a taxi,” she told Tom.\n“You may as well take a taxi.”\nWe waited outside the garage, while his wife hurried on before.

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- In the middle of the passage, the completion invents a lengthy, repetitive dialogue between Tom and Myrtle that does not exist in the original. This invented exchange dominates the latter half of the completion and disrupts the flow and structure of the scene.\n- The completion omits the original's key sequence where Myrtle enters, interacts with Tom, and gives instructions to Wilson, as well as the subsequent private exchange between Tom and Myrtle. Instead, it introduces new actions and dialogue that are not present in the source material.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion leaves out the original's description of Myrtle's physical presence and the narrator's observations about her vitality and appearance.\n- The specific actions Myrtle takes upon entering, such as her interaction with Tom and her directive to Wilson about the chairs, are missing.\n- The completion does not include the atmospheric details about the garage environment, such as the dust and the way it affects the characters' appearances, except for a brief mention of dust in a different context.\n- The original's private, urgent conversation between Tom and Myrtle, including their arrangement to meet and the specific location, is not accurately represented.\n- The completion omits the closing action where Myrtle moves away from Tom as Wilson returns with the chairs.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces an inaccurate sequence of events, such as Myrtle's invented dialogue and actions that do not align with the original narrative.\n- There are misattributed actions, such as Myrtle ordering Tom to sit down and the invented scenario of her taking a seat in the car, which do not occur in the original.\n- The completion repeats a fabricated exchange between Tom and Myrtle multiple times, which is not present in the source and disrupts the intended pacing and progression of the scene.\n- The completion inaccurately describes the setting and the characters' positions, such as references to the car and the elevated structure, which are not part of the original passage at this point.\n\nTo improve, focus on accurately capturing the sequence of events, the key character interactions, and the descriptive details present in the original, while avoiding the introduction of invented dialogue or actions."

          "text_segment": "We waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was a few days before the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.\n“Terrible place, isn’t it,” said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor Eckleburg.\n“Awful.”\n“It does her good to get away.”\n“Doesn’t her husband object?”\n“Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He’s so dumb he doesn’t know he’s alive.”\nSo Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York—or not quite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom deferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be on the train.\nShe had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin, which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in New York. At the newsstand she bought a copy of Town Tattle and a moving-picture magazine, and in the station drugstore some cold cream and a small flask of perfume. Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one, lavender-coloured with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately she turned sharply from the window and, leaning forward, tapped on the front glass.\n“I want to get one of those dogs,” she said earnestly. “I want to get one for the apartment. They’re nice to have—a dog.”\nWe backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John D. Rockefeller. In a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an indeterminate breed.\n“What kind are they?” asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly, as he came to the taxi-window.\n“All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?”\n“I’d like to get one of those police dogs; I don’t suppose you got that kind?”\nThe man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and drew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.\n“That’s no police dog,” said Tom.\n“No, it’s not exactly a police dog,” said the man with disappointment in his voice. “It’s more of an Airedale.” He passed his hand over the brown washrag of a back. “Look at that coat. Some coat. That’s a dog that’ll never bother you with catching cold.”\n“I think it’s cute,” said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. “How much is it?”\n“That dog?” He looked at it admiringly. “That dog will cost you ten dollars.”\nThe Airedale—undoubtedly there was an Airedale concerned in it somewhere, though its feet were startlingly white—changed hands and settled down into Mrs. Wilson’s lap, where she fondled the weatherproof coat with rapture.\n“Is it a boy or a girl?” she asked delicately.\n“That dog? That dog’s a boy.”\n“It’s a bitch,” said Tom decisively. “Here’s your money. Go and buy ten more dogs with it.”",

He knew that Wilson was coming next week to get the car.\n“Oh, I don’t mean to hurry you,” said Wilson. “Myrtle’ll be down in a minute.”\n“Oh, yes.” He looked at us with blank eyes as we drove away.\nBlinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant groaning of the train that was going away, I was about to address him when she came out of the garage, followed by Tom next door.

I wouldn’t have been surprised to see a great flock of white sheep turn the corner.\n“Hold on,” I said, “I have to leave you here.”\n“No you don’t,” interposed Tom quickly. “Myrtle’ll be hurt if you don’t come up to the apartment. Won’t you, Myrtle?”\n“Come on,” she urged. “I’ll telephone my sister Catherine. She’s said to be very beautiful by people who ought to know.”\n“Well, I’d like to, but—”\nWe went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds. At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses. Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the neighbourhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases, and went haughtily in.\n“I’m going to have the McKees come up,” she announced as we rose in the elevator. “And, of course, I got to call up my sister, too.”\nThe apartment was on the top floor—a small living-room, a small dining-room, a small bedroom, and a bath. The living-room was crowded to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it, so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was an over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock. Looked at from a distance, however, the hen resolved itself into a bonnet, and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room. Several old copies of Town Tattle lay on the table together with a copy of Simon Called Peter, and some of the small scandal magazines of Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with the dog. A reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk, to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large, hard dog biscuits—one of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whisky from a locked bureau door.",

Sitting on Tom’s lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the telephone; then there were no cigarettes, and I went out to buy some at the drugstore on the corner. When I came back they had both disappeared, so I sat down discreetly in the living-room and read a chapter of Simon Called Peter—either it was terrible stuff or the whisky distorted things, because it didn’t make any sense to me.\nJust as Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called each other by our first names) reappeared, company commenced to arrive at the apartment door.\nThe sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty, with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky white. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle, but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved about there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary haste, and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I wondered if she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed immoderately, repeated my question aloud, and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel.\nMr. McKee was a pale, feminine man from the flat below. He had just shaved, for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone, and he was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room. He informed me that he was in the “artistic game,” and I gathered later that he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs. Wilson’s mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall. His wife was shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible. She told me with pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven times since they had been married.\nMrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before, and was now attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream-coloured chiffon, which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room. With the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a change. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage was converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her assertions became more violently affected moment by moment, and as she expanded the room grew smaller around her, until she seemed to be revolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.",

There were three married couples and Catherine who was said to be very hard-boiled by a lady who sat next to her on the train. Catherine was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky white. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle but the effect was not altogether successful and I constantly felt that she should be peasant woman, knitting for a fireplace. The sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch. “Do you live down on Long Island, too?” she inquired. “I live at West Egg.” “Really? I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man named Gatsby’s. Do you know him?” “I live next door to him.” “Well, they say he’s a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm’s. That’s where all his money comes from.” We were at least a dozen in the room by now, all different sizes and shapes of people, and I was looking at them with a sort of fascinated repulsion. Catherine wore an elaborate afternoon dress of cream-colored chiffon, which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room. With the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a change. The room rang with the mirthless laughter of its occupants, while occasionally Tom Buchanan would break in with his booming voice. “Sit down, Tom,” she ordered, “and let me alone.” “I want to see you,” Tom insisted. “I want to see you.” “Get on the couch,” she ordered, “and let me alone.” “Come on,” Tom insisted, “I want to see you.” “Get on the couch,” she ordered, “and let me alone.” “Come

                "text": "I have been drunk just twice in my life, and the second time was that afternoon; so everything that happened has a dim, hazy cast over it, although until after eight o’clock the apartment was full of cheerful sun. There were three married couples and Catherine who was said to be very hard-boiled by a lady who sat next to her on the train. Catherine was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky white. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle but the effect was not altogether successful and I constantly felt that she should be peasant woman, knitting for a fireplace. The sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch. “Do you live down on Long Island, too?” she inquired. “I live at West Egg.” “Really? I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man named Gatsby’s. Do you know him?” “I live next door to him.” “Well, they say he’s a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm’s. That’s where all his money comes from.” We were at least a dozen in the room by now, all different sizes and shapes of people, and I was looking at them with a sort of fascinated repulsion. Catherine wore an elaborate afternoon dress of cream-colored chiffon, which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room. With the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a change. The room rang with the mirthless laughter of its occupants, while occasionally Tom Buchanan would break in with his booming voice. “Sit down, Tom,” she ordered, “and let me alone.” “I want to see you,” Tom insisted. “I want to see you.” “Get on the couch,” she ordered, “and let me alone.” “Come on,” Tom insisted, “I want to see you.” “Get on the couch,” she ordered, “and let me alone.” “Come

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant portion of the original's early sequence, specifically the events involving Mrs. Wilson making phone calls, the absence of cigarettes, and the narrator's errand to the drugstore. The narrator's solitary reading and the return of Tom and Myrtle are also missing.\n- The completion introduces a lengthy, repetitive invented dialogue between Tom and another character that is not present in the original passage. This invented exchange dominates the latter half of the completion and disrupts the original narrative flow.\n- The completion skips the introduction and description of Mr. and Mrs. McKee, as well as the details about Mrs. Wilson's change of attire and the transformation in her demeanor.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early on, the completion lacks the depiction of the apartment's atmosphere, including the sunlight and the narrator's perception of events due to intoxication.\n- The sequence where Mrs. Wilson makes phone calls and the narrator leaves to buy cigarettes is absent.\n- The narrator's return to an empty room, his reading experience, and the confusion over the book are not included.\n- The arrival of guests, specifically the introduction and detailed description of Mr. and Mrs. McKee, is missing.\n- The transformation in Mrs. Wilson's personality and the effect of her attire on the room's atmosphere are not described.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately presents the number and nature of guests, mentioning three married couples and a characterization of Catherine that is not in the original.\n- The sequence of events is altered, with character interactions and dialogue occurring out of order or not at all in the original passage.\n- The completion attributes actions and dialogue to characters that do not align with the original, such as the invented conversation between Tom and another character.\n- Descriptions of Catherine's behavior and appearance are partially present but are mixed with invented or misplaced details, such as the reference to her as a \"peasant woman, knitting for a fireplace.\"\n- The overall structure is disrupted by the repetitive, invented dialogue, which replaces the nuanced descriptions and interactions found in the original passage."

                "text": "I have been drunk just twice in my life, and the second time was that afternoon; so everything that happened has a dim, hazy cast over it, although until after eight o’clock the apartment was full of cheerful sun. Sitting on Tom’s lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the telephone; then half an hour later Tom told her she might have the cream-colored gown she had told him she might have. I had been standing beside him listening to the conversation, and mechanically I remarked that I thought it was cute to begin with. “Cute!” she cried contemptuously. “Cute to begin with! You told me you d—” She broke off, and I perceived that she had heard me. “I beg your pardon,” she exclaimed, startled. “I wasn’t listening.” “That’s all right.” She looked at me with an interest that was more than casual. “You live in West Egg,” she remarked at length. “I know somebody there.” “I don’t know a single—” “You must know Gatsby.” “Gatsby?” inquired I. “What Gatsby?” “Everybody knows Gatsby.” In a moment she looked at me again with the same impersonal curiosity. “Who is this Gatsby anyhow?” demanded Tom suddenly. “Some big bootlegger?” “This fella Gatsby lives over at West Egg,” continued Mrs. Wilson. “An’ he’s a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm’s. That’s where all his money comes from.” We were at least a dozen in the room by now, all different sizes and shapes of people, and I was looking at them with a sort of fascinated repulsion. Catherine was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky white. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle but the effect was not altogether successful and I constantly felt that she should be peasant woman, knitting for a fireplace. Mr. McKee was a pale, feminine man from the flat below. He had just shaved, for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone, and he was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room. He informed me that he was in the “artistic” line. “I am a photographer,” he remarked, of absolutely no importance to anyone in the room, who had already heard it several times. “Have you seen my pictures of New York?” I demurred, not knowing the answer, and he explained that he had them in his apartment downstairs. “I’d like very much to see them.” I remarked. “I’ll show you some of them,” he promised, “after we all get a little drunk.” “Come on up,” called Tom from the living-room. “Come on up, Catherine. Come on up, Mr. McKee. Come on up, Mrs. McKee. Come on up, everybody.” Mrs. McKee was a shrill, languid, handsome woman, who knew just how to carry a dress and was able to do it, and Mrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before, and was now attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream-colored chiffon, which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room. With the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a change. The room rang with the mirthless laughter of its occupants, while occasionally Tom Buchanan would break in with his booming voice. “Sit down, Tom,” she ordered, “and let me alone.” “I want to see you,” Tom insisted. “I want to see you.” “Get on the couch,” she ordered, “and let me alone.” “Come on,” Tom insisted, “I want to see you.” “Get on the couch,” she ordered, “and let me alone.” “Come

          "text_segment": "“My dear,” she told her sister in a high, mincing shout, “most of these fellas will cheat you every time. All they think of is money. I had a woman up here last week to look at my feet, and when she gave me the bill you’d of thought she had my appendicitis out.”\n“What was the name of the woman?” asked Mrs. McKee.\n“Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at people’s feet in their own homes.”\n“I like your dress,” remarked Mrs. McKee, “I think it’s adorable.”\nMrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain.\n“It’s just a crazy old thing,” she said. “I just slip it on sometimes when I don’t care what I look like.”\n“But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,” pursued Mrs. McKee. “If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could make something of it.”\nWe all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side, and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face.\n“I should change the light,” he said after a moment. “I’d like to bring out the modelling of the features. And I’d try to get hold of all the back hair.”\n“I wouldn’t think of changing the light,” cried Mrs. McKee. “I think it’s—”\nHer husband said “Sh!” and we all looked at the subject again, whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.\n“You McKees have something to drink,” he said. “Get some more ice and mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.”\n“I told that boy about the ice.” Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness of the lower orders. “These people! You have to keep after them all the time.”\nShe looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.\n“I’ve done some nice things out on Long Island,” asserted Mr. McKee.\nTom looked at him blankly.\n“Two of them we have framed downstairs.”\n“Two what?” demanded Tom.\n“Two studies. One of them I call Montauk Point—The Gulls, and the other I call Montauk Point—The Sea.”\nThe sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch.\n“Do you live down on Long Island, too?” she inquired.\n“I live at West Egg.”\n“Really? I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man named Gatsby’s. Do you know him?”\n“I live next door to him.”\n“Well, they say he’s a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm’s. That’s where all his money comes from.”\n“Really?”\nShe nodded.\n“I’m scared of him. I’d hate to have him get anything on me.”\nThis absorbing information about my neighbour was interrupted by Mrs. McKee’s pointing suddenly at Catherine:\n“Chester, I think you could do something with her,” she broke out, but Mr. McKee only nodded in a bored way, and turned his attention to Tom.\n“I’d like to do more work on Long Island, if I could get the entry. All I ask is that they should give me a start.”\n“Ask Myrtle,” said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as Mrs. Wilson entered with a tray. “She’ll give you a letter of introduction, won’t you, Myrtle?”\n“Do what?” she asked, startled.\n“You’ll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can do some studies of him.” His lips moved silently for a moment as he invented, “ ‘George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,’ or something like that.”\nCatherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear:\n“Neither of them can stand the person they’re married to.”\n“Can’t they?”\n“Can’t stand them.” She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom. “What I say is, why go on living with them if they can’t stand them? If I was them I’d get a divorce and get married to each other right away.”\n“Doesn’t she like Wilson either?”\nThe answer to this was unexpected. It came from Myrtle, who had overheard the question, and it was violent and obscene.\n“You see,” cried Catherine triumphantly. She lowered her voice again. “It’s really his wife that’s keeping them apart. She’s a Catholic, and they don’t believe in divorce.”\nDaisy was not a Catholic, and I was a little shocked at the elaborateness of the lie.\n“When they do get married,” continued Catherine, “they’re going West to live for a while until it blows over.”\n“It’d be more discreet to go to Europe.”\n“Oh, do you like Europe?” she exclaimed surprisingly. “I just got back from Monte Carlo.”\n“Really.”\n“Just last year. I went over there with another girl.”\n“Stay long?”\n“No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back. We went by way of Marseilles. We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started, but we got gyped out of it all in two days in the private rooms. We had an awful time getting back, I can tell you. God, how I hated that town!”\nThe late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue honey of the Mediterranean—then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called me back into the room.\n“I almost made a mistake, too,” she declared vigorously. “I almost married a little kike who’d been after me for years. I knew he was below me. Everybody kept saying to me: ‘Lucille, that man’s way below you!’ But if I hadn’t met Chester, he’d of got me sure.”\n“Yes, but listen,” said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down, “at least you didn’t marry him.”\n“I know I didn’t.”\n“Well, I married him,” said Myrtle, ambiguously. “And that’s the difference between your case and mine.”\n“Why did you, Myrtle?” demanded Catherine. “Nobody forced you to.”\nMyrtle considered.\n“I married him because I thought he was a gentleman,” she said finally. “I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn’t fit to lick my shoe.”\n“You were crazy about him for a while,” said Catherine.\n“Crazy about him!” cried Myrtle incredulously. “Who said I was crazy about him? I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that man there.”\nShe pointed suddenly at me, and everyone looked at me accusingly. I tried to show by my expression that I expected no affection.\n“The only crazy I was was when I married him. I knew right away I made a mistake. He borrowed somebody’s best suit to get married in, and never even told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he was out: ‘Oh, is that your suit?’ I said. ‘This is the first I ever heard about it.’ But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to beat the band all afternoon.”",

            "prefix-probing": "“My dear,” she told her sister in a high, mincing shout, “most of these fellas will cheat you every time. You have to be careful with them.” Catherine, with her solid, sticky bob of red hair and her plucked eyebrows, nodded sagely, though her eyes darted around the small, over-furnished living room with a restless curiosity. The apartment was on the top floor of the garage, a cramped, hot box filled with cheap, gaudy furniture and a general air of disarray. There was a set of tapestried furniture, too large for the room, and a print of a hen sitting on a pile of eggs, which Nick found vaguely disturbing. Magazines were piled high on a table, and a small, fluffy dog, a gift from Tom, lay yapping incessantly on a cushion. Myrtle, having just changed into an elaborate, brown figured silk dress, which stretched tight over her rather substantial figure, moved about the room with a new, artificial hauteur. The dress transformed her, giving her a temporary, borrowed elegance that was both comical and pathetic. She was no longer the garage owner’s wife; she was a woman of the world, or at least, a woman who believed she was. Tom Buchanan sat heavily in an armchair, his powerful body seeming to fill the small space entirely. He looked bored, occasionally glancing at his watch or making a dismissive comment. Nick, feeling increasingly uncomfortable and detached, watched the scene unfold like a spectator at a bizarre play. Mr. McKee, a pale, feminine man who lived downstairs and was a photographer, sat on the edge of a chair, occasionally murmuring about his art. His wife, a shrill, handsome woman, sat beside him, eager to talk about her husband’s work. The air was thick with the smell of cheap perfume, stale alcohol, and the oppressive heat of the city afternoon. The conversation flitted from topic to topic, fueled by the steady supply of whiskey. Myrtle held court, her voice growing louder and more imperious with each drink. She talked about her life, her marriage to George Wilson, which she now described with contempt. “I thought he was a gentleman,” she said, her voice rising. “I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn’t fit to lick my shoe.” She recounted how she had been fooled, how she had married him thinking he had money, only to discover he was poor. The disillusionment was palpable, and she spoke of it with a bitter resentment that seemed to consume her. Tom listened with a sort of amused tolerance, occasionally interjecting a remark that only seemed to egg her on. Catherine chimed in, offering her own worldly advice and observations. She spoke of her own experiences, hinting at a life of independence and sophistication that seemed slightly out of place in this setting. She mentioned a man she knew, a Mr. Gatsby, who lived in West Egg and was said to be the nephew or cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm. This detail, dropped casually into the conversation, piqued Nick’s interest, a small, intriguing mystery in the midst of the squalor and vulgarity. The party grew louder, the laughter more raucous, the conversation more disjointed. Myrtle, now thoroughly drunk, began to talk about Daisy. She repeated Daisy’s name over and over, savoring the sound, perhaps trying to assert her own claim on Tom by invoking the name of his wife. Tom had been patient up to this point, but the mention of Daisy’s name seemed to cross a line. His eyes narrowed, and his face hardened. “Don’t,” he said, his voice low and dangerous. Myrtle, however, was too far gone to heed the warning. She continued to chant Daisy’s name, her voice mocking and defiant. “Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!” she shrieked, her face contorted with drunken rage. Tom stood up abruptly. His movement was sudden and violent. There was a short, sharp sound, a blow delivered with brutal force. Myrtle staggered back, her mouth open in a silent scream, and then collapsed onto the sofa, a trickle of blood appearing at the corner of her lip. The room fell silent for a moment, the shock of the violence hanging heavy in the air. Nick felt a wave of nausea wash over him. He wanted to leave, to escape this suffocating, ugly scene. The party, such as it was, was effectively over. The illusion of gaiety and sophistication had shattered, revealing the raw, brutal reality beneath. Mr. McKee, looking pale and shaken, began to gather his things. Mrs. McKee fussed over him, her earlier volubility gone. Catherine looked stunned, her eyes wide with disbelief. Tom stood over Myrtle, his chest heaving slightly, his face a mask of cold fury. He seemed utterly unrepentant, as if this act of violence was a natural and expected consequence of Myrtle’s defiance. Nick realized with a chilling certainty that this was the true nature of these people, or at least, the nature they revealed when the veneer of politeness and wealth was stripped away. They were capable of casual cruelty, of inflicting pain without a second thought. The apartment, which had seemed merely tawdry before, now felt menacing and oppressive. The air was thick with tension, the silence broken only by Myrtle’s soft whimpering and the distant sounds of the city. Nick knew he had to get out. He felt like an intruder, a witness to something he should not have seen. He had come to the city seeking excitement and experience, but this was not the kind of experience he had anticipated. This was the ugly underbelly of the glamorous world he had glimpsed from afar. He stood up, feeling awkward and out of place. Tom glanced at him, his expression unreadable. There was no apology, no explanation, just a silent acknowledgment of the shared moment of violence. Nick mumbled something about needing to leave and moved towards the door. No one tried to stop him. They were too caught up in the aftermath of the incident, in the silent recriminations and the lingering tension. As he stepped out of the apartment and onto the landing, the noise of the city seemed to rush in, a welcome distraction from the suffocating atmosphere he had just left. He walked down the narrow stairs, his mind reeling from the events of the afternoon. He had seen a side of Tom Buchanan he had not expected, a brutal, violent streak that lay just beneath the surface of his polished exterior. He had also seen the desperate, pathetic attempts of Myrtle Wilson to escape her circumstances, and the tragic consequences of her ambition. The image of her lying on the sofa, blood on her lip, was seared into his memory. He knew then that his time in the city, and his involvement with these people, was going to be far more complicated and disturbing than he had ever imagined. The glamour and excitement he had sought seemed inextricably linked with cruelty and despair. He walked out into the street, the late afternoon sun casting long shadows. The world outside the apartment seemed normal, indifferent to the drama that had just unfolded within its walls. But Nick knew that he had been changed by what he had witnessed. He could not unsee the violence, the desperation, the fundamental unhappiness that lay at the heart of these lives. He felt a profound sense of unease, a growing realization that the world he was entering was not the glittering paradise he had imagined, but a place of moral ambiguity and hidden darkness. The encounter in the apartment above the garage was a stark introduction to the reality of the lives of the wealthy and those who aspired to be like them, a reality far removed from the romanticized notions he had brought with him from the Midwest. It was a world built on lies, on infidelity, and on a casual disregard for the feelings and well-being of others. And he was now, however reluctantly, a part of it. The memory of Myrtle’s face, twisted in pain and defiance, would stay with him, a grim reminder of the human cost of the reckless pursuit of pleasure and status that defined this world. He walked on, the sounds of the city fading into the background, lost in his thoughts, trying to process the disturbing events of the afternoon and what they might signify for his own future in this strange and captivating place. The city, with its endless possibilities and its hidden dangers, stretched out before him, a vast, indifferent landscape waiting to reveal more of its secrets. And Nick, the observer, the chronicler, was ready, albeit reluctantly, to witness whatever came next, no matter how unsettling it might be. He knew that this was just the beginning, that there were more secrets to uncover, more lives to observe, more stories to tell in the glittering, tragic world of the Jazz Age. The image of Gatsby, the mysterious man in West Egg, returned to his mind, a beacon of intrigue in the moral wasteland he had just encountered. Perhaps Gatsby held the key to understanding this world, or perhaps he was just another illusion in a landscape of deceit. Only time would tell, and Nick was determined to find out, no matter the cost. The city lights began to twinkle in the distance as dusk settled, promising another night of revelry and hidden dramas. Nick walked towards them, a reluctant participant in the unfolding tragedy of the American Dream. He had seen the worst of it, but he knew there was more to come, more to witness, more to understand about the lives of these people who lived with such careless abandon. The journey had just begun. He was ready. Or so he told himself. The truth was, he was terrified. But he couldn't turn back now. The story had already started, and he was in it, whether he liked it or not. The city waited, and so did Gatsby. The night was young, and anything was possible, for good or ill. The air was thick with anticipation, and the promise of the unknown. Nick took a deep breath and walked on, into the heart of the city, into the heart of the story. He was ready to see it all, to experience it all, to understand it all, no matter how painful or disturbing it might be. The journey continued, one step at a time, into the glittering, tragic world of the Great Gatsby. He was an observer, a chronicler, a witness to the rise and fall of dreams. And his story, intertwined with theirs, was just beginning to unfold. The city lights beckoned, a siren call to the unknown. Nick answered the call, stepping into the night, ready for whatever came next. The adventure had begun. He was in it now, for better or worse. The story was his to tell, and he would tell it, every word, every detail, every painful truth. The journey continued, into the heart of the Jazz Age, into the heart of the American Dream, into the heart of the Great Gatsby. He was ready. The city waited. The story unfolded. And Nick Carraway was there to witness it all, to record it all, to understand it all. The journey had just begun, and there was no turning back now. He was in it, all the way. The story was his, and he would tell it, to the very end. The city lights shone bright, guiding his way into the night, into the heart of the story. He was ready. The journey continued.

            "Agent_Extraction": {
              "simple_agent_extraction": "“My dear,” she told her sister in a high, mincing shout, “most of these fellas will cheat you every time. All they think of is money. I had a woman up here last week to look at my feet, and when she gave me the bill you’d of thought she had my appendicitis out.”\n\n“What was the name of the woman?” asked Mrs. McKee.\n\n“Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at people’s feet in their own homes.”\n\n“I like your dress,” remarked Mrs. McKee, “I think it’s adorable.”\n\nMrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain. “It’s just a crazy old thing,” she said. “I just slip it on sometimes when I don’t care what I look like.”\n\n“But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,” pursued Mrs. McKee. “If Chester could ever get you in that pose I think he could make something of it.”\n\nWe all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked out the window at the cheerful sun. With difficulty I was persuaded to leave the table where we had been sitting and move out upon the porch. Tom Buchanan had two bulky glasses of whiskey and soda in his hands and I took one from him and poured myself a little more of the soda and moved back inside.\n\nMrs. McKee sat opposite from the King Albert of Belgium and various swollen රාජකීයයන් of the contemporary world, who he had done in pastels. They were next to a faded photograph of a hen sitting on a blurred rock. Looked at from a distance, however, the hen resolved itself into a bonnet, and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room.\n\n“I like your dress,” she repeated, entirely for my benefit. “I was going to wear it myself all afternoon.”\n\n“Come on up,” called Tom from the table. “Look at this fellow.”\n\nHe was talking to Mr. McKee, who turned now, with a husky, guttural laugh, and went to the table. “Ninety-nine times out of a hundred,” he assured us, “ladies object to being photographed in a studio.”\n\n“You don’t say,” murmured Mrs. McKee, in an awed voice. “But I’ve been to a studio several times myself.”\n\n“You see,” explained Mr. McKee, “if I was to photograph you just as you are, you’d look exactly like the Prince of Wales. That’s the secret of it. You see, I’m a photographer myself.”\n\n“Oh, really?” exclaimed Mrs. McKee. “I didn’t know that. I thought you were in the oil business.”\n\n“I am,” said Mr. McKee, “but I do a little photography on the side. I’ve got a studio in the building here. I’ve got two framed studies hanging on the wall in my apartment.”\n\n“You don’t say,” repeated Mrs. McKee, in an awed voice. “But I’ve been to a studio several times myself.”\n\n“You see,” explained Mr. McKee, “if I was to photograph you just as you are, you’d look exactly like the Prince of Wales. That’s the secret of it. You see, I’m a photographer myself.”\n\n“Oh, really?” exclaimed Mrs. McKee. “I didn’t know that.

          "text_segment": "“She really ought to get away from him,” resumed Catherine to me. “They’ve been living over that garage for eleven years. And Tom’s the first sweetie she ever had.”\nThe bottle of whisky—a second one—was now in constant demand by all present, excepting Catherine, who “felt just as good on nothing at all.” Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches, which were a complete supper in themselves. I wanted to get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight, but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild, strident argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I saw him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.\nMyrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.\n“It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the last ones left on the train. I was going up to New York to see my sister and spend the night. He had on a dress suit and patent leather shoes, and I couldn’t keep my eyes off him, but every time he looked at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head. When we came into the station he was next to me, and his white shirtfront pressed against my arm, and so I told him I’d have to call a policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into a taxi with him I didn’t hardly know I wasn’t getting into a subway train. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was ‘You can’t live forever; you can’t live forever.’ ”\nShe turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial laughter.\n“My dear,” she cried, “I’m going to give you this dress as soon as I’m through with it. I’ve got to get another one tomorrow. I’m going to make a list of all the things I’ve got to get. A massage and a wave, and a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ashtrays where you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother’s grave that’ll last all summer. I got to write down a list so I won’t forget all the things I got to do.”\nIt was nine o’clock—almost immediately afterward I looked at my watch and found it was ten. Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists clenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action. Taking out my handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the spot of dried lather that had worried me all the afternoon.\nThe little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through the smoke, and from time to time groaning faintly. People disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost each other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet away. Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood face to face discussing, in impassioned voices, whether Mrs. Wilson had any right to mention Daisy’s name.",

            "prefix-probing": "“She really ought to get away from him,” resumed Catherine to me. “They’ve been living like this for years. It’s really awful. He’s a brute of a man, you know, a great big hulking physical specimen, and he treats her terribly. She thinks he’s going to leave Daisy and marry her, but he’ll never do it. Not really. He just keeps her on a string.” She took a long drag from her cigarette, the smoke curling lazily towards the ceiling. “The only reason they aren’t divorced is that Daisy’s Catholic, and they don’t believe in it.” She said this with an air of profound knowledge, as if the intricacies of the Catholic faith were the sole impediment to Myrtle’s happiness, rather than Tom’s fundamental dishonesty and Myrtle’s own desperate ambition. I looked around the crowded, stuffy room. The air was thick with the smell of cheap perfume, stale alcohol, and the nervous energy of people trying too hard to be sophisticated. Mr. McKee, the pale, feminine photographer, was showing his portfolio of dreary, blurred photographs to his wife, a shrill, unpleasant woman who seemed perpetually on the verge of tears or a fight. Myrtle, meanwhile, was holding court, her voice growing louder and more imperious with every drink. She had changed into a dress of brown figured muslin, which stretched tight over her rather ample figure, and she wore a string of pearls that looked conspicuously fake. She was talking about her life, about how she had been ‘brought up’ in the country, which seemed to be her way of explaining her current situation without admitting she was from a lower class. She spoke of her marriage to Wilson with a kind of contemptuous pity, describing him as a ‘gentleman’ in a tone that suggested the opposite. “He wasn’t fit to lick my shoe,” she declared at one point, her eyes flashing. Catherine leaned closer to me, lowering her voice slightly, though it was hardly necessary over the din. “She married him because she thought he was a gentleman,” she confided. “She didn’t know till after she married him that he borrowed somebody’s best suit to get married in, and he’d never even told her that he was too poor to buy one. I was there. I saw it. She cried all afternoon when she found out. She thought he was a gentleman.” The revelation seemed to solidify Catherine’s conviction that Myrtle was somehow trapped, a victim of circumstance and her own poor judgment, though Catherine herself seemed perfectly comfortable in this sordid little world. The party was spiraling downwards, the conversation becoming more fragmented and nonsensical. Tom was drinking heavily, his eyes fixed on Myrtle with a possessive, almost violent intensity. The atmosphere was charged with a kind of desperate gaiety, a frantic attempt to escape the drab reality of their lives through alcohol and illicit passion. Catherine continued to elaborate on the supposed reasons for Tom and Daisy’s enduring marriage, repeating the Catholic story with unwavering certainty, as if it were a universally accepted truth. It was clear that she, like Myrtle, had constructed a narrative that allowed them to make sense of Tom’s behavior, absolving him of the full weight of his deceit by attributing it to external, insurmountable obstacles. The truth, of course, was far simpler and far more brutal: Tom was a wealthy, powerful man who took what he wanted and discarded it when he was finished, and neither Myrtle nor Catherine seemed willing or able to confront that reality. The apartment, once a symbol of Myrtle’s aspirations, now felt like a cage, filled with the stale air of broken dreams and empty promises. The night wore on, the noise level increasing, the veneer of sophistication completely gone, replaced by raw, drunken emotion. Catherine, oblivious to the growing tension, continued her monologue about the injustices of Myrtle’s situation, painting a picture of a woman wronged by fate and religious dogma, rather than by her own choices and the callousness of the man she adored. It was a convenient fiction, one that allowed them all to avoid the uglier truths lurking beneath the surface of their lives.",

And Tom’s the first sweetie she ever had.”\nThe bottle of whiskey–a second one–was produced and consumed with commendable rapidity. Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two young women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch, open toward the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished light. \n“Did you notice,” asked Mr. McKee, “what a nice build he’s got?”\n“I certainly do,” remarked Mrs. McKee, taking a long swallow of whiskey. \n“Well, if Catherine thinks she can make a living without working,” said Mrs. McKee, “she’s mistaken.”\n“What’s the matter, Nick?” demanded Tom. “Matter of fact, I’m staying over in West Egg tonight.”\n“That’s good,” cried Catherine. “I hope you’ll stay there forever. I was going to ask you and Tom to dinner at the Plaza to-morrow night, but I–”\nShe broke off, and I saw that she was frowning. \n“I don’t like that man, Tom,” she muttered. “I don’t think he’s a gentleman.”\n“He’s not,” said Tom. “He’s a gambler.”\n“He’s a gambler,” repeated Catherine, several times. “He’s a gambler.”\n“They certainly are,” said Mrs. McKee. “They certainly are.”\n“Well, I’m going to get a divorce,” said Catherine. “And then I’m going to marry him.”\n“You are?” cried Mrs. McKee. “You are?”\n“Yes,” said Catherine. “I am.”\n“Well, I’m certainly glad to hear that,” said Mrs.

Catherine leaned down and whispered in her ear. “Do you want me to get you some more of that French stuff? The un-odorous spirit of ammonia——” On the next couch sat Mr. McKee and his wife, who were not saying anything at all. She looked at him now and then, and she was making an estimate of his wife, who sat on the other end of the couch, and she was shocked at the elaborateness of her dress—for several minutes they had been discussing the subject of her dress. There were three married couples present; at least I distinguished between two girls who were at least married and Catherine who was only just living, and Mr. McKee who had a wife and Catherine who did not. By three o’clock the lamp had gone out, and I was sitting in a chair preserving a dignified homogeneity, and not paying any attention to what was going on. Tom Buchanan and Mr. McKee were talking together in a corner. Mrs. McKee was sobbing indefensibly on a couch. Everybody else was there, and all talking in low, earnest voices that rose sometimes to a shrill sound.

Dai——”\nMaking a short deft movement, Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his open hand.\nThen there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and women’s voices scolding, and high over the confusion a sharp broken wail. Catherine leaned down and whispered in her ear. “Do you want me to get you some more of that French stuff? The un-odorous spirit of ammonia——” On the next couch sat Mr. McKee and his wife, who were not saying anything at all. She looked at him now and then, and she was making an estimate of his wife, who sat on the other end of the couch, and she was shocked at the elaborateness of her dress—for several minutes they had been discussing the subject of her dress. There were three married couples present; at least I distinguished between two girls who were at least married and Catherine who was only just living, and Mr. McKee who had a wife and Catherine who did not. By three o’clock the lamp had gone out, and I was sitting in a chair preserving a dignified homogeneity, and not paying any attention to what was going on. Tom Buchanan and Mr. McKee were talking together in a corner. Mrs. McKee was sobbing indefensibly on a couch. Everybody else was there, and all talking in low, earnest voices that rose sometimes to a shrill sound. At the news of the broken nose they had surged forward into a rowdy house party, and Catherine was trying to make a list of all the guests’ names for she hoped to find out who it was that brought out the yellow cocktail girl.

The last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colours, and hair bobbed in strange new ways, and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other’s names.\nThe lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp, joyous moment the centre of a group, and then, excited with triumph, glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and colour under the constantly changing light.\nSuddenly one of these gypsies, in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail out of the air, dumps it down for courage and, moving her hands like Frisco, dances out alone on the canvas platform. A momentary hush; the orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her, and there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda Gray’s understudy from the Follies. The party has begun.",

By seven thirty the eighth car was out in front, restless for, the gate, and by eight thirty the busses began to arrive, roaring with convivial drunkeness, while the air cracked and snapped under the tension of a hundred private elevators. At the same time, weary of the too many swings and plunges and blows, those who had stayed in the water too long came out with their last reserves of strength and collapsed on the sand. Before the half hour, young men were drifting in and out of the front door with their hats and coats and canes, and the living-room, the hall, the librarby, were peopled with burly men and slender women to whom I talked for a while until the air grew too crowded for a single voice. The hall was at present occupied by two garrulous girls in twin yellow dresses, who stopped at the foot of the steps by the door and looked down into the court with convivial excitement. They were continually excited at parties; they were forever finding new things to wonder at in the most familiar surroundings. When they had finished with the court they strolled through the garden, where the electric light showed the green grass and the orange trees and the purple flowers in a sort of phosphorescent glow. The bar was in full swing, and cocktails stood in ranks upon the bar, and trays of champagne were borne by stout waiters above the heads of the crowd.

The last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors, and hair shorn in strange new ways, and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other’s names. The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and the orchestra plays faster, and the wines grow warmer and the gossip cruder. The groups change more quickly, slide, and dissolve, and reassemble at different tables. Suddenly one of these gypsies, in an ecstasy of attention, flapped her arms like a bat, and, swaying, her voice husky, began to sing an obscene song in Dalmatian. Instantly the crowd tittered, melted away, and revalued her in a new light. She was suddenly prevented from singing any more. By midnight the hilarity had increased.

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits key descriptive elements from the original, such as the visual details of the partygoers' attire, the atmosphere created by the lighting, and the specific musical and social transitions as the evening progresses.\n- The original's depiction of the changing social dynamics, including the movement and interactions of groups and individuals, is largely absent or replaced with generic or repetitive statements.\n- The unique event involving a guest's spontaneous dance and the crowd's reaction is not included, which removes a pivotal moment from the narrative.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion provides inaccurate or invented time references and sequences of arrivals that do not match the original's timeline.\n- There are misattributed actions and invented characters or groups (such as the two girls in yellow dresses and the mention of private elevators) that are not present in the original.\n- The sequence of events is altered, with invented actions and descriptions inserted before, during, and after the actual events of the original passage.\n- The repetitive statements about confidence among partygoers are not only inaccurate but also disrupt the intended progression and tone of the original passage."

A chauffeur in a uniform of robin’s-egg blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly formal note from his employer: the honour would be entirely Gatsby’s, it said, if I would attend his “little party” that night. He had seen me several times, and had intended to call on me long before, but a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it—signed Jay Gatsby, in a majestic hand.\nDressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after seven, and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies of people I didn’t know—though here and there was a face I had noticed on the commuting train. I was immediately struck by the number of young Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little hungry, and all talking in low, earnest voices to solid and prosperous Americans.

They came to gamble, to dance, to drink, to flirt, to gossip, to be seen. The house was full of strangers, all laughing and talking with a perfect familiarity that was either the product of the cocktails or the confident ignorance that assumes the world is its oyster. I felt a little lost, a little out of place. I didn’t know anyone, and the sheer scale of the party was overwhelming. The orchestra was playing jazz, and the dance floor was crowded with couples moving with a frantic energy. Waiters circulated with trays of cocktails, and the air was thick with the scent of gardenias and expensive perfume. I wandered through the rooms, looking for a familiar face, or perhaps for the host himself. I asked a few people if they had seen Mr. Gatsby, but no one seemed to know where he was, or even what he looked like. It was as if he were a mythical figure, the subject of endless speculation and rumour, but never actually present. I found myself standing near a table where a group of young women were talking loudly. One of them was Jordan Baker, whom I had met once before. She recognized me, and we started talking. She told me about the party, about the people there, and about Gatsby himself, or rather, the stories about him. It was clear that no one really knew him, despite being guests in his house. The party was a spectacle, a display of wealth and excess, but it lacked any real connection or intimacy. It was a world of transient pleasures, where people came and went like moths drawn to a flame, burning brightly for a moment before disappearing back into the night. I watched them, fascinated and slightly repelled, a quiet observer in the midst of the roaring twenties.",

My voice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden.\n“I thought you might be here,” she responded absently as I came up. “I remembered you lived next door to—”\nShe held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she’d take care of me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses, who stopped at the foot of the steps.\n“Hello!” they cried together. “Sorry you didn’t win.”\nThat was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week before.\n“You don’t know who we are,” said one of the girls in yellow, “but we met you here about a month ago.”\n“You’ve dyed your hair since then,” remarked Jordan, and I started, but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer’s basket. With Jordan’s slender golden arm resting in mine, we descended the steps and sauntered about the garden. A tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight, and we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble.\n“Do you come to these parties often?” inquired Jordan of the girl beside her.\n“The last one was the one I met you at,” answered the girl, in an alert confident voice. She turned to her companion: “Wasn’t it for you, Lucille?”\nIt was for Lucille, too.\n“I like to come,” Lucille said. “I never care what I do, so I always have a good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked me my name and address—inside of a week I got a package from Croirier’s with a new evening gown in it.”\n“Did you keep it?” asked Jordan.\n“Sure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the bust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two hundred and sixty-five dollars.”\n“There’s something funny about a fellow that’ll do a thing like that,” said the other girl eagerly. “He doesn’t want any trouble with anybody.”\n“Who doesn’t?” I inquired.\n“Gatsby. Somebody told me—”\nThe two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.\n“Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.”\nA thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward and listened eagerly.\n“I don’t think it’s so much that,” argued Lucille sceptically; “It’s more that he was a German spy during the war.”\nOne of the men nodded in confirmation.\n“I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in Germany,” he assured us positively.\n“Oh, no,” said the first girl, “it couldn’t be that, because he was in the American army during the war.” As our credulity switched back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm. “You look at him sometimes when he thinks nobody’s looking at him. I’ll bet he killed a man.”\nShe narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned and looked around for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who had found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this world.",

          "text_segment": "The first supper—there would be another one after midnight—was now being served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party, who were spread around a table on the other side of the garden. There were three married couples and Jordan’s escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo, and obviously under the impression that sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling, this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the countryside—East Egg condescending to West Egg and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gaiety.\n“Let’s get out,” whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate half-hour; “this is much too polite for me.”\nWe got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host: I had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. The undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.\nThe bar, where we glanced first, was crowded, but Gatsby was not there. She couldn’t find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn’t on the veranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas.\nA stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.\n“What do you think?” he demanded impetuously.\n“About what?”\nHe waved his hand toward the bookshelves.\n“About that. As a matter of fact you needn’t bother to ascertain. I ascertained. They’re real.”\n“The books?”\nHe nodded.\n“Absolutely real—have pages and everything. I thought they’d be a nice durable cardboard. Matter of fact, they’re absolutely real. Pages and—Here! Lemme show you.”\nTaking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and returned with Volume One of the Stoddard Lectures.\n“See!” he cried triumphantly. “It’s a bona-fide piece of printed matter. It fooled me. This fella’s a regular Belasco. It’s a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop, too—didn’t cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?”\nHe snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf, muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse.\n“Who brought you?” he demanded. “Or did you just come? I was brought. Most people were brought.”\nJordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without answering.\n“I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,” he continued. “Mrs. Claud Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I’ve been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.”\n“Has it?”\n“A little bit, I think. I can’t tell yet. I’ve only been here an hour. Did I tell you about the books? They’re real. They’re—”\n“You told us.”\nWe shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.",

            "prefix-probing": "The first supper—there would be another one after midnight—was now being served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party, who were spread around a table on the other side of the garden. I followed her, and presently I found myself at a table with a half dozen strangers, most of them, I gathered, from New York. There was a stout, florid man named Mr. Palmetto in a white suit, who kept telling a story about a motor-boat that had gone down in a storm, and a pair of young Englishwomen, who were complaining bitterly about the lack of privacy in America. They were, I imagine, the kind of people who go to every party at Gatsby’s mansion, year after year, without ever knowing him. The conversation was loud and disjointed, punctuated by bursts of laughter that seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere at once. People drifted in and out of our group, introducing themselves with a casualness that bordered on indifference. I felt a little lost, a little out of place. I was one of the few guests, I suspected, who had actually been invited. The rest seemed to have simply materialized, drawn by the magnetic pull of Gatsby’s wealth and the promise of a good time. Jordan, cool and detached, sat beside me, occasionally offering a cynical comment on the proceedings. She seemed to know everyone, or at least to recognize them from other parties, other places. She had that air of sophisticated boredom that I was beginning to associate with the wealthy set. As the evening wore on, the rumors about Gatsby began to circulate more freely. He was a German spy during the war. He had killed a man. He was a bootlegger. He was the nephew of Kaiser Wilhelm. Each story was more fantastic than the last, and no one seemed to know the truth. It was as if Gatsby were a character in a play, and the guests were the audience, speculating wildly about his past. I kept looking around, trying to catch a glimpse of my host. I had expected him to be more visible, perhaps greeting guests, but he was nowhere to be seen. It added to the mystery, the aura of the man. Who was this Gatsby, who threw such lavish parties and yet remained so elusive? The music from the orchestra on the lawn grew louder, more insistent. Couples were dancing on the polished floor of the veranda, their movements fluid and graceful in the soft light. The garden was a kaleidoscope of color and sound, a vibrant, pulsating entity. Waiters circulated with trays of cocktails, their white jackets gleaming in the darkness. The air was thick with the scent of flowers and perfume and the faint, intoxicating aroma of alcohol. I tried to engage in conversation, but I found it difficult. The people at our table seemed more interested in talking about themselves or gossiping about others. There was a superficiality to their interactions, a lack of genuine connection. It was all about appearances, about being seen at the right place, with the right people. Jordan leaned closer to me. \"Aren't you having fun, Nick?\" she asked, her voice low. \"I'm trying,\" I said, smiling. \"It's quite a spectacle.\" \"It is,\" she agreed. \"Most of these people come here every weekend. They don't even know Gatsby. They just come for the party.\" \"That's extraordinary,\" I said. \"It is,\" she repeated, taking a sip of her drink. \"He must be a very lonely man.\" The thought struck me. All this extravagance, all this effort, and for what? To entertain a crowd of strangers who didn't care about him, who were only interested in the free food and drink and the opportunity to mingle with others of their kind. It seemed a sad, empty existence. I looked out at the garden, at the swirling mass of people, the bright lights, the sound of the music. It was a scene of unparalleled excess, a testament to the roaring twenties and the boundless optimism, or perhaps recklessness, of the age. And at the center of it all was the invisible man, the mysterious Gatsby, the host who remained hidden in the shadows, watching, waiting. For what, I wondered? What was he hoping to find in this endless parade of faces? What was he searching for in the glittering chaos of his own creation? The questions hung in the air, unanswered, adding another layer to the enigma that was Jay Gatsby.",

There were three married couples and Jordan’s escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo, and obviously under the impression that casual limousines were too odd a thing to take seriously. I was immediately struck by the familiar conviction that it was all a mistake and that I was not wanted. A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian, and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz, and between the numbers people were doing ‘stunts’ all over the garden, while happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A pair of stage twins, who turned out to be the girls in yellow, did a national dance, and four other girls made an incoherent shriek at the neighbouring tables. As soon as I arrived the undergraduate began in a loud voice to ask me if I hadn’t seen a girl around ‘in a white dress.’ She was ‘a little fat girl,’ he added parenthetically. ‘By the way, I’m Mr. McKee,’ he announced suddenly. ‘I’m from West Egg.’ ‘Same here. I live next door to Gatsby’s.’ ‘Know Gatsby?’ demanded the undergraduate suddenly. ‘I live at West Egg,’ I said automatically. ‘Well, I live at West Egg,’ he repeated, in a hurt tone; and she looked at him alertly, sharply, as if she were gathering some vital information from his character. His speaking voice, a gruff, husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. We were at a particularly exhilarated table. There was a sharp, unpleasant discordance in the air, as if the orchestra were tuning up for the ancient prelude to the opera *La Traviata*. I sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men, each of whom seemed to have a suit of clothes waiting for him in a box somewhere inside. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in his middle years. He was a sturdy, straw-haired man of thirty with a hard body and a fine, tanned face. He was talking to a young girl, his face glowing and his eyes shining. I was about to ask him if he had seen Mr. Gatsby when he said, suddenly, ‘I’m Gatsby.’ The two girls in yellow were laughing together, and I knew why. They were laughing because he was Gatsby. I had been talking to him for ten minutes without knowing it. ‘Your face is familiar,’ he said, politely. ‘Weren’t you in the Third Division during the war?’ ‘Why, yes. I was in the Ninth Machine-Gun Battalion.’ ‘I was in the Seventh Infantry until June 1918. I knew I’d seen you somewhere before.’ We talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France. Evidently he knew, through some curious intuition, that I was not a professional golfer. ‘You’re not drinking,’ he said. ‘Have a drink.’ ‘I’ll take a highball,’ I said. ‘I’ve been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.’ ‘Has it?’ ‘A little,’ he said. ‘I don’t know yet. I’ve been sitting here for about an hour, and I don’t think it’s done me any good.’ He looked at the shelves again. ‘These books are real,’ he remarked. ‘The whole library’s real. He’s a regular Belasco. It’s a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop, too—didn’t cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?’ He waved his hand towards the shelves. ‘They’re real books,’ he repeated. ‘Look!’ I looked. The books were real. They were bound in leather and gold, and they had pages. ‘Of course they’re real,’ I said. ‘What did you think they were?’ ‘I thought they were a lot of cardboard covers,’ he answered. ‘The kind you see in the movies. I thought he’d have them bound in cardboard and just have the titles printed on the backs. That’s what I get for not knowing the right people. I never would have expected it of him. He’s a regular Belasco.’ He looked at me again. ‘Are you a friend of Gatsby’s?’ he asked. ‘I know him slightly,’ I said. ‘Well, I’m not a friend of his,’ he said. ‘I just met him. I was brought by a Mrs. Claud Roosevelt whom I met last night. I’ve been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.’ ‘Has it?’ ‘A little,’ he said. ‘I don’t know yet.

Evidently he knew, through some curious intuition, that I was not a professional golfer. ‘You’re not drinking,’ he said. ‘Have a drink.’ ‘I’ll take a highball,’ I said. ‘I’ve been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.’ ‘Has it?’ ‘A little,’ he said. ‘I don’t know yet. I’ve been sitting here for about an hour, and I don’t think it’s done me any good.’ He looked at the shelves again. ‘These books are real,’ he remarked. ‘The whole library’s real. He’s a regular Belasco. It’s a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop, too—didn’t cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?’ He waved his hand towards the shelves. ‘They’re real books,’ he repeated. ‘Look!’ I looked. The books were real. They were bound in leather and gold, and they had pages. ‘Of course they’re real,’ I said. ‘What did you think they were?’ ‘I thought they were a lot of cardboard covers,’ he answered. ‘The kind you see in the movies. I thought he’d have them bound in cardboard and just have the titles printed on the backs. That’s what I get for not knowing the right people. I never would have expected it of him. He’s a regular Belasco.’ He looked at me again. ‘Are you a friend of Gatsby’s?’ he asked. ‘I know him slightly,’ I said. ‘Well, I’m not a friend of his,’ he said. ‘I just met him. I was brought by a Mrs. Claud Roosevelt whom I met last night. I’ve been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.’ ‘Has it?’ ‘A little,’ he said. ‘I don’t know yet.

By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian, and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz, and between the numbers people were doing “stunts” all over the garden, while happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A pair of stage twins, who turned out to be the girls in yellow, did a baby act in costume, and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger-bowls. The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn.\nI was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl, who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying myself now. I had taken two finger-bowls of champagne, and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental, and profound.\nAt a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.\n“Your face is familiar,” he said politely. “Weren’t you in the First Division during the war?”\n“Why yes. I was in the Twenty-eighth Infantry.”\n“I was in the Sixteenth until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I’d seen you somewhere before.”\nWe talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France. Evidently he lived in this vicinity, for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane, and was going to try it out in the morning.\n“Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound.”\n“What time?”\n“Any time that suits you best.”\nIt was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around and smiled.\n“Having a gay time now?” she inquired.\n“Much better.” I turned again to my new acquaintance. “This is an unusual party for me. I haven’t even seen the host. I live over there—” I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, “and this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation.”\nFor a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.\n“I’m Gatsby,” he said suddenly.\n“What!” I exclaimed. “Oh, I beg your pardon.”\n“I thought you knew, old sport. I’m afraid I’m not a very good host.”\nHe smiled understandingly—much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced—or seemed to face—the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey. Precisely at that point it vanished—and I was looking at an elegant young roughneck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced himself I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care.",

            "prefix-probing": "There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden; old men pushing young girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples holding each other tortuously, fashionably, and keeping in the corners—and a great number of single girls dancing individually or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the traps. The groups change swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath; already the lamps in the garden were glowing with a yellow cheerfulness, and by eight o'clock the orchestra had arrived—no thin five-piece affair, but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos, and a whole drum, all playing the \"Jazz History of the World\" in four movements. The party had begun. I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with some people we knew, and some people we didn't know. The people we didn't know were introduced by the people we did know. They were all young, and they were all rich, and they were all trying very hard to be sophisticated. They talked about New York, about the theatre, about the latest scandals. Their laughter was loud and frequent, a brittle sound that seemed to shatter the air around them. Waiters circulated with trays of cocktails, and the air grew thick with the scent of gin and orange peel. As the evening advanced, the cocktails spread with a similar abandon, and the hilarity increased. Laughter was easier, or more piercing, depending on the amount of alcohol consumed. The groups around the tables became more fluid, people drifting from one conversation to another, their voices rising above the music. There was a constant buzz, a hum of human voices that was almost as loud as the orchestra. People were talking about everything and nothing, their words tumbling out in a rush, fueled by the alcohol and the excitement of the night. I noticed that no one seemed to know Gatsby, or at least, no one I spoke to did. They were all guests, invited or not, drawn by the magnetic pull of his wealth and the promise of a good time. They speculated about him, whispered rumors and theories. Some said he had killed a man, others that he was a German spy during the war. One woman insisted he was a relative of Kaiser Wilhelm. These stories, wild and improbable, added to the mystique surrounding the host, a man who remained largely invisible amidst the throng he had gathered. The garden was a riot of color and sound. Chinese lanterns hung from the trees, casting a soft, ethereal glow. The dance floor was packed, a swirling mass of bodies moving to the frantic rhythm of the jazz band. The music was loud, insistent, driving the dancers into a frenzy. People were dancing with a kind of desperate energy, as if trying to outrun something, or perhaps just trying to forget themselves for a few hours. The alcohol continued to flow, and the party became more raucous. Women were laughing hysterically, men were slapping each other on the back, their faces flushed and their ties askew. The veneer of sophistication was beginning to crack, revealing the underlying vulgarity and emptiness. People were behaving with a careless abandon, their inhibitions dissolving with each drink. There were arguments, loud and public, followed by equally loud and public reconciliations. There were couples who had clearly just met, locked in passionate embraces on the edges of the dance floor. It was a world of instant gratification, of fleeting connections and superficial pleasures. Everyone was there to be seen, to be entertained, to escape the mundane reality of their lives. They were like moths drawn to a flame, circling around the bright, dazzling light of Gatsby's wealth and extravagance. And in the center of it all, the mysterious host remained elusive, a figure of rumor and speculation, the orchestrator of this elaborate, glittering spectacle. The night wore on, the music played louder, the laughter grew wilder, and the party, like a runaway train, hurtled towards its inevitable, messy conclusion. The air was thick with the smell of perfume, alcohol, and the faint, underlying scent of desperation.",

          "text_segment": "Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler hurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him on the wire. He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn.\n“If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,” he urged me. “Excuse me. I will rejoin you later.”\nWhen he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan—constrained to assure her of my surprise. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in his middle years.\n“Who is he?” I demanded. “Do you know?”\n“He’s just a man named Gatsby.”\n“Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?”\n“Now you’re started on the subject,” she answered with a wan smile. “Well, he told me once he was an Oxford man.”\nA dim background started to take shape behind him, but at her next remark it faded away.\n“However, I don’t believe it.”\n“Why not?”\n“I don’t know,” she insisted, “I just don’t think he went there.”\nSomething in her tone reminded me of the other girl’s “I think he killed a man,” and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I would have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York. That was comprehensible. But young men didn’t—at least in my provincial inexperience I believed they didn’t—drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island Sound.\n“Anyhow, he gives large parties,” said Jordan, changing the subject with an urban distaste for the concrete. “And I like large parties. They’re so intimate. At small parties there isn’t any privacy.”\nThere was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.\n“Ladies and gentlemen,” he cried. “At the request of Mr. Gatsby we are going to play for you Mr. Vladmir Tostoff’s latest work, which attracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the papers you know there was a big sensation.” He smiled with jovial condescension, and added: “Some sensation!” Whereupon everybody laughed.\n“The piece is known,” he concluded lustily, “as ‘Vladmir Tostoff’s Jazz History of the World!’ ”\nThe nature of Mr. Tostoff’s composition eluded me, because just as it began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and looking from one group to another with approving eyes. His tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister about him. I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased. When the “Jazz History of the World” was over, girls were putting their heads on men’s shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into men’s arms, even into groups, knowing that someone would arrest their falls—but no one swooned backward on Gatsby, and no French bob touched Gatsby’s shoulder, and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby’s head for one link.",

He excused himself with a quick, apologetic smile, a smile of eternal reassurance, and disappeared into the house. His brief absence seemed to leave a momentary void in the vibrant chaos of the garden. Nick, left standing with Jordan Baker, watched him go, a fresh layer of mystery settling over the man he had just met. The phone call from Chicago added another piece to the enigmatic puzzle that was Jay Gatsby. It hinted at a world of business, perhaps illicit, far removed from West Egg's glittering facade. Jordan turned to Nick, her eyes cool and appraising. 'He's always taking calls,' she remarked, her voice a low, bored murmur. 'From all over. Philadelphia, Chicago, places like that.' 'Business?' Nick ventured. Jordan shrugged, a slight, elegant movement. 'Who knows? Something big, I suppose. He's a man of many secrets.' She paused, then added, 'Did you hear the rumors about him? That he killed a man? Or that he was a German spy during the war?' Nick shook his head, fascinated by the effortless way she relayed such sensational gossip. 'No, I hadn't heard those.' 'Oh, they're everywhere,' she said dismissively. 'Nobody knows the truth about him. Not really.' They drifted back into the throng, the music swelling around them. The party was in full swing, a dizzying spectacle of wealth and excess. People danced with a frantic energy, their laughter echoing across the lawn. Waiters circulated with trays of cocktails, their movements precise and tireless. The air was thick with the scent of flowers and perfume, mingled with the sharp tang of alcohol. Nick felt increasingly like a detached observer in this elaborate production. He watched the faces around him – some familiar,",

          "text_segment": "“I beg your pardon.”\nGatsby’s butler was suddenly standing beside us.\n“Miss Baker?” he inquired. “I beg your pardon, but Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you alone.”\n“With me?” she exclaimed in surprise.\n“Yes, madame.”\nShe got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment, and followed the butler toward the house. I noticed that she wore her evening-dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes—there was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.\nI was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and intriguing sounds had issued from a long, many-windowed room which overhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan’s undergraduate, who was now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who implored me to join him, I went inside.\nThe large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was playing the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of champagne, and during the course of her song she had decided, ineptly, that everything was very, very sad—she was not only singing, she was weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks—not freely, however, for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky colour, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face, whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair, and went off into a deep vinous sleep.\n“She had a fight with a man who says he’s her husband,” explained a girl at my elbow.\nI looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan’s party, the quartet from East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of the men was talking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife, after attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent way, broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks—at intervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed: “You promised!” into his ear.\nThe reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant wives. The wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices.\n“Whenever he sees I’m having a good time he wants to go home.”\n“Never heard anything so selfish in my life.”\n“We’re always the first ones to leave.”\n“So are we.”\n“Well, we’re almost the last tonight,” said one of the men sheepishly. “The orchestra left half an hour ago.”\nIn spite of the wives’ agreement that such malevolence was beyond credibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives were lifted, kicking, into the night.",

            "prefix-probing": "I beg your pardon.” The voice was low, almost a murmur against the insistent jazz that spilled from the ballroom, but it cut through the din with surprising clarity. I turned, my glass of champagne momentarily forgotten in my hand. It was a young woman, her face a pale oval in the shifting lights, her eyes wide with a sort of startled innocence that seemed out of place in this riotous assembly. She wore a dress of shimmering gold, catching the light like a trapped sunbeam. “Did I… did I say something?” I asked, feeling a sudden, inexplicable flush rise to my cheeks. The alcohol, perhaps, or the sheer overwhelming strangeness of the evening. She shook her head slowly, a faint smile touching her lips. “No, not at all. It’s just… I thought I heard you mention… West Egg?” “Yes,” I confirmed, a little wary. “I live there. Just next door to… well, to this place.” I gestured vaguely towards the mansion, its colossal silhouette looming behind us, a beacon of ostentatious wealth against the summer night sky. “Oh,” she breathed, her smile widening slightly. “How extraordinary. I’m from the Midwest myself, you see. Just visiting. My cousin brought me.” She didn’t offer her name, and I didn’t press. Names seemed fluid here, less important than the fleeting connections forged in the heat of the moment. We stood in silence for a moment, the music washing over us, the laughter and chatter of hundreds of voices swirling around like leaves in a storm. I watched the dancers, a blur of color and movement, their faces flushed with excitement and something else – a desperate, almost frantic pursuit of pleasure. It struck me, not for the first time that night, how utterly alone I felt amidst this throng. Everyone seemed to know everyone, or at least pretended to, their conversations a tapestry of shared jokes and knowing glances. I, the observer, the quiet man from the West, felt like an anthropologist studying a peculiar, vibrant tribe. The young woman beside me sighed softly. “It’s quite something, isn’t it?” “It is,” I agreed. “Overwhelming.” “He must be a remarkable man,” she said, her gaze fixed on the mansion. “To throw parties like this. Every weekend, they say.” “Gatsby?” I supplied. She nodded. “Yes. Mr. Gatsby. I haven’t even seen him yet. Have you?” “Briefly,” I said. “Earlier this evening.” I didn’t elaborate. My brief encounter with the host had been as enigmatic as everything else about him. A smile that understood you, a carefully chosen word, and then he was gone, swallowed by the crowd. “What’s he like?” she asked, turning her wide eyes back to me. I hesitated. How to describe Gatsby? The rumors were legion – a German spy, an Oxford man, a murderer, a bootlegger. He was a figure of myth before he was a man. “He’s… reserved,” I settled on, which felt like a ridiculous understatement. “And very polite.” She seemed disappointed by my answer. “Oh. I expected… I don’t know. Something more.” “Perhaps he is,” I said. “I’ve only just met him myself.” A sudden burst of raucous laughter erupted nearby, drawing our attention. A group of young women, their dresses hiked up, were attempting a clumsy Charleston on the lawn, egged on by several equally inebriated young men. Their gaiety was loud, forced, a brittle shell over something less joyful. “It’s all so… temporary,” the young woman in gold said, her voice barely audible above the din. “Like spun sugar. Beautiful, but it melts away.” Her words struck a chord. That was it, wasn’t it? The ephemeral nature of it all. The wealth, the parties, the relationships forged and broken in the space of a single night. It was a world built on illusion, on the desperate hope that if you danced fast enough, drank enough, laughed loud enough, you could outrun the emptiness that lurked beneath the surface. I looked at her, really looked at her, and saw a flicker of the same disillusionment I felt. She wasn’t just a pretty face in a gold dress; she was another soul adrift in this glittering, chaotic sea. “Perhaps,” I said, choosing my words carefully, “some things are meant to melt away. Maybe that’s the point.” She didn’t reply, her gaze drifting back to the mansion, its lights blazing like a challenge to the darkness. The music swelled, a saxophone wailing a mournful, bluesy tune that seemed to capture the underlying sadness of the scene. I finished my champagne, the bubbles long gone, leaving only a flat, slightly bitter taste. The night was still young, but I already felt the weariness settling in, the quiet ache of being an outsider looking in on a world that was both dazzling and deeply flawed. I wondered what she was thinking, this girl from the Midwest, dropped into the heart of this roaring, reckless decade. Was she enchanted, or merely bewildered? Or perhaps, like me, she saw the cracks in the gilded facade. The air grew cooler as the night deepened, carrying the scent of cut grass and the distant, metallic tang of the Sound. The party raged on, a relentless, unstoppable force, pulling everyone into its orbit, promising everything and perhaps delivering nothing but a hangover and a vague sense of dissatisfaction in the morning light. I knew, with a certainty that chilled me, that this was just the beginning of my entanglement with this world, with Gatsby, and with the intoxicating, dangerous allure of the American Dream gone wild.",

Excuse me.” She looked at me several times, her brows bent in an anxious frown, but finally she got up and followed the butler to the house. I waited, and sure enough, in a few minutes she came out again, walking slowly, in her sweet, supple way, a balance it seemed she had developed by walking on tightropes all her life. Our white girlhoods passed over in a mist; were there no young men at the time, with the right nose and the right voice, to woo us out of our solemn haughtiness? For a moment I thought I loved her. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home. I’d been writing letters once a week and signing them: “Love, Nick,” and all I’d thought about was that old sport of a card-case. Besides, I disliked her strongly. I agreed with him.

                "text": "I beg your pardon.” Gatsby’s butler was suddenly standing beside us. “Miss Baker?” he inquired. “I beg your pardon, but Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you alone.” “With me?” she exclaimed, in a burst of surprise. “About what?” “He wouldn’t say, madam. Excuse me.” She looked at me several times, her brows bent in an anxious frown, but finally she got up and followed the butler to the house. I waited, and sure enough, in a few minutes she came out again, walking slowly, in her sweet, supple way, a balance it seemed she had developed by walking on tightropes all her life. Our white girlhoods passed over in a mist; were there no young men at the time, with the right nose and the right voice, to woo us out of our solemn haughtiness? For a moment I thought I loved her. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home. I’d been writing letters once a week and signing them: “Love, Nick,” and all I’d thought about was that old sport of a card-case. Besides, I disliked her strongly. I agreed with him. It was two o’clock. The orchestra had played the melancholy theme from Tchaikovsky, and the butler had waited for an hour, and then they had started storming the doors. “You see,” cried a lady, “they can’t get in!” “They

                "text": "I beg your pardon.” Gatsby’s butler was suddenly standing beside us. “Miss Baker?” he inquired. “I beg your pardon, but Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you alone.” “With me?” she exclaimed, in a burst of surprise. “About what?” “He wouldn’t say, madam. Excuse me.” She looked at me several times, her brows bent in an anxious frown, but finally she got up and followed the butler to the house. I waited, and sure enough, in a few minutes she came out again, walking slowly, in her sweet, supple way, a balance it seemed she had developed by walking on tightropes all her life. Or, perhaps, that was only the effect of the dress. The white dress was ripped where she had torn a hole in it with a golf-club that afternoon. It was two o’clock. The orchestra had played the melancholy theme from Tchaikovsky, and the butler had waited for an hour, and then they had started storming the doors. “You see,” cried a lady, “they can’t get in!” “They can’t get in,” repeated a gentleman, “because the doors are locked.” “Oh, but they are not locked,” insisted the lady. She was right. The doors were not locked. And once inside, the large room was crowded. A girl in yellow played the piano, and a red-haired girl sang a song about the rain. She was heavily drunk with champagne, and she was weeping bitterly. She filled the pauses in the song with sobs, and then she went on in a trembling voice, tears making black streaks through the mascara all the way down her cheeks. A guest suggested that she sing us and weep no more, and she collapsed in a heap on a chair. “She argued with her husband,” explained a girl beside me. I looked around. Many women were arguing with men said to be their husbands. Even the sophisticated group from East Egg, which had been sitting together at the table, had disintegrated. One man was absorbed in deep conversation with the actress, and his wife alternated between an airy disdain and a fiercely possessive stare. Resistance to growing old and fat and fifty, which she found in the actress, had made her face hard and sharp and greedy. Two sober men were being urged from the house by their indignant wives. “Whenever I get to having a good time,” cried one of the wives, “some fool of a man always wants to go home with me.” “Selfish as hell,” muttered the other. “We’re almost the last house-party I’ve been to in five years,” said the husband, looking at his watch. “The orchestra left half an hour ago.” “Unbelievable behavior,” agreed the wives. They were not to be moved. The two men picked up their wives and started for the door. The wives were protesting violently, but there was nothing to be done. They were carried out, and the door closed behind them.",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces a lengthy, repetitive exchange about locked doors that is not present in the original passage. This invented dialogue dominates the latter part of the completion and distracts from the actual sequence of events.\n- The completion omits several major scenes from the original, including the depiction of the party's atmosphere, the musical performance, the emotional breakdown of a guest, and the altercations between couples.\n- There is an invented internal monologue and personal reflection from the narrator about feelings for Jordan and past relationships, which does not appear in the original at this point in the narrative.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the description of Jordan's demeanor and attire as she leaves with the butler, as well as the narrator's observations about her manner of movement.\n- The transition to the narrator being alone and the time of night is not clearly established.\n- The depiction of the party inside, including the music, the emotional state of the guests, and the specific actions of the woman in yellow, is missing.\n- The sequence of quarrels among the guests, including the specific interactions between husbands and wives and the eventual resolution, is omitted.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion provides inaccurate or invented dialogue between the butler and Jordan, including questions and responses not found in the original.\n- The timing and sequence of events are confused; the completion suggests Jordan returns quickly, which does not align with the original progression.\n- The invented internal reflections and references to the narrator's feelings and past are misplaced and do not match the original content or tone at this point.\n- The invented dialogue about locked doors is not only inaccurate but also disrupts the flow and structure of the original narrative."

I wanted to explain that I’d hunted for him early in the evening and to apologize for not having known him in the garden.\n“Don’t mention it,” he enjoined me eagerly. “Don’t give it another thought, old sport.” The familiar expression held no more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. “And don’t forget we’re going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning, at nine o’clock.”\nThen the butler, behind his shoulder:\n“Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir.”\n“All right, in a minute.

He was saying some last word to her in a low voice, and she answered him with an interested glance and a faint smile. Then she saw me and smiled, too. ‘Good night!’ called a woman from the steps. ‘The orchestra’s playing the “Love Nest,”’ she added incidentally. ‘Oh, my God!’ answered the woman with whom she was talking. I turned again to Gatsby and saw that he was still looking at Jordan Baker, but stood making an impatient gesture with his hand. ‘I’m five years too late for that,’ he said sadly. ‘Look here, this is a Mr. Carraway, an acquaintance of mine just met this afternoon.’ They shook hands briefly, and then she hurried on toward the steps. ‘Come to see me,’ she urged. ‘Telephone book… look under the name of Mrs. Sigourney Howard… My aunt will be glad to see you…’ ‘That’s sweet of you,’ I said, but she hurried up the steps. ‘You live at West Egg,’ she remarked contemptuously. She vanished into the crowd, and Gatsby turned to me again. ‘One moment!’ he said. ‘I’d like to speak to you about something very important, old sport.’ I followed him inside. We went into the library, and he closed the door. ‘I’ve been meaning to speak to you about this for some time,’ he began. ‘You see, I’ve heard about you from Jordan Baker.’ He paused, and I waited. ‘She told me about your conversation this afternoon.’ I nodded. ‘Well,’ he said, ‘she’s a great friend of mine, and I know she wouldn’t tell me anything that wasn’t true.’ He paused again. ‘I understand you’re a man of fine judgment and discretion.’ I was puzzled. ‘I’m afraid I don’t understand,’ I said. ‘Well, it’s a rather delicate matter,’ he continued. ‘You see, I’m in a position to do you a favor, and I’d like to do it for you.’ I was still more puzzled. ‘A favor?’ I repeated. ‘Yes, a favor. Something that would be of great help to you. Something that you’ve been wanting for a long time.’ He looked at me intently. ‘I don’t know what you mean,’ I said. ‘Well, it’s about your business,’ he said. ‘I understand you’re in the bond business.’ ‘That’s right,’ I said. ‘Well, I happen to know some people who are in a position to do you a great deal of good. People who could put you in the way of some money.’ I was astonished. ‘You mean—’ I began. ‘Yes,’ he interrupted. ‘I mean that I could arrange for you to meet some people who could help you out. People who could give you a hand up.’ He smiled. ‘It’s a little matter, but it might mean a great deal to you.’ I was silent for a moment. ‘I appreciate your offer,’ I said finally, ‘but I don’t think I can accept it.’ He looked surprised. ‘Why not?’ he asked. ‘Well,’ I said, ‘I’m afraid I don’t understand the situation. And I don’t like to take favors from people I don’t know.’ He nodded slowly. ‘I see,’ he said. ‘Well, perhaps another time.’ He stood up. ‘I’m sorry if I’ve bothered you,’ he said. ‘Not at all,’ I said. We went back into the hall. The last guests were leaving. Gatsby stood on the steps, waving good-bye. I went down the drive and turned onto the road. As I walked along, I thought about what Gatsby had said. It was all very strange. I couldn’t understand why he would want to do me a favor. And I didn’t like the idea of taking money from people I didn’t know. It all seemed a little too easy. I decided to forget about it. It was probably just a misunderstanding. I walked on, and soon I was home. I went to bed, but I couldn’t sleep. I kept thinking about Gatsby and his strange offer. I wondered what he was really up to. I decided to keep my distance from him. He seemed like a dangerous man. The next morning, I woke up early. I had a lot of work to do. I went to the office and spent the day working on my bonds. In the evening, I went out to dinner with a friend. We talked about the party at Gatsby’s. My friend had been there, too. He said it was the most amazing party he had ever been to. He said Gatsby was a very mysterious man. I agreed. After dinner, I went home. I was tired, and I went straight to bed. I slept soundly, and when I woke up the next morning, I felt much better. I decided to put Gatsby out of my mind. He was probably just a rich eccentric. I had my own life to live, and I didn’t have time for his strange goings-on.

          "text_segment": "But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite over. Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene. In the ditch beside the road, right side up, but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupé which had left Gatsby’s drive not two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However, as they had left their cars blocking the road, a harsh, discordant din from those in the rear had been audible for some time, and added to the already violent confusion of the scene.\nA man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in the middle of the road, looking from the car to the tyre and from the tyre to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.\n“See!” he explained. “It went in the ditch.”\nThe fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and I recognized first the unusual quality of wonder, and then the man—it was the late patron of Gatsby’s library.\n“How’d it happen?”\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\n“I know nothing whatever about mechanics,” he said decisively.\n“But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?”\n“Don’t ask me,” said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole matter. “I know very little about driving—next to nothing. It happened, and that’s all I know.”\n“Well, if you’re a poor driver you oughtn’t to try driving at night.”\n“But I wasn’t even trying,” he explained indignantly, “I wasn’t even trying.”\nAn awed hush fell upon the bystanders.\n“Do you want to commit suicide?”\n“You’re lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even trying!”\n“You don’t understand,” explained the criminal. “I wasn’t driving. There’s another man in the car.”\nThe shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained “Ah-h-h!” as the door of the coupé swung slowly open. The crowd—it was now a crowd—stepped back involuntarily, and when the door had opened wide there was a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale, dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.\nBlinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant groaning of the horns, the apparition stood swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the duster.\n“Wha’s matter?” he inquired calmly. “Did we run outa gas?”\n“Look!”\nHalf a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel—he stared at it for a moment, and then looked upward as though he suspected that it had dropped from the sky.\n“It came off,” someone explained.\nHe nodded.\n“At first I din’ notice we’d stopped.”\nA pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders, he remarked in a determined voice:\n“Wonder’ff tell me where there’s a gas’line station?”\nAt least a dozen men, some of them a little better off than he was, explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond.\n“Back out,” he suggested after a moment. “Put her in reverse.”\n“But the wheel’s off!”\nHe hesitated.\n“No harm in trying,” he said.\nThe caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and cut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsby’s house, making the night fine as before, and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden. A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host, who stood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.",

            "prefix-probing": "But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite over. The last stragglers were reluctant to leave Gatsby's enchanted garden. A few couples still danced listlessly on the marble patio, their movements slow and disconnected from the frantic energy that had pulsed through the house hours before. The orchestra, or what remained of it, played a final, mournful tune, the notes drifting like lost souls over the manicured lawn. Cars, long and sleek, lined the drive, their chauffeurs dozing or chatting quietly amongst themselves, waiting for their masters to finally tear themselves away from the magnetic pull of Gatsby's hospitality. Inside, through the open doors, I could see the wreckage of the party. Glasses lay shattered on the floor, spilled drinks stained the Persian rugs, and the air was thick with the smell of alcohol and wilting flowers. Servants, already beginning the monumental task of cleaning, moved silently through the rooms, their faces impassive, accustomed to the weekly chaos. It was a stark contrast to the vibrant, almost desperate gaiety of the party's peak. The illusion was fading, revealing the hollow core beneath the glittering surface. I paused at the bottom of the steps, watching the scene. There was a profound loneliness in the air, a sense of anticlimax that settled heavily after the forced exuberance. People who had laughed and danced together just an hour ago now stood awkwardly apart, their temporary bonds dissolved with the music. They were individuals again, facing the quiet reality of their own lives after escaping into Gatsby's dream for a few hours. Gatsby himself was nowhere to be seen. He usually stood by the door, bidding farewell to his guests with that famous, understanding smile. But tonight, perhaps, the effort had been too great, or perhaps he was already lost in his own thoughts, the dream he was chasing momentarily out of reach. I wondered if he felt the same emptiness I did, or if his focus remained solely on the green light across the bay, the symbol of his unattainable desire. The moon hung high and indifferent in the sky, casting long shadows that distorted the familiar landscape. The sound of distant laughter, a final burst from a departing car, echoed briefly and died away. The house, so full of life and noise moments before, began to settle into a vast, silent monument to a man's singular obsession. It was a palace built on a foundation of hope and illusion, and in the quiet aftermath, its artificiality felt palpable. I thought of the stories I had heard about Gatsby, the rumors that swirled around him like the smoke from the discarded cigarettes on his lawn. Was he a German spy? A murderer? A bootlegger? The truth, I suspected, was both simpler and more complex than any of the gossip. He was a man who had built an entire world around a single idea, a single person, and the sheer scale of his effort was both admirable and terrifying. As I walked towards the gate, the cool night air clearing my head, I felt a sense of detachment. I was an observer in this world, a temporary resident in the land of the rich and careless. Their lives, with their extravagant parties, their complicated affairs, and their underlying unhappiness, seemed both fascinating and ultimately meaningless. They were like characters in a play, performing their roles with great energy but little genuine emotion. The road outside Gatsby's estate was quiet, a stark contrast to the bustling activity within. The real world, mundane and predictable, waited just beyond the gates. But the image of the house, standing alone and slightly forlorn in the moonlight, lingered in my mind. It was a symbol of Gatsby himself – grand, mysterious, and ultimately isolated by his own creation. I considered the people I had met that night. The superficial charm, the casual cruelty, the desperate search for excitement. They were drawn to Gatsby's light like moths, seeking warmth and brilliance, but perhaps unaware of the fire that fueled it. And Gatsby, in turn, used them as props in his elaborate production, hoping to lure the one audience member who mattered. The air grew cooler as I walked, the sounds of the party fading behind me. The night was deep and silent now, broken only by the chirping of crickets and the distant hum of traffic on the highway. I was leaving the dream world and returning to reality, but the echoes of the evening stayed with me. The image of Daisy's face, the sound of Gatsby's voice, the unsettling feeling that something significant, perhaps something tragic, was unfolding beneath the surface of this glittering society. It was a world of immense privilege and profound emptiness, a place where money could buy anything but happiness, and where dreams were pursued with a relentless, almost frightening intensity. Gatsby's party was over, but the story, I knew, was far from finished. The seeds of future events had been sown in the champagne and the laughter, and the harvest, I suspected, would be bitter. The night had revealed more than just the end of a party; it had offered a glimpse into the heart of an era, a society teetering on the edge of something unknown, driven by desires they barely understood. The silence outside the gates felt heavy with anticipation, as if the very air was waiting for the next act to begin. The grand illusion had momentarily lifted, leaving behind a sense of unease and the lingering question of what lay ahead for Gatsby and the people who orbited his strange, compelling world. The steps I had descended led not just out of a house, but out of a moment of manufactured joy and into the quiet, uncertain reality that always waited beyond the gates of West Egg.",

On the contrary, they were merely casual events in a crowded summer, and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs.\nMost of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their first names, and lunched with them in dark, crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction, so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow quietly away.\nI took dinner usually at the Yale Club—for some reason it was the gloomiest event of my day—and then I went upstairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour. There were generally a few rioters around, but they never came into the library, so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night was mellow, I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel, and over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station.\nI began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night, and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever know or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness. At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others—poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner—young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.\nAgain at eight o’clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were lined five deep with throbbing taxicabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside. Imagining that I, too, was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate excitement, I wished them well.\nFor a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I found her again. At first I was flattered to go places with her, because she was a golf champion, and everyone knew her name. Then it was something more. I wasn’t actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed something—most affectations conceal something eventually, even though they don’t in the beginning—and one day I found what it was. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about it—and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at Daisy’s. At her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapers—a suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round. The thing approached the proportions of a scandal—then died away. A caddy retracted his statement, and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.\nJordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest. She wasn’t able to endure being at a disadvantage and, given this unwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body.\nIt made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeply—I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on that same house-party that we had a curious conversation about driving a car. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one man’s coat.\n“You’re a rotten driver,” I protested. “Either you ought to be more careful, or you oughtn’t to drive at all.”\n“I am careful.”\n“No, you’re not.”\n“Well, other people are,” she said lightly.\n“What’s that got to do with it?”\n“They’ll keep out of my way,” she insisted. “It takes two to make an accident.”\n“Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.”\n“I hope I never will,” she answered. “I hate careless people. That’s why I like you.”\nHer grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved her. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home. I’d been writing letters once a week and signing them: “Love, Nick,” and all I could think of was how, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint moustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.\nEveryone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.",

            "He feels this list offers a more concrete picture of the attendees than simple generalizations.",
            "The core observation is that these guests readily accepted Gatsby's hospitality while knowing virtually nothing about him.",
            "Nick provides a detailed list of guests from East Egg, including families like the Chester Beckers, Leeches, Hornbeams, Willie Voltaires, and Blackbucks, along with individuals like Bunsen, Doctor Civet, the Ismays, Chrysties, Edgar Beaver, and Clarence Endive, sometimes noting their quirks or fates.",
            "He continues with guests from farther on Long Island: the Cheadles, O. R. P. Schraeders, Stonewall Jackson Abrams, Fishguards, Ripley Snells (involved in an incident leading to jail), the Dancies, S. B. Whitebait, Maurice A. Flink, the Hammerheads, and Beluga the tobacco importer with his daughters.",
            "Guests from West Egg are enumerated, many associated with the film industry: the Poles, Mulreadys, Cecil Roebuck, Cecil Schoen, Senator Gulick, Newton Orchid, Eckhaust, Clyde Cohen, Don S. Schwartz, Arthur McCarty, Catlips, Bembergs, and G. Earl Muldoon (whose brother committed murder).",

          "text_segment": "On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages alongshore, the world and its mistress returned to Gatsby’s house and twinkled hilariously on his lawn.\n“He’s a bootlegger,” said the young ladies, moving somewhere between his cocktails and his flowers. “One time he killed a man who had found out that he was nephew to Von Hindenburg and second cousin to the devil. Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there crystal glass.”\nOnce I wrote down on the empty spaces of a timetable the names of those who came to Gatsby’s house that summer. It is an old timetable now, disintegrating at its folds, and headed “This schedule in effect July 5th, 1922.” But I can still read the grey names, and they will give you a better impression than my generalities of those who accepted Gatsby’s hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing whatever about him.\nFrom East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches, and a man named Bunsen, whom I knew at Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet, who was drowned last summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and the Willie Voltaires, and a whole clan named Blackbuck, who always gathered in a corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near. And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and Mr. Chrystie’s wife), and Edgar Beaver, whose hair, they say, turned cotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.\nClarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He came only once, in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the garden. From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O. R. P. Schraeders, and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia, and the Fishguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there three days before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive that Mrs. Ulysses Swett’s automobile ran over his right hand. The Dancies came, too, and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over sixty, and Maurice A. Flink, and the Hammerheads, and Beluga the tobacco importer, and Beluga’s girls.\nFrom West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Schoen and Gulick the State senator and Newton Orchid, who controlled Films Par Excellence, and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don S. Schwartz (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the movies in one way or another. And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G. Earl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his wife. Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B. (“Rot-Gut”) Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly—they came to gamble, and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was cleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably next day.\nA man named Klipspringer was there so often that he became known as “the boarder”—I doubt if he had any other home. Of theatrical people there were Gus Waize and Horace O’Donavan and Lester Myer and George Duckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New York were the Chromes and the Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry L. Palmetto, who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train in Times Square.\nBenny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite the same ones in physical person, but they were so identical one with another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before. I have forgotten their names—Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela, or Gloria or Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American capitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves to be.\nIn addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O’Brien came there at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer, who had his nose shot off in the war, and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag, his fiancée, and Ardita Fitz-Peters and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of the American Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip, with a man reputed to be her chauffeur, and a prince of something, whom we called Duke, and whose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten.\nAll these people came to Gatsby’s house in the summer.",

            "prefix-probing": "On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages alongshore, the world and its mistress returned to Gatsby’s house and twinkled hilariously on his lawn. The cars, which had been parked five deep in the drive and along the road, were fewer now, but a substantial number remained, gleaming dully in the morning sun. The air, still thick with the scent of crushed mint and spilled liquor from the night before, hummed with a low, persistent murmur of voices and laughter. On the lawn, where the grass was trampled and littered with discarded glasses and crumpled napkins, groups of people lounged in deck chairs or sprawled on blankets. Some, still in evening clothes, looked disheveled and weary, their gaiety now a forced, brittle thing. Others, having changed into bathing suits, splashed noisily in the pool, their shouts echoing across the manicured grounds. Inside the house, the scene was one of opulent disarray. The ballroom, where the orchestra had played until dawn, was empty save for a few stragglers slumped in chairs, nursing drinks. The library, usually a quiet sanctuary, was filled with the chatter of those who had discovered its existence the night before and now felt entitled to occupy it. The dining room table was still laden with the remnants of the feast – platters of cold cuts, half-eaten pastries, bottles of champagne, some still corked, others empty. Servants moved quietly through the rooms, their faces impassive, beginning the monumental task of restoring order. I walked through the grounds, feeling like an anthropologist observing a strange, exotic tribe. These people, drawn from the fringes of the fashionable world, from the arts, from finance, from nowhere in particular, seemed to exist only in the context of Gatsby’s parties. They arrived, consumed his hospitality with a voracious appetite, and then, like moths after the light is extinguished, dispersed, leaving behind only the detritus of their pleasure. They knew Gatsby only vaguely, if at all, and he, I suspected, knew them even less. They were simply the necessary backdrop, the vibrant, shifting scenery against which his own drama was played out. There was a curious lack of intimacy about it all. Despite the proximity, the shared space, the forced jollity, everyone seemed profoundly alone. Conversations were superficial, punctuated by bursts of loud, meaningless laughter. Relationships seemed transient, formed and dissolved within the span of a single evening. It was a world built on illusion, on the fleeting moment, on the desperate pursuit of a good time that always seemed just out of reach. I saw women with tired eyes and smudged makeup, their expensive dresses looking crumpled and sad in the harsh morning light. I saw men with flushed faces and loosened ties, their bravado of the night before replaced by a quiet exhaustion. They were all waiting, I realized, waiting for something – for the party to truly end, for the hangover to subside, for the return to their own less spectacular lives, or perhaps, for the next invitation to arrive. Gatsby himself was nowhere to be seen. He rarely was during these post-party hours. He was the orchestrator, the host, the mysterious figure whose presence was felt everywhere but whose person was seldom encountered amidst the throng. He remained, even in his own house, an enigma, a figure of speculation and rumour. His absence on these mornings only added to the mystique, allowing the guests to project their own fantasies onto him. The contrast with the quiet, church-going world just beyond the hedges was stark. Here, there was no reverence, no reflection, only the continued, albeit subdued, pursuit of sensation. It was a world without consequences, or so it seemed. The rules that governed ordinary life did not apply here. Time itself seemed to operate differently, stretching and distorting to accommodate the endless cycle of revelry and recovery. I sat by the pool for a while, watching the swimmers. They were young, mostly, their bodies tanned and athletic. They laughed and splashed, seemingly oblivious to the wreckage around them. They were the embodiment of the carefree, privileged youth that Gatsby seemed to court. They represented a certain kind of freedom, a freedom from responsibility, from worry, from the constraints of ordinary morality. But even their laughter seemed to have a hollow ring to it, a desperate edge that belied their apparent happiness. It struck me then how much energy was expended in this relentless pursuit of pleasure. The sheer effort involved in maintaining this level of artificial gaiety, in keeping the party going, in pretending that this was the most important thing in the world. It was a performance, a grand, elaborate show, and everyone was both actor and audience. As the morning wore on, the crowd gradually thinned. Cars pulled away, their occupants heading back to the city or to other points on the island. The servants continued their work, clearing away the debris, restoring the house to its immaculate state, preparing it for the next invasion. By late afternoon, the lawn was empty, the pool quiet, the house silent once more. Only the lingering scent of alcohol and the trampled grass remained as evidence of the weekend's festivities. The world and its mistress had departed, leaving Gatsby alone in his magnificent, empty house, presumably waiting for the next Saturday night. The cycle would begin again, the same faces, the same laughter, the same desperate, glittering pursuit of something indefinable. And I, the observer from the sidelines, would watch it all unfold, fascinated and repelled in equal measure.",

          "text_segment": "At nine o’clock, one morning late in July, Gatsby’s gorgeous car lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody from its three-noted horn.\nIt was the first time he had called on me, though I had gone to two of his parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation, made frequent use of his beach.\n“Good morning, old sport. You’re having lunch with me today and I thought we’d ride up together.”\nHe was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American—that comes, I suppose, with the absence of lifting work in youth and, even more, with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games. This quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.\nHe saw me looking with admiration at his car.\n“It’s pretty, isn’t it, old sport?” He jumped off to give me a better view. “Haven’t you ever seen it before?”\nI’d seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream colour, bright with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and toolboxes, and terraced with a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory, we started to town.\nI had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and found, to my disappointment, that he had little to say. So my first impression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate roadhouse next door.\nAnd then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn’t reached West Egg village before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-coloured suit.\n“Look here, old sport,” he broke out surprisingly, “what’s your opinion of me, anyhow?”\nA little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that question deserves.\n“Well, I’m going to tell you something about my life,” he interrupted. “I don’t want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear.”\nSo he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavoured conversation in his halls.\n“I’ll tell you God’s truth.” His right hand suddenly ordered divine retribution to stand by. “I am the son of some wealthy people in the Middle West—all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford, because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It is a family tradition.”\nHe looked at me sideways—and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was lying. He hurried the phrase “educated at Oxford,” or swallowed it, or choked on it, as though it had bothered him before. And with this doubt, his whole statement fell to pieces, and I wondered if there wasn’t something a little sinister about him, after all.\n“What part of the Middle West?” I inquired casually.\n“San Francisco.”\n“I see.”\n“My family all died and I came into a good deal of money.”\nHis voice was solemn, as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan still haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg, but a glance at him convinced me otherwise.\n“After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of Europe—Paris, Venice, Rome—collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago.”\nWith an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The very phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a turbaned “character” leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne.\n“Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief, and I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a commission as first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest I took the remains of my machine-gun battalion so far forward that there was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn’t advance. We stayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty men with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of dead. I was promoted to be a major, and every Allied government gave me a decoration—even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea!”\nLittle Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded at them—with his smile. The smile comprehended Montenegro’s troubled history and sympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people. It appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had elicited this tribute from Montenegro’s warm little heart. My incredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming hastily through a dozen magazines.\nHe reached in his pocket, and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon, fell into my palm.\n“That’s the one from Montenegro.”\nTo my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look. “Orderi di Danilo,” ran the circular legend, “Montenegro, Nicolas Rex.”\n“Turn it.”\n“Major Jay Gatsby,” I read, “For Valour Extraordinary.”\n“Here’s another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Oxford days. It was taken in Trinity Quad—the man on my left is now the Earl of Doncaster.”\nIt was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an archway through which were visible a host of spires. There was Gatsby, looking a little, not much, younger—with a cricket bat in his hand.",

It was a rich cream-colored car, bright with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hat-boxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and terraced with a labyrinth of wind-shields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down beside him, I became aware of the easy money in the vicinity and of the option of not paying for anything. I accepted a cigarette from the case he offered me.  “Your place looks like a Christmas tree,” he said, by way of explanation, “all lit up. I stopped by at two in the morning, and you had your house lit from cellar to garret.”  “The whole town is lit up. I came back last night at midnight.”  “It was a great relief,” he admitted. “I thought you might be offended, God knows. I don’t want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear.”  “I suppose not.”  “I’m the son of some wealthy people in the middle-west—all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford, because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It’s a family tradition.”  He looked at me sideways—and I knew why. It was an absurdly plausible explanation. But you see I was not listening. I had been too engrossed in his \"sort of an English accent\"—the phrase lingered in the air for a moment before he went on.  “As I said before, I was educated at Oxford. It is a great tradition. A family tradition.”  He hurried the phrase \"family tradition\" as if he were afraid I would interrupt him.  “Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief, and I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a commission as first lieutenant when I was in the Argonne Forest, and I was promoted to be a major, and every Allied government gave me a decoration—even Montenegro, little Montenegro down by the Adriatic Sea!”  Little Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded at them—with his smile. The smile comprehended Montenegro’s great exploits in the war.  “Finest specimens of human molars,” he added.  “What?”  “That’s what I said. Finest specimens of human molars.”  He took out a pile of leather-bound books from his pocket.  “These are my credentials,” he said. “I carry them with me all the time.”  I looked at them. They were all bound in leather and stamped with the seal of the University of Oxford.  “You see,” he said, “I was there.”  He fumbled in his pocket and produced a small, flat box of gold.  “This is a souvenir of the war,” he said. “From Montenegro.”  He opened the box. Inside, on a bed of purple velvet, lay a medal.  “Major Jay Gatsby,” I read, “For Valour Extraordinary.”  “It was a great war,” he said. “A great relief.”  He put the medal back in the box and returned it to his pocket.  “And this,” he said, producing a photograph from his wallet, “is a souvenir of Oxford.”  It was a large photograph, faded and cracked, of a group of young men in blazers, sitting on the steps of a building.  “That’s me,” said Gatsby, pointing to one of the faces. “And that’s the Earl of Doncaster, and that’s the Duke of Buccleuch, and that’s Lord Fermor, and that’s Mr. Carraway.”  “You were there with them?”  “Yes,” he said. “We were all there together. It was a great time.”  He put the photograph back in his wallet.  “I’m going to tell you something else,” he said. “I’m going to tell you something about my life. I don’t want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear.”  He paused, and I waited.  “I am a man of great wealth,” he said. “I have a great deal of money.”  He paused again.  “I

It was the first time he had been over this year, though I’d been over there not a few times. I came down the steps in a hurry, carrying an armful of flowers, and met him at the foot of the steps.\n“Good morning, old sport. You’re having lunch with me to-day and I thought we’d go into town.”\nThere was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. His speaking voice, a low, husky murmur, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. There was always a hint of scarcely suppressed excitement in his voice, a constant flicker of interminable rivalry. He was never quite still; there was always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.\nHe saw me looking with admiration at his car.\n“It’s pretty, isn’t it, old sport?” He jumped off to give me a better view. “Haven’t you ever seen it before?”\nI’d seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream-colored, bright with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hat-boxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and terraced with a labyrinth of wind-shields that mirrored a dozen suns.

I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace on the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with their crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart.\n“I’m going to make a big request of you today,” he said, pocketing his souvenirs with satisfaction, “so I thought you ought to know something about me. I didn’t want you to think I was just some nobody. You see, I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad things that happened to me.” He hesitated. “You’ll hear about it this afternoon.”\n“At lunch?”\n“No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you’re taking Miss Baker to tea.”\n“Do you mean you’re in love with Miss Baker?”\n“No, old sport, I’m not. But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak to you about this matter.”\nI hadn’t the faintest idea what “this matter” was, but I was more annoyed than interested. I hadn’t asked Jordan to tea in order to discuss Mr. Jay Gatsby. I was sure the request would be something utterly fantastic, and for a moment I was sorry I’d ever set foot upon his overpopulated lawn.\nHe wouldn’t say another word. His correctness grew on him as we neared the city. We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of red-belted oceangoing ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark, undeserted saloons of the faded-gilt nineteen-hundreds. Then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a glimpse of Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting vitality as we went by.\nWith fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half Astoria—only half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevated I heard the familiar “jug-jug-spat!” of a motorcycle, and a frantic policeman rode alongside.\n“All right, old sport,” called Gatsby. We slowed down. Taking a white card from his wallet, he waved it before the man’s eyes.\n“Right you are,” agreed the policeman, tipping his cap. “Know you next time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse me!”\n“What was that?” I inquired. “The picture of Oxford?”\n“I was able to do the commissioner a favour once, and he sends me a Christmas card every year.”\nOver the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of nonolfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.\nA dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two carriages with drawn blinds, and by more cheerful carriages for friends. The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short upper lips of southeastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of Gatsby’s splendid car was included in their sombre holiday. As we crossed Blackwell’s Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white chauffeur, in which sat three modish negroes, two bucks and a girl. I laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in haughty rivalry.\n“Anything can happen now that we’ve slid over this bridge,” I thought; “anything at all…”\nEven Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.",

I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace on the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with their crimson light, the distress of all the poor he had met. With an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The thing approached the proportions of standing alone on the last barrier of civilization. “I didn’t like to hear a personal remark,” Gatsby explained. “A man like me must be careful.” There was a pause. “And my parents are dead,” he announced matter-of-factly. “Of course I was brought up in America, but educated at Oxford, because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It is a family tradition.” He looked at me sideways—and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was lying. He hurried the phrase “educated at Oxford,” or swallowed it, or choked on it, as though it had taken him years to get it right. He was silent for a moment. The idea of Gatsby, big swell, Gatsby who could afford to forget about the past, was in effect extinguished by this statement. I waited, and sure enough, in a moment he looked at me with more attention. “I am going to make a big request of you to-day,” he said, immediately and without caution. “I want you and Jordan to come over to my house this afternoon.” The modesty of the demand shook me. He offered me the money he had made at the drug-stores. He never knew how near he came to giving me a dead rattle. “I beg your pardon,” said I. “Did you request my presence alone?” “No, he wants to know if you’ll invite Daisy to tea,” said the Jordan Baker suddenly from the back seat. “Of course I will. What time?” “He wants it to be in the afternoon,” explained Jordan, “so she can see his house.” This was a new idea to me. I don’t think it ever occurred to me that I was doing anything more than making a social call. I thought of the three rooms over the garage that I had rented from Mr. McKee. “Well, I’d like to,” I said, “but—” We were close to the city now, on the crowded side of the Queensboro Bridge, a hundred feet above the East River. And then, as if in response to my thought, there was a flutter of a dress and the crunch of a shoe on the gravel, and I saw that Jordan Baker was standing beside me. “I’m sorry,” she said, “I didn’t mean to interrupt. But I thought you might be interested to know that Mr. Gatsby is a very rich man.” “Oh, I know that,” I said. “But I didn’t know he was so rich.” “He is,” she said, and then she added, “He’s a very generous man, too. He gave me a pearl necklace the other day.” I looked at her, and she looked at me, and we both laughed. “Well, I’m glad to hear it,” I said. “I hope he’ll be generous to you, too.” “He will,” she said. “He’s going to give me a car.” I looked at her again, and she looked at me, and we both laughed again. “Well, I’m glad to hear it,” I said. “I hope he’ll be generous to you, too.” “He will,” she said. “He’s going to give me a car.” I looked at her again, and she looked at me, and we both laughed again. “Well, I’m glad to hear it,” I said. “I hope he’ll be generous to you, too.” “He will,” she

                "text": "Then it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace on the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with their crimson light, the distress of all the poor he had met. With an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The thing approached the proportions of standing alone on the last barrier of civilization. “I didn’t like to hear a personal remark,” Gatsby explained. “A man like me must be careful.” There was a pause. “And my parents are dead,” he announced matter-of-factly. “Of course I was brought up in America, but educated at Oxford, because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It is a family tradition.” He looked at me sideways—and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was lying. He hurried the phrase “educated at Oxford,” or swallowed it, or choked on it, as though it had taken him years to get it right. He was silent for a moment. The idea of Gatsby, big swell, Gatsby who could afford to forget about the past, was in effect extinguished by this statement.

                "text": "Then it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace on the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with their crimson light, the distress of all the poor he had met. With an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The thing approached the proportions of standing alone on the last barrier of civilization. “I’m going to tell you something about my life,” he interrupted. “I haven’t told anybody who came to my house. They know I had a bad time at the end of the war, and that I came from the Middle West—.” Instead of being the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe—so I complained in my own mind, and said nothing. “—and you may as well know whether I was lying on the beach all the time. You see, I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad thing that happened to me.” He hesitated. “You’ll hear about it from Jordan Baker. She’s going to tell you all about it this afternoon.” “She’s going to tell me what?” inquired Jordan. “Fifty miles an hour,” muttered Gatsby. He sped up the car. “I don’t want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear.” “I suppose not.” “I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford, because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It is a family tradition.” He looked at me sideways—and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was lying. He hurried the phrase “educated at Oxford,” or swallowed it, or choked on it, as though it had taken him years to get it right. “It was an American living in Monte Carlo,” he went on, “in Easters of 1919. He was a great friend of mine. I was in the drug business and then I was in the oil business. But I made a lot of money and I wanted to do something for him. I bought him a string of drug-stores and a lot of oil wells. I owned them myself. I was a partner with a fellow named Wolfshiem. He’s a gambler.

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces invented scenes and dialogue that do not appear in the original, such as extended conversations with Jordan Baker about gifts and repeated references to being given a car. This invented content replaces significant portions of the original narrative and dialogue.\n- The completion omits the entire sequence of the car journey into the city, including the encounter with the policeman, the description of the cityscape, and the symbolic events and observations made during the drive.\n- The completion contains a repetitive, looping exchange between characters that is not present in the original and disrupts the narrative flow.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the original's detailed account of the protagonist's internal reactions and reflections during the conversation with Gatsby.\n- The progression of events during the car ride, including passing specific locations, observing notable scenes, and the protagonist's impressions of the city, are missing.\n- Key symbolic moments, such as the encounter with the funeral procession and the limousine with its passengers, are not included.\n- The original's closing reflections on the sense of possibility and wonder as they cross the bridge are absent.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion misattributes actions and dialogue, assigning lines and intentions to characters that do not match the original sequence.\n- The timing and context of the request made by Gatsby are altered, and the nature of the request is inaccurately described.\n- The sequence of events is disrupted, with invented conversations replacing the actual progression from the palace imagery to the drive into the city.\n- The completion introduces factual inaccuracies regarding character relationships and motivations, and it repeats invented dialogue excessively, which is not present in the original passage."

The thing approached the proportions of standing alone on the last barrier of civilization. “I’m going to tell you something about my life,” he interrupted. “I haven’t told anybody who came to my house. They know I had a bad time at the end of the war, and that I came from the Middle West—.” Instead of being the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe—so I complained in my own mind, and said nothing. “—and you may as well know whether I was lying on the beach all the time. You see, I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad thing that happened to me.” He hesitated. “You’ll hear about it from Jordan Baker. She’s going to tell you all about it this afternoon.” “She’s going to tell me what?” inquired Jordan. “Fifty miles an hour,” muttered Gatsby. He sped up the car. “I don’t want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear.” “I suppose not.” “I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford, because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It is a family tradition.” He looked at me sideways—and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was lying. He hurried the phrase “educated at Oxford,” or swallowed it, or choked on it, as though it had taken him years to get it right. He was silent for a moment. The idea of Gatsby, big swell, Gatsby who could afford to forget about the past, was in effect extinguished by this statement. I waited, and sure enough, in a moment he looked at me with more attention. “I am going to make a big request of you to-day,” he said, immediately and without caution. “I want to get the hear all about it,” murmured Jordan Baker. She was leaning forward, her face turned toward him eagerly. “Well,” said Gatsby, “I’m going to tell you.” He looked at me. “I’m going to tell you a big secret.” With an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces invented scenes and dialogue early on, such as references to helping the poor and internal monologue about civilization, which are not present in the original passage.\n- There is a significant omission of the entire sequence involving the drive toward the city, including the passing of specific locations, the encounter with the police officer, and the various observations made from the car.\n- The completion devolves into a repetitive, irrelevant loop about a character fixing a sporting event, which is not part of this section of the original text and disrupts the narrative flow.\n- The ending omits the original’s closing reflections and the significant cityscape and character observations.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the detailed description of the journey into the city, including the passing of notable landmarks, the visual impressions of the city, and the atmospheric details that set the scene.\n- There is no mention of the interaction with the police officer, the use of a card, or the explanation that follows.\n- The passage omits the observations of other vehicles and people encountered on the way, such as the funeral procession and the limousine with its occupants.\n- The original’s concluding thoughts and the sense of possibility as the city is approached are missing.\n\n3.

          "text_segment": "Roaring noon. In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby for lunch. Blinking away the brightness of the street outside, my eyes picked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.\n“Mr. Carraway, this is my friend Mr. Wolfshiem.”\nA small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half-darkness.\n“—So I took one look at him,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, shaking my hand earnestly, “and what do you think I did?”\n“What?” I inquired politely.\nBut evidently he was not addressing me, for he dropped my hand and covered Gatsby with his expressive nose.\n“I handed the money to Katspaugh and I said: ‘All right, Katspaugh, don’t pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.’ He shut it then and there.”\nGatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the restaurant, whereupon Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was starting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction.\n“Highballs?” asked the head waiter.\n“This is a nice restaurant here,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, looking at the presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. “But I like across the street better!”\n“Yes, highballs,” agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfshiem: “It’s too hot over there.”\n“Hot and small—yes,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “but full of memories.”\n“What place is that?” I asked.\n“The old Metropole.”\n“The old Metropole,” brooded Mr. Wolfshiem gloomily. “Filled with faces dead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I can’t forget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. It was six of us at the table, and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening. When it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a funny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside. ‘All right,’ says Rosy, and begins to get up, and I pulled him down in his chair.\n“ ‘Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don’t you, so help me, move outside this room.’\n“It was four o’clock in the morning then, and if we’d of raised the blinds we’d of seen daylight.”\n“Did he go?” I asked innocently.\n“Sure he went.” Mr. Wolfshiem’s nose flashed at me indignantly. “He turned around in the door and says: ‘Don’t let that waiter take away my coffee!’ Then he went out on the sidewalk, and they shot him three times in his full belly and drove away.”\n“Four of them were electrocuted,” I said, remembering.\n“Five, with Becker.” His nostrils turned to me in an interested way. “I understand you’re looking for a business gonnegtion.”\nThe juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered for me:\n“Oh, no,” he exclaimed, “this isn’t the man.”\n“No?” Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed.\n“This is just a friend. I told you we’d talk about that some other time.”\n“I beg your pardon,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “I had a wrong man.”\nA succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting the more sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with ferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around the room—he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly behind. I think that, except for my presence, he would have taken one short glance beneath our own table.",

            "prefix-probing": "Roaring noon. The sun beat down on West Egg with a ferocity that seemed almost personal, baking the manicured lawns and turning the air above the driveways into shimmering waves. Even the colossal, raw-white palace of Jay Gatsby seemed to wilt slightly under the oppressive glare, its towers and terraces losing some of their defiant sparkle in the flat, blinding light. Inside, the air was thick and still, despite the efforts of whirring electric fans that merely stirred the heat around like a spoon in heavy soup. The scent of cut grass, wilting flowers, and something vaguely alcoholic hung in the air, a residue of the previous night's revelry that the sun had failed to burn away. Nick Carraway felt the heat press against him as he stood by a tall window, looking out at the shimmering Sound. The water, usually a cool, inviting blue, was now a dull, metallic grey under the sun's hammer. He had come over at Daisy's casual invitation, a summons delivered with that familiar, breathless urgency that always masked a deeper, unarticulated need. Tom Buchanan was somewhere in the house, a restless, powerful presence even when unseen, his voice occasionally booming from another room like distant thunder. Jordan Baker was draped elegantly on a chaise lounge, a cigarette held languidly between her fingers, her eyes half-closed against the glare reflecting off the polished floor. She seemed impervious to the heat, encased in her own cool, detached world. Then there was Daisy. She drifted into the room like a white cloud, her voice a low, thrilling murmur that promised secrets and laughter. She wore a dress the color of a summer sky just before dusk, and her eyes, the color of the sea on a clear day, held a familiar, wistful expression. The heat seemed to cling to her, making her movements languid, almost dreamlike. She fanned herself slowly with a small, feathered fan, her wrist turning with a delicate grace. Gatsby appeared shortly after, emerging from the shadows of the hallway. He was dressed impeccably, as always, in a light linen suit that seemed impossibly crisp in the heat. His smile, that famous, understanding smile, flickered across his face as he greeted them, but there was a tension in his shoulders, a watchfulness in his eyes that the smile couldn't quite conceal. He moved with a restless energy that seemed at odds with the oppressive stillness of the house. He suggested they go out, perhaps to the city, to escape the heat. The idea hung in the air, charged with unspoken possibilities and dangers. Tom entered the room then, filling the space with his sheer physical presence. He looked hot and bothered, his face flushed. He eyed Gatsby with a proprietary air, a silent challenge passing between the two men that was almost palpable in the stifling heat. The air grew heavier, thicker with unspoken words and simmering resentments. The casual afternoon gathering had suddenly acquired an edge, a tension that the heat seemed to amplify, pressing down on them all. Daisy, sensing the shift, laughed a little too brightly, suggesting they have some iced tea. The sound was brittle, like thin ice cracking. Gatsby watched her, his expression unreadable. Tom watched Gatsby, his jaw set. Nick felt the familiar discomfort of being caught in the crosscurrents of their lives, a silent observer in a drama he couldn't fully comprehend. The heat outside continued its relentless assault, mirroring the rising temperature within the room. The afternoon stretched ahead, long and uncertain, filled with the promise of confrontation and the heavy weight of the past. The roaring noon had given way to a simmering afternoon, pregnant with the possibility of storm, the unbearable heat pressing down on them all.",

Despite the ostensible secrecy of the meeting it was more or less a public affair. When he saw me a sly grin came into his face, and, leaning across the table, he tapped my shoulder with a soft fat finger, and said: \"Look here, old sport, you come with me and see the fellows.\" I went with him inside. A small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with pale, bright eyes. \"This is Mr. Carraway,\" said Gatsby, cutting a short fine line at the last word, \"Mr. Wolfshiem.\" A succulent hash arrived, and for a while I lost sight of Gatsby and was staring at Wolfshiem. He was a small, flat-nosed Jew with an enormous head, and tiny eyes, which looked out of their expanded pupils over a hooked nose. He was eating with ferocious delicacy, his eyes roving here and there, scanning the whole room, including the area behind our table.

Why has it all got to come through Miss Baker?”\n“Oh, it’s nothing underhand,” he assured me. “Miss Baker’s a great sportswoman, you know, and she’d never do anything that wasn’t all right.”\nSuddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up, and hurried from the room, leaving me with Mr. Wolfshiem at the table.\n“He has to telephone,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, following him with his eyes. “Fine fellow, isn’t he? Handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman.”\n“Yes.”\n“He’s an Oggsford man.”\n“Oh!”\n“He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?”\n“I’ve heard of it.”\n“It’s one of the most famous colleges in the world.”\n“Have you known Gatsby for a long time?” I inquired.\n“Several years,” he answered in a gratified way. “I made the pleasure of his acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a man of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to myself: ‘There’s the kind of man you’d like to take home and introduce to your mother and sister.’ ” He paused. “I see you’re looking at my cuff buttons.”\nI hadn’t been looking at them, but I did now. They were composed of oddly familiar pieces of ivory.\n“Finest specimens of human molars,” he informed me.\n“Well!” I inspected them. “That’s a very interesting idea.”\n“Yeah.” He flipped his sleeves up under his coat. “Yeah, Gatsby’s very careful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend’s wife.”\nWhen the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat down Mr. Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet.\n“I have enjoyed my lunch,” he said, “and I’m going to run off from you two young men before I outstay my welcome.”\n“Don’t hurry Meyer,” said Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfshiem raised his hand in a sort of benediction.\n“You’re very polite, but I belong to another generation,” he announced solemnly. “You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and your—” He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his hand. “As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won’t impose myself on you any longer.”\nAs he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling. I wondered if I had said anything to offend him.\n“He becomes very sentimental sometimes,” explained Gatsby. “This is one of his sentimental days. He’s quite a character around New York—a denizen of Broadway.”\n“Who is he, anyhow, an actor?”\n“No.”\n“A dentist?”\n“Meyer Wolfshiem? No, he’s a gambler.” Gatsby hesitated, then added, coolly: “He’s the man who fixed the World’s Series back in 1919.”\n“Fixed the World’s Series?” I repeated.\nThe idea staggered me. I remembered, of course, that the World’s Series had been fixed in 1919, but if I had thought of it at all I would have thought of it as a thing that merely happened, the end of some inevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million people—with the single-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe.\n“How did he happen to do that?” I asked after a minute.\n“He just saw the opportunity.”\n“Why isn’t he in jail?”\n“They can’t get him, old sport. He’s a smart man.”\nI insisted on paying the check. As the waiter brought my change I caught sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room.\n“Come along with me for a minute,” I said; “I’ve got to say hello to someone.”\nWhen he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our direction.\n“Where’ve you been?” he demanded eagerly. “Daisy’s furious because you haven’t called up.”\n“This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.”\nThey shook hands briefly, and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over Gatsby’s face.\n“How’ve you been, anyhow?” demanded Tom of me. “How’d you happen to come up this far to eat?”\n“I’ve been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.”\nI turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there.",

            "prefix-probing": "“Look here, old sport,” said Gatsby, leaning toward me, “I’m afraid I made you a little angry this morning in the car.” He hadn’t, but I knew what he meant. He was afraid that I thought him just another rich man, a bootlegger perhaps, and he wanted me to think well of him, to think that he was a man of fine breeding and education. He was, in fact, a little nervous, and he got the impression that I was skeptical of his sudden wealth and elaborate lifestyle. He cleared his throat and began, in a hurried, embarrassed way, to tell me the story of his life. It was a strange story, and as he told it, I felt a growing incredulity. He said he was the son of wealthy people in the Middle West—all dead now. He was brought up in America but educated at Oxford, because all his ancestors had been educated there for many years. This was the first point that made me stare. Oxford, New Mexico, perhaps, I thought, or something of that sort. He saw my doubt and hurried on. “It was an American tradition,” he explained. “The family always lived like Englishmen. Every one of them was educated at Oxford. It’s a family tradition.” He paused, and I waited, but he didn’t elaborate. He seemed to expect me to accept this extraordinary statement without question. He went on to say that after his parents died, he came into a good deal of money. He traveled all over Europe, collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to forget something very sad that happened to him long ago. It was a romantic story, told with a strained, earnest sincerity that was more convincing than the details themselves. He spoke of capitals of Europe, of Monte Carlo, of the Bois de Boulogne, of the Riviera, of the great resorts where he had spent his youth. He had been everywhere, seen everything, done everything. He had even been in the war. “I was in the Argonne Forest,” he said, “I was promoted to be a major, and every Allied government gave me a decoration—even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea!” He pulled a medal out of his pocket, a little, fat, gold medal, and I saw that it was inscribed “Major Jay Gatsby, For Valor Extraordinary.” On the reverse, it said “Montenegro, 1917.” I examined it skeptically. It looked real enough, but it was such an odd thing to carry around. He saw my expression and produced something else, a photograph. “Here’s another thing I keep about me,” he said. “An Oxford man. This was taken at Trinity College. The man on the left is a friend of mine from San Francisco—his name is Mr. Dan Cody. Does the name ring a bell?” I looked at the photograph. It showed about a dozen young men in blazers, sitting in a row. Gatsby was in the front row, looking very young and serious. The man next to him, presumably Dan Cody, was a large, imposing figure. The picture seemed genuine, but it didn’t prove he had been educated there. He could have just visited. I handed the things back to him, feeling more confused than ever. His story was so improbable, so filled with clichés from cheap novels, and yet, the medal and the photograph provided a strange, tangible support for it. He put them away and we drove on in silence for a moment. I was trying to reconcile the man I knew, the host of the lavish parties, the mysterious figure, with this romantic, slightly absurd character he was presenting. Just then, a policeman on a motorcycle pulled us over. My heart sank. This was it, I thought. The real reason for his wealth, the bootlegging, the illegal activities, were about to be exposed. But Gatsby, with a calm assurance that surprised me, simply reached into his wallet and produced a small white card. He handed it to the policeman. The officer took it, glanced at it, and his expression changed instantly. He saluted. “Right you are, Mr. Gatsby,” he said. “Proceed.” He waved us on, and we drove away, leaving the policeman standing by the road. Gatsby put the card back in his wallet. “I was able to do the commissioner a favor once,” he explained casually. “He sends me a Christmas card every year.” I stared at him, speechless. The incident with the policeman, the white card, it was like something out of a movie. It added another layer to the mystery of Jay Gatsby. It was clear that he had connections, powerful connections, that went beyond the world of West Egg and its nouveau riche. He had shown me the medal, the photograph, and now this. He was determined to convince me that he was not just some nobody who had stumbled into money, but a man with a history, a past, even if that past seemed to be a carefully constructed fiction. He wanted me to believe in him, to trust him, perhaps because he had a favor to ask, a favor that was important enough for him to reveal these carefully guarded pieces of his identity, or at least, the identity he wanted me to see. The car sped on towards the city, and I sat beside him, trying to make sense of the man who was Jay Gatsby, a man who seemed to be composed of equal parts ambition, mystery, and carefully curated lies.",

              "simple_agent_extraction": "“Look here, old sport,” said Gatsby, leaning toward me, “I’m afraid I made you a little angry this morning in the car.”\n\nThere was the smile again, but this time I held my ground. “I don’t like mysteries,” I answered, “and I don’t understand why you won’t tell me what it is you want. Why in the devil’s name don’t you ask me yourself?”\n\n“He was embarrassed, that’s all,” said Gatsby. “And he’s only a young man, after all.”\n\n“This matter of Jordan Baker’s was that?”\n\n“No, no, nothing to do with it at all. You see, I carry on a little business on the side, a sort of side line, you understand. And I thought that you might be able to use the connection.”\n\n“With Jordan Baker?” I asked, politely confused.\n\n“No, not with Jordan Baker. I thought you knew old sport. I’m afraid I’m not making myself clear. Jordan Baker’s a great sportswoman, you know, and she’d never do anything that wasn’t all right.”\n\nThe phrase “all right” in the mouth of Gatsby had an ominous ring, and I instantly jumped to the conclusion that he was offering me a cheap career as a salesman at several times my salary. I explained that I was much obliged, but I was engaged in another transaction that might take some time.\n\n“Oh, it isn’t that,” he said. “I’m not just a nobody. I’ve been out of college only five years. I’ve been in the army and in France.” He looked at me with an anxious, puzzled effort, as if to find out what it was I was thinking. “Well,” he added, “I don’t want to keep you any longer, old sport.”\n\n“I’m not in any hurry,” I said.\n\n“I have to make a phone call, anyway.” He got up awkwardly, and I was about to rise when the front door opened and Wolfshiem came in, his tragic nose trembling in the candlelight. He looked at us all with a sort of melancholy satisfaction, and then, seeing Gatsby, his face broke into a radiant and benevolent smile.\n\n“Ah, Gatsby, my dear fellow,” he cried, “how are you?”\n\n“Fine, thank you, Mr. Wolfshiem,” answered Gatsby, as if surprised to see him. “I was just going to call you.”\n\n“Well, I’m here, you see. I’m here. I can’t stay long. I’m just passing through. I have to go to Chicago.”\n\n“Oh, I see. Well, I’ll be back in a minute.”\n\n“Don’t hurry, my dear fellow. I’m just going to have a cup of coffee.” He sat down and looked at me with a sort of benign curiosity. “And this is the young man?” he inquired, with a slight bow.\n\n“This is Mr. Carraway,” said Gatsby, politely.\n\n“Ah, indeed. Mr. Carraway. I’ve heard about you.” He looked at me again with that same benign curiosity. “You’re a friend of Gatsby’s?”\n\n“I am.”\n\n“Ah, indeed. Well, I’m glad to know you, Mr. Carraway. I’ve known Gatsby for a long time. We were in the war together.”\n\n“Oh, were you?”\n\n“Yes, indeed. We were in the same division. We were in the same company. We were in the same platoon. We were in the same squad.” He paused and looked at me with a sort of proud satisfaction. “We were in the same tent.”\n\n“Oh, I see.”\n\n“Yes, indeed. We were in the same tent. And we were in the same bed.” He paused again and looked at me with a sort of triumphant satisfaction. “We were in the same sleeping bag.”\n\n“Oh, I see.”\n\n“Yes, indeed. We were in the same sleeping bag. And we were in the same dream.” He paused again and looked at me with a sort of mystical satisfaction. “We were in the same universe.”\n\n“Oh, I see.”\n\n“Yes, indeed. We were in the same universe. And we were in the same God.” He paused again and looked at me with a sort of divine satisfaction. “We were in the same nothing.”\n\n“Oh, I see.”\n\n“Yes, indeed. We were in the same nothing. And we were in the same everything.” He paused again and looked at me with a sort of cosmic satisfaction. “We were in the same all.”\n\n“Oh, I see.”\n\n“Yes, indeed. We were in the same all. And we were in the same one.” He paused again and looked at me with a sort of ultimate satisfaction. “We were in the same zero.”\n\n",

Why in the devil’s name don’t you ask me yourself?”\n\n“He was embarrassed, that’s all,” said Gatsby. “And he’s only a young man, after all.”\n\n“This matter of Jordan Baker’s was that?”\n\n“No, no, nothing to do with it at all. You see, I carry on a little business on the side, a sort of side line, you understand. And I thought that you might be able to use the connection.”\n\n“With Jordan Baker?” I asked, politely confused.\n\n“No, not with Jordan Baker. I thought you knew old sport. I’m afraid I’m not making myself clear. Jordan Baker’s a great sportswoman, you know, and she’d never do anything that wasn’t all right.”\n\nThe phrase “all right” in the mouth of Gatsby had an ominous ring, and I instantly jumped to the conclusion that he was offering me a cheap career as a salesman at several times my salary. I explained that I was much obliged, but I was engaged in another transaction that might take some time.\n\n“Oh, it isn’t that,” he said. “I’m not just a nobody.

          "text_segment": "One October day in nineteen-seventeen—\n(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)\n—I was walking along from one place to another, half on the sidewalks and half on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on shoes from England with rubber knobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground. I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind, and whenever this happened the red, white, and blue banners in front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tut-tut-tut-tut, in a disapproving way.\nThe largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to Daisy Fay’s house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She dressed in white, and had a little white roadster, and all day long the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night. “Anyways, for an hour!”\nWhen I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside the kerb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen before. They were so engrossed in each other that she didn’t see me until I was five feet away.\n“Hello, Jordan,” she called unexpectedly. “Please come here.”\nI was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older girls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross to make bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she couldn’t come that day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since. His name was Jay Gatsby, and I didn’t lay eyes on him again for over four years—even after I’d met him on Long Island I didn’t realize it was the same man.\nThat was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a few beaux myself, and I began to play in tournaments, so I didn’t see Daisy very often. She went with a slightly older crowd—when she went with anyone at all. Wild rumours were circulating about her—how her mother had found her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas. She was effectually prevented, but she wasn’t on speaking terms with her family for several weeks. After that she didn’t play around with the soldiers any more, but only with a few flat-footed, shortsighted young men in town, who couldn’t get into the army at all.\nBy the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a début after the armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a man from New Orleans. In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago, with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He came down with a hundred people in four private cars, and hired a whole floor of the Muhlbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\nI was a bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in her flowered dress—and as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottle of Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.\n“ ’Gratulate me,” she muttered. “Never had a drink before, but oh how I do enjoy it.”\n“What’s the matter, Daisy?”\nI was scared, I can tell you; I’d never seen a girl like that before.\n“Here, dearies.” She groped around in a wastebasket she had with her on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls. “Take ’em downstairs and give ’em back to whoever they belong to. Tell ’em all Daisy’s change’ her mine. Say: ‘Daisy’s change’ her mine!’ ”\nShe began to cry—she cried and cried. I rushed out and found her mother’s maid, and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath. She wouldn’t let go of the letter. She took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up in a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the soap-dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.\nBut she didn’t say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress, and half an hour later, when we walked out of the room, the pearls were around her neck and the incident was over. Next day at five o’clock she married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver, and started off on a three months’ trip to the South Seas.",

I didn't see him again for over four years. Not until I met him on Long Island.\n\nWell, the next year, I was busy with my own life. I was playing golf, and I was going to parties.

            "prefix-probing": "One October day in nineteen-seventeen—(told me by Jordan Baker, who had it from Gatsby, who had it from Daisy, I suppose)—the officer, young James Gatz, met Daisy Fay. It was in Louisville. The city was alive with young officers from Camp Taylor, their uniforms bright against the autumn leaves, their laughter echoing through the streets. Daisy, a girl of eighteen, was already a figure of legend in her own small world, a world of money, privilege, and effortless charm. She was beautiful, of course, with a voice that was like money, a voice that promised excitement and whispered of possibilities. She moved through her days surrounded by admirers, a golden girl in a golden house, seemingly untouched by the anxieties of the world at war. But beneath the surface of her bright, careless existence, there was a yearning, a desire for something more, something perhaps even dangerous. And then, James Gatz, or rather, Lieutenant Jay Gatsby as he had begun to call himself, appeared. He was penniless, a man with no past to speak of, only a future he was determined to invent. He had drifted into her orbit, drawn by the same magnetic pull that drew everyone to her, but with a difference. He saw not just the beautiful girl, but the symbol she represented, the life he craved, the world of wealth and security that had always been just beyond his reach. He was an officer, yes, but one who had come from nowhere, who had worked his way up from the bottom, carrying the weight of his humble origins like a secret burden. He knew instinctively that to win Daisy, he had to become someone else entirely. He had to become the man she expected, the man who belonged in her world. He lied about his background, about his family, about his money. He presented himself as a man of the same class, the same breeding, the same effortless ease. And Daisy, captivated by his uniform, his youth, his intensity, and perhaps most of all, by the sheer force of his presence, believed him. Their romance was swift and intense, a whirlwind of stolen moments and whispered promises. They drove through the autumn streets in her white car, the air crisp and cool, the world outside their bubble seeming to fade away. They spent hours together, talking, laughing, falling deeper and deeper in love. For Gatsby, Daisy was the embodiment of his dreams, the golden girl who held the key to the life he desperately wanted. For Daisy, Gatsby was an escape from the predictable path laid out before her, a taste of adventure and passion in a world that often felt stiflingly safe. He took her by storm, his passion overwhelming her carefully constructed defenses. He was the first man who had ever looked at her with such complete devotion, such absolute certainty. He made her feel special, unique, the center of his universe. And in return, she gave him her heart, or at least, the part of it that was capable of such a gift at that time in her life. He knew that he had no right to her, that his deception was a fragile foundation for their love. But he was desperate, consumed by his vision of the future, a future that had to include Daisy. He felt married to her, he told Jordan, that was the only way he could describe it. It was as if their brief time together had sealed their fate, bound them together in a way that transcended the conventional ties of marriage. He had taken her because he loved her, but also because he saw in her the promise of everything he wanted. He had committed himself to her, and in doing so, he had committed himself to a certain way of life, a certain kind of success. He knew that he had to succeed, that he had to become the man he pretended to be, not just for himself, but for her. Their time together was tragically short. The war intervened, as it did for so many young men and women of that generation. Gatsby was called away, sent overseas to fight. He left Daisy with promises of return, with letters filled with longing and devotion. And for a time, Daisy waited. She was young, beautiful, and surrounded by eligible men. The world moved on, and the intensity of their brief romance began to fade, like a photograph left too long in the sun. She received his letters, but they seemed to come from a different world, a world of trenches and danger that felt increasingly distant from her comfortable life in Louisville. She was lonely, and the pressure to marry, to settle down, became immense. There were other men, men who belonged to her world, men who offered security and stability. And then, Tom Buchanan arrived, a man of immense wealth and power, a man who offered her the kind of life she had always known, but on an even grander scale. He was everything Gatsby was not – established, secure, undeniably part of the world she inhabited. He swept her off her feet, his confidence and wealth a powerful antidote to her loneliness and uncertainty. She married him, not out of great love, perhaps, but out of a need for security, a desire to move on, and perhaps a flicker of resentment that Gatsby had not returned sooner, had not been able to offer her the same stability. And so, the golden girl married the brute, and Gatsby, fighting a war thousands of miles away, lost her. But he never forgot. The memory of Daisy, the dream of the life she represented, became the driving force of his existence. Everything he did, every risk he took, every dollar he earned, was aimed at one goal: to recreate that brief, perfect time in Louisville, to win back the girl who had embodied his impossible dream. He built his mansion across the bay from her house, a monument to his unwavering hope, a beacon meant to draw her back to him. He threw lavish parties, hoping she would wander in, drawn by the light and the music. He waited, patiently, obsessively, for the day when he could finally reclaim the past, when he could step back into that October day in nineteen-seventeen and make it last forever. That brief, intense romance in Louisville was the genesis of everything that followed, the seed from which the tragedy of Jay Gatsby's life would inevitably grow. It was the moment when the dream was born, a dream so powerful, so consuming, that it would ultimately destroy him."

If he left the room for a minute she’d look around uneasily, and say: “Where’s Tom gone?” and wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the door. She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour, rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable delight. It was touching to see them together—it made you laugh in a hushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A week after I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night, and ripped a front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got into the papers, too, because her arm was broken—she was one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.\nThe next April Daisy had her little girl, and they went to France for a year. I saw them one spring in Cannes, and later in Deauville, and then they came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in Chicago, as you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation. Perhaps because she doesn’t drink. It’s a great advantage not to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue and, moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they don’t see or care. Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour at all—and yet there’s something in that voice of hers…\nWell, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first time in years. It was when I asked you—do you remember?—if you knew Gatsby in West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me up, and said: “What Gatsby?” and when I described him—I was half asleep—she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know. It wasn’t until then that I connected this Gatsby with the officer in her white car.",

            "prefix-probing": "I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back, and I thought I’d never seen a girl so mad about her husband. They were like figures out of a fairy tale, rich and beautiful, moving through sun-drenched landscapes with an air of effortless grace. Their house in Santa Barbara was sprawling and magnificent, filled with light and the scent of flowers, a place where time seemed to move at a more leisurely, luxurious pace. Daisy, with her low, thrilling voice that was full of money, seemed utterly captivated by Tom. She hung on his words, laughed at his jokes with a genuine, sparkling mirth, and followed him with her eyes across crowded rooms. He was a man of immense physical power and confidence, a former football hero who carried himself with an almost arrogant assurance, and she seemed to bask in his presence, drawing strength and identity from being his wife. They traveled constantly in those early years – Palm Beach, the Riviera, wherever the sun shone brightest and the wealthy gathered to play. Their life was a blur of exclusive parties, thrilling polo matches where Tom excelled, and leisurely afternoons spent yachting on azure waters. Daisy was always the center of attention, effortlessly charming everyone she met with her radiant smile and captivating personality, but her focus always seemed to return to Tom. It was a dazzling spectacle of wealth and young love, or what certainly appeared to be young love to an outsider like myself. I remember thinking how complete they seemed, how perfectly matched in their privilege and their shared, careless ease. They moved through the world with an air of invincibility, as if nothing could ever touch them, protected by their immense fortune and their social standing. Their happiness seemed as solid and enduring as their vast wealth. I saw them again later, of course, and the picture changed dramatically, revealing the cracks beneath the glittering surface, but that first impression of Daisy's absolute devotion to Tom, her radiant happiness in his company, remained vividly etched in my memory. It was a powerful image of a woman utterly consumed by love for her husband, a love that seemed to define her existence in those early, golden days of their marriage. They were the golden couple, living a golden life, and Daisy was the radiant sun around which Tom, the powerful, imposing planet, revolved. It was a world I could only observe from the periphery, a world of effortless grace and boundless possibility, embodied by Daisy's seemingly boundless affection for Tom. The sheer intensity of her gaze when she looked at him, the way her hand would instinctively reach for his arm or rest lightly on his shoulder, spoke volumes about her feelings. It wasn't just affection; it was adoration, a complete surrender to the idea of him as her protector and her world. This was before the restlessness set in, before the gilded cage began to feel like a prison, before the whispers started circulating about Tom's infidelities. In Santa Barbara, and in those subsequent early years, they were the epitome of marital bliss, a perfect, glittering unit, seemingly destined for a lifetime of shared happiness and privilege. It was a vision of life that seemed utterly unattainable to me, yet fascinating to witness.",

He was dressed in his army uniform, and I remember thinking it was the first time I’d ever seen a man produce such an effect upon a girl. She had a début after the armistice, and in February she was married to Tom Buchanan of Chicago. He came down with a hundred people in four private cars, and hired a whole floor of the Muhlbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars. I was bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in her flowered dress—and as drunk as a monkey. She had a letter in her hand. ‘Here, read this,’ she muttered. ‘And tell me what to do. It’s from that man Gatsby.’ Something was said about the pearls. She stood up, threw the pearls down the steps and she didn’t even know she was doing it. ‘The three hundred and fifty thousand dollar necklace!’ She cried. ‘The three hundred and fifty thousand dollar necklace!’ Then she went into the bath-room and held the letter under a cold shower, and wouldn’t let me in.

She stood up, threw the pearls down the steps and she didn’t even know she was doing it. ‘The three hundred and fifty thousand dollar necklace!’ She cried. ‘The three hundred and fifty thousand dollar necklace!’ Then she went into the bath-room and held the letter under a cold shower, and wouldn’t let me in.

The sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in the West Fifties, and the clear voices of children, already gathered like crickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight:\n“I’m the Sheik of Araby.\nYour love belongs to me.\nAt night when you’re asleep\nInto your tent I’ll creep—”\n“It was a strange coincidence,” I said.\n“But it wasn’t a coincidence at all.”\n“Why not?”\n“Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay.”\nThen it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that June night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of his purposeless splendour.\n“He wants to know,” continued Jordan, “if you’ll invite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him come over.”\nThe modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths—so that he could “come over” some afternoon to a stranger’s garden.\n“Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?”\n“He’s afraid, he’s waited so long. He thought you might be offended. You see, he’s regular tough underneath it all.”\nSomething worried me.\n“Why didn’t he ask you to arrange a meeting?”\n“He wants her to see his house,” she explained. “And your house is right next door.”\n“Oh!”\n“I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some night,” went on Jordan, “but she never did. Then he began asking people casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found. It was that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heard the elaborate way he worked up to it. Of course, I immediately suggested a luncheon in New York—and I thought he’d go mad:\n“ ‘I don’t want to do anything out of the way!’ he kept saying. ‘I want to see her right next door.’\n“When I said you were a particular friend of Tom’s, he started to abandon the whole idea. He doesn’t know very much about Tom, though he says he’s read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse of Daisy’s name.”",

            "prefix-probing": "When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza for half an hour and were driving in a victoria through Central Park. The sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in the West Fifties, and the clear pale dawn of the season was upon us when we started for Long Island. There was a long, hot, dusty ride ahead, and the victoria seemed to crawl through the park's fading light. The air was thick with the smell of hot asphalt and wilting leaves. No one spoke. The afternoon's brutal honesty hung in the air like the heat itself, heavy and suffocating. Daisy sat beside Gatsby, her face pale and drawn, her eyes fixed straight ahead. Tom, across from them, stared out the window, his jaw set, a muscle twitching in his cheek. Jordan leaned back, her eyes closed, perhaps feigning sleep, perhaps genuinely exhausted by the emotional wreckage. I felt a profound weariness settle over me, a sense of the futility of it all. The grand gesture, the desperate attempt to recapture the past, had collapsed under the weight of reality and Tom's brutal pragmatism. Gatsby, who had seemed so invincible just hours before, now looked like a man who had lost everything. His dream, so tangible and close, had dissolved like mist in the harsh light of the Plaza suite.\n\nThe silence stretched, broken only by the clip-clop of the horse's hooves and the distant hum of city traffic. We emerged from the park and headed towards the Queensboro Bridge. The decision was made, unspoken but understood: the party was over. The illusion was shattered. We had to go home.\n\nAs we reached the bridge, Tom suddenly spoke, his voice rough. \"We'd better stop for gas.\"\nGatsby nodded, his eyes still on Daisy.\n\"And we'll switch cars,\" Tom added, looking directly at Gatsby. \"You take my coupe. Jordan and Nick and I will go in your yellow one.\"\nA flicker of something – defiance? despair? – crossed Gatsby's face, but he agreed. It was a strategic move by Tom, forcing Gatsby into his car with Daisy, perhaps to prove his confidence, perhaps to set a trap. Or perhaps it was just the simplest arrangement for getting home.\n\nWe stopped at a garage on the edge of the city. The air was even hotter here, smelling of oil and gasoline. The attendant, a young Greek named Michaelis, filled the tanks. The exchange of cars felt significant, a physical manifestation of the shifting power dynamics. Gatsby and Daisy got into the blue coupe. Tom, Jordan, and I climbed into the opulent, ill-fated yellow car. As we pulled away, heading east towards the Eggs, I had a premonition of disaster, a sense that the day's events were not yet concluded, that the heat and the tension were building towards a terrible climax. The sun was now a fiery ball sinking below the horizon, casting long, distorted shadows ahead of us. The road stretched out, empty and waiting.",

The sun slanted westward at a tremendously sharp angle and the carriages of the wealthy were ranged in apposition to the long, gay crowd on the parkway. There were such gay flags on her carriage that she might have been a bandbox, and I was going to ask her what you did, it was so engagingly preposterous, but she was far too excited to hear me.  “And you found out what it was?” she inquired.  “Did you send her an invitation to the funeral?”  “He wants to know if you’ll invite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him come over.”  The modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths—so that she might wander one afternoon and stand beneath his windows. Suddenly I wasn’t thinking any more about Daisy and Gatsby and the rest of them in their enchanted gardens. I was thinking of myself. For a moment I suspected that he wanted to sell me something.  “He’s afraid, he’s terribly afraid,” she admitted, with a tiny frown. “It’s awful old, but he’s been waiting so long. It’s a great advantage not to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue and, moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind drunk that they don’t see or care. Perhaps you would be interested to know that I was married in the middle of June.”  “No, Jordan,” I objected. “I’m not even faintly interested.”  “Well, you ought to be. I was bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the white girlhood of the world. She was dressed in white, and her face was lovely and excited.

                "text": "When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza for half an hour and were driving in a victoria through Central Park. The sun slanted westward at a tremendously sharp angle and the carriages of the wealthy were ranged in apposition to the long, gay crowd on the parkway. There were such gay flags on her carriage that she might have been a bandbox, and I was going to ask her what you did, it was so engagingly preposterous, but she was far too excited to hear me.  “And you found out what it was?” she inquired.  “Did you send her an invitation to the funeral?”  “He wants to know if you’ll invite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him come over.”  The modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths—so that she might wander one afternoon and stand beneath his windows. Suddenly I wasn’t thinking any more about Daisy and Gatsby and the rest of them in their enchanted gardens. I was thinking of myself. For a moment I suspected that he wanted to sell me something.  “He’s afraid, he’s terribly afraid,” she admitted, with a tiny frown. “It’s awful old, but he’s been waiting so long. It’s a great advantage not to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue and, moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind drunk that they don’t see or care. Perhaps you would be interested to know that I was married in the middle of June.”  “No, Jordan,” I objected. “I’m not even faintly interested.”  “Well, you ought to be. I was bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the white girlhood of the world. She was dressed in white, and her face was lovely and excited. She knew that it was coming, but she didn’t know when, and she didn’t know who it was. She was just eighteen, and she was going to the devil.

A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement: “There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy, and the tired.”\n“And Daisy ought to have something in her life,” murmured Jordan to me.\n“Does she want to see Gatsby?”\n“She’s not to know about it. Gatsby doesn’t want her to know. You’re just supposed to invite her to tea.”\nWe passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the façade of Fifty-Ninth Street, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park. Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan, I had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs, and so I drew up the girl beside me, tightening my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth smiled, and so I drew her up again closer, this time to my face.",

A breeze blew through the open car, carrying the scent of honeysuckle and the distant murmur of the city. She leaned against me, her cheek cool against my jacket, and murmured, 'Anywhere.' The car sped on, the headlights cutting tunnels through the deepening twilight. We didn't talk much, the silence between us comfortable, charged with a quiet understanding that had grown between us over the summer. The world outside the car windows blurred into streaks of light and shadow – the dark shapes of trees, the occasional gleam of water, the scattered lights of houses. I felt a sense of peace, a temporary escape from the frantic energy and underlying tension that seemed to permeate everything else in my life, especially the tangled affairs of Gatsby and the Buchanans. Jordan's presence was calming, her cool detachment a contrast to the emotional turmoil I had witnessed and been drawn into. We drove towards the city, the promise of dinner and the evening stretching out before us, a simple, uncomplicated pleasure in a world that felt increasingly complex and uncertain. The air grew cooler as we approached the river, the city skyline beginning to rise like a jagged crown against the bruised purple sky. It felt good to be moving, to be leaving the oppressive atmosphere of West Egg behind, even just for a few hours. I tightened my arm around her, feeling the slight weight of her head on my shoulder, and for a moment, everything felt right."

          "text_segment": "When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that my house was on fire. Two o’clock and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light, which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a corner, I saw that it was Gatsby’s house, lit from tower to cellar.\nAt first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved itself into “hide-and-go-seek” or “sardines-in-the-box” with all the house thrown open to the game. But there wasn’t a sound. Only wind in the trees, which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned away I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.\n“Your place looks like the World’s Fair,” I said.\n“Does it?” He turned his eyes toward it absently. “I have been glancing into some of the rooms. Let’s go to Coney Island, old sport. In my car.”\n“It’s too late.”\n“Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven’t made use of it all summer.”\n“I’ve got to go to bed.”\n“All right.”\nHe waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.\n“I talked with Miss Baker,” I said after a moment. “I’m going to call up Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea.”\n“Oh, that’s all right,” he said carelessly. “I don’t want to put you to any trouble.”\n“What day would suit you?”\n“What day would suit you?” he corrected me quickly. “I don’t want to put you to any trouble, you see.”\n“How about the day after tomorrow?”\nHe considered for a moment. Then, with reluctance: “I want to get the grass cut,” he said.\nWe both looked down at the grass—there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began. I suspected that he meant my grass.\n“There’s another little thing,” he said uncertainly, and hesitated.\n“Would you rather put it off for a few days?” I asked.\n“Oh, it isn’t about that. At least—” He fumbled with a series of beginnings. “Why, I thought—why, look here, old sport, you don’t make much money, do you?”\n“Not very much.”\nThis seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently.\n“I thought you didn’t, if you’ll pardon my—you see, I carry on a little business on the side, a sort of side line, you understand. And I thought that if you don’t make very much—You’re selling bonds, aren’t you, old sport?”\n“Trying to.”\n“Well, this would interest you. It wouldn’t take up much of your time and you might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing.”\nI realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might have been one of the crises of my life. But, because the offer was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no choice except to cut him off there.\n“I’ve got my hands full,” I said. “I’m much obliged but I couldn’t take on any more work.”\n“You wouldn’t have to do any business with Wolfshiem.” Evidently he thought that I was shying away from the “gonnegtion” mentioned at lunch, but I assured him he was wrong. He waited a moment longer, hoping I’d begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he went unwillingly home.\nThe evening had made me lightheaded and happy; I think I walked into a deep sleep as I entered my front door. So I don’t know whether or not Gatsby went to Coney Island, or for how many hours he “glanced into rooms” while his house blazed gaudily on.",

Tenderly, gorgeously, their incantations were working their way through the ancient wood. I stared at it first from the road and then from the grass — and I knew what it was immediately. Gatsby, in a white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold-colored tie, hurried in from the lawn, in a confused way, as though he had been waiting all night for me to come home. “Is my house not right?” he asked. I assured him that it was fine, but that I had a rather long working day and I was tired. He looked at me with an anxious, expectant face. “I’ve got a man here that does my lawn. I’d like to have him do yours for you. Free.” “Oh, that’s all right,” I said. “I’ve got a man myself.” His face fell, and I perceived that he was standing down on the lowest step. “I don’t want to do anything out of the way,” he said. “You see, I’m just a poor boy, and I’ve got to get ahead somehow.” “You’re doing all right now,” I said. “I’m not doing so well,” he answered. “I’ve got a lot of things to do, and I’m not doing them.” He

                "text": "When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that my house was on fire. Two o’clock and the whole house alight. Tenderly, gorgeously, their incantations were working their way through the ancient wood. I stared at it first from the road and then from the grass — and I knew what it was immediately. Gatsby, in a white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold-colored tie, hurried in from the lawn, in a confused way, as though he had been waiting all night for me to come home. “Is my house not right?” he asked. I assured him that it was fine, but that I had a rather long working day and I was tired. He looked at me with an anxious, expectant face. “I’ve got a man here that does my lawn. I’d like to have him do yours for you. Free.” “Oh, that’s all right,” I said. “I’ve got a man myself.” His face fell, and I perceived that he was standing down on the lowest step. “I don’t want to do anything out of the way,” he said. “You see, I’m just a poor boy, and I’ve got to get ahead somehow.” “You’re doing all right now,” I said. “I’m not doing so well,” he answered. “I’ve got a lot of things to do, and I’m not doing them.” He looked at me again, and I saw that he was trying to make up his mind about something. “Look here, old sport,” he said, “you don’t make much money, do you?” “I’m not doing so well,” I said. “I’ve got a

At eleven o’clock a man in a raincoat, dragging a lawn-mower, tapped at my front door and said that Mr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass. This reminded me that I had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back, so I drove into West Egg Village to search for her among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buy some cups and lemons and flowers.\nThe flowers were unnecessary, for at two o’clock a greenhouse arrived from Gatsby’s, with innumerable receptacles to contain it. An hour later the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold-coloured tie, hurried in. He was pale, and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes.\n“Is everything all right?” he asked immediately.\n“The grass looks fine, if that’s what you mean.”\n“What grass?” he inquired blankly. “Oh, the grass in the yard.” He looked out the window at it, but, judging from his expression, I don’t believe he saw a thing.\n“Looks very good,” he remarked vaguely. “One of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four. I think it was The Journal. Have you got everything you need in the shape of—of tea?”\nI took him into the pantry, where he looked a little reproachfully at the Finn. Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen shop.\n“Will they do?” I asked.\n“Of course, of course! They’re fine!” and he added hollowly, “… old sport.”\nThe rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist, through which occasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyes through a copy of Clay’s Economics, starting at the Finnish tread that shook the kitchen floor, and peering towards the bleared windows from time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking place outside. Finally he got up and informed me, in an uncertain voice, that he was going home.\n“Why’s that?”\n“Nobody’s coming to tea. It’s too late!” He looked at his watch as if there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere. “I can’t wait all day.”\n“Don’t be silly; it’s just two minutes to four.”",

                "text": "I called up Daisy from the office next morning, and invited her to come to tea. \"Don't bring Tom,\" I warned her. \"What in the name of Heaven is the matter?\" she asked blankly. \"Do you mean to say you're in love with me,\" and she laughed. \"Don't be silly,\" I said. \"The man's coming over.\" \"The man?\" she stared. \"What man?\" \"Gatsby.\" \"Gatsby?\" she was incredulous. \"What Gatsby?\" I told her how I had heard about a man who lived in a house with a tower, which from the road looked like a Church, and she said, \"That's Gatsby's house.\" So I explained that I'd heard she was coming to a tea at my house. \"Of course I'm coming,\" she said. \"But I can't wait all day.\" The day agreed upon was pouring rain. At eleven o'clock a man in a raincoat, dragging a lawn-mower, came plodding up the drive. He turned out to be Gatsby's gardener, come to cut my grass. \"I'm afraid the rain's going to spoil it for you,\" I said. \"Oh, it don't matter,\" he said. \"I've got a machine that does the work of about a dozen men.\" As he went off, muttering to himself, I realized that I had forgotten to arrange for my Finn. I went in to call her up, but she was out, so I went down to the village and found her, and bought some cups and lemons and flowers. The flowers were unnecessary, for at two o'clock a greenhouse arrived from Gatsby's, with innumerable receptacles to contain it. An hour later the front door opened and Gatsby stood there in a white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold-colored tie, his face pale, drawn, and half sick with an overwhelming nervousness. He was breathless as he mounted the steps and stopped in the hall, pale as death. He stared around him wildly, as if the house itself were pressing down upon his offence of coming there. \"Is everything all right?\" he asked. \"Of course.\" \"You--you haven't here?\" \"I've got some tea here,\" I said. \"Is it all right?\" \"Of course it's all right. But--\" He looked at the grass for a moment, and then stared at me with eyes brimming with tears. \"What is the matter?\" I asked. \"It's going to rain all day,\" he said. \"I told you it was going to rain.\" We went into the pantry. \"You haven't got any lemons, have you?\" he asked. \"I've got some lemons.\" \"You haven't got any cakes, have you?\" \"I've got some cakes.\" \"You haven't got any

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The beginning of the completion introduces invented dialogue and scenes between the narrator and Daisy that do not appear in the original, including references to a tower and a conversation about being in love. This is a significant deviation from the source material.\n- The middle section contains an extremely long, repetitive, and nonsensical sequence about buying flowers and cutting branches, which is not present in the original and disrupts the narrative flow.\n- The completion omits major portions of the original passage, including the arrival of the greenhouse, Gatsby's nervous entrance, the detailed description of his appearance, the interaction about the grass, the scrutiny of the lemon cakes, and the depiction of Gatsby's anxious waiting.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the original's specific time markers and weather descriptions that set the scene for the day of the tea.\n- There is no mention of the greenhouse delivery or the abundance of flowers that arrive from Gatsby, which is a key detail in the original.\n- The emotional and physical description of Gatsby upon his arrival, including his attire and signs of nervousness, is missing.\n- The interaction in the pantry regarding the lemon cakes and the Finn is not included.\n- The depiction of Gatsby's anxious behavior while waiting, including his actions and the shifting weather, is absent.\n- The final exchange about Gatsby wanting to leave and the reassurance about the time is not present.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The early dialogue between Daisy and the narrator is inaccurate and introduces invented content not found in the original.\n- The sequence of events is disrupted by the repetitive and fabricated actions regarding flowers and branches, which do not occur in the source material.\n- The identity and actions of the man who comes to cut the grass are misrepresented, and the dialogue attributed to him is not accurate.\n- The completion fails to maintain the correct order of events, omitting key transitions and interactions that structure the original passage."

We both jumped up, and, a little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard.\nUnder the dripping bare lilac-trees a large open car was coming up the drive. It stopped. Daisy’s face, tipped sideways beneath a three-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic smile.\n“Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?”\nThe exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I had to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone, before any words came through. A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek, and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car.\n“Are you in love with me,” she said low in my ear, “or why did I have to come alone?”\n“That’s the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go far away and spend an hour.”\n“Come back in an hour, Ferdie.” Then in a grave murmur: “His name is Ferdie.”\n“Does the gasoline affect his nose?”\n“I don’t think so,” she said innocently. “Why?”\nWe went in. To my overwhelming surprise the living-room was deserted.\n“Well, that’s funny,” I exclaimed.\n“What’s funny?”\nShe turned her head as there was a light dignified knocking at the front door. I went out and opened it. Gatsby, pale as death, with his hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a puddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes.\nWith his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the hall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire, and disappeared into the living-room. It wasn’t a bit funny. Aware of the loud beating of my own heart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain.\nFor half a minute there wasn’t a sound. Then from the living-room I heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh, followed by Daisy’s voice on a clear artificial note:\n“I certainly am awfully glad to see you again.”\nA pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing to do in the hall, so I went into the room.\nGatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of boredom. His head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a defunct mantelpiece clock, and from this position his distraught eyes stared down at Daisy, who was sitting, frightened but graceful, on the edge of a stiff chair.\n“We’ve met before,” muttered Gatsby. His eyes glanced momentarily at me, and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh. Luckily the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his head, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers, and set it back in place. Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of the sofa and his chin in his hand.\n“I’m sorry about the clock,” he said.\nMy own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn. I couldn’t muster up a single commonplace out of the thousand in my head.\n“It’s an old clock,” I told them idiotically.\nI think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on the floor.\n“We haven’t met for many years,” said Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact as it could ever be.\n“Five years next November.”\nThe automatic quality of Gatsby’s answer set us all back at least another minute.",

          "text_segment": "I had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in on a tray.\nAmid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical decency established itself. Gatsby got himself into a shadow and, while Daisy and I talked, looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with tense, unhappy eyes. However, as calmness wasn’t an end in itself, I made an excuse at the first possible moment, and got to my feet.\n“Where are you going?” demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm.\n“I’ll be back.”\n“I’ve got to speak to you about something before you go.”\nHe followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door, and whispered: “Oh, God!” in a miserable way.\n“What’s the matter?”\n“This is a terrible mistake,” he said, shaking his head from side to side, “a terrible, terrible mistake.”\n“You’re just embarrassed, that’s all,” and luckily I added: “Daisy’s embarrassed too.”\n“She’s embarrassed?” he repeated incredulously.\n“Just as much as you are.”\n“Don’t talk so loud.”\n“You’re acting like a little boy,” I broke out impatiently. “Not only that, but you’re rude. Daisy’s sitting in there all alone.”\nHe raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable reproach, and, opening the door cautiously, went back into the other room.\nI walked out the back way—just as Gatsby had when he had made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour before—and ran for a huge black knotted tree, whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain. Once more it was pouring, and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by Gatsby’s gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric marshes. There was nothing to look at from under the tree except Gatsby’s enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church steeple, for half an hour. A brewer had built it early in the “period” craze, a decade before, and there was a story that he’d agreed to pay five years’ taxes on all the neighbouring cottages if the owners would have their roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their refusal took the heart out of his plan to Found a Family—he went into an immediate decline. His children sold his house with the black wreath still on the door. Americans, while willing, even eager, to be serfs, have always been obstinate about being peasantry.\nAfter half an hour, the sun shone again, and the grocer’s automobile rounded Gatsby’s drive with the raw material for his servants’ dinner—I felt sure he wouldn’t eat a spoonful. A maid began opening the upper windows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and, leaning from the large central bay, spat meditatively into the garden. It was time I went back. While the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and swelling a little now and then with gusts of emotion. But in the new silence I felt that silence had fallen within the house too.\nI went in—after making every possible noise in the kitchen, short of pushing over the stove—but I don’t believe they heard a sound. They were sitting at either end of the couch, looking at each other as if some question had been asked, or was in the air, and every vestige of embarrassment was gone. Daisy’s face was smeared with tears, and when I came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before a mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply confounding. He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little room.\n“Oh, hello, old sport,” he said, as if he hadn’t seen me for years. I thought for a moment he was going to shake hands.\n“It’s stopped raining.”\n“Has it?” When he realized what I was talking about, that there were twinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man, like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to Daisy. “What do you think of that? It’s stopped raining.”\n“I’m glad, Jay.” Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told only of her unexpected joy.\n“I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,” he said, “I’d like to show her around.”\n“You’re sure you want me to come?”\n“Absolutely, old sport.”",

            "prefix-probing": "I had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in on a tray. Daisy and Gatsby stood side by side, looking at each other with an intensity that made me feel like a clumsy intruder. The Finn, oblivious, set the tray down on the table with a clatter that seemed to echo in the strained silence. There were three cups, a silver pot, a plate of soggy sandwiches, and a bowl of cakes. I poured the tea, my hands trembling slightly, and offered a cup to Daisy. She took it mechanically, her eyes still fixed on Gatsby. He was pale, his eyes dark and troubled. He looked as if he hadn't slept in a week. I handed him a cup, and he took it, his fingers brushing mine, cold and clammy. We sat down, or rather, we perched on the edges of our chairs, the small room suddenly feeling vast and empty between us. The rain drummed against the windows, a relentless, melancholy sound. For a long moment, no one spoke. The air was thick with unspoken words, with five years of separation, with the weight of a dream that had been nurtured in the dark. Gatsby cleared his throat. 'Well, this is a--' he began, but his voice failed him. He looked around the room as if seeing it for the first time, his eyes resting on the mantelpiece clock. It was an old, ornate clock, and as he stared at it, he reached out and knocked it over. It fell with a crash, scattering dust and plaster. Gatsby jumped up, his face crimson. 'I'm awfully sorry!' he stammered. 'I--' He looked at the broken clock, then at Daisy, then back at the clock, utterly mortified. Daisy let out a little cry, half-startled, half-amused. 'It's all right, Jay,' she said softly. 'It's only a clock.' Her voice was like a soothing balm, and some of the tension seemed to drain from his face. He picked up the clock carefully, as if it were a fragile bird, and set it back on the mantelpiece, slightly askew. 'I haven't seen you in years,' he said, his voice still shaky. 'Five years next November,' corrected Daisy. The simple statement hung in the air, marking the precise duration of his waiting, his hoping, his building. It was a measurement of his entire adult life's purpose. A faint colour came into Gatsby's cheeks. 'I've got a man in England who buys me clothes,' he said, changing the subject abruptly. 'He sends me a selection of things at the beginning of each season. They arrive in a big box.' It was a clumsy attempt to impress her, a sudden, almost desperate display of his wealth, the tangible proof of his success. Daisy looked at him, a curious expression on her face. 'They must be beautiful,' she said, her voice low. 'Would you like to see the house, Daisy?' Gatsby asked, standing up. His nervousness seemed to have vanished, replaced by a sudden eagerness. 'I'd be delighted,' she said, rising with him. I felt a pang of relief. The awkwardness of the tea was over. They were moving into his world now, the world he had built for her. As we walked through the rooms, Gatsby seemed to expand, to fill the space with his presence. He showed her the library, a vast room lined with books, most of them with un-cut pages. 'Bought them all,' he said, with a gesture. 'A man came around selling them, and I bought them all at once.' It was another display, another assertion of his ability to acquire, to possess. Daisy ran her fingers along the spines of the books, a faint smile on her lips. He showed her the music room, with its enormous organ, and the billiard room, and the swimming pool, and the gardens. Everywhere we went, there was an air of magnificent, almost overwhelming opulence. It was a house built not just for living, but for showing, for proving. And every room, every object, seemed to be waiting for Daisy's approval. Finally, he led us into a large bedroom, a room dominated by a massive bed and a dressing-table covered with silver brushes and combs. In one corner, there was a large, cedar-lined closet. Gatsby opened it, revealing stacks and stacks of shirts, piled high on the shelves. There were shirts of linen, of silk, of fine flannel, shirts in every colour imaginable – pale peach, apple green, coral, lavender, soft blues, and yellows. He began to pull them down, one after another, throwing them onto the bed. They cascaded down in a rainbow of fabric, a soft, colourful avalanche. 'I've got a man in England who buys me clothes,' he repeated, his voice full of a strange, almost childlike pride. 'He sends me a selection of things at the beginning of each season.' Daisy watched the shirts pile up, her eyes wide. She picked one up, a shirt of sheer silk, and held it against her cheek. Then, suddenly, she began to cry. Great, heavy sobs shook her body. 'They're such beautiful shirts,' she sobbed, her voice muffled in the fabric. 'It makes me sad because I've never seen such – such beautiful shirts before.' I looked at Gatsby. He was watching her, his face expressionless, but his eyes were filled with a deep, almost painful satisfaction. He had shown her the physical manifestation of his dream, the wealth he had accumulated, the success he had achieved, all for her. And her tears, tears shed over shirts, were the validation he had been waiting for, the proof that his five years of relentless striving had been worth it. The rain had stopped, and a shaft of sunlight broke through the clouds, illuminating the room and the pile of colourful shirts on the bed. It seemed, for a moment, as if the sun itself had come out just for them, just for this moment of reunion and revelation. Gatsby looked out the window, towards the bay, towards the green light that had guided him for so long. The dream was no longer a distant light; it was here, in the room, in the form of a woman crying into a pile of shirts.",

In its little tin holster stood a bottle of rye whiskey and four fine glasses – the kind Gatsby himself used to drink with when he wasn’t training like a boxer. When the Finn went away Gatsby sat down at the other end of the divan, the same place he had occupied at the beginning. He was now decently clothed in a “sport shirt,” open at the neck, sneakers and duck trousers of a nebulous hue. The rain cooled about us in the afternoon and his house loomed suddenly out of the rain at the end of the drive. For half an hour Daisy and Gatsby talked together alone. So I walked away and left them. I found the living-room teeming with a dozen cheerful, excited guests who were already drinking the whiskey and having a good time. I waited, and half an hour later Gatsby came out of the living-room and found me. “What do you think of this, Nick?” he demanded. “I haven’t seen Daisy for five years.” “Not seeing,” I reminded him. “No, not seeing.

          "text_segment": "Daisy went upstairs to wash her face—too late I thought with humiliation of my towels—while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn.\n“My house looks well, doesn’t it?” he demanded. “See how the whole front of it catches the light.”\nI agreed that it was splendid.\n“Yes.” His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower. “It took me just three years to earn the money that bought it.”\n“I thought you inherited your money.”\n“I did, old sport,” he said automatically, “but I lost most of it in the big panic—the panic of the war.”\nI think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what business he was in he answered: “That’s my affair,” before he realized that it wasn’t an appropriate reply.\n“Oh, I’ve been in several things,” he corrected himself. “I was in the drug business and then I was in the oil business. But I’m not in either one now.” He looked at me with more attention. “Do you mean you’ve been thinking over what I proposed the other night?”\nBefore I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight.\n“That huge place there?” she cried pointing.\n“Do you like it?”\n“I love it, but I don’t see how you live there all alone.”\n“I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People who do interesting things. Celebrated people.”\nInstead of taking the shortcut along the Sound we went down to the road and entered by the big postern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the gardens, the sparkling odour of jonquils and the frothy odour of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odour of kiss-me-at-the-gate. It was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but bird voices in the trees.\nAnd inside, as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music-rooms and Restoration Salons, I felt that there were guests concealed behind every couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through. As Gatsby closed the door of “the Merton College Library” I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into ghostly laughter.\nWe went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing-rooms and poolrooms, and bathrooms with sunken baths—intruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pyjamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. It was Mr. Klipspringer, the “boarder.” I had seen him wandering hungrily about the beach that morning. Finally we came to Gatsby’s own apartment, a bedroom and a bath, and an Adam’s study, where we sat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall.\nHe hadn’t once ceased looking at Daisy, and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes. Sometimes too, he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way, as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer real. Once he nearly toppled down a flight of stairs.\nHis bedroom was the simplest room of all—except where the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush with delight, and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and began to laugh.\n“It’s the funniest thing, old sport,” he said hilariously. “I can’t—When I try to—”\nHe had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third. After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder at her presence. He had been full of the idea so long, dreamed it right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to speak, at an inconceivable pitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction, he was running down like an over-wound clock.\nRecovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and his shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high.\n“I’ve got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.”\nHe took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one, before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel, which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in many-coloured disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher—shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange, with monograms of indian blue. Suddenly, with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily.\n“They’re such beautiful shirts,” she sobbed, her voice muffled in the thick folds. “It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such—such beautiful shirts before.”",

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces invented narrative elements early on, such as the narrator's internal plans and feelings about calling Gatsby, driving away, and reflections on Daisy's actions and parties. These do not appear in the original passage and disrupt the flow and focus of the scene.\n- The completion omits a significant portion of the original sequence, including the conversation between Gatsby and the narrator about his house, his finances, and his business, as well as Daisy's reappearance and her initial reactions to Gatsby's house.\n- The tour of Gatsby's house, including the gardens, the various rooms, and the encounter with Mr. Klipspringer, is missing. The transition directly to the shirts scene skips over these important events and descriptions.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The initial dialogue between Gatsby and the narrator about the house's appearance and Gatsby's financial history is absent.\n- Daisy's return, her admiration of the house, and the detailed walk through the grounds and interior are not included.\n- The sensory descriptions of the gardens, flowers, and the atmosphere of the house are missing.\n- The encounter with Mr. Klipspringer and the description of Gatsby's own rooms are omitted.\n- The emotional build-up and Gatsby's reactions to Daisy's presence, including his visible emotional transitions, are not present.\n- The detailed description of the shirts, including their colors, patterns, and the act of Gatsby throwing them, is only partially represented.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is incorrect: the completion jumps from Daisy going upstairs directly to the shirts scene, skipping the intervening tour and conversations.\n- The completion attributes actions and dialogue to Gatsby that are not present at that point in the original, such as him turning from the window and initiating the shirts scene.\n- The emotional responses are altered: Daisy's reaction to the shirts is described with different intensity and sequence, and the narrator's and Gatsby's responses are not aligned with the original progression.\n- The completion invents a reflective commentary about \"revaluation of all values\" that is not present in the original passage.\n\nOverall, the completion should focus on accurately following the sequence of events, including all major interactions, settings, and emotional developments, and avoid introducing invented narrative elements or omitting key descriptive and dialogic content."

                "text": "Daisy went upstairs to wash her face—too late I thought with humiliation of my towels—while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn. “My house looks well, doesn’t it?” he demanded. “See how the whole front of it catches the light.” I agreed that it was splendid. The rain stopped about four and the sun began to shine again. “About the grass now,” he said. “I think some of it’s a little rusty.” We walked in the four sides of the rectangle and stopped by the gate of a kitchen garden, closed with a white lattice. “I had it from a man called Hertel who built it for some millionaire who had the good sense to die. It cost a fortune. He was an eccentric old brute, and I can tell you he built it for a woman who didn’t know a thing about him. It was a strange coincidence, wasn’t it?” “By the way,” I inquired, “did you get the house you wanted?” “I got this house, yes.” “It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.” “Yes.” I waited, but he didn’t say any more, and after a moment I said, “He’s dead now.” “Yes.” After a pause he added, “You see, I carry on a little business on the side, a sort of sideline, you understand. And I thought that if you don’t make very much, you might without knowing it be doing something that—” “Did you start doing business of this sort after the war?” “It was in nineteen-nineteen. I got to know something about the bond business. And then I started to go around with a fellow who’d been in the drug business and then he went into the oil business. I made a lot of money, but I lost most of it in the big panic—the panic of the war.” I hesitated. “You said you lived in America for a while after the war.” A pause. “Yeah—well, I did.” “And you’ve been in America ever since?” “Yeah—well, I have.

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion becomes stuck in a repetitive loop, repeating a small segment of dialogue and narrative dozens of times, which prevents any progression through the passage. As a result, the majority of the original scene is missing, including all events after the initial conversation about Gatsby's house and his finances.\n- Entire major sections are omitted, such as Daisy's return, the tour of Gatsby's house, the detailed descriptions of the rooms and gardens, the encounter with Mr. Klipspringer, the emotional moment with the shirts, and Daisy's reaction.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the sequence where Daisy comes back outside and interacts with Gatsby and the narrator.\n- There is no mention of the group touring the house, the specific rooms, or the sensory details (sights, smells, sounds) that are present in the original.\n- The emotional arc involving Gatsby's fixation on Daisy's reactions, his near accident, and the display of his clothing is not present.\n- The significant moment where Daisy is moved to tears by Gatsby's shirts is entirely missing.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces invented or misplaced details, such as references to the rain stopping and the sun shining, which are not part of this passage.\n- The dialogue is repeated inaccurately and excessively, disrupting the intended sequence of events and omitting the natural flow of conversation.\n- There are invented lines and attributions, such as references to the kitchen garden and the oil man, which do not belong in this context.\n- The sequence of events is lost due to the repetition, and the narrative does not progress beyond the initial exchange about Gatsby's wealth.\n\nTo improve, ensure the completion covers the full arc of the scene, avoids repetition, and includes the key events and emotional beats in the correct order, while refraining from inventing or misplacing details."

            "prefix-probing": "Daisy went upstairs to wash her face—too late I thought with humiliation of my towels—while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn. The rain was still falling, a thick, dreary curtain between us and the world. Gatsby was overwhelmingly nervous. He hadn’t stopped looking at the clock for ten minutes. He was pale, and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes. He kept running his hand through his hair, and whenever I spoke he stared at me blankly and said, “What?”\n\n“She’s coming down now,” I said. “You’d better go in.”\n\n“In?” he faltered. He looked at the house as if it were an impassable obstacle.\n\n“Yes, in. She’ll be down any minute. You can’t just stand here.”\n\nHe hesitated, then turned and walked stiffly back toward the front door. I followed him, feeling like a chaperone at a particularly awkward blind date. We stood in the hall, the grandfather clock ticking loudly, emphasizing the silence. Gatsby stood with his hands in his pockets, rocking back and forth on his heels, his eyes fixed on the bottom of the stairs. The tension was palpable, thick enough to cut with a knife. I felt a sudden impulse to leave, to escape this charged atmosphere, but I knew I couldn’t abandon him now.\n\nThen Daisy came down the stairs. She stood for a moment in the hall, looking from one to the other of us, her face bewildered. She wore a dress of soft lavender silk, and her voice, when she spoke, was like a bell.\n\n“I thought you weren’t coming,” she said to me, her eyes wide.\n\n“That’s right,” murmured Gatsby, from the other side of the hall. He was leaning against the wall, his head thrown back, his eyes closed.\n\nDaisy turned to him, a puzzled frown on her face. “Oh, hello, Gatsby,” she said, as if she had just noticed him.\n\nHe opened his eyes and stared at her, his face expressionless for a moment. Then, slowly, a smile broke over his face, a smile that understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced—or seemed to face—the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.\n\nDaisy laughed, a nervous little sound. “I haven’t seen you in years,” she said. “Five years next November.”\n\nGatsby winced. “It’s been five years,” he repeated softly.\n\nThere was an awkward silence. I felt like a fifth wheel, a spectator at a play I didn’t fully understand. I decided to make myself scarce.\n\n“I think I’ll go home now,” I said. “It’s raining.”\n\n“Don’t hurry, Nick,” said Daisy.\n\n“I’ll just run for a minute,” I said. “It’s raining hard.”\n\nI went out the back way, into the kitchen, and stood there for a moment, listening. I could hear their voices, low and indistinct, from the living room. I waited, the rain drumming on the roof, the clock ticking. After a few minutes, the voices grew louder, more animated. I peeked through the pantry door.\n\nGatsby and Daisy were sitting opposite each other on the couch, staring into each other’s eyes. Gatsby was no longer pale. He was glowing. His face was radiant, his eyes shining. Daisy was crying, tears streaming down her face, but she was smiling.\n\n“I’m so glad,” she sobbed.\n\n“I’m so glad,” he repeated, his voice husky with emotion.\n\nI slipped back out into the rain and walked around the house to the front. I stood under the dripping eaves, looking in through the window. They were still sitting there, talking rapidly, excitedly. Gatsby was gesturing, his hands moving expressively. Daisy was listening, her face rapt. The awkwardness was gone, replaced by a breathless intensity.\n\nAfter a while, Gatsby stood up and pulled Daisy to her feet. “I want to show you my house,” he said.\n\nThey came out into the hall, and I quickly stepped back from the window. I heard them moving through the house, Gatsby’s voice explaining, Daisy’s voice exclaiming. I waited on the porch, the rain soaking my clothes, feeling a strange mix of relief and melancholy.\n\nFinally, they came back to the living room. I heard Gatsby call my name. I went back inside.\n\nThey were standing together by the fireplace, looking at me with shining eyes.\n\n“Nick,” Gatsby said, his voice full of a triumphant joy I had never heard before. “This is Daisy. You know Daisy.”\n\n“Of course,” I said, smiling. “Hello, Daisy.”\n\n“Hello, Nick,” she said, her voice still thick with tears, but her smile radiant.\n\n“We’ve been looking at my house,” Gatsby said, sweeping his hand around the room as if encompassing the entire mansion. “I want to show Daisy everything.”\n\nHe led us through the house, room after room. The library, with its rows of unread books. The music room, with its enormous organ. The bedrooms, each more luxurious than the last. The swimming pool, visible through the windows, shimmering in the rain. He showed her his clothes, piles of shirts, silk shirts, linen shirts, flannel shirts, striped shirts, checkered shirts, all colors of the rainbow. He took them from a cabinet and threw them, one by one, before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel, which lost their folds as they fell and piled up in a colorful heap upon the table.\n\n“They’re such beautiful shirts,” she sobbed, her voice muffled in the thick folds. “It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such—such beautiful shirts before.”\n\nWe stood there, Gatsby watching her, a look of profound satisfaction on his face. He had done it. He had shown her his wealth, his success, everything he had built for her. And she was crying over his shirts. It was a strange, poignant moment, the culmination of years of dreaming, reduced to tears over fabric.\n\nHe showed her the rest of the house, the gardens, the pool, the beach. He pointed out the green light at the end of her dock, across the bay.\n\n“You always did live across the bay,” he said softly.\n\nDaisy looked at the light, then back at him, her eyes full of a complex emotion I couldn’t decipher.\n\nAs the afternoon wore on, the rain stopped, and a pale sun broke through the clouds. The air was clean and fresh. We sat in the living room, talking, laughing. The initial awkwardness was completely gone. Gatsby and Daisy were lost in each other, their conversation flowing easily, picking up the threads of five years ago as if no time had passed. I sat on the edge of the group, watching them, feeling like an observer of a miracle. Gatsby’s dream, the one he had pursued for so long, was finally within his grasp. He had recaptured the past, or at least, he believed he had. The expression on his face, as he looked at Daisy, was one of pure, unadulterated happiness. It was a look I would never forget."

Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star to the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one.\nI began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects in the half darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.\n“Who’s this?”\n“That? That’s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.”\nThe name sounded faintly familiar.\n“He’s dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.”\nThere was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the bureau—Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly—taken apparently when he was about eighteen.\n“I adore it,” exclaimed Daisy. “The pompadour! You never told me you had a pompadour—or a yacht.”\n“Look at this,” said Gatsby quickly. “Here’s a lot of clippings—about you.”\nThey stood side by side examining it. I was going to ask to see the rubies when the phone rang, and Gatsby took up the receiver.\n“Yes… Well, I can’t talk now… I can’t talk now, old sport… I said a small town… He must know what a small town is… Well, he’s no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small town…”\nHe rang off.\n“Come here quick!” cried Daisy at the window.\nThe rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west, and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.\n“Look at that,” she whispered, and then after a moment: “I’d like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around.”\nI tried to go then, but they wouldn’t hear of it; perhaps my presence made them feel more satisfactorily alone.\n“I know what we’ll do,” said Gatsby, “we’ll have Klipspringer play the piano.”\nHe went out of the room calling “Ewing!” and returned in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man, with shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blond hair. He was now decently clothed in a “sport shirt,” open at the neck, sneakers, and duck trousers of a nebulous hue.\n“Did we interrupt your exercise?” inquired Daisy politely.\n“I was asleep,” cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment. “That is, I’d been asleep. Then I got up…”\n“Klipspringer plays the piano,” said Gatsby, cutting him off. “Don’t you, Ewing, old sport?”\n“I don’t play well. I don’t—hardly play at all. I’m all out of prac—”\n“We’ll go downstairs,” interrupted Gatsby. He flipped a switch. The grey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light.\nIn the music-room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano. He lit Daisy’s cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her on a couch far across the room, where there was no light save what the gleaming floor bounced in from the hall.\nWhen Klipspringer had played “The Love Nest” he turned around on the bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.\n“I’m all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldn’t play. I’m all out of prac—”\n“Don’t talk so much, old sport,” commanded Gatsby. “Play!”\n“In the morning,\nIn the evening,\nAin’t we got fun—”\nOutside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the Sound. All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric trains, men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New York. It was the hour of a profound human change, and excitement was generating on the air.\n“One thing’s sure and nothing’s surer\nThe rich get richer and the poor get—children.\nIn the meantime,\nIn between time—”\nAs I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of bewilderment had come back into Gatsby’s face, as though a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness. Almost five years! There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams—not through her own fault, but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man can store up in his ghostly heart.\nAs I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand took hold of hers, and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion. I think that voice held him most, with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because it couldn’t be over-dreamed—that voice was a deathless song.\nThey had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand; Gatsby didn’t know me now at all. I looked once more at them and they looked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life. Then I went out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them there together.",

            "prefix-probing": "After the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool, and the hydroplane, and the midsummer flowers—but outside Gatsby’s window it began to rain again, so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated surface of the Sound.The rain fell harder, drumming against the panes, blurring the already indistinct shore across the water. Gatsby, standing between us, seemed less a host and more a nervous, expectant boy. His eyes kept straying to Daisy, then back to the window, as if the weather were a personal affront, a deliberate obstacle placed in the path of his carefully orchestrated afternoon. The room, so recently filled with the echoes of his grand tour, now felt strangely quiet, charged with an unspoken tension. Daisy, too, was quiet, her initial awe seeming to have settled into a pensive, almost melancholic mood. She stood with her hands clasped lightly in front of her, her gaze following Gatsby’s to the window, but her thoughts seemed far away.The silence stretched, becoming almost unbearable. Gatsby shifted his weight from one foot to the other. He cleared his throat. “It’s a funny thing, that rain,” he said, his voice a little strained. “It’s been coming down like this all morning.”“It is,” Daisy agreed softly, without turning.Another silence. I felt like an intruder, a superfluous third party in a scene that was meant for two. I looked around the room, noticing details I had missed before – the heavy, ornate furniture, the paintings on the walls, the sheer, overwhelming opulence that now seemed slightly damp and subdued by the weather.Gatsby suddenly turned from the window, a desperate energy seizing him. “I haven’t shown you the rest of the house,” he said quickly, too quickly. “There are other rooms. And my clothes. I’d like to show you my clothes.”His eagerness was almost painful to watch. It was as if he believed that by displaying the sheer quantity and quality of his possessions, he could somehow bridge the gap that the years and circumstances had created between him and Daisy. He led us out of the room and down a long corridor, his pace quickening with each step. We passed through rooms I barely registered – a library, a music room, all furnished with the same lavish, slightly impersonal grandeur. Finally, he flung open the door to a large dressing-room, its walls lined with cabinets and shelves.“These are my shirts, old sport,” he announced, his voice ringing with a strange mixture of pride and anxiety.He began to pull them out, one after another, from their tissue-lined drawers. Piles of shirts, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel, which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in many-colored disarray. Shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange, with monograms of Indian blue. Suddenly, with a strained sound, Gatsby began throwing them, literally throwing them, into a great heap upon the table.“He’s got a man in England who buys him all his clothes. He sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.”He kept throwing them, the beautiful, expensive fabrics cascading down, a waterfall of color and texture. There were shirts of every conceivable hue and pattern, each one a testament to his wealth, his success, his carefully constructed identity. He was like a child showing off his toys, desperate for approval, for admiration.Daisy watched him, her eyes wide, a faint smile playing on her lips. But as the pile grew higher, as the sheer volume of his possessions became overwhelming, the smile faded. Her expression changed, becoming one of bewildered sadness.Finally, Gatsby stopped, breathing a little heavily. The table was buried under a mountain of shirts. He looked at Daisy, his eyes searching her face for a reaction.And then, Daisy, beautiful, golden Daisy, bent her head into the shirts and began to cry.“They’re such beautiful shirts,” she sobbed, her voice muffled by the fabric. “It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such—such beautiful shirts before.”Her tears were not, I think, for the shirts themselves, but for the years, the lost time, the impossible distance that lay between the boy she had loved and the man who now stood before her, surrounded by the tangible proof of his success. It was the realization of what might have been, of the life they could have shared, had circumstances been different, had he been rich enough then. The shirts were merely the catalyst, the physical manifestation of the wealth that had finally made him worthy, in his own eyes and perhaps in the world’s, of standing before her again.Gatsby looked at her, his face a mask of conflicting emotions – relief, tenderness, a lingering anxiety. He reached out a hand, as if to touch her, then hesitated.“You’ve got a cold,” he said, his voice gentle.“Ah-choo!” she sneezed, and Gatsby took a pile of shirts and threw them over her face, so that she was literally buried under them.It was a strange, almost surreal moment. The rain outside, the mountain of shirts inside, Daisy weeping into the silk and linen. It was a scene that encapsulated the peculiar, extravagant, and ultimately poignant nature of Gatsby’s dream.When Daisy finally lifted her head, her face was wet with tears, but her eyes were shining. The sadness was still there, but it was mingled now with something else – a kind of wonder, a dawning realization of the depth of Gatsby’s devotion, the extraordinary lengths to which he had gone to recreate their past.Gatsby, visibly relieved by her tears, which seemed to have broken some invisible barrier between them, began to tidy the shirts, folding them carefully and placing them back in the drawers. The tension in the room began to dissipate, replaced by a fragile, tentative intimacy.He showed us the rest of the house then, with a renewed confidence. We saw his bedroom, a simple, almost monastic room compared to the rest of the house, with only a bed, a table, and a few books. He showed us the photograph of Dan Cody, the old man in a yachting costume, a figure from Gatsby’s past that hinted at the origins of his wealth and his ambition. He spoke of Cody with a mixture of reverence and detachment, as if describing a character in a story rather than a man who had shaped his life.We went downstairs again, and Gatsby, remembering the planned tour, led us out onto the terrace despite the persistent drizzle. The grounds were vast and beautiful, even under the grey sky. We saw the swimming pool, its surface rippled by the rain, the gardens, the hydroplane moored at the dock. But the magic of the tour was gone. The real revelation had happened inside, among the shirts.Back inside, the atmosphere had shifted completely. The awkwardness was gone, replaced by a comfortable, almost domestic ease. Gatsby seemed transformed, lighter, happier than I had ever seen him. He looked at Daisy with an open, adoring gaze that was almost painful in its intensity.He had a man named Ewing Klipspringer, a sort of boarder who seemed to live permanently at Gatsby’s house, come down and play the piano. Klipspringer, a pale, slightly bewildered young man, sat down at the grand piano in the music room and began to play. He played popular tunes, light and cheerful, filling the house with music.Daisy and Gatsby sat together on a sofa, talking softly, their heads close together. They seemed oblivious to everything else, lost in their own world. I watched them, feeling again like an outsider, but this time the feeling was different. It wasn’t awkwardness, but a sense of witnessing something profoundly private and significant.Gatsby’s dream, the one he had pursued for five long years, the one that had driven him to build this house, to accumulate this wealth, was finally within his grasp. He had recreated the past, or at least, he had brought the object of his past back into his present. The green light at the end of Daisy’s dock, the symbol of his distant hope, was now, perhaps, within reach.As Klipspringer played, the rain outside seemed to soften, becoming a gentle murmur against the windows. The air inside was warm and filled with music and the quiet murmur of their voices. It was a moment of perfect, fragile happiness, a bubble of time suspended within the larger narrative of their lives.I knew, even then, that such moments are fleeting, that the weight of the past and the complexities of the present would inevitably intrude. But for now, in this room, surrounded by the evidence of Gatsby’s extraordinary devotion, they were simply two people who had found each other again after a long separation.Gatsby’s face, as he looked at Daisy, was radiant. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.He was safe at last, his sanctuary found. He had waited for this moment, planned for it, built his entire life around it. And now, here she was, sitting beside him, her hand perhaps resting lightly on his arm, her laughter mingling with the music.The rain had stopped. A shaft of sunlight broke through the clouds, illuminating the room, casting a golden glow on Daisy’s hair. It was as if the heavens themselves were blessing their reunion.Klipspringer finished a piece and looked up, blinking in the sudden light. Gatsby and Daisy didn’t seem to notice. They were still talking, their voices low and intimate.I felt a pang of something – not sadness, exactly, but a sense of the inevitable fragility of such perfect moments. Gatsby’s dream was so immense, so powerful, that it seemed impossible for reality to live up to it. He had built his entire world around the idea of Daisy, the idealized version of her that existed in his memory. Now that she was here, in the flesh, could she possibly measure up to the impossible standard he had set?But for now, in this sunlit room, surrounded by the echoes of Klipspringer’s music and the rustle of silk shirts being put away, they were simply happy. And watching them, I felt a strange mixture of hope and foreboding. Gatsby had achieved his goal, he had won Daisy back. But what would happen now? What happens after the dream is realized?The question hung in the air, unspoken, as the afternoon wore on. The house, the grounds, the shirts, the music – they were all part of the elaborate stage setting Gatsby had created for this moment. And now the play had begun.I stood up quietly, feeling that my presence was no longer necessary, perhaps even intrusive. I moved towards the door, intending to slip away unnoticed. But as I reached the threshold, Gatsby looked up, his eyes bright with happiness.“Staying for tea, old sport?” he called out, his voice full of warmth.I hesitated, then smiled. “I think I’ll head back,” I said. “But thank you, Gatsby. It’s been… extraordinary.”He nodded, understanding. He knew, I think, that I had witnessed something significant, something that went beyond the mere showing off of wealth. I had seen the culmination of his dream.As I walked out of the room, leaving them alone together, I could still hear the faint sound of Klipspringer playing the piano, a cheerful, insistent melody that seemed to underscore the fragile happiness of the moment. The rain had stopped completely now, and the sun was shining brightly, illuminating the wet leaves on the trees outside.I walked down the grand staircase, through the marble hall,",

Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed as close as a star to the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one. I began to walk about the room, examining the pictures on the wall. The largest of these was an elaborate Dan Cody—a turbaned “portrait of Gatsby” with a husky, florid face of zero old age. “He was an old friend of mine,” said Gatsby, as I stopped before it. “I suppose you’ve met him.” “I haven’t. In fact I didn’t know him. I thought you inherited your money.” “I did, as a matter of fact—from my father.” His father was poor, and farm people. “He’s dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.” There was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the bureau—a defiancely grim young man, five years younger than the others, who without a word was asserting his conviction of the triumph of some long-dreamed of personal destiny. “Who is this?” demanded Daisy. “That? That’s me.” “I like your dress,” remarked Daisy, and I knew that she was flattered. “It’s a trifle old-fashioned, but very good. Is that a wedding dress?” “It’s a yachting costume.” “Oh, yes. I see.” She turned to Gatsby. “You must have been a very poor boy.” “I was.” “Well, I don’t care. I love you anyhow.” She laughed, as if she had said something very witty, and held out her hand for him to kiss. “You see,” she cried, “you see I’m not old-fashioned. I’m not old-fashioned at all. I’m—I’m just—I’m just a little—a little—a little—a little—” She broke off, and I saw that she was crying. “Oh, Gatsby!” Her voice was muffled by the wet folds of the handkerchief. “It’s the first time I ever saw you,” she sobbed, “and I can’t believe it’s you.” “You’re not crying,” said Gatsby, in a strained voice. “You haven’t seen anything yet,” she wailed. “I haven’t even begun.” “You’re not crying,” repeated Gatsby, in a voice that was barely audible. “You’re not crying, are you?” “Oh, Gatsby!” She took his hand and held it tight. “Oh, Gatsby!” He was silent. He was looking at her with an expression of infinite relief, as if he had found something he had lost. “You’re not crying,” he said again. “You’re not crying, are you?” “Oh, Gatsby!” She began to laugh, and the laughter was mixed with tears. “Oh, Gatsby!” He was silent.

                "text": "After the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool, and the hydroplane, and the midsummer flowers—but outside Gatsby’s window it began to rain again, so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated surface of the Sound. “If it wasn’t for the mist we could see your house,” said Gatsby. “You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock.” Daisy put her arm through his abruptly, but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed as close as a star to the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one. I began to walk about the room, examining the pictures on the wall. The largest of these was an elaborate Dan Cody—a turbaned “portrait of Gatsby” with a husky, florid face of zero old age. “He was an old friend of mine,” said Gatsby, as I stopped before it. “I suppose you’ve met him.” “I haven’t. In fact I didn’t know him. I thought you inherited your money.” “I did, as a matter of fact—from my father.” His father was poor, and farm people. “He’s dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.” There was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the bureau—a defiancely grim young man, five years younger than the others, who without a word was asserting his conviction of the triumph of some long-dreamed of personal destiny. “Who is this?” demanded Daisy. “That? That’s me.” “I like your dress,” remarked Daisy, and I knew that she was flattered. “It’s a trifle old-fashioned, but very good. Is that a wedding dress?” “It’s a yachting costume.” “Oh, yes. I see.” She turned to Gatsby. “You must have been a very poor boy.” “I was.” “Well, I don’t care. I love you anyhow.” She laughed, as if she had said something very witty, and held out her hand for him to kiss. “You see,” she cried, “you see I’m not old-fashioned. I’m not old-fashioned at all. I’m—I’m just—I’m just a little—a little—a little—a little—” She broke off, and I saw that she was crying. “Oh, Gatsby!” Her voice was muffled by the wet folds of the handkerchief. “It’s the first time I ever saw you,” she sobbed, “and I can’t believe it’s you.” “You’re not crying,” said Gatsby, in a strained voice. “You haven’t seen anything yet,” she wailed. “I haven’t even begun.” “You’re not crying,” repeated Gatsby, in a voice that was barely audible. “You’re not crying, are you?” “Oh, Gatsby!” She took his hand and held it tight. “Oh, Gatsby!” He was silent. He was looking at her with an expression of infinite relief, as if he had found something he had lost. “You’re not crying,” he said again. “You’re not crying, are you?” “Oh, Gatsby!” She began to laugh, and the laughter was mixed with tears. “Oh, Gatsby!” He was silent.

Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields, of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since seventy-five. The transactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire found him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and, living alone with a few servants, he was in a way committing himself to the whim of a young man whom he happened to pick up somewhere and later taken to sea. This was the opportunity Gatz had been waiting for. He saw the yacht, the symbol of wealth and freedom, and knew his chance had come. He rowed out to the yacht, introduced himself, and was taken on as Cody's assistant. This marked the true beginning of Jay Gatsby, the man who would pursue his dream across the country, building a fortune and a legend, all for the sake of a lost love and a vanished past. He left behind the poverty and anonymity of James Gatz, embracing the glittering, self-created persona of Jay Gatsby, a man defined by his aspirations rather than his origins. His transformation was complete, a testament to his extraordinary capacity for hope and his unwavering belief in the future he had envisioned.",

His brown, hardening body lived naturally through the half-fierce, half-lazy work of the bracing days. He knew women early, and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous of them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of the others because they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming self-absorption he took for granted.\nBut his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy’s wing.\nAn instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before, to the small Lutheran College of St. Olaf’s in southern Minnesota. He stayed there two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor’s work with which he was to pay his way through. Then he drifted back to Lake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the day that Dan Cody’s yacht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore.\nCody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields, of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since seventy-five. The transactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire found him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and, suspecting this, an infinite number of women tried to separate him from his money. The none too savoury ramifications by which Ella Kaye, the newspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in a yacht, were common property of the turgid journalism in 1902.

The latter was less secure, sometimes sleeping on the ground, sometimes in the bunkhouse of a logging camp, sometimes in the forecastle of a lake freighter. He was nineteen, and he had been restless since he was seventeen, when he had left his parents' farm in North Dakota. He found the life of a farmer's son stifling, the endless cycle of planting and harvesting, the small-town gossip, the lack of opportunity. He dreamed of something more, something grander, something that shimmered with the promise of wealth and adventure. He had a fierce, almost religious, belief in his own potential. He wasn't just James Gatz from North Dakota; he was a man destined for greatness. This belief was not a vague hope but a concrete, vivid image he carried in his mind – the 'Platonic conception of himself,' as Nick Carraway would later call it. He saw himself as a figure of power and sophistication, a man who commanded respect and lived a life of effortless luxury. This vision was so real to him that it felt more authentic than the muddy shores of Lake Superior or the rough hands of the fishermen he worked alongside. He devoured books, not for knowledge, but for glimpses into the world he craved. He read about millionaires and explorers, about yachts and mansions, about cities glittering with lights. He practiced speaking in a way he imagined wealthy people spoke, shedding the flat vowels of the Midwest. He was constantly reinventing himself, shedding the skin of James Gatz and reaching for the idealized form of Jay Gatsby. One day, while working on the lake, a yacht anchored in the bay. It was a magnificent vessel, gleaming white against the blue water, a symbol of everything he aspired to. Its owner was Dan Cody, a fifty-year-old man who had made a fortune in copper and silver. Cody was a product of the Nevada silver fields, of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since seventy-five. He was a pioneer, a man of immense wealth and a taste for adventure, though his wealth was now mostly dissipated by women and alcohol. James Gatz rowed out to the yacht, not out of curiosity, but with a sense of destiny. A storm was brewing, and Cody needed a hand. Gatz, quick and capable, proved himself useful. Cody, perhaps seeing a spark of his own youthful ambition in the young man, took a liking to him. He offered Gatz a job as his steward, a position that would take him away from the shores of Lake Superior and into a world he had only dreamed of.

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion lacks the nuanced description of the protagonist's physical and emotional state during his work, as well as the dual nature of his daily labor.\n- The completion does not include the specific details about the protagonist's nightly environment, such as the objects in his room and the atmospheric conditions.\n- The transition from the protagonist's imaginative life to his attempt at college is less developed, missing the sense of how his dreams relate to his actions.\n- The completion omits the public perception and rumors surrounding Ella Kaye and Cody, as well as the specific year referenced in the original.\n- The final sentence does not mention the specific location where Cody and the protagonist meet, nor does it capture the sense of fate or destiny as strongly as the original.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces the name of Cody's yacht, which is not present in the original passage.\n- There is a slight mischaracterization of the protagonist's attitude toward women, attributing it to their being spoiled, rather than focusing on his own self-absorption and the reasons for his contempt.\n- The completion suggests Cody was already mentally frail, whereas the original describes him as robust but on the verge of decline.\n- The sequence of events is slightly altered, particularly in the transition from the protagonist's return to Lake Superior to the arrival of Cody's yacht, which is less clearly linked to the protagonist's ongoing search for purpose."

I suppose he smiled at Dan Cody—it was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced—or seemed to face—the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey. Precisely at that point it vanished—and I was looking at an elegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced himself he’d bought a pile of canvas clothes and a yachting cap, and brown derby, which in a fashion of at least ten years ago, hid the tan look of his skin, and I thought he looked a little foolish in the cap. But there was nothing foolish about him when he spoke to Dan Cody—or rather, when Dan Cody asked him a few questions, that first night, out on the ocean. \"What’s your name?\" demanded Dan Cody. \"James Gatz.\" He knew he had a big future in front of him, and ever since he made the promise to himself that night on the boat—\n\nA promise that he’d break it all down, and build it all up again, into something glorious before he died.\n\n\"I’ve been drifting around for a couple of years now,\" he said, \"trying to get started.\" \"What are you doing now?\" asked Cody. \"I’m a clam-digger.\" He was employed in a vague personal capacity by the proprietor of a small hotel in Duluth; on the lake Superior shore.

But there was nothing foolish about him when he spoke to Dan Cody—or rather, when Dan Cody asked him a few questions, that first night, out on the ocean. \"What’s your name?\" demanded Dan Cody. \"James Gatz.\" He knew he had a big future in front of him, and ever since he made the promise to himself that night on the boat—\n\nA promise that he’d break it all down, and build it all up again, into something glorious before he died.\n\n\"I’ve been drifting around for a couple of years now,\" he said, \"trying to get started.\" \"What are you doing now?\" asked Cody. \"I’m a clam-digger.\" He was employed in a vague personal capacity by the proprietor of a small hotel in Duluth; on the lake Superior shore.

                "text": "To young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck, that yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world. I suppose he smiled at Dan Cody—it was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced—or seemed to face—the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey. Precisely at that point it vanished—and I was looking at an elegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced himself he’d bought a pile of canvas clothes and a yachting cap, and brown derby, which in a fashion of at least ten years ago, hid the tan look of his skin, and I thought he looked a little foolish in the cap.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces a lengthy, repetitive, and irrelevant section about being a clam-digger and salmon-fisher, which is not present in the original passage.

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion fails to include the details about the questions asked by Cody and the revelation of a new name.\n- The middle section lacks the description of the protagonist's various roles and responsibilities while employed, as well as the growing trust placed in him.\n- The passage omits the time span of the arrangement and the notable journeys undertaken.\n- The conclusion is missing the arrival of a new character, the location where this occurs, and the significant event that changes the course of the story.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces invented introspective commentary and dialogue that are not present in the original, such as reflections on a \"promise\" and extended musings about smiles.\n- There are inaccuracies in the sequence of events, with invented dialogue and actions preceding or replacing actual events from the original.\n- The completion misattributes actions and roles, focusing excessively on irrelevant occupations and omitting the actual positions held by the protagonist.\n- The narrative perspective shifts inappropriately, introducing first-person commentary and observations that do not align with the original structure."

                "text": "To young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck, that yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world. I suppose he smiled at Dan Cody—it was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced—or seemed to face—the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey. Precisely at that point it vanished—and I was looking at an elegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced himself he’d bought a pile of canvas clothes and a yachting cap, and brown derby, which in a fashion of at least ten years ago, hid the tan look of his skin, and I thought he looked a little foolish in the cap. But there was nothing foolish about him when he spoke to Dan Cody—or rather, when Dan Cody asked him a few questions, that first night, out on the ocean. “What’s your name?” demanded Dan Cody. “James Gatz.” He knew he had a big future in front of him, and ever since he made the promise to himself that night on the boat— It was laborious and embarrassing, but it had always been his habit to be lavish with them. He was employed in a vague personal capacity by the proprietor of a small hotel in Duluth; on the Lake Superior shore. He was a clam-digger and a salmon-fisher or anything else that brought him food or money. But the proprietor, finding his business better in the summer, had dispensed with him early in September. It was when he got back to shore after rowing out to the Tuolomee that he was hired. He was hired, and Cody bought him a blue coat, six pairs of white duck trousers, and a yachting cap before they sailed for the West Indies and the Barbary Coast. For five years these two young men drifted here and there on the currents of the Pacific. Wherever he went with Dan Cody that year, he was determined to bring back a fortune. He was steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even jailor, for Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be about. And it was from Dan Cody that he inherited money—a legacy of twenty-five thousand dollars. He didn’t get it. He never got it. Ella Kaye came on board one night in Boston and a week later Dan Cody died suddenly and mysteriously. But he knew what was in store for him. He knew what was in store for him.

His eyes, small and shrewd, seemed to hold the secrets of a thousand backrooms and whispered deals. He was the man who fixed the 1919 World Series, a fact he mentioned with a casual, almost boastful air, as if it were merely a clever business transaction. This was the world Gatsby had stepped into, a world where the rules were bent and broken for profit, where the rough edges of the frontier had been polished just enough to fit into the gilded cages of the East. Wolfsheim was the embodiment of that transition, a relic of a cruder era who had found his niche in the sophisticated corruption of the Jazz Age. He was Gatsby's mentor, his partner in the shadowy enterprises that had built the mansion and funded the parties. Looking at his portrait, I saw not just a man, but a symbol of the forces that had shaped Gatsby's rise – the ruthless ambition, the disregard for law, the raw, untamed energy that had been channeled into the pursuit of wealth and a lost dream. He was a reminder that behind the glittering facade of West Egg lay a foundation built on the same savage violence Wolfsheim represented.",

          "text_segment": "It was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs. For several weeks I didn’t see him or hear his voice on the phone—mostly I was in New York, trotting around with Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile aunt—but finally I went over to his house one Sunday afternoon. I hadn’t been there two minutes when somebody brought Tom Buchanan in for a drink. I was startled, naturally, but the really surprising thing was that it hadn’t happened before.\nThey were a party of three on horseback—Tom and a man named Sloane and a pretty woman in a brown riding-habit, who had been there previously.\n“I’m delighted to see you,” said Gatsby, standing on his porch. “I’m delighted that you dropped in.”\nAs though they cared!\n“Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar.” He walked around the room quickly, ringing bells. “I’ll have something to drink for you in just a minute.”\nHe was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there. But he would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in a vague way that that was all they came for. Mr. Sloane wanted nothing. A lemonade? No, thanks. A little champagne? Nothing at all, thanks… I’m sorry—\n“Did you have a nice ride?”\n“Very good roads around here.”\n“I suppose the automobiles—”\n“Yeah.”\nMoved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom, who had accepted the introduction as a stranger.\n“I believe we’ve met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan.”\n“Oh, yes,” said Tom, gruffly polite, but obviously not remembering. “So we did. I remember very well.”\n“About two weeks ago.”\n“That’s right. You were with Nick here.”\n“I know your wife,” continued Gatsby, almost aggressively.\n“That so?”\nTom turned to me.\n“You live near here, Nick?”\n“Next door.”\n“That so?”\nMr. Sloane didn’t enter into the conversation, but lounged back haughtily in his chair; the woman said nothing either—until unexpectedly, after two highballs, she became cordial.\n“We’ll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby,” she suggested. “What do you say?”\n“Certainly; I’d be delighted to have you.”\n“Be ver’ nice,” said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. “Well—think ought to be starting home.”\n“Please don’t hurry,” Gatsby urged them. He had control of himself now, and he wanted to see more of Tom. “Why don’t you—why don’t you stay for supper? I wouldn’t be surprised if some other people dropped in from New York.”\n“You come to supper with me,” said the lady enthusiastically. “Both of you.”\nThis included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.\n“Come along,” he said—but to her only.\n“I mean it,” she insisted. “I’d love to have you. Lots of room.”\nGatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go and he didn’t see that Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn’t.\n“I’m afraid I won’t be able to,” I said.\n“Well, you come,” she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.\nMr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear.\n“We won’t be late if we start now,” she insisted aloud.\n“I haven’t got a horse,” said Gatsby. “I used to ride in the army, but I’ve never bought a horse. I’ll have to follow you in my car. Excuse me for just a minute.”\nThe rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady began an impassioned conversation aside.\n“My God, I believe the man’s coming,” said Tom. “Doesn’t he know she doesn’t want him?”\n“She says she does want him.”\n“She has a big dinner party and he won’t know a soul there.” He frowned. “I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may be old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to suit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish.”\nSuddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted their horses.\n“Come on,” said Mr. Sloane to Tom, “we’re late. We’ve got to go.” And then to me: “Tell him we couldn’t wait, will you?”\nTom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod, and they trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August foliage just as Gatsby, with hat and light overcoat in hand, came out the front door.",

            "prefix-probing": "It was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs. The effective halt had come long before, of course, when the bullet found its mark in the pool, but now it was official, final, marked by the grim necessity of arranging a funeral for a man who had been, in life, surrounded by so many, yet in death, was utterly alone. Gatsby was dead. The world he had built, the shimmering, insubstantial palace of his dreams, constructed from sheer will and a desperate hope, had collapsed, leaving only the raw, ugly reality of a man shot down in his own swimming pool, a victim of a twisted vengeance born of lies and fear. My role as observer, as confidante, as the single honest man among them, was over. There was nothing left to observe but the wreckage, nothing left to confide in but the empty air and the silent, accusing walls of his mansion. The days that followed were a blur of grim necessity and profound disillusionment. I was the only one who seemed to care, the only one willing to take responsibility for the final disposition of Jay Gatsby. I tried to find people for the funeral. It seemed incredible that a man who had thrown such lavish parties, whose house had been a beacon of light and music every weekend, could be so utterly abandoned in death. I called Daisy, but she and Tom had vanished, leaving no forwarding address, no trace, retreating into the impregnable fortress of their wealth and indifference. They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made… I called Meyer Wolfshiem, the man who had supposedly made Gatsby. His office was in the Swastika Holding Company building. His secretary was evasive, then Wolfshiem himself came on the line, full of excuses. He couldn't get mixed up in it, he said. He was a business man, and business was business. He couldn't afford to get involved with a dead man. It was a chilling reminder of the transactional nature of Gatsby's relationships. Then there was Klipspringer, the 'boarder,' who had lived at Gatsby's house all summer, eating his food, using his pool, playing his piano. I called him, hoping he would at least show up out of some sense of obligation. He called back, not to offer condolences or ask about the funeral, but to ask if someone would send him his tennis shoes. His tennis shoes! It was grotesque, a perfect encapsulation of the parasitic nature of the people who had flocked to Gatsby's light. I searched for others, for anyone who had shared a drink or a dance or a conversation with him, but there was no one. They had all moved on, like moths scattering when the light is extinguished. The only person who came was his father, Henry C. Gatz, a solemn, helpless old man from Minnesota, who arrived carrying a worn copy of 'Hopalong Cassidy' with Gatsby's youthful resolutions written inside. He was proud of his son, immensely proud, showing me a faded photograph of the house and talking about Jimmy's potential, his plans. It was heartbreaking to see his simple, genuine grief contrasted with the utter absence of everyone else. The funeral was a miserable affair. Besides Mr. Gatz and myself, only the minister and four or five servants attended. It rained. It was a lonely, desolate end for a man who had craved connection and recognition above all else. After the funeral, the East felt unbearable. It was haunted for me now, a place of grotesque gardens and ashes, of people who preyed on each other without consequence, who built their lives on illusions and destroyed others with casual cruelty. I remembered the raw vigor of the West, the clean, hard lives of the people there, the sense of belonging that I had never found here, this frantic, superficial world. I wanted to see the familiar streets, the houses I knew, the faces that weren't masks of pretense and indifference. Before I left, I had one last encounter with Tom. I saw him on Fifth Avenue one afternoon. He looked prosperous and solid, utterly untouched by the ruin he had helped create. He told me he had told Wilson that Gatsby was the owner of the death car, and that Gatsby had murdered Myrtle. He said he had a right to tell him, that Gatsby deserved to be killed for running over Myrtle. He spoke with a brutal, self-righteous certainty that chilled me. I couldn't even be angry. It was like talking to a child who had broken something and blamed someone else, but this child had broken lives. There was no point in arguing with him, no way to penetrate the thick shell of his self-justification, his belief in his own inherent rightness. I left him standing there, a monument to the brutal indifference and destructive power of his class. I also saw Jordan Baker. We talked briefly. She was cool and detached, as always, her golden arms brown in the sun. She told me she was engaged to another man. She accused me of being dishonest, of breaking off our relationship without a word. It was a strange accusation coming from her, from any of them. I felt a weariness, a profound exhaustion with their world, their lies, their endless capacity for self-deception and shifting blame. I couldn't stand their air of knowing everything, of being above consequence. I see now that this has been a story of the West, after all—Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life. Even when the excitement of that summer was over, and I had left the coast forever, I could not get the hang of the Eastern temperament. I was fitted for the West. So I decided to go back home. The East was a place of ghosts and ashes, a place where dreams turned to dust and people were consumed by their own emptiness. I wanted the solid ground of the West, the moral landscape I understood. On my last night, I walked over to Gatsby’s house. It was dark and empty, a hollow shell, the lights extinguished, the music silenced forever. I went down to the beach and sat looking out at the water. The moon was high, casting a pale light over the bay. I thought about Gatsby, about his dream, about the green light at the end of Daisy’s dock. He had believed in that light, in the future that recedes before us. He had not known that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night. Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine morning—— So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.",

              "simple_agent_extraction": "It was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs. We were at least casually intimate in this year with Jordan Baker, and it was pleasant to have her there beside me on my last old spring days. But generally I was drawn elsewhere. Her house was on a low cliff overlooking the Sound, and I spent three days there once in a misty April, when it was so cold that the hip-flask of whiskey came in handy and we turned Jordan’s room into a pigsty, and later I had a dim background of New York at night, with its gay crowds and pleasure palaces, and over all the ceaseless, sombre thunder of Broadway, the tuning-fork that had been struck upon a star. Then came that Sunday afternoon — when things happened that convinced me of his incorrigible optimism. I should have remembered that the roadster was the most limited of all caravans and its passen gers the most unrestful of all travellers. We were sitting down at an unfamiliar table in the garden, when Gatsby appeared, through the amorphous trees, with two friends whom he introduced as Mr. Sloane and the lady. ‘Do you know why we stopped by?’ asked Mr. Sloane. ‘I never had so much fun, Sloane,’ said the lady. ‘Mr. Gatsby, I wish you’d tell me where you live. We haven’t met for many years,’ said Tom Buchanan, leaning down from his saddle. ‘In West Egg,’ said Gatsby, politely. ‘I live at West Egg,’ repeated Tom, amazed. ‘The name sounds familiar. I’m almost sure I’ve met you somewhere before.’ ‘We met at a party about a month ago.’ ‘That’s right. You were Mr. Gatsby.’ ‘I’m glad you remembered me.’ ‘I’m afraid your hand is safer in your pocket, Mr. Gatsby,’ said Mr. Sloane, coldly. ‘You see,’ he explained to the lady, ‘if you shake hands with him it means you’ve accepted his hospitality.’ ‘I’m afraid I’m not in a position to accept any hospitality,’ said the lady, with a slight smile. ‘I’m afraid I’m not in a position to accept any

We were at least casually intimate in this year with Jordan Baker, and it was pleasant to have her there beside me on my last old spring days. But generally I was drawn elsewhere. Her house was on a low cliff overlooking the Sound, and I spent three days there once in a misty April, when it was so cold that the hip-flask of whiskey came in handy and we turned Jordan’s room into a pigsty, and later I had a dim background of New York at night, with its gay crowds and pleasure palaces, and over all the ceaseless, sombre thunder of Broadway, the tuning-fork that had been struck upon a star. Then came that Sunday afternoon — when things happened that convinced me of his incorrigible optimism. I should have remembered that the roadster was the most limited of all caravans and its passen gers the most unrestful of all travellers. We were sitting down at an unfamiliar table in the garden, when Gatsby appeared, through the amorphous trees, with two friends whom he introduced as Mr. Sloane and the lady. ‘Do you know why we stopped by?’ asked Mr. Sloane. ‘I never had so much fun, Sloane,’ said the lady. ‘Mr. Gatsby, I wish you’d tell me where you live. We haven’t met for many years,’ said Tom Buchanan, leaning down from his saddle. ‘In West Egg,’ said Gatsby, politely. ‘I live at West Egg,’ repeated Tom, amazed. ‘The name sounds familiar. I’m almost sure I’ve met you somewhere before.’ ‘We met at a party about a month ago.’ ‘That’s right. You were Mr. Gatsby.’ ‘I’m glad you remembered me.’ ‘I’m afraid your hand is safer in your pocket, Mr. Gatsby,’ said Mr. Sloane, coldly. ‘You see,’ he explained to the lady, ‘if you shake hands with him it means you’ve accepted his hospitality.’ ‘I’m afraid I’m not in a position to accept any hospitality,’ said the lady, with a slight smile. ‘I’m afraid I’m not in a position to accept any hospitality,’ repeated Mr. Sloane, with a slight smile. ‘I’m afraid I’m not in a position to accept any hospitality,’ repeated the lady, with a slight smile. ‘I’m afraid I’m not in a position to

          "text_segment": "Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy’s running around alone, for on the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby’s party. Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness—it stands out in my memory from Gatsby’s other parties that summer. There were the same people, or at least the same sort of people, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-coloured, many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that hadn’t been there before. Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world complete in itself, with its own standards and its own great figures, second to nothing because it had no consciousness of being so, and now I was looking at it again, through Daisy’s eyes. It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment.\nThey arrived at twilight, and, as we strolled out among the sparkling hundreds, Daisy’s voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat.\n“These things excite me so,” she whispered. “If you want to kiss me any time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I’ll be glad to arrange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green card. I’m giving out green—”\n“Look around,” suggested Gatsby.\n“I’m looking around. I’m having a marvellous—”\n“You must see the faces of many people you’ve heard about.”\nTom’s arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.\n“We don’t go around very much,” he said; “in fact, I was just thinking I don’t know a soul here.”\n“Perhaps you know that lady.” Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white-plum tree. Tom and Daisy stared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies.\n“She’s lovely,” said Daisy.\n“The man bending over her is her director.”\nHe took them ceremoniously from group to group:\n“Mrs. Buchanan… and Mr. Buchanan—” After an instant’s hesitation he added: “the polo player.”\n“Oh no,” objected Tom quickly, “not me.”\nBut evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained “the polo player” for the rest of the evening.\n“I’ve never met so many celebrities,” Daisy exclaimed. “I liked that man—what was his name?—with the sort of blue nose.”\nGatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer.\n“Well, I liked him anyhow.”\n“I’d a little rather not be the polo player,” said Tom pleasantly, “I’d rather look at all these famous people in—in oblivion.”\nDaisy and Gatsby danced. I remember being surprised by his graceful, conservative foxtrot—I had never seen him dance before. Then they sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour, while at her request I remained watchfully in the garden. “In case there’s a fire or a flood,” she explained, “or any act of God.”\nTom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together. “Do you mind if I eat with some people over here?” he said. “A fellow’s getting off some funny stuff.”\n“Go ahead,” answered Daisy genially, “and if you want to take down any addresses here’s my little gold pencil.”… She looked around after a moment and told me the girl was “common but pretty,” and I knew that except for the half-hour she’d been alone with Gatsby she wasn’t having a good time.",

            "prefix-probing": "Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy’s running around alone, for on the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby’s party. Their arrival cast a subtle, yet palpable, shift over the vibrant chaos of Gatsby’s lawn. Tom, with his imposing physique and air of proprietorship, moved through the crowd like a restless, suspicious animal, his eyes scanning the faces with a proprietary disapproval that seemed to encompass the entire scene. Daisy, beside him, was a splash of delicate color against the boisterous backdrop, her laughter like a bright, uncertain note in the symphony of jazz and chatter. She seemed both fascinated and slightly overwhelmed by the sheer, unadulterated spectacle, a world away from the staid, predictable gatherings of East Egg. Gatsby, usually so poised and in control of his elaborate stage, seemed subtly off-balance by Tom’s presence. He hovered near Daisy, his gaze fixed on her with an intensity that bordered on desperation, anxious for her approval, for some sign that this dazzling display was worthy of her. He introduced them to a few people, but the introductions felt strained, the usual effortless charm replaced by a nervous eagerness. Tom, meanwhile, wasted no time in expressing his disdain. He found the guests vulgar, the music loud, the whole affair lacking in the quiet, inherited dignity he associated with wealth. He kept asking questions, probing for the source of Gatsby’s money, his eyes narrowed with suspicion. \"Who is this fellow, anyhow?\" he demanded of Nick at one point, his voice thick with a raw vigor that cut through the artificial gaiety. \"Some kind of bootlegger, I suppose.\" Daisy, for her part, tried to enjoy herself, swept along by the current of the party, but Tom’s palpable disapproval seemed to dampen her spirits. Gatsby, sensing this, tried desperately to isolate her from the parts of the party he feared she would find distasteful. He took her on a tour of the house, showing her the opulent rooms, the vast library, the swimming pool, as if the sheer weight of his possessions could somehow impress her enough to erase Tom’s judgment. He even pointed out the specific rooms he had built for her, a detail that hung in the air with a heavy, unspoken significance. Daisy was momentarily captivated by the sheer scale of it all, but the underlying tension between the two men, and the jarring contrast between Gatsby’s world and her own, was undeniable. Nick watched this unfolding drama with a growing sense of unease. He saw Gatsby’s desperate attempt to recreate a past that was irrevocably gone, his belief that this elaborate facade could somehow win Daisy back completely. He saw Tom’s brutal, unthinking possessiveness, his inability to comprehend a world outside his own narrow experience. And he saw Daisy, caught between them, her famous charm and vivacity flickering under the strain. The party, which usually felt like a vibrant, if superficial, escape, now felt charged with a dangerous undercurrent. The music seemed louder, the laughter more brittle, the whole scene a grotesque parody of joy. Tom’s presence had stripped away the illusion, revealing the raw, uncomfortable reality beneath. He was a jarring note in Gatsby’s carefully orchestrated symphony, a reminder of the world Gatsby was trying so hard to escape, and the world that still held Daisy captive. The evening wore on, the tension mounting, a silent battle being waged on the manicured lawn, the prize a woman who seemed increasingly fragile under the weight of their competing desires. Gatsby’s dream, so vivid and tangible just moments before, seemed to recede slightly, threatened by the brute force of Tom’s reality. The air grew heavy with unspoken accusations and simmering resentment, turning the festive atmosphere into something strained and precarious."

          "text_segment": "We were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my fault—Gatsby had been called to the phone, and I’d enjoyed these same people only two weeks before. But what had amused me then turned septic on the air now.\n“How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?”\nThe girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my shoulder. At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes.\n“Wha’?”\nA massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf with her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker’s defence:\n“Oh, she’s all right now. When she’s had five or six cocktails she always starts screaming like that. I tell her she ought to leave it alone.”\n“I do leave it alone,” affirmed the accused hollowly.\n“We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: ‘There’s somebody that needs your help, Doc.’ ”\n“She’s much obliged, I’m sure,” said another friend, without gratitude, “but you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool.”\n“Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,” mumbled Miss Baedeker. “They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey.”\n“Then you ought to leave it alone,” countered Doctor Civet.\n“Speak for yourself!” cried Miss Baedeker violently. “Your hand shakes. I wouldn’t let you operate on me!”\nIt was like that. Almost the last thing I remember was standing with Daisy and watching the moving-picture director and his Star. They were still under the white-plum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale, thin ray of moonlight between. It occurred to me that he had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this proximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate degree and kiss at her cheek.\n“I like her,” said Daisy, “I think she’s lovely.”\nBut the rest offended her—and inarguably because it wasn’t a gesture but an emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented “place” that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village—appalled by its raw vigour that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a shortcut from nothing to nothing. She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand.\nI sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car. It was dark here in front; only the bright door sent ten square feet of light volleying out into the soft black morning. Sometimes a shadow moved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow, an indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an invisible glass.\n“Who is this Gatsby anyhow?” demanded Tom suddenly. “Some big bootlegger?”\n“Where’d you hear that?” I inquired.\n“I didn’t hear it. I imagined it. A lot of these newly rich people are just big bootleggers, you know.”\n“Not Gatsby,” I said shortly.\nHe was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the drive crunched under his feet.\n“Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie together.”\nA breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy’s fur collar.\n“At least they are more interesting than the people we know,” she said with an effort.\n“You didn’t look so interested.”\n“Well, I was.”\nTom laughed and turned to me.\n“Did you notice Daisy’s face when that girl asked her to put her under a cold shower?”\nDaisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper, bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again. When the melody rose her voice broke up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.\n“Lots of people come who haven’t been invited,” she said suddenly. “That girl hadn’t been invited. They simply force their way in and he’s too polite to object.”\n“I’d like to know who he is and what he does,” insisted Tom. “And I think I’ll make a point of finding out.”\n“I can tell you right now,” she answered. “He owned some drugstores, a lot of drugstores. He built them up himself.”\nThe dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive.\n“Good night, Nick,” said Daisy.\nHer glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps, where “Three O’Clock in the Morning,” a neat, sad little waltz of that year, was drifting out the open door. After all, in the very casualness of Gatsby’s party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from her world. What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside? What would happen now in the dim, incalculable hours? Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare and to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with one fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would blot out those five years of unwavering devotion.",

            "prefix-probing": "We were at a particularly tipsy table. The air around us hummed with the frantic energy of a hundred conversations, all competing with the insistent, brassy clamor of the orchestra. Champagne corks popped like distant firecrackers, and the golden liquid flowed into glasses with a reckless generosity that seemed to mirror the mood of the entire assembly. My own glass, perpetually refilled by an unseen hand, felt cool and heavy, a small anchor in the swirling, disorienting sea of faces and laughter. Around me, people I barely knew, and some I didn't know at all, leaned in conspiratorially, their voices slurred just enough to make their pronouncements sound profound, or perhaps just louder. A woman with a cascade of red hair, whom I vaguely recalled seeing earlier near the buffet, was explaining, with elaborate gestures, the intricate details of her recent divorce. Her companion, a stout man in a white suit that seemed perpetually on the verge of bursting, nodded sagely, though his eyes kept darting towards the dance floor, where couples gyrated with a kind of desperate abandon. The table itself was a microcosm of the larger party – a collection of individuals thrown together by chance, united only by their shared consumption of Gatsby's hospitality and his liquor. There was a young couple, barely out of their teens, locked in a passionate, public embrace that drew amused glances. There was an older gentleman, impeccably dressed, who sat silently, nursing his drink and observing the scene with an expression of weary amusement, as if he had seen it all before, perhaps many times over. I felt a familiar detachment settling over me, the sensation of being both present and utterly removed. It was like watching a play unfold, a vibrant, chaotic spectacle in which I had been assigned a minor, non-speaking role. The music swelled, a hot, syncopated rhythm that seemed to demand movement, and several people from our table lurched onto the crowded floor, their movements clumsy but enthusiastic. The conversation, if one could call it that, drifted from topic to topic with the same aimless quality as the dancers. Someone mentioned the stock market, someone else complained about the heat, and then, inevitably, the talk turned to Gatsby. The rumors circulated like currency – he was a German spy, he had killed a man, he was a relative of the Kaiser, he had never even been to Oxford. Each story was more improbable than the last, yet they were repeated with a kind of reverent awe, adding layers to the enigma that was our host. No one at our table, or indeed, it seemed, at the entire party, knew Gatsby personally. They had simply arrived, drawn by the magnetic pull of his wealth and his reputation for throwing these lavish, unrestrained gatherings. It was a strange form of social interaction, built on a foundation of anonymity and borrowed glamour. We were all guests in a house whose owner remained largely invisible, a mysterious figure glimpsed only occasionally, if at all, through the throng. I looked out across the lawn, which was now a shimmering expanse of light and shadow, dotted with clusters of people laughing and talking. The air was thick with the scent of flowers and perfume and alcohol. The noise level was deafening, a constant roar that made intimate conversation impossible and encouraged only shouted pronouncements and boisterous laughter. The woman with the red hair suddenly leaned towards me, her eyes bright and unfocused. \"Isn't it marvelous?\" she slurred, sweeping a hand vaguely around the scene. \"Simply marvelous.\" I nodded, offering a non-committal smile. What could I say? It was certainly something. It was a display of wealth and excess on a scale I had never witnessed before, a testament to a kind of careless, almost violent, opulence. It felt both exhilarating and deeply unsettling. The night wore on, the level of intoxication at our table steadily increasing. The young couple had disappeared, presumably to find a more private spot for their affections. The stout man in the white suit had finally made it to the dance floor, where he was attempting a clumsy Charleston with a woman who looked equally unsteady on her feet. The older gentleman still sat silently, his gaze fixed on some distant point. I found myself wondering about Gatsby, the man behind this elaborate facade. What did he make of all this? Did he enjoy these parties? Or was he, like me, merely an observer, watching from the periphery? The sheer scale of the event suggested a desperate need to impress, a yearning for something that all this extravagance couldn't quite provide. As the hours passed, the party began to fray at the edges. The music grew louder, the dancing more frenetic. Arguments broke out near the bar. People stumbled and fell. The veneer of sophistication, thin to begin with, had completely dissolved, revealing the raw, uninhibited chaos beneath. Our table, once a hub of tipsy chatter, had become quieter, the occupants either lost in their own alcoholic haze or having wandered off in search of new diversions. I sat there, the ice in my glass long melted, the bubbles in my champagne long gone, feeling a profound sense of isolation amidst the crowd. This was the Jazz Age in full swing, a dizzying, intoxicating dance on the edge of something undefined, something perhaps dangerous. And I, Nick Carraway, was merely watching it all unfold, trying to make sense of the spectacle, trying to understand the man who had orchestrated it all, the mysterious Jay Gatsby.",

Something in the wind stirred the leaves and caught at my scarf at the three-quarter mark. The young ladies were drunk, and one of them was singing an obscene song in a husky contralto. Beside her sat a stout, middle-aged man, with a large, flat nose and a rather unpleasant face.

                "text": "We were at a particularly tipsy table. There was a great deal of champagne, and the young ladies made incidental remarks that struck Gatsby cold, but everything else passed, in a fashion, between eight and nine, only half built, as usual. Something in the wind stirred the leaves and caught at my scarf at the three-quarter mark. The young ladies were drunk, and one of them was singing an obscene song in a husky contralto. Beside her sat a stout, middle-aged man, with a large, flat nose and a rather unpleasant face. He was talking to a very drunk woman, Miss Baedeker, who was saying that she had been dunked in a swimming pool at West Egg that afternoon. 'I'll bet you were,' said the stout man. 'I'll bet you were dunked in a swimming pool.' 'I was, too,' said Miss Baedeker. 'I was dunked in a swimming pool.' 'I'll bet you were,' said the stout man.

          "text_segment": "I stayed late that night. Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free, and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run up, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights were extinguished in the guestrooms overhead. When he came down the steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes were bright and tired.\n“She didn’t like it,” he said immediately.\n“Of course she did.”\n“She didn’t like it,” he insisted. “She didn’t have a good time.”\nHe was silent, and I guessed at his unutterable depression.\n“I feel far away from her,” he said. “It’s hard to make her understand.”\n“You mean about the dance?”\n“The dance?” He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of his fingers. “Old sport, the dance is unimportant.”\nHe wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say: “I never loved you.” After she had obliterated four years with that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken. One of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back to Louisville and be married from her house—just as if it were five years ago.\n“And she doesn’t understand,” he said. “She used to be able to understand. We’d sit for hours—”\nHe broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds and discarded favours and crushed flowers.\n“I wouldn’t ask too much of her,” I ventured. “You can’t repeat the past.”\n“Can’t repeat the past?” he cried incredulously. “Why of course you can!”\nHe looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.\n“I’m going to fix everything just the way it was before,” he said, nodding determinedly. “She’ll see.”\nHe talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy. His life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he could find out what that thing was…\n… One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight. They stopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of the year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees—he could climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.\nHis heart beat faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning-fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips’ touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.\nThrough all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was reminded of something—an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man’s, as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air. But they made no sound, and what I had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever.",

After the last guests had departed, and the lights began to snap off out on the lawn, Gatsby came alive to me, standing on the porch, his hands shoved in his pockets, looking at the black sky through the great trees that brooded over the house. The party seemed to him a colossal failure. \"She didn't like it,\" he said immediately. \"Of course she didn't like it.\" \"She didn't have a good time.\" He was silent, and I guessed at his unutterable depression. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, hoping, I suppose, that she would come, and young Roué of the world, Gatsby, had broken the five-year-old chain of habit only to be disappointed. He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say: \"I never loved you.\" After she had obliterated four years with that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken. One of them was that, after she came back, they were to go back to Louisville and be married from her house—just as if it were five years ago. \"And she's not to know about the past. You've got to be careful about women.\" He was talking intently across the lawn. \"It was a great mistake, my not having any more women at the house. The only thing I can think of is that I'm not very good at it.\" He looked at me anxiously, as if he hoped I'd corroborate this. \"I'm not very good at it,\" he repeated. \"I'm not very good at it.\" \"I don't think that's a very good idea,\" I told him. \"You can't repeat the past.\" \"Can't repeat the past?\" he cried incredulously. \"Why of course you can!\" He looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking somewhere among the shadows of the house, just out of reach of his hand. \"I'm going to fix everything just the way it was before,\" he said, nodding determinedly. \"She'll see.\" He talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy. His life had been confused and disordered ever since he had committed himself to the following of that grail. His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. We walked slowly down the garden toward the gate. He described that year, repeating all he had told me the night before, and adding more, until his imagination felt like a thin beard, and I was afraid that in another minute it would be visible to the naked eye. He told me that he had first met Daisy in the autumn of 1917, when he was stationed at Camp Taylor, near Louisville. He was a young officer, and she was a girl in white, and she was the most popular girl in Louisville. He had never met any one like her before. He had never known any one so beautiful and so rich.

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents a lengthy, repetitive exchange between Gatsby and the narrator that does not occur in the original. This invented dialogue dominates the middle and end of the passage, replacing key original content.\n- The completion omits the entire reflective and descriptive section from the latter part of the original, including the significant memory sequence and the narrator’s internal observations.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The initial setting details, such as the specific activities and atmosphere in the garden and the sequence of events leading up to Gatsby’s arrival, are missing or replaced with generic descriptions.\n- The original’s nuanced depiction of Gatsby’s emotional state and physical appearance upon entering is not present.\n- The completion lacks the original’s exploration of Gatsby’s desires regarding Daisy, including his hopes for her actions and the plan involving Louisville.\n- The passage omits the detailed recollection of a significant moment from Gatsby’s past, including the sensory and atmospheric details, and the metaphorical imagery associated with that memory.\n- The narrator’s introspective conclusion and the sense of an elusive, unspoken realization are not included.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The timing and sequence of events are altered; the completion suggests Gatsby is present immediately after the party, rather than after a period of waiting.\n- The dialogue is inaccurate, with invented lines and repeated exchanges that do not reflect the original conversation’s content or tone.\n- The completion attributes thoughts and motivations to Gatsby and the narrator that are not present in the original, including invented rationalizations and future predictions.\n- The structure of the conversation is disrupted, with the focus shifting away from the original’s themes of longing and the impossibility of recapturing the past.\n- The completion fails to include the original’s symbolic and metaphorical language, especially in the latter half, and instead repeats a single argument multiple times."

Wondering if he were sick I went over to find out—an unfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door.\n“Is Mr. Gatsby sick?”\n“Nope.” After a pause he added “sir” in a dilatory, grudging way.\n“I hadn’t seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell him Mr. Carraway came over.”\n“Who?” he demanded rudely.\n“Carraway.”\n“Carraway. All right, I’ll tell him.”\nAbruptly he slammed the door.\nMy Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never went into West Egg village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered moderate supplies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that the kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the village was that the new people weren’t servants at all.\nNext day Gatsby called me on the phone.\n“Going away?” I inquired.\n“No, old sport.”\n“I hear you fired all your servants.”\n“I wanted somebody who wouldn’t gossip. Daisy comes over quite often—in the afternoons.”\nSo the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in her eyes.\n“They’re some people Wolfshiem wanted to do something for.

The silence that fell over the grounds was profound. No more music, no more laughter, no more endless stream of cars. The house stood dark and empty, a sudden, stark contrast to the vibrant spectacle it had been. People whispered, wondering what had happened, but the mystery remained. Then came another change. One morning, the entire staff was gone, replaced by a new set of servants, surly and secretive. Gatsby explained to Nick that these new people were brothers and sisters, recommended by Wolfshiem, and that he had let the old staff go because they gossiped. He wanted to avoid any talk about Daisy coming over. The summer pressed on, heavy and hot, the air thick with the scent of honeysuckle and the promise of storm. The days grew longer, the heat more intense, mirroring the rising tension between the characters. The carefree days of spring and early summer were over. The illusion of endless possibility had faded. The stillness of Gatsby's mansion felt ominous, a pause before a catastrophe. The vibrant life that had pulsed there was extinguished, leaving behind only the oppressive quiet and the weight of unspoken desires and dangerous secrets. The season of revelry had ended, and the season of reckoning had begun.",

Ahead of the great changes that were due around him he had made one of his own. And one afternoon, late in July, his gardener came over to my house and said that Mr. Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his house a week ago and hired a entirely new one, who neither knew nor cared whether a story was true or false. \"There's something funny about a fellow that'll do a thing like that,\" he said. \"He doesn't look like a servant.\" The next morning on my way to work I stopped at the corner to get a pack of cigarettes, and I saw the gardener again. \"Is Mr. Gatsby sick?\" I inquired. \"No, sir. He's not sick.\" He was a large, hulking fellow, with a stolid face, and he didn't seem to have any idea what I was talking about. \"Well, I mean, is he all right?\" I persisted. \"Yes, sir. He's all right.\" He was plainly not a servant. I went on to the station. The next day Gatsby phoned me. \"Good morning, old sport,\" he said. \"How are you?\" I was feeling a little depressed by the heat, and I answered, \"I'm all right, thanks. How are you?\" \"I'm all right,\" he said. \"I'm just calling to ask you if you'll come over the day after to-morrow.\" I hesitated. \"I'd like to, but I'm afraid I can't. I'm going to be busy.\" \"Oh, well, that's too bad. I'm sorry.\" He sounded disappointed. \"I'm going to have a party,\" he said. \"A small one.\" \"Oh, I see.\" I was a little surprised. \"I thought you weren't having any more parties.\" \"Oh, I am,\" he said. \"I'm just having a small one.

                "text": "It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday night—and, as obscurely as it had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over. Only gradually I became aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away. Before me stretched the portentous, menacing road of a new decade. . . .\nIt was nine o’clock when I finished this meditation and I decided to drive over to Gatsby’s. There were hardly any lights on the first floor, but on the second I saw a single lamp throwing a yellow square on the side of the house. When I got to the door the butler gave me a surprisingly hard stare, and after a moment grudgingly allowed me to enter. “Is Mr. Gatsby sick?” “Nope.” After a pause he added, “I could find out what you want, sir.” “Oh, it isn’t important,” I said. “Just tell him Mr. Carraway called.” “Yeah.” This man was introduced to me as Gatsby’s butler when I called toward the end of July. It was a hot afternoon, and all the doors and windows were open, trying to let in a wish for fresh air. There wasn’t a sound in the house except the groaning creak of a mattress somewhere upstairs. He was still there when I came back that night. I hadn’t seen him around before. The next morning I sent my Finn to make a list of the groceries. “It’s funny,” she said, “but I haven’t seen a soul all morning.” A little later I got off the train at West Egg, and I saw a grocery boy from West Egg Village standing beside the kitchen door. “Did you see anybody in there?” I inquired. “No, sir,” he answered. “They’re all gone.” He stared at me for a moment, and then he added, “They fired all those servants last week.” “Fired them?” “Yeah. They’re all gone. The Finn says she hasn’t seen a soul all morning.” He stared at me again. “It’s funny,” he repeated. “I haven’t seen a soul all morning.” I went on to the station. The next day Gatsby phoned me. “Good morning, old sport,” he said. “How are you?” I was feeling a little depressed by the heat, and I answered, “I’m all right, thanks. How are you?” “I’m all right,” he said. “I’m just calling to ask you if you’ll come over the day after to-morrow.” I hesitated. “I’d like to, but I’m afraid I can’t. I’m going to be busy.” “Oh, well, that’s too bad. I’m sorry.” He sounded disappointed. “I’m going to have a party,” he said. “A small one.” “Oh, I see.” I was a little surprised. “I thought you weren’t having any more parties.” “Oh, I am,” he said. “I’m just having a small one. Just a few people.” He paused. “Daisy and Tom are coming.” I was silent. “Oh, I see,” I said again. “Well, I’d like to come, but I’m afraid I can’t.” “Oh, well, that’s too bad,” he said. “I’m sorry.” He paused again. “I’m going to have a party,” he said. “A small one.” “Oh, I see.” I was a little surprised. “I thought you weren’t having any more parties.” “Oh, I am,” he said. “I’m just having a small one.

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces invented scenes and characters, such as a gardener relaying information about Gatsby's servants and a repeated, lengthy, and unrealistic phone conversation about a party. These do not appear in the original passage.\n- The completion omits the original's key sequence involving Nick's direct visit to Gatsby's house, the interaction with the unfamiliar butler, and the subsequent information from Nick's Finn and the grocery boy about the new servants.\n- The completion contains a large, repetitive block of dialogue about a party that is not present in the original and disrupts the narrative flow.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the original's detailed account of Nick's suspicions about Gatsby's health and his visit to the house, including the specific exchange with the butler.\n- There is no mention of the Finn's report about the new servants' behavior or the grocery boy's observation about the state of the kitchen, both of which are important for establishing the atmosphere and changes in Gatsby's household.\n- The explanation regarding why Gatsby replaced his servants and the connection to Daisy's visits is missing or only vaguely referenced.\n- The original's nuanced description of the townspeople's opinions about the new staff is absent.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes the information about the servants to a gardener, rather than the sources in the original.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the phone call from Gatsby and the invented party invitation occur in a different order and context than the original events.\n- The completion repeatedly cycles through a fabricated conversation about a party, which is not only inaccurate but also disrupts the intended pacing and focus of the original passage.\n- The completion omits the original's explanation about the new servants' background and their connection to another character, leading to a loss of important context.\n\nTo improve, the LLM should avoid inventing new scenes or dialogue, ensure all key narrative steps and sources of information are included, and maintain the correct sequence and context of events as presented in the original passage."

As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush at noon. The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion; the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry. Her pocketbook slapped to the floor.\n“Oh, my!” she gasped.\nI picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it at arm’s length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that I had no designs upon it—but everyone near by, including the woman, suspected me just the same.\n“Hot!” said the conductor to familiar faces. “Some weather!… Hot!… Hot!… Hot!… Is it hot enough for you?

Was that all? About noon. The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of summer. As my train waited the ten minutes at Jamaica, the woman up the aisle of the coach fanned herself with a newspaper. The man next to her told her she might as well leave it in the oven. When the train began to move again this woman blocked out the light for a moment with one of those cheap Japanese lanterns of the nineties. She was going to the World’s Fair with a man from New Jersey and they had a little house in Bayonne. It was hot work, this fanning. She began to cry. “I’m going to get sick,” she said. “I got a headache just from looking at the advertisement over the way. I can’t stand this heat any more. If I don’t get sick I’m going to faint.” “Don’t stand there,” commanded the man beside her. “Come on back where it’s cooler. You can’t stand there.” He got up himself and went toward the end of the coach. The woman followed, but presently she came back and sat down beside her friend. She had dropped a purse in the aisle, and when I picked it up and gave it to her she looked at me with a gloomy suspicion. “Aut’graphs?” she asked. “Aut’graphs?” I have talked with acquaintances old and new, first with a bus-driver who had been there ’05, then with a taxi-driver who had been there ’09, and I have heard the story of the World’s Fair in 1909 from a man who had lived near it for many years.

About noon. The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of summer. As my train waited the ten minutes at Jamaica, the woman up the aisle of the coach fanned herself with a newspaper. The man next to her told her she might as well leave it in the oven. When the train began to move again this woman blocked out the light for a moment with one of those cheap Japanese lanterns of the nineties. She was going to the World’s Fair with a man from New Jersey and they had a little house in Bayonne. It was hot work, this fanning. She began to cry. “I’m going to get sick,” she said. “I got a headache just from looking at the advertisement over the way. I can’t stand this heat any more. If I don’t get sick I’m going to faint.” “Don’t stand there,” commanded the man beside her. “Come on back where it’s cooler. You can’t stand there.” He got up himself and went toward the end of the coach. The woman followed, but presently she came back and sat down beside her friend. She had dropped a purse in the aisle, and when I picked it up and gave it to her she looked at me with a gloomy suspicion. “Aut’graphs?” she asked. “Aut’graphs?” I have talked with acquaintances old and new, first with a bus-driver who had been there ’05, then with a taxi-driver who had been there ’09, and I have heard the story of the World’s Fair in 1909 from a man who had lived near it for many years.

About noon. The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of summer. As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush at noon. The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion; the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her handkerchief and then gave it up and fanned herself with a subway map. The very hotness of the weather even made it necessary to postpone the picnic, and Gatsby called me up at eleven o’clock to say that they’d be damned if they’d go to Coney Island. In fact, they were coming over to my house for a while. I didn’t object. There was something in the air that morning that fell just short of being oppressive. Still, I can’t explain how it was that I knew Daisy was coming too. I got off the train at West Egg and started out the dusty road to the house. The conductor was talking to a brakeman as I went by. “I’m going to get a cold bath,” he said, “and go to bed.” “Well, so long,” the brakeman answered. “See you soon.” “I hope not,” said the conductor. “I hope I don’t see you all summer.” I went up to Gatsby’s door and knocked. He came out in a white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold-colored tie, and he was pale as death. “Is it twelve already?” he asked. I told him it was only ten minutes past nine. He looked at his watch as if he were surprised. “Oh,” he said. “I thought it was twelve.” “Are you sure?” I asked. “I’m sure.” He looked at me with an air of having committed himself to something. “I thought you might be interested to know that Daisy is coming over this afternoon.” I didn’t say anything. “She wants to see you,” he added. “She wants to see you alone.” I didn’t say anything. “She wants to see you alone,” he repeated. “She wants to see you alone.” He looked at me with an air of having committed himself to something. “I thought you might be interested to know that Daisy is

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces a lengthy, repetitive, and irrelevant section about the World’s Fair that is not present in the original passage. This invented content dominates the latter part of the completion and disrupts the narrative flow.\n- Several invented scenes and dialogue exchanges between train passengers appear, including references to a Japanese lantern, a trip to the World’s Fair, and additional characters and actions not found in the original.\n- The completion omits the original’s important reflective commentary and the narrator’s internal thoughts about the upcoming lunch and the emotional tension surrounding it.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the narrator’s sense of foreboding and speculation about the possibility of a dramatic confrontation, which is a key part of the original’s early section.\n- The description of the oppressive heat and its sensory details, such as the train emerging from a tunnel and the specific sounds and sensations, are either missing or replaced with unrelated details.\n- The original’s depiction of the train environment, including the conductor’s remarks and the narrator’s observations about the heat’s effect on people, is not accurately represented.\n- The subtle social dynamics and the narrator’s feelings of suspicion from others after returning the woman’s pocketbook are not fully captured.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered, with invented actions and dialogue inserted before and after the actual events of the train ride.\n- The timing and setting details are inaccurate, such as the train waiting at a station instead of emerging from a tunnel, and the invented references to the World’s Fair and other locations.\n- The actions and reactions of the passengers, including the woman’s behavior and the man’s comments, do not align with the original events.\n- The completion omits the original’s closing reflection on the indifference of people in the heat, which is a significant thematic element.\n\nTo improve, focus on accurately capturing the sequence of events, the narrator’s internal reflections, the sensory details of the setting, and avoid introducing invented scenes or repetitive content."

In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the common store of life.\nThe room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols weighing down their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.\n“We can’t move,” they said together.\nJordan’s fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment in mine.\n“And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?” I inquired.\nSimultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall telephone.\nGatsby stood in the centre of the crimson carpet and gazed around with fascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting laugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.\n“The rumour is,” whispered Jordan, “that that’s Tom’s girl on the telephone.”\nWe were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance: “Very well, then, I won’t sell you the car at all… I’m under no obligations to you at all… and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time, I won’t stand that at all!”\n“Holding down the receiver,” said Daisy cynically.\n“No, he’s not,” I assured her. “It’s a bona-fide deal. I happen to know about it.”\nTom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his thick body, and hurried into the room.\n“Mr. Gatsby!” He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed dislike. “I’m glad to see you, sir… Nick…”\n“Make us a cold drink,” cried Daisy.\nAs he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and pulled his face down, kissing him on the mouth.\n“You know I love you,” she murmured.\n“You forget there’s a lady present,” said Jordan.\nDaisy looked around doubtfully.\n“You kiss Nick too.”\n“What a low, vulgar girl!”\n“I don’t care!” cried Daisy, and began to clog on the brick fireplace. Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.\n“Bles-sed pre-cious,” she crooned, holding out her arms. “Come to your own mother that loves you.”\nThe child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and rooted shyly into her mother’s dress.\n“The bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy hair? Stand up now, and say—How-de-do.”\nGatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand. Afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise. I don’t think he had ever really believed in its existence before.\n“I got dressed before luncheon,” said the child, turning eagerly to Daisy.\n“That’s because your mother wanted to show you off.” Her face bent into the single wrinkle of the small white neck. “You dream, you. You absolute little dream.”\n“Yes,” admitted the child calmly. “Aunt Jordan’s got on a white dress too.”\n“How do you like mother’s friends?” Daisy turned her around so that she faced Gatsby. “Do you think they’re pretty?”\n“Where’s Daddy?”\n“She doesn’t look like her father,” explained Daisy. “She looks like me. She’s got my hair and shape of the face.”\nDaisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took a step forward and held out her hand.\n“Come, Pammy.”\n“Goodbye, sweetheart!”\nWith a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to her nurse’s hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back, preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.",

            "prefix-probing": "... Through the hall of the Buchanans’ house blew a faint wind, carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at the door. I went in. The house was dark and silent, save for the distant murmur of voices. I found them in the kitchen, sitting opposite each other at the scrubbed table. A plate of cold fried chicken was between them, with a bottle of ale. They weren't happy, and neither of them was crying. There was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about them, a deep complicity that went beyond any momentary quarrel. They were conspiring together. I saw the essential, indestructible nature of their union. It was a bond forged in wealth and carelessness, a shared history of privilege and indifference. I stood there for a moment, unseen, feeling a profound sense of revulsion. I knew I couldn't stay. I backed out quietly, through the dining-room, through the hall, and out the front door. Gatsby was still there, a dark, solitary shape against the lighter background of the drive. He turned as I came out. \"Is everything all right?\" he asked, his voice low and anxious. \"Yes,\" I said. \"They're all right. They're sitting at the kitchen table.\" \"Did she tell him anything? About us?\" \"I don't think so, old sport. They were just talking.\" He seemed relieved, but his eyes were still fixed on the house. \"I'm going to wait here,\" he said. \"Just in case she needs me. You go on home, old sport.\" \"Gatsby,\" I said, \"you can't stay here all night. What if he comes out?\" \"He won't,\" Gatsby said with certainty. \"I'll be right here. If he tries to bother her, I'll be here.\" I knew there was nothing more I could do. My role was finished. I had seen the truth inside, the impenetrable fortress of their shared world. Gatsby, with his naive, persistent hope, was still outside, believing he could somehow breach it. I looked back at the house, then at Gatsby. He was standing motionless, his eyes fixed on the upper windows, waiting for a sign that would never come. The wind rustled the leaves in the trees overhead. The night was cool and quiet, a stark contrast to the chaos of the afternoon. I felt a great weariness settle over me. I wanted to be away from them all, away from the East, with its distorted values and its destructive people. But I couldn't leave Gatsby like that. Not yet. \"I'll stay with you for a bit,\" I offered, though I knew it was futile. \"No, old sport. Go on home. Get some sleep. I'll be fine.\" His voice was gentle but firm. He was determined to keep his vigil. I hesitated, then turned towards my own house. As I walked away, I glanced back. Gatsby was still there, a figure of pure, unwavering devotion, silhouetted against the faint light from the house. He was watching over nothing, guarding a dream that was already dead. He was the single, most hopeful figure I had ever known, and now he was reduced to this lonely, desperate watch. The telephone bell had stopped ringing. The house was silent again, holding its secrets within its walls. I walked on, leaving him alone in the darkness, a sentinel of a lost cause. The air grew colder. The stars seemed distant and indifferent. I thought of the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning— So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past. Gatsby stood there, a monument to a single, unattainable desire, while the world he chased moved on, leaving him stranded in the night. His vigil was a testament to a faith that refused to die, even when its object was lost forever within the secure, careless world of the Buchanans.",

On the green Sound, stagnant in the heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea.

Slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and the abounding blessed isles.\n“There’s sport for you,” said Tom, nodding. “I’d like to be out there with him for about an hour.”\nWe had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat, and drank down nervous gaiety with the cold ale.\n“What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon?” cried Daisy, “and the day after that, and the next thirty years?”\n“Don’t be morbid,” Jordan said. “Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.”\n“But it’s so hot,” insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, “and everything’s so confused. Let’s all go to town!”\nHer voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding its senselessness into forms.\n“I’ve heard of making a garage out of a stable,” Tom was saying to Gatsby, “but I’m the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage.”\n“Who wants to go to town?” demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby’s eyes floated toward her. “Ah,” she cried, “you look so cool.”\nTheir eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space. With an effort she glanced down at the table.\n“You always look so cool,” she repeated.\nShe had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was astounded. His mouth opened a little, and he looked at Gatsby, and then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as someone he knew a long time ago.\n“You resemble the advertisement of the man,” she went on innocently. “You know the advertisement of the man—”\n“All right,” broke in Tom quickly, “I’m perfectly willing to go to town. Come on—we’re all going to town.”\nHe got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife. No one moved.\n“Come on!” His temper cracked a little. “What’s the matter, anyhow? If we’re going to town, let’s start.”\nHis hand, trembling with his effort at self-control, bore to his lips the last of his glass of ale. Daisy’s voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive.\n“Are we just going to go?” she objected. “Like this? Aren’t we going to let anyone smoke a cigarette first?”\n“Everybody smoked all through lunch.”\n“Oh, let’s have fun,” she begged him. “It’s too hot to fuss.”\nHe didn’t answer.\n“Have it your own way,” she said. “Come on, Jordan.”\nThey went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky. Gatsby started to speak, changed his mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.\n“Have you got your stables here?” asked Gatsby with an effort.\n“About a quarter of a mile down the road.”\n“Oh.”\nA pause.\n“I don’t see the idea of going to town,” broke out Tom savagely. “Women get these notions in their heads—”\n“Shall we take anything to drink?” called Daisy from an upper window.\n“I’ll get some whisky,” answered Tom. He went inside.\nGatsby turned to me rigidly:\n“I can’t say anything in his house, old sport.”\n“She’s got an indiscreet voice,” I remarked. “It’s full of—” I hesitated.\n“Her voice is full of money,” he said suddenly.\nThat was it. I’d never understood before. It was full of money—that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals’ song of it… High in a white palace the king’s daughter, the golden girl…\nTom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and carrying light capes over their arms.\n“Shall we all go in my car?” suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, green leather of the seat. “I ought to have left it in the shade.”\n“Is it standard shift?” demanded Tom.\n“Yes.”\n“Well, you take my coupé and let me drive your car to town.”",

            "prefix-probing": "Gatsby took up his drink. He held it loosely, a pale gold liquid in a fragile glass, and his eyes, which had been fixed on the distant, shimmering lights across the bay, returned slowly to the swirling chaos of his own lawn. The music, a frantic jazz, pulsed through the humid night air, mingling with the high, excited laughter of hundreds of people he barely knew. They were everywhere – spilling out of the house onto the terraces, clustered around the buffet tables laden with glistening hams and salads, dancing with a wild, careless abandon on the polished floor of the ballroom.He watched them, a solitary figure on the edge of the revelry, a host who seemed more like a spectator. There was a profound loneliness in his posture, a stillness that set him apart from the frenetic energy surrounding him. He smiled, that famous, understanding smile, at a passing group, but it didn't quite reach his eyes. They remained watchful, searching, as if looking for something – or someone – who wasn't there, or perhaps who was there but remained just out of reach.The rumors about him circulated like wildfire through the crowd. He was a German spy. He had killed a man. He was a bootlegger, a nephew of Kaiser Wilhelm, a man who had sprung from nowhere with ill-gotten gains. Each story added another layer to the enigma, another piece to the puzzle that no one could quite solve. And Gatsby, standing there with his drink, seemed to absorb it all, letting the myths build around him, perhaps even encouraging them in some silent, inscrutable way.He took a small sip of his drink, the ice clinking softly against the glass. The taste seemed distant, unimportant. His mind was elsewhere, perhaps five years in the past, perhaps just across the water. The present moment, this extravagant display of wealth and gaiety, felt like a carefully constructed stage set, beautiful and elaborate, but ultimately hollow without the presence that gave it meaning.He saw Nick Carraway making his way through the crowd, a look of bewildered fascination on his face. Nick was one of the few people here who seemed genuinely curious, genuinely trying to understand. Most others were simply there to consume, to bask in the reflected glow of Gatsby's wealth, to enjoy the free food and liquor and the intoxicating atmosphere of possibility. They were moths drawn to a flame, oblivious to the fire's true nature or the man who tended it.Gatsby nodded slightly to Nick, a silent acknowledgment across the throng. He appreciated Nick's quiet presence, his lack of judgment, his willingness to listen. Nick was a link, a bridge to a world Gatsby desperately wanted to reclaim.He turned his gaze back towards the bay, towards the faint green light that pulsed at the end of Daisy's dock. It was a tiny point of light in the vast darkness, but to Gatsby, it was everything. It was the symbol of his dream, the culmination of years of striving, of building, of waiting. Every party, every lavish expenditure, every risk he had taken – it all led back to that light, to the hope of recapturing a moment in time, of erasing the past five years and starting over.The music swelled, a saxophone wailing a mournful, bluesy tune beneath the frantic rhythm. Couples spun past, their faces flushed with alcohol and excitement. A woman shrieked with laughter as she stumbled, caught by her partner. The air was thick with the scent of perfume, alcohol, and the damp earth of the garden.Gatsby finished his drink and set the glass down on a nearby table. He felt a familiar ache in his chest, a longing so profound it was almost physical. He had built this empire, this monument to his love, and yet, the object of his devotion remained elusive, separated by a gulf of time and circumstance.He straightened his tie, a gesture of quiet determination. He would not give up. He could not give up. The dream was too real, too vivid in his mind. He had come too far to fail now. He had transformed himself, shedding his past like an old skin, reinventing himself as Jay Gatsby, the man who could achieve anything. And achieving his dream meant winning back Daisy.He began to move through the crowd, a polite smile fixed on his face, exchanging brief pleasantries, nodding to acquaintances. He moved with a certain grace, a quiet confidence that belied the turmoil within him. He was the perfect host, attentive and charming, making sure everyone was enjoying themselves, even as his own thoughts were miles away, across the water, in a house with a green light.He saw Daisy and Tom Buchanan arrive, their presence creating a subtle ripple through the crowd. Daisy, radiant and fragile, clinging to Tom's arm. Tom, solid and imposing, his eyes scanning the room with a proprietary air. Gatsby's heart gave a lurch. This was it. The moment he had been waiting for, preparing for, for so long.He watched them for a moment, a complex mixture of emotions playing across his face – hope, anxiety, a fierce protectiveness. He had to be careful. He had to play this right. Everything depended on it.He took a deep breath and began to walk towards them, a smile that was both genuine and carefully constructed on his lips. The music seemed to fade into the background, the noise of the party receding. All that mattered was Daisy. All that mattered was the dream.He reached them, his hand extended, his voice calm and steady. \"Hello, Daisy.\"Her eyes widened slightly, a flicker of surprise, then recognition. Tom's expression remained unreadable, a watchful intensity in his gaze.The conversation that followed was stilted, awkward, charged with unspoken history and tension. Gatsby tried to maintain his composure, to project an air of effortless charm, but he could feel the tremor in his hands, the pounding of his heart. This was not how he had imagined it. The reality was messier, more complicated than the perfect scenarios he had played out in his mind.He offered them drinks, introduced them to a few people, tried to draw Daisy into conversation. But she seemed hesitant, nervous, caught between the past and the present, between Gatsby and Tom. Tom, meanwhile, watched Gatsby with a thinly veiled suspicion, his questions pointed, his demeanor challenging.Gatsby felt the carefully constructed facade begin to crack. The dream, so vivid and tangible just moments before, seemed to recede, becoming once again a distant, unattainable light. He had built this entire world for her, and yet, here she was, standing beside the man who represented everything he despised, everything he was trying to escape.He excused himself briefly, needing a moment to compose himself. He walked away from the crowd, towards the quieter part of the garden, the cool night air a welcome relief against his flushed face. He looked back at the house, at the dazzling lights and the swirling figures within. It all felt like a mirage, beautiful but insubstantial.He had believed so implicitly in the power of his dream, in the idea that he could simply recreate the past through sheer force of will and wealth. But standing there, alone in the garden, he felt the weight of reality pressing down on him. The past was not something you could simply step back into. It was gone, irrevocably altered by time and experience.He heard footsteps behind him and turned to see Nick approaching. Nick's presence was a comfort, a reminder of the outside world, the world beyond the gilded cage of Gatsby's mansion. \"Everything alright, Gatsby?\" Nick asked, his voice quiet.Gatsby forced a smile. \"Yes, old sport. Just... taking a moment.\"He looked back at the house, at the distant figure of Daisy, still standing with Tom. The green light across the bay seemed dimmer now, less significant. The dream felt fragile, threatened by the harsh light of day, or rather, the harsh reality of the night.He knew, with a sudden, chilling certainty, that this was not going to be easy. The path to his dream was not a straight line, but a tangled, treacherous maze. And he was not sure he had the strength to navigate it. But he had to try. He had to keep fighting. For Daisy. For the dream. For everything he had built.He turned back to Nick, his smile fading, replaced by a look of quiet desperation. \"It's... it's going to be alright,\" he said, but his voice lacked conviction. He picked up his drink again, the ice long melted, the liquid warm and flat. He raised it slightly, not in a toast, but in a gesture of weary resignation. The party raged on around him, oblivious to the quiet battle being fought within the heart of its host. The night was still young, but the weight of years felt heavy on Gatsby's shoulders. The dream was still alive, but its light seemed to flicker, threatened by the encroaching darkness of reality. He took a sip, the taste bitter on his tongue. The long vigil had begun.",

              "simple_agent_extraction": "Gatsby took up his drink. “They certainly look cool,” he remarked, as soon as the question of the weather was disposed of. “Unlike a lot of these newly rich people you see to-day. I know your family.”\n“I don’t think I ever met your father.”\n“No.” He hesitated. “My father’s dead.” After a pause he added, “My whole family’s dead.”\n“I see.”\nThe butler brought back a little plate of cold fried chicken and four bottles of ale. “Daisy’s home,” commented Tom. “She’s been having a swell time, wherever she’s been. I can tell when Daisy’s blue by the way she moves around. Look at the candles!”\nCold fat candles stood in hot golden candlesticks, holding up bouquets of melting flowers. “I can’t stand this heat,” cried Daisy. “Everybody we know feels the same way. Mr. Gatsby, would you like a little cold drink?”\n“Thank you.”\n“We can’t move,” said Daisy with a helpless little laugh. “Not always.”\nAgain a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.\nThat was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals’ song of it. . . . High in a white palace the king’s daughter, the golden girl. . . .\nTom was talking intently across the table at Gatsby, his nostrils quivering. I felt the hot, sticky night close in on them, and my own instinct was to shrink away. I waited, and sure enough, in a moment she looked at him with an absolute, unqualified devotion. Her expression was curiously familiar—it was the kind of look that passes between husband and wife, after years of marriage—and for a moment I lost sight of Jordan and Daisy and the others. But with every word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave that up, and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room.\nThe afternoon had made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them a deep breath before starting again. But now they were all restless again, and Daisy was getting ready to leave. “Are you sure you won’t come in, Tom?” she asked, as we stood on the porch. “I’m sure I won’t,” he answered shortly. “You two run along. We’ll follow in the coupé.”\nShe looked at him, and then at Gatsby, and then back at him, as if she had forgotten something. “Oh, all right,” she said. “Come on, Jordan.”\nThey went inside. Tom and Gatsby stood side by side on the porch, looking out at the hot, damp night. “I suppose you’ve got to make your house into a garage, after all,” said Tom. “Or else tear it down.”\n“I’ve got it all planned,” answered Gatsby. “I’m going to have a garage, and a stable, and a swimming-pool, and a private beach.”\n“That’s a lot of stuff,” said Tom. “I don’t see how you’re going to get it all in.”\n“I’ve got it all planned,” repeated Gatsby. “I’m going to have a garage, and a stable, and a swimming-pool, and a private beach.”\n“That’s a lot of stuff,” said Tom. “I don’t see how you’re

                "text": "Gatsby took up his drink. “They certainly look cool,” he remarked, as soon as the question of the weather was disposed of. “Unlike a lot of these newly rich people you see to-day. I know your family.”\n“I don’t think I ever met your father.”\n“No.” He hesitated. “My father’s dead.” After a pause he added, “My whole family’s dead.”\n“I see.”\nThe butler brought back a little plate of cold fried chicken and four bottles of ale. “Daisy’s home,” commented Tom. “She’s been having a swell time, wherever she’s been. I can tell when Daisy’s blue by the way she moves around. Look at the candles!”\nCold fat candles stood in hot golden candlesticks, holding up bouquets of melting flowers. “I can’t stand this heat,” cried Daisy. “Everybody we know feels the same way. Mr. Gatsby, would you like a little cold drink?”\n“Thank you.”\n“We can’t move,” said Daisy with a helpless little laugh. “Not always.”\nAgain a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.\nThat was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals’ song of it. . . . High in a white palace the king’s daughter, the golden girl. . . .\nTom was talking intently across the table at Gatsby, his nostrils quivering. I felt the hot, sticky night close in on them, and my own instinct was to shrink away. I waited, and sure enough, in a moment she looked at him with an absolute, unqualified devotion. Her expression was curiously familiar—it was the kind of look that passes between husband and wife, after years of marriage—and for a moment I lost sight of Jordan and Daisy and the others. But with every word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave that up, and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room.\nThe afternoon had made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them a deep breath before starting again. But now they were all restless again, and Daisy was getting ready to leave. “Are you sure you won’t come in, Tom?” she asked, as we stood on the porch. “I’m sure I won’t,” he answered shortly. “You two run along. We’ll follow in the coupé.”\nShe looked at him, and then at Gatsby, and then back at him, as if she had forgotten something. “Oh, all right,” she said. “Come on, Jordan.”\nThey went inside. Tom and Gatsby stood side by side on the porch, looking out at the hot, damp night. “I suppose you’ve got to make your house into a garage, after all,” said Tom. “Or else tear it down.”\n“I’ve got it all planned,” answered Gatsby. “I’m going to have a garage, and a stable, and a swimming-pool, and a private beach.”\n“That’s a lot of stuff,” said Tom. “I don’t see how you’re going to get it all in.”\n“I’ve got it all planned,” repeated Gatsby. “I’m going to have a garage, and a stable, and a swimming-pool, and a private beach.”\n“That’s a lot of stuff,” said Tom. “I don’t see how you’re

He looked at the gauge. “And if it runs out I can stop at a drugstore. You can buy anything at a drugstore nowadays.”\nA pause followed this apparently pointless remark. Daisy looked at Tom frowning, and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar and vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in words, passed over Gatsby’s face.\n“Come on, Daisy,” said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby’s car. “I’ll take you in this circus wagon.”\nHe opened the door, but she moved out from the circle of his arm.\n“You take Nick and Jordan. We’ll follow you in the coupé.”\nShe walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand. Jordan and Tom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby’s car, Tom pushed the unfamiliar gears tentatively, and we shot off into the oppressive heat, leaving them out of sight behind.\n“Did you see that?” demanded Tom.\n“See what?”\nHe looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must have known all along.\n“You think I’m pretty dumb, don’t you?” he suggested. “Perhaps I am, but I have a—almost a second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to do. Maybe you don’t believe that, but science—”\nHe paused. The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back from the edge of theoretical abyss.\n“I’ve made a small investigation of this fellow,” he continued. “I could have gone deeper if I’d known—”\n“Do you mean you’ve been to a medium?” inquired Jordan humorously.\n“What?” Confused, he stared at us as we laughed. “A medium?”\n“About Gatsby.”\n“About Gatsby! No, I haven’t. I said I’d been making a small investigation of his past.”\n“And you found he was an Oxford man,” said Jordan helpfully.\n“An Oxford man!” He was incredulous. “Like hell he is! He wears a pink suit.”\n“Nevertheless he’s an Oxford man.”\n“Oxford, New Mexico,” snorted Tom contemptuously, “or something like that.”\n“Listen, Tom. If you’re such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?” demanded Jordan crossly.\n“Daisy invited him; she knew him before we were married—God knows where!”\nWe were all irritable now with the fading ale, and aware of it we drove for a while in silence.",

Eckleburg’s faded eyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby’s caution about gasoline.\n“We’ve got enough to get us to town,” said Tom.\n“But there’s a garage right here,” objected Jordan. “I don’t want to get stalled in this baking heat.”\nTom threw on both brakes impatiently, and we slid to an abrupt dusty stop under Wilson’s sign. After a moment the proprietor emerged from the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.\n“Let’s have some gas!” cried Tom roughly. “What do you think we stopped for—to admire the view?”\n“I’m sick,” said Wilson without moving. “Been sick all day.”\n“What’s the matter?”\n“I’m all run down.”\n“Well, shall I help myself?” Tom demanded. “You sounded well enough on the phone.”\nWith an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and, breathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his face was green.\n“I didn’t mean to interrupt your lunch,” he said. “But I need money pretty bad, and I was wondering what you were going to do with your old car.”\n“How do you like this one?” inquired Tom. “I bought it last week.”\n“It’s a nice yellow one,” said Wilson, as he strained at the handle.\n“Like to buy it?”\n“Big chance,” Wilson smiled faintly. “No, but I could make some money on the other.”\n“What do you want money for, all of a sudden?”\n“I’ve been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and I want to go West.”\n“Your wife does,” exclaimed Tom, startled.\n“She’s been talking about it for ten years.” He rested for a moment against the pump, shading his eyes. “And now she’s going whether she wants to or not. I’m going to get her away.”\nThe coupé flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a waving hand.\n“What do I owe you?” demanded Tom harshly.\n“I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,” remarked Wilson. “That’s why I want to get away. That’s why I been bothering you about the car.”\n“What do I owe you?”\n“Dollar twenty.”\nThe relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had a bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadn’t alighted on Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world, and the shock had made him physically sick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour before—and it occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well. Wilson was so sick that he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty—as if he had just got some poor girl with child.\n“I’ll let you have that car,” said Tom.",

            "prefix-probing": "Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg’s faded eyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby’s caution about gasoline. There was a long, hard day ahead and if we were to make it to the city and back, we’d need a full tank. The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the traffic jams are insufferable. This was a place where ashes took the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and finally, with a transcendent effort, of men who moved dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. Occasionally a line of gray cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-gray men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud, which screens their obscure operations from your sight. But above the gray land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic—their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face, but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an advertising man had painted them there years ago, and then promptly sank down himself into eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days, under sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground. The only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, with a sort of compact Main Street ministering to it, and contiguous to absolutely nothing. One of the three shops it contained was a garage—repairs. The owner was a blond, spiritless man, anaemic, and faintly handsome. When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his light blue eyes. A white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinity—except his wife, who moved about the garage with a soft, languid (and, I thought, a perceptible) vitality. They were both in the middle thirties. George B. Wilson was his name, and he was one of the few men who had a garage on the motor-road—the only building in sight, with one exception, so long as the motor-road stretched in a thin gray line, bounded on one side by the railroad and on the other by a long stretch of dismal swamps. It was a hot day, and the air was thick with the smell of dust and gasoline. Wilson came forward, wiping his hands on a piece of cotton waste. “Hello, Wilson,” said Tom, his hand on my shoulder. “How’s business?” “I can’t complain,” answered Wilson unconvincingly. “When are you going to sell me that car?” asked Tom. “Next week; I’ve got my man working on it now,” said Wilson. “Works pretty slow, don’t he?” inquired Tom good-humoredly. “No, he doesn’t,” said Wilson quickly. “He’s an honest, hard-working man. I don’t understand why it isn’t done.” “Well, he’d better get a move on,” muttered Tom, with a glance at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, which had just emerged, pale and enormous, from the dissolving trees. “Come on, we’ll stop somewhere else. I’ve got to get some gas.” “I’m almost out myself,” said Wilson. “I’ve got to go to town to-morrow and get some more.” “Well, you’d better get a move on,” repeated Tom. “I’ll stop in on my way back and see how you’re getting on.” He turned to me. “Come on, Nick,” he said. “We’ll go to town.” I hesitated. “I’ve got nothing to do,” I said, “but I’d like to get some lunch.” “All right,” he said. “We’ll get some lunch in town.” He turned to Wilson. “I’ll be back,” he said. “Don’t worry about the car.” He got into the car and started the engine. Wilson stood there, looking after us, a forlorn figure in the dust. As we drove away, I saw Myrtle Wilson standing in the doorway of the garage, watching us. She had changed her dress to a dark blue crêpe-de-chine, which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her into the car. She had a fierce vitality that made her glow. Her face was smeared with grease and she was trying to wipe it off with a piece of cotton waste. “Hello, Myrtle,” said Tom. “How are you?” “I’m all right,” she said, her voice husky. “I’m going to town,” she added, looking at me. “I’ve got to get some things.” “All right,” said Tom. “We’ll go to town.” He started the car and we drove away, leaving Wilson standing in the dust. As we sped toward the city, the valley of ashes receded behind us, and the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg faded into the distance, still brooding over the desolate landscape.",

His eyes were small and close together, and they were the color of water.\n\n“I can’t get any gas,” he said. “I’m all out.”\n\n“You’re out?” Tom exclaimed. “What do you mean you’re out?”\n\n“I haven’t had any all day,” the man said. “I’m all out.”\n\n“Well, then, what are you going to do?” Tom demanded.\n\n“I don’t know,” the man said. “I’m all out.”\n\nHe looked at Tom with a kind of helpless despair.\n\n“I’ve been sick all day,” he said. “I’m all out.”\n\n“Well, then, what are you going to do?” Tom demanded again.\n\n“I don’t know,” the man said. “I’m all out.”\n\nHe looked at Tom with a kind of helpless despair.\n\n“I’ve been sick all day,” he said. “I’m all out.”\n\n“Well, then, what are you going to do?” Tom demanded again.\n\n“I don’t know,” the man said. “I’m all out.”\n\nHe looked at Tom with a kind of helpless despair.\n\n“I’ve been sick all day,” he said. “I’m all out.”\n\n“Well, then, what are you going to do?” Tom demanded again.\n\n“I don’t know,” the man said. “I’m all out.”\n\nHe looked at Tom with a kind of helpless despair.\n\n“I’ve been sick all day,” he said. “I’m all out.”\n\n“Well, then, what are you going to do?” Tom demanded again.\n\n“I don’t know,” the man said. “I’m all out.”\n\nHe looked at Tom with a kind of helpless despair.\n\n“I’ve been sick all day,” he said. “I’m all out.”\n\n“Well, then, what are you going to do?” Tom demanded again.\n\n“I don’t know,” the man said. “I’m all out.”\n\nHe looked at Tom with a kind of helpless despair.\n\n“I’ve been sick all day,” he said. “I’m all out.”\n\n“Well, then, what are you going to do?” Tom demanded again.\n\n“I don’t know,” the man said. “I’m all out.”\n\nHe looked at Tom with a kind of helpless despair.\n\n“I’ve been sick all day,” he said. “I’m all out.”\n\n“Well, then, what are you going to do?” Tom demanded again.\n\n“I don’t know,” the man said. “I’m all out.”\n\nHe looked at Tom with a kind of helpless despair.\n\n“I’ve been sick all day,” he said. “I’m all out.”\n\n“Well, then, what are you going to do?” Tom demanded again.\n\n“I don’t know,” the man said. “I’m all out.”\n\nHe looked at Tom with a kind of helpless despair.\n\n“I’ve been sick all day,” he said. “I’m all out.”\n\n“Well, then, what are you going to do?” Tom",

His eyes were small and close together, and they were the color of water.\n\n“I can’t get any gas,” he said. “I’m all out.”\n\n“You’re out?” Tom exclaimed. “What do you mean you’re out?”\n\n“I haven’t had any all day,” the man said. “I’m all out.”\n\n“Well, then, what are you going to do?” Tom demanded.\n\n“I don’t know,” the man said. “I’m all out.”\n\nHe looked at Tom with a kind of helpless despair.\n\n“I’ve been sick all day,” he said. “I’m all out.”\n\n“Well, then, what are you going to do?” Tom demanded again.\n\n“I don’t know,” the man said. “I’m all out.”\n\nHe looked at Tom with a kind of helpless despair.\n\n“I’ve been sick all day,” he said. “I’m all out.”\n\n“Well, then, what are you going to do?” Tom demanded again.\n\n“I don’t know,” the man said. “I’m all out.”\n\nHe looked at Tom with a kind of helpless despair.\n\n“I’ve been sick all day,” he said. “I’m all out.”\n\n“Well, then, what are you going to do?” Tom demanded again.\n\n“I don’t know,” the man said. “I’m all out.”\n\nHe looked at Tom with a kind of helpless despair.\n\n“I’ve been sick all day,” he said. “I’m all out.”\n\n“Well, then, what are you going to do?” Tom demanded again.\n\n“I don’t know,” the man said. “I’m all out.”\n\nHe looked at Tom with a kind of helpless despair.\n\n“I’ve been sick all day,” he said. “I’m all out.”\n\n“Well, then, what are you going to do?” Tom demanded again.\n\n“I don’t know,” the man said. “I’m all out.”\n\nHe looked at Tom with a kind of helpless despair.\n\n“I’ve been sick all day,” he said. “I’m all out.”\n\n“Well, then, what are you going to do?” Tom demanded again.\n\n“I don’t know,” the man said. “I’m all out.”\n\nHe looked at Tom with a kind of helpless despair.\n\n“I’ve been sick all day,” he said. “I’m all out.”\n\n“Well, then, what are you going to do?” Tom demanded again.\n\n“I don’t know,” the man said. “I’m all out.”\n\nHe looked at Tom with a kind of helpless despair.\n\n“I’ve been sick all day,” he said. “I’m all out.”\n\n“Well, then, what are you going to do?” Tom demanded again.\n\n“I don’t know,” the man said. “I’m all out.”\n\nHe looked at Tom with a kind of helpless despair.\n\n“I’ve been sick all day,” he said. “I’m all out.”\n\n“Well, then, what are you going to do?” Tom",

          "text_segment": "That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of something behind. Over the ash-heaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil, but I perceived, after a moment, that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away.\nIn one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little, and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car. So engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed, and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture. Her expression was curiously familiar—it was an expression I had often seen on women’s faces, but on Myrtle Wilson’s face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on Jordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife.\nThere is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping precipitately from his control. Instinct made him step on the accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in sight of the easygoing blue coupé.\n“Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,” suggested Jordan. “I love New York on summer afternoons when everyone’s away. There’s something very sensuous about it—overripe, as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands.”\nThe word “sensuous” had the effect of further disquieting Tom, but before he could invent a protest the coupé came to a stop, and Daisy signalled us to draw up alongside.\n“Where are we going?” she cried.\n“How about the movies?”\n“It’s so hot,” she complained. “You go. We’ll ride around and meet you after.” With an effort her wit rose faintly. “We’ll meet you on some corner. I’ll be the man smoking two cigarettes.”\n“We can’t argue about it here,” Tom said impatiently, as a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind us. “You follow me to the south side of Central Park, in front of the Plaza.”\nSeveral times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight. I think he was afraid they would dart down a side-street and out of his life forever.\nBut they didn’t. And we all took the less explicable step of engaging the parlour of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.\nThe prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into that room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in the course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back. The notion originated with Daisy’s suggestion that we hire five bathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as “a place to have a mint julep.” Each of us said over and over that it was a “crazy idea”—we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought, or pretended to think, that we were being very funny…\nThe room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four o’clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from the Park. Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us, fixing her hair.\n“It’s a swell suite,” whispered Jordan respectfully, and everyone laughed.\n“Open another window,” commanded Daisy, without turning around.\n“There aren’t any more.”\n“Well, we’d better telephone for an axe—”\n“The thing to do is to forget about the heat,” said Tom impatiently. “You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it.”\nHe unrolled the bottle of whisky from the towel and put it on the table.\n“Why not let her alone, old sport?” remarked Gatsby. “You’re the one that wanted to come to town.”\nThere was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered, “Excuse me”—but this time no one laughed.\n“I’ll pick it up,” I offered.\n“I’ve got it.” Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered “Hum!” in an interested way, and tossed the book on a chair.\n“That’s a great expression of yours, isn’t it?” said Tom sharply.\n“What is?”\n“All this ‘old sport’ business. Where’d you pick that up?”\n“Now see here, Tom,” said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, “if you’re going to make personal remarks I won’t stay here a minute. Call up and order some ice for the mint julep.”\nAs Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn’s Wedding March from the ballroom below.\n“Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!” cried Jordan dismally.\n“Still—I was married in the middle of June,” Daisy remembered. “Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?”\n“Biloxi,” he answered shortly.\n“A man named Biloxi. ‘Blocks’ Biloxi, and he made boxes—that’s a fact—and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.”\n“They carried him into my house,” appended Jordan, “because we lived just two doors from the church. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy told him he had to get out. The day after he left Daddy died.” After a moment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent, “There wasn’t any connection.”\n“I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,” I remarked.\n“That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he left. He gave me an aluminium putter that I use today.”",

              "simple_agent_extraction": "That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of something behind. About half way between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley of ashes—a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and finally, with a transcendent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. Occasionally a line of gray cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-gray men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud which screens their obscure operations from your sight. But above the gray land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic—their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face, but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a non-existent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself into eternal blindness or forgot them and moved away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days under sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground. The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and, when the drawbridge is up to let a tug go through, the whole caravansary must wait for the black river to flow into the sea. The immediate association that came to me in the car was the white face of the obligatory oculist brooding over the solemn dumping ground. The only difference was that she was alive. He was alive, too, and stood beside me for a moment watching the sunlight on the brown blades of grass. Then he turned and got into the coupé and started the motor. I sat beside Daisy and she leaned against me, letting her hot hand rest on my knee. 'How about the movies?' suggested Miss Baker. 'Come on,' said Daisy. 'We'll go to the movies. Everybody thinks so.' 'But we can't go to the movies,' objected Tom quickly. 'She wants to see the movies,' whispered Daisy, as if she were afraid he might hear. 'No, we can't,' said Tom impatiently. 'We're going to town.' There was a long silence on the scorching afternoon, a silence that was broken only by the insistent beating of the coupé's motor and the soft, gray dust that blew in from the road. The coupé was close behind Gatsby's open car, and we overtook him on the road. 'Hello!' shouted Gatsby from a jump seat. 'Look at the dust!' I remarked. 'Isn't it terrible, old sport? But we've got seats in the shade.' He hadn't been talking to me. 'You look so cool,' she repeated. 'They told me you were in the navy in the war,' said Daisy to Gatsby. 'So I was, in the navy.' 'You look so cool,' she repeated. 'Tell me about the navy. We went to France, to that'—she hesitated—'that awful show at Château Thierry.' 'We saw you at the movies.' 'He looked at her now, a little preoccupied, as if he were a photographer arranging the light. The thing approached the proportions of a love affair. 'I love New York on summer afternoons,' said Jordan Baker. 'I love New York at night.' 'I love it too,' answered Gatsby. 'Good night, everybody,' called Daisy with sudden gayety. 'I think we'd better all go home.' 'It's his wife that's driving,' explained Tom to the policeman on the corner. 'I know all about it. We're going to town.' He turned around and spoke to us again. 'You can't just sit there,' he said. 'We've got to do something.' 'We can't do anything,' said Daisy. 'We've got to do something,' repeated Tom. 'We've got to do something.' 'We can't do anything,' said Daisy. 'We've got to do something,' repeated Tom. 'We've got to do something.' 'We can't do anything,' said Daisy. 'We've got to do something,' repeated Tom.

                "text": "That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of something behind. About half way between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley of ashes—a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and finally, with a transcendent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. Occasionally a line of gray cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-gray men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud which screens their obscure operations from your sight. But above the gray land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic—their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face, but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a non-existent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself into eternal blindness or forgot them and moved away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days under sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground. The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and, when the drawbridge is up to let a tug go through, the whole caravansary must wait for the black river to flow into the sea. The immediate association that came to me in the car was the white face of the obligatory oculist brooding over the solemn dumping ground. The only difference was that she was alive. He was alive, too, and stood beside me for a moment watching the sunlight on the brown blades of grass. Then he turned and got into the coupé and started the motor. I sat beside Daisy and she leaned against me, letting her hot hand rest on my knee. 'How about the movies?' suggested Miss Baker. 'Come on,' said Daisy. 'We'll go to the movies. Everybody thinks so.' 'But we can't go to the movies,' objected Tom quickly. 'She wants to see the movies,' whispered Daisy, as if she were afraid he might hear. 'No, we can't,' said Tom impatiently. 'We're going to town.' There was a long silence on the scorching afternoon, a silence that was broken only by the insistent beating of the coupé's motor and the soft, gray dust that blew in from the road. The coupé was close behind Gatsby's open car, and we overtook him on the road. 'Hello!' shouted Gatsby from a jump seat. 'Look at the dust!' I remarked. 'Isn't it terrible, old sport? But we've got seats in the shade.' He hadn't been talking to me. 'You look so cool,' she repeated. 'They told me you were in the navy in the war,' said Daisy to Gatsby. 'So I was, in the navy.' 'You look so cool,' she repeated. 'Tell me about the navy. We went to France, to that'—she hesitated—'that awful show at Château Thierry.' 'We saw you at the movies.' 'He looked at her now, a little preoccupied, as if he were a photographer arranging the light. The thing approached the proportions of a love affair. 'I love New York on summer afternoons,' said Jordan Baker. 'I love New York at night.' 'I love it too,' answered Gatsby. 'Good night, everybody,' called Daisy with sudden gayety. 'I think we'd better all go home.' 'It's his wife that's driving,' explained Tom to the policeman on the corner. 'I know all about it. We're going to town.' He turned around and spoke to us again. 'You can't just sit there,' he said. 'We've got to do something.' 'We can't do anything,' said Daisy. 'We've got to do something,' repeated Tom. 'We've got to do something.' 'We can't do anything,' said Daisy. 'We've got to do something,' repeated Tom. 'We've got to do something.' 'We can't do anything,' said Daisy. 'We've got to do something,' repeated Tom.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces a lengthy and detailed description of a location that is not present in the original passage, including invented scenes and background about the area and its features. This section is out of place and does not match the events or focus of the original excerpt.\n- The completion omits the entire sequence involving the observation of Myrtle Wilson, her emotional reaction, and the mistaken identity, which is a key part of the original.\n- The completion fails to include the transition from the drive to the hotel, the decision-making process about where to go, and the subsequent arrival at the hotel suite, all of which are central to the original passage.\n- The completion does not include the group’s interactions in the hotel suite, the discussion about the heat, the mention of the mint julep, or the recollections about Biloxi, which are significant narrative elements in the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the depiction of the characters’ emotional states and interpersonal tensions, especially Tom’s panic and the shifting dynamics between the characters as they travel.\n- There is no mention of the specific actions and dialogue that occur during the car journey, such as the pursuit of Daisy’s car, the traffic interactions, and Tom’s attempts to maintain control.\n- The completion omits the group’s arrival at the hotel, their conversation with the clerk, and the physical discomforts experienced by the narrator.\n- The completion does not include the detailed dialogue and character interactions in the hotel suite, including the discussion about the heat, the mint julep, and the humorous and tense exchanges among the group.\n- The recollection about Biloxi and the related family anecdotes are entirely missing.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion presents an inaccurate sequence of events, focusing on a description of the setting rather than the character-driven narrative of the original.\n- There are invented actions and dialogue, such as Daisy and Tom repeatedly debating about what to do, which do not occur in the original passage.\n- The completion misattributes actions and dialogue, assigning lines and behaviors to characters that are not present in the original excerpt.\n- The completion fails to accurately represent the timing and progression of events, such as the transition from the car journey to the hotel suite and the specific time of day mentioned in the original.\n- The completion introduces repetitive and irrelevant dialogue that does not reflect the actual interactions or tone of the original passage."

He was a friend of Daisy’s.”\n“He was not,” she denied. “I’d never seen him before. He came down in the private car.”\n“Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville. Asa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room for him.”\nJordan smiled.\n“He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of your class at Yale.”\nTom and I looked at each other blankly.\n“Biloxi?”\n“First place, we didn’t have any president—”\nGatsby’s foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.\n“By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you’re an Oxford man.”\n“Not exactly.”\n“Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.”\n“Yes—I went there.”\nA pause. Then Tom’s voice, incredulous and insulting:\n“You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven.”\nAnother pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but the silence was unbroken by his “thank you” and the soft closing of the door. This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.\n“I told you I went there,” said Gatsby.\n“I heard you, but I’d like to know when.”\n“It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That’s why I can’t really call myself an Oxford man.”\nTom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. But we were all looking at Gatsby.\n“It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the armistice,” he continued. “We could go to any of the universities in England or France.”\nI wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one of those renewals of complete faith in him that I’d experienced before.\nDaisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.\n“Open the whisky, Tom,” she ordered, “and I’ll make you a mint julep. Then you won’t seem so stupid to yourself… Look at the mint!”\n“Wait a minute,” snapped Tom, “I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question.”\n“Go on,” Gatsby said politely.\n“What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?”\nThey were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.\n“He isn’t causing a row,” Daisy looked desperately from one to the other. “You’re causing a row. Please have a little self-control.”\n“Self-control!” repeated Tom incredulously. “I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife. Well, if that’s the idea you can count me out… Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next they’ll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white.”\nFlushed with his impassioned gibberish, he saw himself standing alone on the last barrier of civilization.\n“We’re all white here,” murmured Jordan.\n“I know I’m not very popular. I don’t give big parties. I suppose you’ve got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any friends—in the modern world.”\nAngry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened his mouth. The transition from libertine to prig was so complete.\n“I’ve got something to tell you, old sport—” began Gatsby. But Daisy guessed at his intention.\n“Please don’t!” she interrupted helplessly. “Please let’s all go home. Why don’t we all go home?”\n“That’s a good idea,” I got up. “Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.”\n“I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.”\n“Your wife doesn’t love you,” said Gatsby. “She’s never loved you. She loves me.”\n“You must be crazy!” exclaimed Tom automatically.\nGatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.\n“She never loved you, do you hear?” he cried. “She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone except me!”\nAt this point Jordan and I tried to go, but Tom and Gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that we remain—as though neither of them had anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emotions.\n“Sit down, Daisy,” Tom’s voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal note. “What’s been going on? I want to hear all about it.”\n“I told you what’s been going on,” said Gatsby. “Going on for five years—and you didn’t know.”\nTom turned to Daisy sharply.\n“You’ve been seeing this fellow for five years?”\n“Not seeing,” said Gatsby. “No, we couldn’t meet. But both of us loved each other all that time, old sport, and you didn’t know. I used to laugh sometimes”—but there was no laughter in his eyes—“to think that you didn’t know.”\n“Oh—that’s all.” Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman and leaned back in his chair.\n“You’re crazy!” he exploded. “I can’t speak about what happened five years ago, because I didn’t know Daisy then—and I’ll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door. But all the rest of that’s a God damned lie. Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now.”\n“No,” said Gatsby, shaking his head.\n“She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her head and doesn’t know what she’s doing.” He nodded sagely. “And what’s more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time.”\n“You’re revolting,” said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice, dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: “Do you know why we left Chicago? I’m surprised that they didn’t treat you to the story of that little spree.”\nGatsby walked over and stood beside her.\n“Daisy, that’s all over now,” he said earnestly. “It doesn’t matter any more. Just tell him the truth—that you never loved him—and it’s all wiped out forever.”\nShe looked at him blindly. “Why—how could I love him—possibly?”\n“You never loved him.”\nShe hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal, as though she realized at last what she was doing—and as though she had never, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done now. It was too late.\n“I never loved him,” she said, with perceptible reluctance.\n“Not at Kapiolani?” demanded Tom suddenly.\n“No.”\nFrom the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up on hot waves of air.\n“Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry?” There was a husky tenderness in his tone… “Daisy?”\n“Please don’t.” Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it. She looked at Gatsby. “There, Jay,” she said—but her hand as she tried to light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette and the burning match on the carpet.\n“Oh, you want too much!” she cried to Gatsby. “I love you now—isn’t that enough? I can’t help what’s past.” She began to sob helplessly. “I did love him once—but I loved you too.”\nGatsby’s eyes opened and closed.\n“You loved me too?” he repeated.\n“Even that’s a lie,” said Tom savagely. “She didn’t know you were alive. Why—there’s things between Daisy and me that you’ll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget.”\nThe words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.\n“I want to speak to Daisy alone,” he insisted. “She’s all excited now—”\n“Even alone I can’t say I never loved Tom,” she admitted in a pitiful voice. “It wouldn’t be true.”\n“Of course it wouldn’t,” agreed Tom.\nShe turned to her husband.\n“As if it mattered to you,” she said.\n“Of course it matters. I’m going to take better care of you from now on.”\n“You don’t understand,” said Gatsby, with a touch of panic. “You’re not going to take care of her any more.”\n“I’m not?” Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to control himself now. “Why’s that?”\n“Daisy’s leaving you.”\n“Nonsense.”\n“I am, though,” she said with a visible effort.\n“She’s not leaving me!” Tom’s words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby. “Certainly not for a common swindler who’d have to steal the ring he put on her finger.”\n“I won’t stand this!” cried Daisy. “Oh, please let’s get out.”\n“Who are you, anyhow?” broke out Tom. “You’re one of that bunch that hangs around with Meyer Wolfshiem—that much I happen to know. I’ve made a little investigation into your affairs—and I’ll carry it further tomorrow.”\n“You can suit yourself about that, old sport,” said Gatsby steadily.\n“I found out what your ‘drugstores’ were.” He turned to us and spoke rapidly. “He and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of side-street drugstores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter. That’s one of his little stunts. I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw him, and I wasn’t far wrong.”\n“What about it?” said Gatsby politely. “I guess your friend Walter Chase wasn’t too proud to come in on it.”\n“And you left him in the lurch, didn’t you? You let him go to jail for a month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the subject of you.”\n“He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old sport.”\n“Don’t you call me ‘old sport’!” cried Tom. Gatsby said nothing. “Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but Wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth.”\nThat unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby’s face.\n“That drugstore business was just small change,” continued Tom slowly, “but you’ve got something on now that Walter’s afraid to tell me about.”\nI glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her husband, and at Jordan, who had begun to balance an invisible but absorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back to Gatsby—and was startled at his expression. He looked—and this is said in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden—as if he had “killed a man.” For a moment the set of his face could be described in just that fantastic way.\nIt passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been made. But with every word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave that up, and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room.\nThe voice begged again to go.",

            "prefix-probing": "The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of “Yea—ea—ea!” and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began. The air, thick with the scent of gardenias and expensive perfume, seemed to vibrate with a sudden, unleashed energy. It was a sound that promised release, a temporary suspension of the rigid formalities that had governed the preceding hour. Couples, flushed and eager, spilled onto the polished floor, their movements initially tentative, then bolder as the rhythm took hold. The band, a brassy, exuberant ensemble, launched into a Charleston, its syncopated beat infectious, pulling even the most reserved guests into its orbit. Laughter, sharp and bright, mingled with the music, creating a joyous, almost frantic, symphony of celebration. Waiters, balancing trays laden with champagne flutes and glittering cocktails, weaved through the throng, their faces impassive amidst the revelry. The room, draped in silks and adorned with cascades of flowers, felt like a stage set for a grand, slightly unreal, performance. Chandeliers blazed overhead, casting a warm, golden light that softened the edges of the scene, making everyone look a little younger, a little more beautiful, a little less burdened by the weight of their own histories. It was a world built on illusion, on the careful cultivation of appearances, and tonight, the illusion was perfect. The bride, radiant in white lace, was swept onto the floor by her new husband, a figure of imposing physicality and casual confidence. They moved together with an easy grace that spoke of shared privilege, of a life lived without want or worry. Around them, the party swirled, a kaleidoscope of color and movement. Women in shimmering gowns, their jewels catching the light, laughed with men in crisp tuxedos, their conversations a low murmur beneath the music. It was a gathering of the privileged, the wealthy, the people who inhabited a world where money smoothed over every rough edge, where discomfort was a foreign concept. I watched from the periphery, a silent observer in this glittering tableau. There was a certain fascination in it, a hypnotic quality to the sheer scale of the opulence, the effortless extravagance. But there was also a sense of detachment, a feeling that I was looking through a pane of glass at a world I could observe but never truly inhabit. The gaiety felt forced, the laughter a little too loud, the smiles a little too fixed. It was as if everyone was playing a part, performing the role of the happy, carefree socialite. And perhaps they were. Perhaps the performance was the reality, the only reality that mattered in this rarefied atmosphere. The jazz band shifted tempo, moving into a slower, more languid tune. Couples drew closer, their movements becoming more intimate, more suggestive. The air grew warmer, heavier, charged with a subtle current of desire and unspoken longing. I saw faces flushed with alcohol and emotion, eyes meeting across the crowded floor, brief, intense connections forming and dissolving in the swirling mass of bodies. It was a world of fleeting pleasures, of transient affections, where relationships seemed as fluid and changeable as the music itself. I thought of the stories I had heard, the whispers and rumors that circulated through this society like a contagious disease. Stories of affairs, of betrayals, of broken promises. They were the undercurrent beneath the polished surface, the hidden cracks in the gilded facade. And watching these people dance, laugh, and flirt, it was easy to see how those stories came to be. There was a restlessness about them, a perpetual search for something more, something new, something that might fill the emptiness that seemed to lie beneath the surface of their lives. They had everything, and yet they seemed constantly unsatisfied, constantly seeking the next thrill, the next distraction. It was a peculiar paradox, one that I found both intriguing and disturbing. The night wore on, the music growing louder, the dancing more frenzied. The initial elegance of the scene began to fray at the edges. Ties were loosened, hair became disheveled, laughter grew coarser. The veneer of sophistication began to crack, revealing something wilder, more primal, beneath. It was the release of pent-up energy, the shedding of inhibitions that had been carefully maintained throughout the day. The party was reaching its peak, a crescendo of noise and movement and intoxication. I saw people stumble, their balance lost to the combined effects of alcohol and exhaustion. Arguments flared up and died down just as quickly, forgotten in the general chaos. It was a scene of controlled abandon, a carefully orchestrated descent into revelry. But even in the midst of the chaos, there was a sense of order, a sense that this was how things were meant to be. This was the ritual of their lives, the cycle of formality and release, of constraint and excess. It was a pattern that repeated itself endlessly, a dance that never truly ended. I found myself drawn into conversations, pulled into the eddying currents of the party. People spoke of trivial things, of summer plans, of mutual acquaintances, of the latest scandals. Their words were light and airy, devoid of any real substance. It was a language of surfaces, a way of communicating without revealing anything of importance. I felt a strange sense of isolation even as I was surrounded by people. Their world was not my world, their concerns were not my concerns. I was an outsider looking in, a spectator at a play in which I had no part. And yet, there was a part of me that was drawn to it, to the glamour, the excitement, the sheer vitality of it all. It was a world that promised something, something elusive and undefined, but something that felt important. It was the promise of belonging, perhaps, or the promise of understanding, of finally grasping the secret of their effortless existence. But the more I observed, the less I understood. Their lives seemed to be built on contradictions, on a foundation of wealth and privilege that somehow failed to bring them happiness. They were like beautiful, fragile objects, polished and perfect on the outside, but hollow within. The music changed again, a slow, mournful saxophone solo drifting through the air. It was a sound that seemed to speak of longing, of regret, of the things that were lost or never found. It was a counterpoint to the earlier exuberance, a reminder that even in the midst of celebration, there was a deeper current of sadness running beneath the surface. I saw a woman weeping quietly in a corner, her face hidden in her hands. No one seemed to notice, or perhaps they chose not to. Her sorrow was a private matter, an unwelcome intrusion into the public display of happiness. It was a stark reminder that even in this world of privilege, there was pain, there was suffering. It was not a shield against the realities of life, merely a different way of experiencing them. The party continued its relentless pace, oblivious to the quiet moments of despair that flickered at its edges. The dancing grew wilder, the music louder, the laughter more unrestrained. It was a desperate attempt to outrun the darkness, to drown out the whispers of doubt and dissatisfaction. And for a time, it seemed to work. The sheer force of the revelry was overwhelming, sweeping everyone along in its wake. It was a collective act of denial, a refusal to acknowledge the emptiness that lay beneath the surface. I felt a growing weariness settle over me. The energy of the party was draining, its relentless gaiety exhausting. I longed for quiet, for solitude, for a moment to collect my thoughts and make sense of what I was witnessing. But there was no escape. The party was a vortex, pulling everyone deeper into its swirling depths. It was a world without pause, without reflection, a world of constant motion and fleeting sensation. And I was caught in its grip, an unwilling participant in a dance that felt both exhilarating and terrifying. The night air, cool and damp, offered a brief respite as I stepped onto a balcony overlooking the gardens. The sounds of the party were muffled here, a distant roar that seemed to belong to another world. Below, the gardens were bathed in moonlight, the flowers ghostly white against the dark green of the foliage. It was a scene of quiet beauty, a stark contrast to the frenetic energy of the ballroom. I took a deep breath, filling my lungs with the clean, cool air. It felt like a cleansing, a washing away of the artificiality and excess that had surrounded me. I looked up at the stars, their cold, distant light a reminder of the vastness of the universe, of the insignificance of the human drama unfolding below. And for a moment, the party, the wealth, the glittering facade, all seemed to shrink in importance. They were just fleeting moments in the grand sweep of time, brief flashes of light against an eternal darkness. But then the music swelled again, louder this time, pulling me back into the present. The party was still raging, its energy undiminished. And I knew that I could not escape it, not yet. I was bound to this world, to these people, by a strange mixture of fascination and repulsion. I wanted to understand them, to understand what drove them, what they were searching for. And so, I turned back towards the light, towards the noise, towards the dance. The air inside was thick and hot, the scent of perfume and alcohol even stronger than before. The faces of the dancers were flushed and sweaty, their eyes bright with a feverish intensity. It was a scene of raw, unbridled energy, a release of all the pent-up emotions and desires that lay beneath the polished surface of their lives. I saw a woman throw her head back and laugh, a wild, abandoned sound that cut through the music. I saw a man pull his partner close, their bodies pressed together in a desperate embrace. It was a dance of longing, of searching, of a desperate attempt to connect in a world that felt increasingly disconnected. And I was a part of it now, swept up in the current, moving with the rhythm of the music. I was no longer an observer, but a participant, caught in the intoxicating swirl of the party. The night was a blur of faces, of voices, of fleeting moments of connection and disconnection. It was a world of contradictions, of beauty and decay, of hope and despair. And as the night wore on, the lines between them began to blur, the distinctions becoming less clear. The party was a microcosm of their lives, a reflection of the world they inhabited. It was a world of endless possibility, but also a world of profound emptiness. And as the first hints of dawn began to appear in the sky, casting a pale light through the windows, the party began to wind down. The music grew softer, the dancing slower, the laughter more subdued. The energy that had fueled the night began to dissipate, leaving behind a sense of exhaustion and anticlimax. People began to drift away, their faces tired and drawn. The magic of the night was fading, replaced by the harsh reality of the morning. And as I stood there, watching the last of the guests depart, I felt a profound sense of sadness. It was the sadness of an ending, the sadness of a dream that had come to an end. But it was also the sadness of a world that seemed to be constantly searching for something it could never find. It was a world of beautiful illusions, but a world that ultimately failed to satisfy. And as the sun rose higher in the sky, casting its harsh light on the remnants of the party, I knew that I would never forget what I had seen. It was a glimpse into a world that was both fascinating and terrifying, a world that was built on wealth and privilege, but a world that was ultimately empty at its core. And as I walked away, leaving the silence and the stillness behind, I carried with me the memory of the music, the laughter, and the desperate, unending dance.",

Lot of young founders.” “I don’t think so,” said Tom gloomily. “There’s an old saying about the founders.” “An old saying? It’s a new one, at least I never heard it before.” “What has it got to do with anything?” demanded Daisy. “They’re all dead anyway,” said Jordan. “I think we’d better look around for some cold drink,” said Daisy. “What do you say, Tom?” “Make us a cold drink,” said Daisy. As he went out the door my eyes followed him for a moment, half expecting that Daisy was going to rush after him. But she didn’t. She moved close to Gatsby, looked up into his face and told him she loved him. “You see,” she cried, “you see I love you.” Gatsby looked at her in amazement. “You mean to say you’re not in love with Mr. Buchanan?” she asked. “I’m not in love with Mr. Buchanan,” she said. “I never was.” “You never were?” he asked. “Never,” she said. “Not for a minute.” She looked at him with a strange, wild look in her eyes. “I never loved him,” she repeated. “I never loved him.” Gatsby took her hand. “You see,” he said, “she never loved you.” “She never loved you,” echoed Daisy. “She never loved you.” Tom came back, carrying four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice. “Here’s your drinks,” he said. “What’s all this?” “She’s not in love with you,” said Gatsby. “She’s not in love with you.” “She never

                "text": "The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of “Yea—ea—ea!” and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began. “We’re getting old,” said Daisy. “If we lived in California, it would be different. Lot of young founders.” “I don’t think so,” said Tom gloomily. “There’s an old saying about the founders.” “An old saying? It’s a new one, at least I never heard it before.” “What has it got to do with anything?” demanded Daisy. “They’re all dead anyway,” said Jordan. “I think we’d better look around for some cold drink,” said Daisy. “What do you say, Tom?” “Make us a cold drink,” said Daisy. As he went out the door my eyes followed him for a moment, half expecting that Daisy was going to rush after him. But she didn’t. She moved close to Gatsby, looked up into his face and told him she loved him. “You see,” she cried, “you see I love you.” Gatsby looked at her in amazement. “You mean to say you’re not in love with Mr. Buchanan?” she asked. “I’m not in love with Mr. Buchanan,” she said. “I never was.” “You never were?” he asked. “Never,” she said. “Not for a minute.” She looked at him with a strange, wild look in her eyes. “I never loved him,” she repeated. “I never loved him.” Gatsby took her hand. “You see,” he said, “she never loved you.” “She never loved you,” echoed Daisy. “She never loved you.” Tom came back, carrying four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice. “Here’s your drinks,” he said. “What’s all this?” “She’s not in love with you,” said Gatsby. “She’s not in love with you.” “She never loved you,” said Daisy. “She never loved you.” Tom looked at them, his face hard. “What’s all this?” he repeated. “She’s not in love with you,” said Gatsby. “She never loved you.” “She never loved

Human sympathy has its limits, and we were content to let all their tragic arguments fade with the city lights behind. Thirty—the promise of a decade of loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning briefcase of enthusiasm, thinning hair. But there was Jordan beside me, who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten dreams from age to age. As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face fell lazily against my coat’s shoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand.\nSo we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight.",

You did, didn’t you?” He was forcing her hand, pushing her towards an impossible confession. The air crackled with the unspoken history between them, the years of marriage, the child, the shared life, however flawed. Gatsby watched her, his dream hanging precariously on her next words. His face was a mask of desperate hope, willing her to deny the past, to affirm only the five years they had lost. But the weight of reality, of the present, was crushing her. Her shoulders shook with sobs, and she couldn’t meet Gatsby’s pleading gaze. The moment stretched, agonizingly, until the truth, or at least a version of it, was wrung from her.",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces a lengthy, repetitive exchange about pearls that is not present in the original passage. This invented dialogue dominates the middle and end of the completion, displacing actual events and reflections from the source material.\n- Several invented scenes and lines are included, such as references to a platform, Daisy's supposed statements about Tom, and a focus on pearls, none of which occur in the original excerpt.\n- The completion omits the entire latter portion of the original, including the narrator's internal reflections, the transition to leaving the scene, and the significant thematic commentary on age and loneliness.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the depiction of the characters' emotional states and the subtle narrative distance that is present in the original, especially after Daisy and Gatsby leave.\n- There is no mention of the narrator's realization about his birthday, nor the introspective thoughts about entering a new decade and the associated feelings.\n- The transition to the car ride back to Long Island, the description of Tom's behavior, and the emotional distance between the characters during this ride are all missing.\n- The original's closing reflection on mortality and the symbolic journey \"toward death through the cooling twilight\" is absent.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion attributes actions and dialogue to characters that do not occur in the original, such as Daisy's supposed statements about Tom and the repeated insistence on seeing pearls.\n- The sequence of events is altered, with invented dialogue and scenes replacing the actual progression from confrontation to departure to introspection.\n- The emotional tone and focus are shifted, with the completion emphasizing invented conflict and repetition rather than the original's sense of isolation, resignation, and reflection."

He had slept through the heat until after five, when he strolled over to the garage, and found George Wilson sick in his office—really sick, pale as his own pale hair and shaking all over. Michaelis advised him to go to bed, but Wilson refused, saying that he’d miss a lot of business if he did. While his neighbour was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke out overhead.\n“I’ve got my wife locked in up there,” explained Wilson calmly. “She’s going to stay there till the day after tomorrow, and then we’re going to move away.”\nMichaelis was astonished; they had been neighbours for four years, and Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement. Generally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn’t working, he sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed along the road. When anyone spoke to him he invariably laughed in an agreeable, colourless way. He was his wife’s man and not his own.\nSo naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson wouldn’t say a word—instead he began to throw curious, suspicious glances at his visitor and ask him what he’d been doing at certain times on certain days. Just as the latter was getting uneasy, some workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant, and Michaelis took the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he didn’t. He supposed he forgot to, that’s all. When he came outside again, a little after seven, he was reminded of the conversation because he heard Mrs. Wilson’s voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in the garage.\n“Beat me!” he heard her cry. “Throw me down and beat me, you dirty little coward!”\nA moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and shouting—before he could move from his door the business was over.\nThe “death car” as the newspapers called it, didn’t stop; it came out of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, and then disappeared around the next bend. Mavro Michaelis wasn’t even sure of its colour—he told the first policeman that it was light green. The other car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark blood with the dust.\nMichaelis and this man reached her first, but when they had torn open her shirtwaist, still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap, and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped a little at the corners, as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long.",

            "prefix-probing": "The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the ash-heaps was the principal witness at the inquest. He was one of the few people who had been present during the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, having been roused from his sleep by the sound of the crash and the subsequent commotion. His small, dingy establishment, usually a quiet refuge for weary travelers and the inhabitants of the valley of ashes, became the focal point of the initial confusion and grief. Michaelis, a man of simple habits and a gentle nature, found himself thrust into a role he was ill-equipped to handle. He had seen Myrtle Wilson only moments before her death, arguing with her husband, George, in the garage. He had heard the rising tension in their voices, the desperate edge to George's pleas for her to stay. Then came the roar of the engine, the screech of tires, and the sickening thud that echoed across the desolate landscape. He was the first to reach the scene, his heart pounding with a nameless dread. He saw the crumpled figure on the road, the pool of blood spreading on the dust. He saw George Wilson, howling like a wounded animal, cradling his dead wife's head. Michaelis tried to help, tried to offer comfort, but his words were lost in the storm of George's anguish. He stayed with Wilson through the long night, listening to his incoherent ramblings, his desperate search for meaning in the senseless violence. Wilson was convinced that Myrtle had been running away from him, that the car was her lover's. He spoke of God, of the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg watching over the valley, seeing everything. Michaelis, a man of faith himself, tried to steer Wilson away from these dark thoughts, urging him to rest, to accept the terrible reality. But Wilson was beyond reach, consumed by his grief and a growing obsession with vengeance. At the inquest, Michaelis recounted everything he had seen and heard. He described the argument between George and Myrtle, the speed of the car, the immediate aftermath. He spoke of Wilson's state of mind, his conviction that the driver was the man Myrtle had been seeing. His testimony was crucial in establishing the timeline and the emotional context of the events leading up to the accident. He painted a picture of a marriage in turmoil, of a woman desperate to escape, and a man driven to the brink by suspicion and despair. Michaelis's quiet, factual account stood in stark contrast to the sensationalism that quickly surrounded the tragedy. He was a voice of simple truth in a world increasingly distorted by rumor and speculation. He saw the raw pain, the human cost, unvarnished by the layers of wealth and deceit that characterized the lives of those involved. His small coffee shop, usually a place of mundane transactions, became a temporary stage for the unfolding of a great American tragedy, witnessed by a humble Greek immigrant who could only watch and report what his honest eyes had seen.",

The man came out of the office holding a tin of lard, and Michaelis saw with a shock that he was sick—it was the first time Michaelis had ever seen him sick.

His wife, after attempting to laugh at him and failing, went upstairs to change her dress. \"Keep your hands off the lever,\" snapped Wilson. \"I'm getting to be a mechanic myself.\" \"You don't have to tell me what to do,\" she answered fiercely. \"None of us can stand the sight of you any more.\" \"She's going to stay there till the day after to-morrow,\" said Wilson. \"Then we're going to move away.\" \"Why're you going to move?\" \"To get away from it all. They won't be able to come any more.\" He stared dully at Michaelis, then suddenly asserted his wife's right to buy ten dogs if she pleased. \"I don't care if he buys ten dogs,\" interrupted Michaelis, \"as long as they don't fall on the sidewalk.\" \"An automobile passed here this afternoon and left dust all over the child.\" He looked out of the window at the sign of the oculist across the street. \"It was a yellow car,\" he said, \"a big yellow car.

I don't know how it got there.\" He looked at Michaelis, then at the picture. \"I'm going to find out who it was,\" he said. \"I'm going to find out who she was.\" He stared at the picture for a

He was a husky, reserved young man, inclined to reserve even in his unreserved conversations, and what he remembered was not to be questioned about. According to Michaelis, Wilson had been \"perfectly all right\" up to a certain point this afternoon. \"I have a way of finding out,\" he said. \"About what?\" asked Michaelis. \"About the cars,\" he answered. \"What cars?\" \"Their cars.\" He stared at Michaelis with eyes dimmed a little by many pointless days and nights. \"Those days he was fine,\" said Michaelis. \"He worked himself up into a white personal devil.\" About five o'clock it was all over.

          "text_segment": "We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still some distance away.\n“Wreck!” said Tom. “That’s good. Wilson’ll have a little business at last.”\nHe slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping, until, as we came nearer, the hushed, intent faces of the people at the garage door made him automatically put on the brakes.\n“We’ll take a look,” he said doubtfully, “just a look.”\nI became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly from the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coupé and walked toward the door resolved itself into the words “Oh, my God!” uttered over and over in a gasping moan.\n“There’s some bad trouble here,” said Tom excitedly.\nHe reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage, which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging metal basket overhead. Then he made a harsh sound in his throat, and with a violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through.\nThe circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it was a minute before I could see anything at all. Then new arrivals deranged the line, and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.\nMyrtle Wilson’s body, wrapped in a blanket, and then in another blanket, as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night, lay on a worktable by the wall, and Tom, with his back to us, was bending over it, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down names with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I couldn’t find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed clamorously through the bare garage—then I saw Wilson standing on the raised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to the doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low voice and attempting, from time to time, to lay a hand on his shoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall, and then jerk back to the light again, and he gave out incessantly his high, horrible call:\n“Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!”\nPresently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and, after staring around the garage with glazed eyes, addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the policeman.\n“M-a-v—” the policeman was saying, “—o—”\n“No, r—” corrected the man, “M-a-v-r-o—”\n“Listen to me!” muttered Tom fiercely.\n“r—” said the policeman, “o—”\n“g—”\n“g—” He looked up as Tom’s broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder. “What you want, fella?”\n“What happened?—that’s what I want to know.”\n“Auto hit her. Ins’antly killed.”\n“Instantly killed,” repeated Tom, staring.\n“She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn’t even stopus car.”\n“There was two cars,” said Michaelis, “one comin’, one goin’, see?”\n“Going where?” asked the policeman keenly.\n“One goin’ each way. Well, she”—his hand rose toward the blankets but stopped halfway and fell to his side—“she ran out there an’ the one comin’ from N’York knock right into her, goin’ thirty or forty miles an hour.”\n“What’s the name of this place here?” demanded the officer.\n“Hasn’t got any name.”\nA pale well-dressed negro stepped near.\n“It was a yellow car,” he said, “big yellow car. New.”\n“See the accident?” asked the policeman.\n“No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster’n forty. Going fifty, sixty.”\n“Come here and let’s have your name. Look out now. I want to get his name.”\nSome words of this conversation must have reached Wilson, swaying in the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his grasping cries:\n“You don’t have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of car it was!”\nWatching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten under his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and, standing in front of him, seized him firmly by the upper arms.\n“You’ve got to pull yourself together,” he said with soothing gruffness.\nWilson’s eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.\n“Listen,” said Tom, shaking him a little. “I just got here a minute ago, from New York. I was bringing you that coupé we’ve been talking about. That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn’t mine—do you hear? I haven’t seen it all afternoon.”\nOnly the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said, but the policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent eyes.\n“What’s all that?” he demanded.\n“I’m a friend of his.” Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on Wilson’s body. “He says he knows the car that did it… It was a yellow car.”\nSome dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.\n“And what colour’s your car?”\n“It’s a blue car, a coupé.”\n“We’ve come straight from New York,” I said.\nSomeone who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this, and the policeman turned away.\n“Now, if you’ll let me have that name again correct—”\nPicking up Wilson like a doll, Tom carried him into the office, set him down in a chair, and came back.\n“If somebody’ll come here and sit with him,” he snapped authoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the door on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the table. As he passed close to me he whispered: “Let’s get out.”\nSelf-consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we pushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor, case in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.\nTom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend—then his foot came down hard, and the coupé raced along through the night. In a little while I heard a low husky sob, and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face.\n“The God damned coward!” he whimpered.",

Wilson’ll have a little business at last.” He slowed down, but kept moving at the curb. “Want to look?” he asked, half turning to us. “High in a white palace the king’s daughter, the golden girl. . . .” Jordan changed her position in the road, and plugged her ears with cotton. “Go on,” she urged. “We’re all right.” “It’s his wife that’s dead.” Tom spoke over the fence. “You’ve got to go there and see.” The crowd drew back, straggling, and Tom took a long time finding the right place to turn around. When he had turned he stopped the car which was now opposite the garage, and got out. “Come on.” He started for the fence. “What is it?” I asked, standing beside Jordan. “I don’t know.” “It’s a wreck,” said Tom. “That’s good.

          "text_segment": "The Buchanans’ house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling trees. Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor, where two windows bloomed with light among the vines.\n“Daisy’s home,” he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and frowned slightly.\n“I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There’s nothing we can do tonight.”\nA change had come over him, and he spoke gravely, and with decision. As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of the situation in a few brisk phrases.\n“I’ll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you’re waiting you and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some supper—if you want any.” He opened the door. “Come in.”\n“No, thanks. But I’d be glad if you’d order me the taxi. I’ll wait outside.”\nJordan put her hand on my arm.\n“Won’t you come in, Nick?”\n“No, thanks.”\nI was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan lingered for a moment more.\n“It’s only half-past nine,” she said.\nI’d be damned if I’d go in; I’d had enough of all of them for one day, and suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of this in my expression, for she turned abruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the house. I sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler’s voice calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the house, intending to wait by the gate.\nI hadn’t gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from between two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird by that time, because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon.\n“What are you doing?” I inquired.\n“Just standing here, old sport.”\nSomehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was going to rob the house in a moment; I wouldn’t have been surprised to see sinister faces, the faces of “Wolfshiem’s people,” behind him in the dark shrubbery.\n“Did you see any trouble on the road?” he asked after a minute.\n“Yes.”\nHe hesitated.\n“Was she killed?”\n“Yes.”\n“I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It’s better that the shock should all come at once. She stood it pretty well.”\nHe spoke as if Daisy’s reaction was the only thing that mattered.\n“I got to West Egg by a side road,” he went on, “and left the car in my garage. I don’t think anybody saw us, but of course I can’t be sure.”\nI disliked him so much by this time that I didn’t find it necessary to tell him he was wrong.\n“Who was the woman?” he inquired.\n“Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did it happen?”\n“Well, I tried to swing the wheel—” He broke off, and suddenly I guessed at the truth.\n“Was Daisy driving?”\n“Yes,” he said after a moment, “but of course I’ll say I was. You see, when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to drive—and this woman rushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute, but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second my hand reached the wheel I felt the shock—it must have killed her instantly.”\n“It ripped her open—”\n“Don’t tell me, old sport.” He winced. “Anyhow—Daisy stepped on it. I tried to make her stop, but she couldn’t, so I pulled on the emergency brake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.\n“She’ll be all right tomorrow,” he said presently. “I’m just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon. She’s locked herself into her room, and if he tries any brutality she’s going to turn the light out and on again.”\n“He won’t touch her,” I said. “He’s not thinking about her.”\n“I don’t trust him, old sport.”\n“How long are you going to wait?”\n“All night, if necessary. Anyhow, till they all go to bed.”\nA new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy had been driving. He might think he saw a connection in it—he might think anything. I looked at the house; there were two or three bright windows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy’s room on the ground floor.\n“You wait here,” I said. “I’ll see if there’s any sign of a commotion.”\nI walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel softly, and tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains were open, and I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where we had dined that June night three months before, I came to a small rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window. The blind was drawn, but I found a rift at the sill.\nDaisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table, with a plate of cold fried chicken between them, and two bottles of ale. He was talking intently across the table at her, and in his earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own. Once in a while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.\nThey weren’t happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the ale—and yet they weren’t unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture, and anybody would have said that they were conspiring together.\nAs I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the dark road toward the house. Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in the drive.\n“Is it all quiet up there?” he asked anxiously.\n“Yes, it’s all quiet.” I hesitated. “You’d better come home and get some sleep.”\nHe shook his head.\n“I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport.”\nHe put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the moonlight—watching over nothing.",

            "prefix-probing": "The Buchanans’ house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling trees. It was a mansion, a cheerful red-and-white Georgian Colonial house, overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run. My taxi halted at the curb. I got out and stood for a moment on the drive, absorbing the sheer, careless opulence of the place. There was an indefinable air of wealth about it, not just money, but old money, settled and secure, the kind that doesn't need to flaunt itself but permeates everything like a fine dust. The windows were open, letting out a soft golden light and the murmur of voices. It felt like stepping into a different world, a world of ease and privilege that I, a newcomer from the West, could only observe from the periphery. I walked up the steps and rang the bell. A butler, impossibly tall and dressed in a crisp uniform, opened the door. He had the impassive face of someone who had seen everything and was surprised by nothing. He led me through a cool, marble-floored hall into a large, sun-drenched room. The room was high-ceilinged and airy, with French windows opening onto the lawn. The furniture was heavy and expensive, covered in white dust-sheets, giving the room a temporary, almost transient feel, despite its obvious permanence. Or perhaps it was just the heat of the afternoon, shimmering through the open windows, that made everything seem slightly unreal. Two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. I must have stood there for a moment, blinking in the sudden brightness, before one of them, the one I knew, called out. “I’m p-paralyzed with happiness.” It was Daisy. Her voice was a low, thrilling murmur, a voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. It was full of money—that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals’ song of it. . . . A beautiful little fool, she had once said, that’s what I hope she’ll be. That’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool. The other girl was Jordan Baker, a famous golfer. She lay stretched out on a couch at the other end of the room, her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it. She had a hard, jaunty air about her, a sort of cool, self-possessed beauty that was the antithesis of Daisy’s fragile charm. She didn’t speak, but gave me a slight nod, her eyes, bright and cynical, meeting mine for a brief moment before she looked away. “Gatsby?” demanded Daisy suddenly. “What Gatsby?” I asked, confused. “He’s a neighbor,” she explained, turning her lovely, bored face toward me. “You must know Gatsby.” I shook my head. “I live in West Egg,” I said. “Oh,” she said, and a little ripple of disappointment seemed to pass over her. “I thought you knew Gatsby. He lives in a house that looks like a hotel.” Just then, Tom Buchanan came into the room. He was a sturdy, straw-haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill the doorway, his shoulders broad, his chest deep. He had been a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of anticlimax. His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and there were fewer of them than had been the case ten years ago. “Hello, Nick,” he said, without any particular warmth. He looked me over with an appraising glance, as if measuring my worth, or perhaps just my size. “You’re here for the summer, aren’t you?” “I am,” I said. “I’ve rented a small house in West Egg.” “West Egg?” he scoffed. “That’s the less fashionable side, isn’t it?” He didn’t wait for an answer, but turned his attention back to the women. “What are you doing?” he demanded. “We’re just sitting here,” said Daisy, her voice trailing off. “You ought to be doing something,” he said, his voice booming slightly. He picked up a book from a table and looked at the title. “’The Rise of the Colored Empires’ by Goddard,” he read aloud. “This is a good book, everyone ought to read it. The idea is if we don’t look out the white race will be utterly submerged. It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.” Jordan Baker sat up a little. “Tom’s getting very profound,” she remarked, with a hint of mockery in her voice. “He reads deep books with long words in them.” Tom frowned. “It’s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will get control of things.” “We’ve got to beat them down,” whispered Daisy, winking at me with an absurd, charming little grin. Tom was not amused. “You’ve read it, haven’t you, Tom?” she asked innocently. “On the contrary,” said Tom, “I hate that word hulking—even in kidding.” “Hulking,” I repeated. “That’s what I am,” he said. The conversation drifted aimlessly for a while, touching on various trivialities, the heat, the latest gossip, the endless round of parties. I felt increasingly like an observer, a fly on the wall in this gilded cage. There was a restlessness about them, a sort of desperate gaiety that felt forced, brittle. It was as if they were constantly searching for something, some elusive excitement, to fill the vast emptiness of their lives. The phone rang, and Tom left the room to answer it. As soon as he was gone, Daisy leaned toward me, her eyes wide. “Did you see Tom’s eyes?” she whispered. “They’re so… intense.” Jordan Baker yawned delicately. “He’s just being Tom,” she said, her voice flat. Daisy sighed. “I don’t know what to do,” she said, her voice barely audible. “I don’t know what to do.” There was a profound sadness in her voice, a sense of helplessness that was startling. It was clear that her life, despite its outward perfection, was far from happy. The phone call seemed to be a source of tension. When Tom returned, he was visibly agitated. He paced the room, his hands clasped behind his back. “It was the garage,” he said, his voice clipped. “Something about a car.” He didn’t elaborate, but the air in the room had changed, becoming heavy with unspoken things. Daisy watched him, her face pale. Jordan Baker had closed her eyes again, retreating into her own world. I felt the awkwardness of the situation, the palpable tension between husband and wife, the silent complicity of the friend. It was a glimpse behind the glittering facade, a hint of the rot that lay beneath the surface of their privileged lives. I wanted to leave, to escape the oppressive atmosphere, but I was trapped, a guest in their elaborate, unhappy drama. The afternoon wore on, the sun sinking lower in the sky, casting long shadows across the lawn. The conversation became more strained, punctuated by long silences. I realized that I had stumbled into a world of complex, unhappy relationships, a world where wealth and privilege did not guarantee contentment. It was a world I was only beginning to understand, a world that would soon draw me deeper into its tangled web of desires, illusions, and betrayals. The house, which had seemed so cheerful and inviting from the outside, now felt like a prison, holding its inhabitants captive in their own gilded misery. The rustling trees outside seemed to whisper secrets, secrets of a past that refused to stay buried, secrets that would eventually unravel the carefully constructed lives of the people within these walls. I looked at Daisy, her face a mask of forced gaiety, and at Tom, his eyes hard and restless, and at Jordan, cool and detached. They were all searching for something, something they couldn't find, something that perhaps didn't exist. And I, the innocent bystander, was about to be caught in the crosscurrents of their desperate search.",

He was pale and his eyes were fixed on us with a strained, questioning expression. He said nothing, but his look was enough. He knew. He must have known all along. He led us into the drawing-room, where the others were gathered. Jordan was there, and a few other people I didn’t know. They were all talking in low voices, and the air was thick with tension. Tom went over to Daisy and spoke to her in a low voice. She nodded, her face expressionless. Then Tom turned to us. “We’d better have some supper,” he said, his voice unnaturally loud. “We’ve had a long day.” We sat down at the table, but no one ate. The food was there, but it might as well have been made of stone. The silence was broken only by the clinking of silverware and the occasional cough. After a while, Tom stood up. “I think we should all go to bed,” he said. “It’s been a trying day.” We all agreed, and we went upstairs. I said good night to Jordan at her door, and then I went to my own room. I couldn’t sleep. I kept thinking about what had happened. About Myrtle, and the accident. And about Daisy and Gatsby.

                "text": "The Buchanans’ house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling trees. Tom stopped the car. “Daisy’s home,” he remarked. As we got out he thought for a moment and then added, “You two start on in to supper.” “In a minute,” I said. I wanted to get out and walk eastward down the road and disappear into the darkness. I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that hadn’t been there before. Or perhaps I had felt it all the time but had too much vitality to be affected by it now. “Well, suit yourself,” Tom remarked. “Daisy’s home.” As he said it she came out to the porch. There was a light in the hall, but it was dark outside, so that they were silhouettes only, —he towering beside her. They stood there for a moment and then she turned and went inside again. “He’s not coming up,” said Jordan beside me. “Neither are you.” Jordan went up the steps and disappeared. I waited, and sure enough, in a moment I heard the familiar “Ah-h-h!” from the butler’s pantry at the sound of the electric bell. The butler came out and he and Tom talked for a moment, looking up and down the drive. I looked at the house, glowing now with reflected gold, and then I knew that Daisy was sitting in a room somewhere, alone, and that the lamp beside her glowed on a pile of unused clothes. Probably it had been twenty minutes before I could decide what to do. I wanted to go to work with my hands, scrub the floor, rake the leaves, dig a garden—any activity that promised a definite clean perspective at the end. Instead I waited until an hour had passed after we got back and then circulated among the three or four automobiles that waited in the drive outside. The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there was an autumn flavour in the air. The chauffeur came out, carrying a blanket and the ladder, and mounted to the roof to tidy up her hair—that is, Jordan’s. She was within a hundred miles of my house, and I’d told her I would call her up. And I did. I waited outside the gates for a little while and then started on foot toward West Egg, half an hour’s walk from the village. It was dark now, and the moon was shining.

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents several scenes and actions not present in the original, such as Daisy coming out onto the porch, a group gathering in the drawing-room, and a communal supper with multiple unnamed guests. These invented events replace the original's more private and tense interactions.\n- The sequence of events is significantly altered: the original features a conversation outside the house, a refusal to enter, and a private encounter between Nick and Gatsby, while the completion instead has the narrator entering the house, participating in a group meal, and later going to bed.\n- The completion omits the original's detailed depiction of Nick's solitary wait outside, his emotional state, and the specific observation of Tom and Daisy's interaction in the kitchen.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the original's step-by-step account of Nick's refusal to enter the house, his conversation with Jordan, and his decision to wait outside.\n- The detailed exchange between Nick and Gatsby, including their discussion about the accident, Daisy's role, and Gatsby's intentions, is largely missing or replaced with a much briefer and less nuanced interaction.\n- The original's depiction of Nick observing Tom and Daisy through the window, including the specific details of their meal and body language, is absent.\n- The completion does not include the original's closing scene of Gatsby's vigil and Nick's final observations as he leaves Gatsby outside.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion presents events out of order, such as having Gatsby arrive after Nick has gone to bed, rather than their meeting occurring while Nick is outside.\n- There are inaccurate attributions of actions and dialogue, such as Tom's behavior and the group supper, which do not align with the original's more subdued and private interactions.\n- The emotional tone and focus are shifted: the completion adds internal reflections and narrative commentary that are not present in the original passage, and omits the original's emphasis on Nick's discomfort and the tension between the characters.\n- The completion introduces invented dialogue and actions, such as Daisy's appearance on the porch and the narrator's extended internal monologue, which are not part of the original sequence."

Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby’s drive, and immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dress—I felt that I had something to tell him, something to warn him about, and morning would be too late.\nCrossing his lawn, I saw that his front door was still open and he was leaning against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep.\n“Nothing happened,” he said wanly. “I waited, and about four o’clock she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out the light.”\nHis house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when we hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes. We pushed aside curtains that were like pavilions, and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for electric light switches—once I tumbled with a sort of splash upon the keys of a ghostly piano. There was an inexplicable amount of dust everywhere, and the rooms were musty, as though they hadn’t been aired for many days. I found the humidor on an unfamiliar table, with two stale, dry cigarettes inside. Throwing open the French windows of the drawing-room, we sat smoking out into the darkness.\n“You ought to go away,” I said. “It’s pretty certain they’ll trace your car.”\n“Go away now, old sport?”\n“Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal.”\nHe wouldn’t consider it. He couldn’t possibly leave Daisy until he knew what she was going to do. He was clutching at some last hope and I couldn’t bear to shake him free.",

I can’t shake the feeling that he was standing there for some time, waiting. ‘Hello, Nick,’ he said. ‘I’ve been waiting for you. I thought you’d come.’ He looked at me sideways—and I knew why.

The sheet was crumpled where I had made a sudden, convulsive movement, and I lay there, staring at the ceiling, the events of the day before replaying themselves with horrifying clarity. The hot, humid afternoon, the tension in the Plaza suite, the reckless drive home, the sickening thud, the ghastly spectacle by the road, the casual cruelty of Tom, the desperate, watchful silence of Gatsby. It all swam before my eyes, a chaotic, violent tableau that mocked the carefully constructed facade of their lives. The foghorn seemed to mourn not just for ships lost at sea, but for the wreckage of human lives scattered along the shore of the Sound. I saw Myrtle Wilson’s face, or what was left of it, and the vacant, stunned look in Michaelis’s eyes. I saw Daisy’s beautiful, careless face, and Tom’s hard, possessive mouth. And Gatsby, standing guard outside the house, a solitary, pathetic figure clinging to a hope that was now surely dead. The dreams were worse, populated by distorted figures from the party, their laughter turning to screams, their elegant movements becoming clumsy, violent lurches. I felt a profound, physical nausea, a revulsion not just at the accident itself, but at the moral emptiness that had made it possible. The East, with its frantic energy and its glittering, hollow people, seemed to press in on me, suffocating me with its corruption. I wanted to shout, to wake them all up, to force them to confront the horror they had created, but I knew it would be useless. They were insulated by their money, their privilege, their utter lack of imagination. As the first grey light filtered through the window, I felt a cold certainty settle over me: this was not my world. I was an outsider, a spectator who had been drawn too close to the flame and was now scorched by its heat. The foghorn finally fell silent, but the silence was heavy with the weight of what had happened, and what was yet to come. I knew I had to do something, but I didn't know what. The morning brought no clarity, only a dull ache and the persistent, sickening smell of death that seemed to cling to the air."

          "text_segment": "It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with Dan Cody—told it to me because “Jay Gatsby” had broken up like glass against Tom’s hard malice, and the long secret extravaganza was played out. I think that he would have acknowledged anything now, without reserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy.\nShe was the first “nice” girl he had ever known. In various unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people, but always with indiscernible barbed wire between. He found her excitingly desirable. He went to her house, at first with other officers from Camp Taylor, then alone. It amazed him—he had never been in such a beautiful house before. But what gave it an air of breathless intensity, was that Daisy lived there—it was as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it, a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors, and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year’s shining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered. It excited him, too, that many men had already loved Daisy—it increased her value in his eyes. He felt their presence all about the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions.\nBut he knew that he was in Daisy’s house by a colossal accident. However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders. So he made the most of his time. He took what he could get, ravenously and unscrupulously—eventually he took Daisy one still October night, took her because he had no real right to touch her hand.\nHe might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under false pretences. I don’t mean that he had traded on his phantom millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he let her believe that he was a person from much the same strata as herself—that he was fully able to take care of her. As a matter of fact, he had no such facilities—he had no comfortable family standing behind him, and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the world.\nBut he didn’t despise himself and it didn’t turn out as he had imagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go—but now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail. He knew that Daisy was extraordinary, but he didn’t realize just how extraordinary a “nice” girl could be. She vanished into her rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby—nothing. He felt married to her, that was all.\nWhen they met again, two days later, it was Gatsby who was breathless, who was, somehow, betrayed. Her porch was bright with the bought luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth. She had caught a cold, and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever, and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor.\n“I can’t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her, old sport. I even hoped for a while that she’d throw me over, but she didn’t, because she was in love with me too. She thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her… Well, there I was, way off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden I didn’t care. What was the use of doing great things if I could have a better time telling her what I was going to do?”\nOn the last afternoon before he went abroad, he sat with Daisy in his arms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day, with fire in the room and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he changed his arm a little, and once he kissed her dark shining hair. The afternoon had made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised. They had never been closer in their month of love, nor communicated more profoundly one with another, than when she brushed silent lips against his coat’s shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were asleep.",

            "prefix-probing": "It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with Dan Cody—told it to me because “Jay Gatsby” had broken up like glass against Tom’s hard malice, and the long secret extravaganza was played out. He told it to me while we waited for the taxi, and his eyes, which had been brooding on the raw, cold night, were now turned inward upon himself. His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people—his imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at all. The truth was that Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of himself. He was a son of God—a phrase which, if it means anything, means just that—and he must be about His Father’s business, the service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty. So he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end. For over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of Lake Superior as a clam digger and a salmon fisher, but he knew that he was in training for something else, something big. He accepted a few chores that brought him food and a bed, but his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene, and he fell asleep with the knowledge that he was in training for one of the roles that he was creating for himself on the periphery of his imagination. Then came the man who changed his life forever. Dan Cody, a fifty-year-old pioneer debauchee, who had made a fortune in the Yukon and then restlessly dissipated it on the high seas. He was a product of the Nevada silver fields, of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since seventy-five. The transactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire found him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and, living alone in the Houseboat, he was inordinately active. He was a large, florid man, with a hard, jaunty body and a rather soft, subjectless voice. James Gatz was seventeen, and a ragged, hard-working boy who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants. He saw Cody’s yacht, the Tuolomee, anchored in the bay, and rowed out to warn him about an impending storm. Cody was in a temper, and he was drunk, but he took a fancy to the boy. He asked him where he came from, and what he did. James Gatz told him he was from North Dakota, and that he was a clam digger. Cody liked his spirit, and the next morning he took him on as his steward. It was at this point that James Gatz officially became Jay Gatsby. He had been waiting for a moment like this, a chance to shed his old identity and step into the one he had created in his dreams. He told Cody his name was Jay Gatsby, and Cody, perhaps too drunk or too indifferent to question it, accepted it. For five years, Gatsby traveled with Dan Cody on the Tuolomee. They sailed three times around the continent. It was a life of luxury and excess, a world of yachts, women, and heavy drinking. Cody was a heavy drinker, and Gatsby saw firsthand the destructive power of alcohol. It was a lesson he never forgot, and it was why he himself drank so little. He was there to look after Cody, to keep him out of trouble, and to learn. Cody was Gatsby’s education in the ways of the wealthy, the careless, and the powerful. He saw how money was spent, how relationships were formed and broken, and how the rich lived. He was exposed to a world far removed from the poverty of his youth. He learned about business, about the stock market, about the superficiality that often accompanied great wealth. He was Cody’s confidant, his assistant, his protector. He was everything but his son. Cody was involved with a woman named Ella Kaye, a newspaper woman who came aboard the yacht one May day in Boston and who was wherever Cody went for the rest of his life. It was Ella Kaye who inherited Cody’s money—a cool quarter of a million dollars—when he died a week later in Boston. Gatsby was left with nothing but a legacy of five thousand dollars, which he never received because Ella Kaye found a legal way to appropriate it. This experience solidified Gatsby’s determination to become wealthy himself. He had seen the money, lived the life, and then had it snatched away. He understood the power of money and the ruthlessness of those who possessed it. The five years with Cody were his apprenticeship, his preparation for the life he was determined to build. He learned how to act like a rich man, how to navigate their world, and how to pursue wealth with single-minded intensity. He didn't tell me all this in a single, coherent narrative. It came out in fragments, punctuated by long silences, as the taxi carried us through the dark streets. He spoke of Cody with a mixture of admiration and resentment, of the life on the yacht with a kind of wistful detachment. He was no longer the confident, almost arrogant host of the parties; he was James Gatz again, the boy who had dreamed of a better life and had pursued it with relentless energy. The story of Dan Cody was the missing piece, the explanation for the elaborate facade of Jay Gatsby. It showed the foundation upon which the dream was built, a foundation laid in the turbulent waters of Lake Superior and solidified over five years of restless wandering. It explained the source of his initial capital, the contacts he might have made, and the education he received in the ways of the world he so desperately wanted to conquer. It was the story of how a poor boy from North Dakota transformed himself into the enigmatic millionaire of West Egg, a transformation driven by ambition, fueled by a dream, and shaped by the mentorship of a dissolute millionaire. And now, that carefully constructed identity, built over years of effort and secrecy, had been shattered by the brutal reality of Tom Buchanan's world. The long secret extravaganza was indeed played out, leaving behind only the fragments of a broken dream and the raw, vulnerable truth of James Gatz."

          "text_segment": "He did extraordinarily well in the war. He was a captain before he went to the front, and following the Argonne battles he got his majority and the command of the divisional machine-guns. After the armistice he tried frantically to get home, but some complication or misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He was worried now—there was a quality of nervous despair in Daisy’s letters. She didn’t see why he couldn’t come. She was feeling the pressure of the world outside, and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all.\nFor Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes. All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the “Beale Street Blues” while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust. At the grey tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low, sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the floor.\nThrough this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men, and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening-dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed. And all the time something within her was crying for a decision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately—and the decision must be made by some force—of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality—that was close at hand.\nThat force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom Buchanan. There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his position, and Daisy was flattered. Doubtless there was a certain struggle and a certain relief. The letter reached Gatsby while he was still at Oxford.\nIt was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of the windows downstairs, filling the house with grey-turning, gold-turning light. The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. There was a slow, pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool, lovely day.\n“I don’t think she ever loved him.” Gatsby turned around from a window and looked at me challengingly. “You must remember, old sport, she was very excited this afternoon. He told her those things in a way that frightened her—that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper. And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying.”\nHe sat down gloomily.\n“Of course she might have loved him just for a minute, when they were first married—and loved me more even then, do you see?”\nSuddenly he came out with a curious remark.\n“In any case,” he said, “it was just personal.”\nWhat could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in his conception of the affair that couldn’t be measured?\nHe came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their wedding trip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to Louisville on the last of his army pay. He stayed there a week, walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through the November night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which they had driven in her white car. Just as Daisy’s house had always seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses, so his idea of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded with a melancholy beauty.\nHe left feeling that if he had searched harder, he might have found her—that he was leaving her behind. The day-coach—he was penniless now—was hot. He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a folding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar buildings moved by. Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street.\nThe track curved and now it was going away from the sun, which, as it sank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing city where she had drawn her breath. He stretched out his hand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of the spot that she had made lovely for him. But it was all going by too fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of it, the freshest and the best, forever.",

            "prefix-probing": "He did extraordinarily well in the war. Major Jay Gatsby, as he was known then, emerged from the trenches of the Great War not just alive, but decorated, a figure of quiet competence and undeniable bravery. The novel hints at this period as a crucial turning point, a crucible that forged the man who would later build his opulent empire on West Egg. While the details are sparse, filtered through Gatsby’s own carefully constructed narrative and Nick Carraway’s piecing together of the truth, the fact of his distinguished service is presented as one of the few solid, verifiable elements of his mysterious past. He carried the proof with him – the medals, the Distinguished Service Cross from Montenegro, the Croix de Guerre from France. He showed them to Nick one afternoon, a tangible counterpoint to the wild rumors that swirled around him. These weren't the fabrications of a fantasist; they were official recognition of courage under fire, of leadership in the face of death. The war, for Gatsby, was perhaps the first time he truly felt seen, truly felt valued, not for his background or his wealth (which he didn't have), but for his inherent qualities – his resilience, his nerve, his ability to perform under extreme pressure. It was a stark contrast to the aimless drifting of his youth as James Gatz, the boy from North Dakota with grand dreams but no clear path. The military provided structure, purpose, and a brutal, undeniable reality that stripped away pretense. In the chaos and camaraderie of the front lines, social distinctions blurred. A man was judged by his actions, his courage, his ability to lead and survive. Gatsby, it seems, excelled in this environment. He rose through the ranks, a testament to his ambition and capability. The war offered him a glimpse of a different world, a world where merit could elevate a man, where heroism was recognized and rewarded. It was a world far removed from the rigid social hierarchies of the America he knew, particularly the old money circles he would later desperately try to penetrate. Following the armistice, Gatsby had the unique opportunity to attend Oxford for five months, a privilege granted to officers. This brief sojourn in the hallowed halls of one of the world's most prestigious universities further broadened his horizons. It exposed him to a level of culture and sophistication that he had only dreamed of. It was a fleeting taste of the life he aspired to, a life of ease, learning, and established status. This period, though short, likely solidified his resolve to acquire the trappings of that world, to bridge the gap between the humble origins of James Gatz and the sophisticated image of Jay Gatsby. The war and the subsequent time at Oxford were transformative experiences. They took the raw ambition of the young man and refined it, giving him a veneer of experience and accomplishment that he would later leverage. They provided him with stories, with credentials (the medals, the Oxford connection), that lent a degree of credibility to the persona he was building. Yet, the war also represented a profound disruption. It was a period of intense living, followed by a return to a world that felt both familiar and irrevocably changed. The post-war years, the Roaring Twenties, were characterized by a frantic energy, a desire to forget the horrors of the trenches and embrace pleasure and prosperity. Gatsby, like many of his generation, carried the weight of that experience, even as he threw himself into the pursuit of wealth and the past. His success in the war, his survival and decoration, must have instilled in him a powerful belief in his own capacity to achieve the impossible. If he could face down death and emerge a hero, surely he could conquer the social barriers and economic challenges that stood between him and his dream – the dream embodied by Daisy. The discipline, the strategic thinking, the sheer force of will required to succeed in combat were skills he undoubtedly transferred to his post-war endeavors. Building his vast network, orchestrating his elaborate parties, accumulating his immense fortune – these were campaigns in their own right, requiring planning, risk-taking, and a relentless focus on the objective. The war, therefore, was not just a chapter in his life; it was a foundational experience that shaped his character, fueled his ambition, and provided him with the conviction that he could, through sheer effort and will, bend reality to his desires. It was the crucible where James Gatz began to truly become Jay Gatsby, the man who believed in the green light, the future that yearned before us.",

I can’t explain to you how I love that man—when I first met him it was in August, 1918, in France. He was part of the American Expeditionary Force.

He stayed there a week, walking the streets where their footsteps had fallen, and when he left it seemed to him that the city itself was gone, gone wherever she was. He was penniless, and everything in the world depended on him doing well. He went to Oggsford, old sport. You know Oggsford College in England?

He was delayed in the Argonne Forest for two weeks, and when he got back to Louisville she was gone. He stayed there a week, walking the streets where their footsteps had fallen, and when he left it seemed to him that the city itself was gone, gone wherever she was. He was penniless, and everything in the world depended on him doing well. He went to Oggsford, old sport. You know Oggsford College in England? It was in November, 1918, that he went to Demaine, and finally he got to Oggsford. He stayed there five months. That’s the story of Gatsby. He was an officer in the war, and he did extraordinarily",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a substantial portion of the original passage, including the entire section describing Daisy's emotional state, her social environment, and the events leading up to Tom Buchanan's arrival. This results in the loss of important context and character development.\n- The completion introduces repetitive and irrelevant content, particularly the repeated sentences about Gatsby staying at Oxford for five months, which is not present in the original and disrupts the narrative flow.\n- The completion fails to include the reflective dialogue between Gatsby and the narrator, as well as the atmospheric description of the morning on Long Island, both of which are significant in the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion does not mention the complications or misunderstandings that led Gatsby to Oxford instead of home, nor does it address Daisy's letters and her emotional turmoil.\n- The middle section omits the depiction of Daisy's social life, the sensory details of her world, and the emotional undertones that shape her decisions.\n- The arrival of Tom Buchanan and its impact on Daisy, as well as the struggle and relief she experiences, are not included.\n- The completion skips the scene-setting and introspective moments on Long Island, including the description of the dawn, the house, and the natural surroundings.\n- The dialogue between Gatsby and the narrator, which provides insight into Gatsby's feelings and the complexity of the relationships, is missing.\n- The final reflective journey Gatsby makes to Louisville, including the sensory and emotional details of his visit and departure, is only partially represented and lacks the depth and imagery of the original.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered, with some events either omitted or presented out of order, such as Gatsby's time at Oxford and his return to Louisville.\n- There are invented details, such as the mention of \"Oggsford College\" and \"Demaine,\" which do not correspond to the original content.\n- The completion attributes actions and decisions to Gatsby that are not present in the original, such as the specifics of his commission and the circumstances of his stay in Louisville.\n- The repetitive content about the opportunity for officers after the armistice is inaccurate and not part of the original narrative.\n\nTo improve, ensure the completion follows the original passage's structure, includes all major events and emotional developments in the correct order, avoids invented or repetitive content, and captures the key atmospheric and introspective elements present throughout the passage."

The gardener, the last one of Gatsby’s former servants, came to the foot of the steps.\n“I’m going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby. Leaves’ll start falling pretty soon, and then there’s always trouble with the pipes.”\n“Don’t do it today,” Gatsby answered. He turned to me apologetically. “You know, old sport, I’ve never used that pool all summer?”\nI looked at my watch and stood up.\n“Twelve minutes to my train.”\nI didn’t want to go to the city. I wasn’t worth a decent stroke of work, but it was more than that—I didn’t want to leave Gatsby. I missed that train, and then another, before I could get myself away.\n“I’ll call you up,” I said finally.\n“Do, old sport.”\n“I’ll call you about noon.”\nWe walked slowly down the steps.\n“I suppose Daisy’ll call too.” He looked at me anxiously, as if he hoped I’d corroborate this.\n“I suppose so.”\n“Well, goodbye.”\nWe shook hands and I started away. Just before I reached the hedge I remembered something and turned around.\n“They’re a rotten crowd,” I shouted across the lawn. “You’re worth the whole damn bunch put together.”\nI’ve always been glad I said that. It was the only compliment I ever gave him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end. First he nodded politely, and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding smile, as if we’d been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time. His gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of colour against the white steps, and I thought of the night when I first came to his ancestral home, three months before. The lawn and drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his corruption—and he had stood on those steps, concealing his incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye.\nI thanked him for his hospitality. We were always thanking him for that—I and the others.\n“Goodbye,” I called. “I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby.”",

            "prefix-probing": "It was nine o’clock when we finished breakfast and went out on the porch. The sun, already high and warm, cast long shadows across the lawn, illuminating the dew-kissed grass with a brilliant, almost artificial green. The air was thick with the scent of honeysuckle and the distant hum of a lawnmower, a sound that seemed to emphasize the profound stillness of the morning. Tom was already there, sprawled in a wicker chair, reading the financial section of the paper with a frown etched between his brows. He looked restless, even in repose, his powerful frame seeming too large for the delicate furniture. Daisy sat opposite him, idly fanning herself with a magazine, her eyes fixed on the shimmering water of the bay. There was a tension in the air, a palpable silence that spoke volumes about the unspoken things between them. I sat down quietly, feeling like an intruder in their domestic tableau, yet drawn into the magnetic field of their complicated lives. The heat was beginning to build, promising another sweltering day, the kind of day that seemed to press down on everything, making the air heavy with anticipation. I watched a sailboat glide lazily across the bay, its white sail a stark contrast against the deep blue water, and thought of Gatsby’s house across the way, hidden behind a screen of trees, its mystery as impenetrable as ever. What was he doing at this hour? Was he already planning the next grand gesture, the next extravagant party, all designed to lure a certain golden girl back into his orbit? The thought of him, so close yet so distant, filled the morning with a strange energy, a sense of impending drama. Daisy sighed, a soft, almost inaudible sound, and shifted in her chair. 'It’s so hot,' she murmured, her voice like money, cool and inviting despite the heat. Tom grunted, not looking up from his paper. The silence descended again, broken only by the rustle of the newspaper and the distant drone of the lawnmower. I felt a familiar sense of unease, the feeling that I was witnessing something private and fragile, something that could shatter at any moment. The porch, usually a place of leisurely comfort, felt charged with unspoken words and simmering emotions. It was a beautiful morning, undeniably beautiful, but beneath the surface, the currents were strong and unpredictable, pulling towards an unknown future. The green light across the bay, though invisible in the daylight, felt closer than ever, a beacon of hope and obsession, drawing us all towards its irresistible glow. The quiet morning held its breath, waiting."

Just before noon the phone woke me, and I started up with sweat breaking out on my forehead. It was Jordan Baker; she often called me up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements between hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find in any other way. Usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool, as if a divot from a green golf-links had come sailing in at the office window, but this morning it seemed harsh and dry.\n“I’ve left Daisy’s house,” she said. “I’m at Hempstead, and I’m going down to Southampton this afternoon.”\nProbably it had been tactful to leave Daisy’s house, but the act annoyed me, and her next remark made me rigid.\n“You weren’t so nice to me last night.”\n“How could it have mattered then?”\nSilence for a moment. Then:\n“However—I want to see you.”\n“I want to see you, too.”\n“Suppose I don’t go to Southampton, and come into town this afternoon?”\n“No—I don’t think this afternoon.”\n“Very well.”\n“It’s impossible this afternoon.

Looked at my watch and found it was noon. ‘Hello!’ Assumed to be the operator— ‘This is Mr. Carraway,’ I said. ‘Ah—h!’ It was Jordan Baker. She sounded breathless and harsh in the receiver. ‘I just left Daisy’s house,’ she said. ‘She’s going to move away.’ She was hurrying off somewhere, but I knew she’d speak to me. ‘Hello?’ I waited. ‘Well,’ she said, ‘I suppose you don’t want to see me. Probably we won’t meet again. Probably it’s better for both of us.’ I began to protest. ‘Don’t talk so much,’ she interrupted. ‘I can’t hear what you’re saying.’ ‘I was going to call you up,’ I said, ‘because—’ ‘Don’t talk so much,’ she repeated as a way of getting rid of me before she hung up. ‘I can’t hear what you’re saying, Nick. I hear it for the first time.’ ‘It was a mistake,’ I said. ‘The only crazy thing I did all summer was to fall in love with you.’ ‘You weren’t in love with me,’ she said kindly. ‘There wasn’t any desire in it. Besides,’ she added, ‘I don’t think they’d let us marry. We’re so different. You see.’ She waited. ‘Well,’ I said, ‘good-bye.’ ‘Good-bye,’ she agreed. ‘I’m going to Southampton this afternoon.

When I woke up I didn’t know what time it was, so I looked at my watch and found it was noon. Looked at my watch and found it was noon. ‘Hello!’ Assumed to be the operator— ‘This is Mr. Carraway,’ I said. ‘Ah—h!’ It was Jordan Baker. She sounded breathless and harsh in the receiver. ‘I just left Daisy’s house,’ she said. ‘She’s going to move away.’ She was hurrying off somewhere, but I knew she’d speak to me. ‘Hello?’ I waited. ‘Well,’ she said, ‘I suppose you don’t want to see me. Probably we won’t meet again. Probably it’s better for both of us.’ I began to protest. ‘Don’t talk so much,’ she interrupted. ‘I can’t hear what you’re saying.’ ‘I was going to call you up,’ I said, ‘because—’ ‘Don’t talk so much,’ she repeated as a way of getting rid of me before she hung up. ‘I can’t hear what you’re saying, Nick. I hear it for the first time.’ ‘It was a mistake,’ I said. ‘The only crazy thing I did all summer was to fall in love with you.’ ‘You weren’t in love with me,’ she said kindly. ‘There wasn’t any desire in it. Besides,’ she added, ‘I don’t think they’d let us marry. We’re so different. You see.’ She waited. ‘Well,’ I said, ‘good-bye.’ ‘Good-bye,’ she agreed. ‘I’m going to Southampton this afternoon. Just for a week or so. I’ll be back in a few days.’ ‘All right.’ ‘Good-bye.’ ‘Good-bye.’ She hung up. I couldn’t think of anything to say. I was annoyed, but I couldn’t think of anything to say.

I tried four times; finally an exasperated central told me the wire was being kept open for long distance from Detroit. Taking out my timetable, I drew a small circle around the three-fifty train. Then I leaned back in my chair and tried to think. It was just noon.\nWhen I passed the ash-heaps on the train that morning I had crossed deliberately to the other side of the car. I supposed there’d be a curious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark spots in the dust, and some garrulous man telling over and over what had happened, until it became less and less real even to him and he could tell it no longer, and Myrtle Wilson’s tragic achievement was forgotten. Now I want to go back a little and tell what happened at the garage after we left there the night before.\nThey had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine. She must have broken her rule against drinking that night, for when she arrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had already gone to Flushing. When they convinced her of this, she immediately fainted, as if that was the intolerable part of the affair. Someone, kind or curious, took her in his car and drove her in the wake of her sister’s body.\nUntil long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front of the garage, while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on the couch inside. For a while the door of the office was open, and everyone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it. Finally someone said it was a shame, and closed the door. Michaelis and several other men were with him; first, four or five men, later two or three men. Still later Michaelis had to ask the last stranger to wait there fifteen minutes longer, while he went back to his own place and made a pot of coffee. After that, he stayed there alone with Wilson until dawn.",

He announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car belonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen.\nBut when he heard himself say this, he flinched and began to cry “Oh, my God!” again in his groaning voice. Michaelis made a clumsy attempt to distract him.\n“How long have you been married, George? Come on there, try and sit still a minute, and answer my question. How long have you been married?”\n“Twelve years.”\n“Ever had any children? Come on, George, sit still—I asked you a question. Did you ever have any children?”\nThe hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light, and whenever Michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him like the car that hadn’t stopped a few hours before. He didn’t like to go into the garage, because the work bench was stained where the body had been lying, so he moved uncomfortably around the office—he knew every object in it before morning—and from time to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep him more quiet.\n“Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George? Maybe even if you haven’t been there for a long time? Maybe I could call up the church and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?”\n“Don’t belong to any.”\n“You ought to have a church, George, for times like this. You must have gone to church once. Didn’t you get married in a church? Listen, George, listen to me. Didn’t you get married in a church?”\n“That was a long time ago.”\nThe effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking—for a moment he was silent. Then the same half-knowing, half-bewildered look came back into his faded eyes.\n“Look in the drawer there,” he said, pointing at the desk.\n“Which drawer?”\n“That drawer—that one.”\nMichaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand. There was nothing in it but a small, expensive dog-leash, made of leather and braided silver. It was apparently new.\n“This?” he inquired, holding it up.\nWilson stared and nodded.\n“I found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell me about it, but I knew it was something funny.”\n“You mean your wife bought it?”\n“She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau.”\nMichaelis didn’t see anything odd in that, and he gave Wilson a dozen reasons why his wife might have bought the dog-leash. But conceivably Wilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle, because he began saying “Oh, my God!” again in a whisper—his comforter left several explanations in the air.\n“Then he killed her,” said Wilson. His mouth dropped open suddenly.\n“Who did?”\n“I have a way of finding out.”\n“You’re morbid, George,” said his friend. “This has been a strain to you and you don’t know what you’re saying. You’d better try and sit quiet till morning.”\n“He murdered her.”\n“It was an accident, George.”\nWilson shook his head. His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened slightly with the ghost of a superior “Hm!”\n“I know,” he said definitely. “I’m one of these trusting fellas and I don’t think any harm to nobody, but when I get to know a thing I know it. It was the man in that car. She ran out to speak to him and he wouldn’t stop.”\nMichaelis had seen this too, but it hadn’t occurred to him that there was any special significance in it. He believed that Mrs. Wilson had been running away from her husband, rather than trying to stop any particular car.\n“How could she of been like that?”\n“She’s a deep one,” said Wilson, as if that answered the question. “Ah-h-h—”\nHe began to rock again, and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in his hand.\n“Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George?”\nThis was a forlorn hope—he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend: there was not enough of him for his wife. He was glad a little later when he noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window, and realized that dawn wasn’t far off. About five o’clock it was blue enough outside to snap off the light.\nWilson’s glazed eyes turned out to the ash-heaps, where small grey clouds took on fantastic shapes and scurried here and there in the faint dawn wind.\n“I spoke to her,” he muttered, after a long silence. “I told her she might fool me but she couldn’t fool God. I took her to the window”—with an effort he got up and walked to the rear window and leaned with his face pressed against it—“and I said ‘God knows what you’ve been doing, everything you’ve been doing. You may fool me, but you can’t fool God!’ ”\nStanding behind him, Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, which had just emerged, pale and enormous, from the dissolving night.\n“God sees everything,” repeated Wilson.\n“That’s an advertisement,” Michaelis assured him. Something made him turn away from the window and look back into the room. But Wilson stood there a long time, his face close to the window pane, nodding into the twilight.",

Michaelis, who had been sitting beside him, trying to offer what comfort he could, listened intently. Wilson’s eyes, red-rimmed and vacant moments before, now held a terrifying focus. 'It was a yellow car,' he repeated, his voice low and hoarse, 'a big yellow car. It didn't stop.' Michaelis nodded, though he had heard this many times already. 'Yes, George. We know. The police are looking for it.' 'Looking for it?' Wilson’s voice rose slightly, a tremor of madness in it. 'They don't know who was driving. But I know. I know the man.' Michaelis hesitated. 'You mean the man Myrtle was with?' Wilson turned his head slowly, his gaze fixed on something unseen. 'He was the one. He was the one who killed her. He didn't stop. He just drove away.' A shudder ran through him. 'God sees everything,' he whispered, looking towards the giant eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg on the billboard. 'God sees everything.' Michaelis followed his gaze, feeling a chill despite the heat. He tried to steer the conversation back to practical matters. 'George, you need to rest. You haven't slept.' 'Rest?' Wilson laughed, a dry, rasping sound. 'I can't rest. Not until I find him. The man in the yellow car.' He stood up abruptly, his movements jerky and unnatural. 'I have to find him.' Michaelis tried to stop him. 'Where are you going, George? You're not well.' 'I'm going to find him,' Wilson insisted, pulling away. 'I'm going to find the owner of that car.' He left the garage, leaving Michaelis standing alone in the dust. Wilson’s mind, shattered by grief and betrayal, had latched onto the yellow car as the sole object of his vengeance. He was no longer the meek, defeated man of the valley of ashes; he was a man possessed by a singular, deadly purpose. He began his search methodically, starting with the garages and gas stations along the road that led away from the scene of the accident. He asked everyone he met if they had seen a big yellow car pass by that night. His appearance—disheveled, wild-eyed, and radiating a desperate intensity—made people uneasy, but his questions were clear and persistent. He learned that a car matching the description had stopped briefly at a gas station a few miles down the road. The attendant remembered it because it was a showy car, and the driver had seemed nervous. Wilson pressed for details, for a name, but the attendant couldn't provide one. He only knew the car had headed west, towards the Eggs. West Egg. The name resonated in Wilson's fevered brain. That was where the rich lived, the people who could afford big yellow cars. That was where Myrtle had gone that afternoon. A terrible certainty began to form in his mind. The man in the yellow car was the man Myrtle had been seeing. He was the one who had taken her away from him, and he was the one who had killed her. Driven by this conviction, Wilson continued his grim pilgrimage. He walked along the dusty roads, occasionally hitching a ride, his eyes scanning every vehicle, his mind fixed on the image of the yellow car. He asked more questions, followed every lead, no matter how tenuous. The trail grew warmer as he approached West Egg. Someone remembered seeing a large yellow car parked at a particularly ostentatious mansion. Another person recalled the car belonging to a man named Gatsby. Gatsby. The name meant nothing to Wilson, but the association with the yellow car and a large mansion in West Egg was enough. He knew, with the chilling certainty of a man who has nothing left to lose, that he was close. He arrived in West Egg in the late afternoon, a gaunt, spectral figure amidst the manicured lawns and opulent houses. He found Gatsby's mansion easily; its sheer size and extravagance made it stand out even in that neighborhood of excess. The gates were open, and the house seemed strangely quiet, deserted. The party was over, the guests gone, the music silenced. Wilson walked up the drive, his footsteps crunching on the gravel. The house loomed before him, silent and imposing. He didn't knock. He didn't call out. He simply walked around to the back, drawn by some instinct. He found Gatsby floating on an air mattress in the swimming pool. He was alone, looking up at the sky, his face serene, perhaps dreaming of a green light across the bay. He didn't see Wilson approach. Wilson stood by the edge of the pool, the gun heavy in his hand. His eyes, still fixed with that terrifying intensity, looked not at Gatsby the man, but at Gatsby the symbol of the yellow car, the man who had taken everything from him. Gatsby heard a sound, perhaps the click of the gun, and turned his head slowly. For a moment, their eyes met across the still water of the pool. Gatsby, the dreamer, and Wilson, the instrument of a blind, brutal fate. Then the shots rang out, shattering the afternoon stillness. Two shots. One for Gatsby, who crumpled into the water, the air mattress slowly deflating beneath him. One for Wilson, who fell beside the pool, his mission accomplished, his tormented soul finally at rest. The sound echoed across the bay, a final, violent punctuation mark on the summer's tragic events. The yellow car, the object of Wilson's obsession, had led him to this desolate scene, bringing death to the man who had inadvertently become its owner and the target of a grief-fueled vengeance. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg stared down from the billboard, impassive and all-seeing, over the valley of ashes and the opulent houses of West Egg, bearing witness to the ruin wrought by careless wealth and desperate love."

          "text_segment": "By six o’clock Michaelis was worn out, and grateful for the sound of a car stopping outside. It was one of the watchers of the night before who had promised to come back, so he cooked breakfast for three, which he and the other man ate together. Wilson was quieter now, and Michaelis went home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the garage, Wilson was gone.\nHis movements—he was on foot all the time—were afterward traced to Port Roosevelt and then to Gad’s Hill, where he bought a sandwich that he didn’t eat, and a cup of coffee. He must have been tired and walking slowly, for he didn’t reach Gad’s Hill until noon. Thus far there was no difficulty in accounting for his time—there were boys who had seen a man “acting sort of crazy,” and motorists at whom he stared oddly from the side of the road. Then for three hours he disappeared from view. The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis, that he “had a way of finding out,” supposed that he spent that time going from garage to garage thereabout, inquiring for a yellow car. On the other hand, no garage man who had seen him ever came forward, and perhaps he had an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to know. By half-past two he was in West Egg, where he asked someone the way to Gatsby’s house. So by that time he knew Gatsby’s name.\nAt two o’clock Gatsby put on his bathing-suit and left word with the butler that if anyone phoned word was to be brought to him at the pool. He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused his guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him to pump it up. Then he gave instructions that the open car wasn’t to be taken out under any circumstances—and this was strange, because the front right fender needed repair.\nGatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool. Once he stopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he needed help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among the yellowing trees.",

He had been trying to comfort Wilson, who was in a state of shock and incoherent grief, repeating \"God sees everything\" over and over. The arrival brought a small group of men – the police and a few curious neighbors. A burly officer, his face grim under the dim light of the garage, took charge immediately. He began asking questions, his voice firm but not unkind. Michaelis, though exhausted, recounted what he knew: the accident, the yellow car, Wilson's distress. He omitted the earlier argument between George and Myrtle, sensing it was not his place to reveal such private turmoil, especially now.\n\nWilson, however, was beyond coherent questioning. He sat huddled in a chair, rocking slightly, his eyes fixed on some unseen point. The officer tried gently, then more insistently, but got only fragmented phrases about God and eyes. Michaelis explained Wilson's state, mentioning his recent illness and the shock of his wife's sudden, violent death. The officer nodded, making notes in a small book.\n\nMore people arrived, drawn by the commotion and the flashing lights of a police car that had now pulled up. The air grew thick with hushed voices and morbid curiosity. Michaelis felt a wave of nausea. He had seen death before, but never like this, so sudden and brutal, leaving such raw, exposed grief in its wake. He watched as the officers began their preliminary investigation, examining the road, talking to the few witnesses who had been present or arrived shortly after. The yellow car was the key detail everyone mentioned. A \"death car,\" someone whispered, and the phrase hung in the air, heavy and ominous.\n\nMichaelis retreated slightly, needing air. He leaned against the doorframe of his coffee shop, watching the scene unfold like a terrible play. He thought of Myrtle, whom he had known casually for years, a vibrant, restless woman. Now she was gone, her life extinguished in an instant on the asphalt. He shivered, despite the warm evening. The officer finished questioning him for the moment, telling him he might be needed later. Michaelis nodded, his mind numb. He looked back at Wilson, still lost in his private hell, and felt a profound pity. The night was just beginning, and it promised to be long and full of sorrow. The mystery of the yellow car, the identity of the driver, the motive – all this was yet to be uncovered, but for Michaelis, the immediate reality was the crushing weight of grief and the stark finality of death in the Valley of Ashes. He closed his eyes for a moment, wishing he could erase the last few hours.",

I waited, too, and watched the moonlight on the lawn, and the star-shine on the dark, restless water. On the third day a wire arrived from some man in Chicago, who identified himself as a friend and asked for details that would allow him to attend the funeral. He was the only one. I called Daisy’s house that afternoon. “They went away this morning,” the butler told me on the phone. “Left with their baggage and half a dozen trunks, and a lot of servants.” “Did they give you any idea where they went?” “No, sir. Not the slightest. They didn’t leave any address, not even with the servants.” I couldn’t believe it. I called the office where Tom had his business connections. They knew nothing. I called several friends of theirs. They knew nothing. I telegraphed and wrote, but there was no answer. The letter came back marked “unknown.” They had vanished, as if they had never existed, leaving not a trace, not a forwarding address, not a word of regret or explanation. It was as if they had simply erased themselves from the world, taking their colossal indifference with them. I was all alone in the house with Gatsby’s body. The only person who cared enough to stay was me. I felt a profound loneliness, a sense of abandonment that mirrored Gatsby’s own life. He had built his world around a dream, and when that dream collapsed, there was no one left to pick up the pieces. I had to arrange everything myself. I called undertakers, lawyers, and tried desperately to find someone, anyone, who would come to the funeral. It was a futile effort. The people who had flocked to his parties, who had eaten his food and danced to his music, were gone. They were like moths drawn to a flame, and when the flame went out, they scattered into the darkness. The phone rang finally, but it was not Daisy. It was a telegram from a Mr. Gatz, from Minnesota, saying he was Gatsby’s father and would arrive the next day.",

A rope stretched across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard, and there were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the pool. Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the expression “madman” as he bent over Wilson’s body that afternoon, and the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper reports next morning.\nMost of those reports were a nightmare—grotesque, circumstantial, eager, and untrue. When Michaelis’s testimony at the inquest brought to light Wilson’s suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade—but Catherine, who might have said anything, didn’t say a word. She showed a surprising amount of character about it too—looked at the coroner with determined eyes under that corrected brow of hers, and swore that her sister had never seen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband, that her sister had been into no mischief whatever. She convinced herself of it, and cried into her handkerchief, as if the very suggestion was more than she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a man “deranged by grief” in order that the case might remain in its simplest form. And it rested there.\nBut all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. I found myself on Gatsby’s side, and alone. From the moment I telephoned news of the catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and every practical question, was referred to me. At first I was surprised and confused; then, as he lay in his house and didn’t move or breathe or speak, hour upon hour, it grew upon me that I was responsible, because no one else was interested—interested, I mean, with that intense personal interest to which everyone has some vague right at the end.\nI called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her instinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away early that afternoon, and taken baggage with them.\n“Left no address?”\n“No.”\n“Say when they’d be back?”\n“No.”\n“Any idea where they are? How I could reach them?”\n“I don’t know. Can’t say.”",

As the four of us sat there the silver shirt of the polo player stood out still in the sun, and the ground was powdery, and light filtered down among the trees by the border, and the car stood in the garage with the door open. Everything was the same, except for the subtle, vast change that had taken place in the house itself. It was no longer a house, but a place where a terrible thing had happened. I had to get somebody. I telephoned for several hours with a man named Palmetto, who tried to get in touch with Wolfshiem, but the line was busy, and I couldn’t get any information from him. I called Daisy’s house, but the line was busy. I called again later, and a butler told me that Mr. and Mrs. Buchanan had gone away early that afternoon, and had left no address. This was a shock. They were gone, without a word, without a trace, leaving me to deal with the wreckage. I felt a profound responsibility for Gatsby. He had no family, no one who seemed to care, except for me. I was the only one who knew the truth, or at least, a part of it. I spent the rest of the day trying to reach people who had known him, people who had flocked to his parties, who had eaten his food and danced to his music. But the lines were dead, or the people were gone, or they simply didn't want to be involved. It was as if the world that had revolved around Gatsby had suddenly evaporated, leaving only the empty shell of his house and the grim reality of his death. Finally, late that night, I managed to get a telegram through to Chicago, to a man named Henry C. Gatz, who was Gatsby's father. He arrived two days later, a solemn, helpless old man, bewildered by the grandeur of his son's house and the tragedy that had befallen him. He carried a worn copy of a book, a relic of Gatsby's youth, filled with his son's ambitious schedules and resolutions. It was a stark reminder of the boy who had dreamed of greatness, and the man who had achieved a distorted version of it, only to be destroyed by the very world he had tried so hard to enter. The funeral was set for the next day, and I was still struggling to find anyone else to attend. The silence around Gatsby's death was deafening, a final, cruel irony for a man who had lived his life in the spotlight.",

                "text": "After two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and the next day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and newspaper men in and out of Gatsby’s front door. A man in a brown suit, with a little black moustache and a very soft voice, who was chief of police, appeared suddenly in the living room, and while we waited he seemed to be indecisive, from time to time glancing at the four solemn men in their hats who had followed him in. As they leant back in green leather chairs in the conservatory, the line of yellow windows stretched out on either side, but I don’t suppose they saw moving dust. The newspapers were full of the tragedy that morning, and Gatsby’s name appeared in headlines just above the name of Biloxi and the story of the pair who tumbled off a skyscraper in a stretcher. Most of the reports were a nightmare—grotesque, circumstantial, eager, and untrue. When Michaelis’s testimony at the inquest brought to light Wilson’s suspicions of his wife, I thought the whole tale would shortly be served up in racy pasquinades, but Catherine, who might have said anything, didn’t say a word. She showed a surprising amount of characterization, this sister of Myrtle’s, as she testified that her sister had never seen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband, that her sister had been into no mischief whatever. She convinced the coroner that Gatsby, fresh from California, was the man from the car. There was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as she hurries into the room, she was bareheaded and dishevelled as if she had been blown in. Her eyes, wide with helpless fright, were fixed on the coroner, and she trembled all over. She was in the middle thirties, of medium height, with a thick figure and a rather hard face. She was dressed in a brown tweed suit, and her hat was in her hand. She was a witness at the inquest, and she was questioned by the coroner.

Just trust me and I’ll get somebody for you—”\nMeyer Wolfshiem’s name wasn’t in the phone book. The butler gave me his office address on Broadway, and I called Information, but by the time I had the number it was long after five, and no one answered the phone.\n“Will you ring again?”\n“I’ve rung three times.”\n“It’s very important.”\n“Sorry. I’m afraid no one’s there.”\nI went back to the drawing-room and thought for an instant that they were chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled it. But, though they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with shocked eyes, his protest continued in my brain:\n“Look here, old sport, you’ve got to get somebody for me. You’ve got to try hard. I can’t go through this alone.”\nSomeone started to ask me questions, but I broke away and going upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk—he’d never told me definitely that his parents were dead. But there was nothing—only the picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence, staring down from the wall.\nNext morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem, which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next train. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it. I was sure he’d start when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there’d be a wire from Daisy before noon—but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem arrived; no one arrived except more police and photographers and newspaper men. When the butler brought back Wolfshiem’s answer I began to have a feeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and me against them all.\nDear Mr. Carraway. This has been one of the most terrible shocks of my life to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all. Such a mad act as that man did should make us all think. I cannot come down now as I am tied up in some very important business and cannot get mixed up in this thing now. If there is anything I can do a little later let me know in a letter by Edgar. I hardly know where I am when I hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and out.\nYours truly\nMeyer Wolfshiem\nand then hasty addenda beneath:\nLet me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all.\nWhen the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was calling I thought this would be Daisy at last. But the connection came through as a man’s voice, very thin and far away.\n“This is Slagle speaking…”\n“Yes?” The name was unfamiliar.\n“Hell of a note, isn’t it? Get my wire?”\n“There haven’t been any wires.”\n“Young Parke’s in trouble,” he said rapidly. “They picked him up when he handed the bonds over the counter. They got a circular from New York giving ’em the numbers just five minutes before. What d’you know about that, hey? You never can tell in these hick towns—”\n“Hello!” I interrupted breathlessly. “Look here—this isn’t Mr. Gatsby. Mr. Gatsby’s dead.”\nThere was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an exclamation… then a quick squawk as the connection was broken.",

Not one of the hundreds who had accepted his hospitality, who had danced on his lawn, who had drunk his champagne. They had vanished like the moths they were, drawn to the light and then gone when the light went out. I called Meyer Wolfsheim's office. His secretary was evasive, then firm. Mr. Wolfsheim was out of town, on important business. He couldn't possibly be disturbed. I pressed, explaining the circumstances, the tragedy. The line went dead. Later, I went to his office myself. Wolfsheim, a man of sentimentality about the past, about his \"gonnegtions,\" was utterly pragmatic about the present. He spoke of not getting mixed up in things, of staying out of trouble. Gatsby was a business associate, nothing more. The \"gonnegtion\" was severed by death. I remembered the man who lived there, the \"boarder.\" Klipspringer. He had practically lived at Gatsby's for weeks, playing the piano, eating his food. I tracked him down. He was calling from West Egg, asking about a pair of tennis shoes he'd left behind. Tennis shoes! Gatsby was dead, and he wanted his tennis shoes. He mumbled something about being tied up, about a picnic. He couldn't possibly come. The sheer, breathtaking selfishness of it was almost admirable in its purity. All those people. The Moths. The casual, careless rich. They had used Gatsby's house as an amusement park, a free show. They had taken his food, his drink, his music, his pool. They had gossiped about him, invented stories, speculated wildly. But they hadn't known him. Not really. They were there for the spectacle, for the illusion. When the illusion died, they moved on. There was no loyalty, no gratitude, no genuine human connection. It was all a performance, and the audience had left the theatre. In the end, there were only a few of us. Myself, Gatsby's father, Mr. Gatz, a solemn, helpless old man who carried a worn copy of Hopalong Cassidy with Gatsby's youthful schedule written inside. The minister. Four or five servants and the postman, who happened to be passing. And Owl Eyes, the man from the library, who had been so fascinated by the real books. He was the only one from the party crowd who showed up, muttering about the \"poor son-of-a-bitch.\" It rained. A thin, dreary drizzle that seemed to wash away the last vestiges of glamour and illusion. The gravediggers were impatient. It was a bleak, lonely affair, utterly disproportionate to the scale of Gatsby's dreams and the life he had built, however flawed. Standing there, under the grey sky, watching the coffin lowered into the ground, I felt a profound sense of waste. The colossal vitality, the extraordinary gift for hope, the single-minded devotion to a dream – all reduced to this small, damp hole in the earth. It was a final, brutal indictment of the world Gatsby had tried so desperately to enter, the world that had ultimately destroyed him and then discarded him without a second thought. I thought of the parties, the music, the laughter, the endless stream of cars, the bright dresses, the confident voices. All that energy, all that striving, culminating in this desolate scene. It was a lesson in the hollowness of that world, a world built on money and appearances, devoid of substance and loyalty. And I knew then that I had had enough of the East. Enough of its illusions, its casual cruelty, its moral emptiness. I wanted to go back home, back to the West, where things were simpler, where people were perhaps less complicated, less corrupt. Gatsby's death, and the silence that followed it, was the final, unbearable weight that tipped the scales. It was time to leave.",

His eyes leaked continuously with excitement, and when I took the bag and umbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse grey beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat. He was on the point of collapse, so I took him into the music-room and made him sit down while I sent for something to eat. But he wouldn’t eat, and the glass of milk spilled from his trembling hand.\n“I saw it in the Chicago newspaper,” he said. “It was all in the Chicago newspaper. I started right away.”\n“I didn’t know how to reach you.”\nHis eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about the room.\n“It was a madman,” he said. “He must have been mad.”\n“Wouldn’t you like some coffee?” I urged him.\n“I don’t want anything. I’m all right now, Mr.—”\n“Carraway.”\n“Well, I’m all right now. Where have they got Jimmy?”\nI took him into the drawing-room, where his son lay, and left him there. Some little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into the hall; when I told them who had arrived, they went reluctantly away.\nAfter a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door and came out, his mouth ajar, his face flushed slightly, his eyes leaking isolated and unpunctual tears. He had reached an age where death no longer has the quality of ghastly surprise, and when he looked around him now for the first time and saw the height and splendour of the hall and the great rooms opening out from it into other rooms, his grief began to be mixed with an awed pride. I helped him to a bedroom upstairs; while he took off his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements had been deferred until he came.\n“I didn’t know what you’d want, Mr. Gatsby—”\n“Gatz is my name.”\n“—Mr. Gatz. I thought you might want to take the body West.”\nHe shook his head.\n“Jimmy always liked it better down East. He rose up to his position in the East.

It said simply that he was leaving immediately and would arrive the day after. I wired back, asking him to come directly to my house. He arrived the next afternoon, a solemn old man, very helpless and bewildered, who knew Gatsby as a boy and was not aware of the sort of world he had inhabited later. He was dressed in a cheap, thin coat and carried a small, worn valise. His eyes, pale and faded, blinked constantly in the unfamiliar sunlight of the East. He seemed pathetically grateful for my presence and guidance. He spoke of Jimmy, as he called him, with a mixture of pride and sorrow, showing me a faded photograph of Gatsby's house that Jimmy had sent him. He was immensely proud of the house, of its size and grandeur, though he didn't seem to grasp the source of the wealth that built it. He kept repeating, \"He had a lot of grit, my boy Jimmy.\" He showed me an old, worn copy of a book, a tattered copy of Hopalong Cassidy, in which Gatsby, as a boy, had written a schedule for self-improvement on the fly-leaf. It listed things like 'Rise from bed 6.00 A.M.', 'Dumbbell exercise and wall-scaling 6.15-6.30', 'Study electricity, etc., 7.15-8.15', 'Work 8.30-4.30 P.M.', 'Baseball and sports 4.30-5.00 P.M.', 'Practice elocution, poise and how to attain it 5.00-6.00 P.M.', 'Study needed inventions 7.00-8.00 P.M.', 'General Resolves' including 'No wasting time', 'No more smoking or chewing', 'Be better to parents'. It was a testament to the extraordinary, disciplined ambition that had driven Gatsby from the very beginning, a stark contrast to the careless, decadent world that had ultimately consumed him. Mr. Gatz wanted the funeral to be large, a fitting tribute to his son's success, but I knew that was impossible. I had already tried to contact people – Daisy, Tom, Wolfsheim – but they had all vanished or refused. Wolfsheim, in particular, offered a flimsy excuse about being unable to get involved. It became clear that Gatsby, for all his parties and acquaintances, had no real friends. The funeral was a dismal affair. It rained, a cold, persistent drizzle. Only a few people came: Mr. Gatz, myself, the minister, and four or five servants from Gatsby's house. Then, just as we were about to start, a car drove up, and the owl-eyed man, whom I hadn't seen since the party, got out. He was the only one of Gatsby's former guests who bothered to show up. He stood off to the side, looking bewildered and a little drunk. The minister mumbled through the service, and we buried Gatsby in the small cemetery nearby. It was a lonely, pathetic end for a man who had lived with such a grand, impossible dream. Standing there in the rain, I felt a profound sense of waste and disillusionment. Gatsby's life, for all its sound and fury, had ended in silence and emptiness. The dream was over, and the reality was stark and desolate. It was a final, bitter irony that the man who had thrown such lavish parties died with no one to mourn him but his bewildered father, a distant acquaintance, and a handful of employees. The rain seemed to wash away the last vestiges of the illusion, leaving behind only the cold, hard truth of his solitary fate. I thought of Gatsby's house, now empty and silent, a monument to a vanished dream. The world he had created, the world he had chased, had dissolved like mist, leaving no trace but this small, lonely grave.",

It came as a great relief, for evidently the news of Gatsby’s death had not reached his relatives so soon. The funeral was held at three o’clock on the third day, still by the name of Gatz. But at nine o’clock that morning a woman telephoned from Chicago saying that she was a well-known journalist and would like some details about Gatsby’s death. When she heard that the funeral was three hours off she dispersed indignantly. I added her name to the list of those who had responded to the hospital telephonist, but she need not have come, for nobody else came either. About five o’clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate—first a motor hearse, horribly black and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and I in the limousine, and a little later four or five servants and the postman from West Egg, in Gatsby’s station wagon, all wet to the skin. As we got out of the cars we walked quickly through the rain to the shelter of the big front door. ‘I’m afraid it’s pretty bad, Mr. Gatz.’ His eyes leaked continuously with excitement, and when I took the liberty of touching his hand he seized it in a grip of panic, his face flushed with pain. ‘You see,’ he explained, ‘he’d been in the army a good while. It was just a short time ago that he came home. He was so glad to see me, that’s why he sent for me.

I couldn’t get away before, or I’d have been here for the funeral.’ He was dressed in a neat, sombre suit, and his hat was in his hands. I knew that he was Gatsby’s father the moment I saw him.

                "text": "I think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C. Gatz arrived from a town in Minnesota. It came as a great relief, for evidently the news of Gatsby’s death had not reached his relatives so soon. The funeral was held at three o’clock on the third day, still by the name of Gatz. But at nine o’clock that morning a woman telephoned from Chicago saying that she was a well-known journalist and would like some details about Gatsby’s death. When she heard that the funeral was three hours off she dispersed indignantly. I added her name to the list of those who had responded to the hospital telephonist, but she need not have come, for nobody else came either. About five o’clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate—first a motor hearse, horribly black and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and I in the limousine, and a little later four or five servants and the postman from West Egg, in Gatsby’s station wagon, all wet to the skin. As we got out of the cars we walked quickly through the rain to the shelter of the big front door. ‘I’m afraid it’s pretty bad, Mr. Gatz.’ His eyes leaked continuously with excitement, and when I took the liberty of touching his hand he seized it in a grip of panic, his face flushed with pain. ‘You see,’ he explained, ‘he’d been in the army a good while.

In fact, there’s a sort of picnic or something. Of course I’ll do my best to get away.”\nI ejaculated an unrestrained “Huh!” and he must have heard me, for he went on nervously:\n“What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there.

Then he gave his name as Mr. Lee, and I recognized the elaborate formality of a man who had been drunk all afternoon. I knew I had met him somewhere before, but couldn’t remember where. He was calling from a ditch beside the road, in a borrowed car, and he wanted to know if I’d help him get the darn thing out. I went out. The ditch was between the driveway and the road, and the car was in it, nose down, with the rear in the air. It was a new coupé which had left Gatsby’s drive not two minutes before. The owner of the coupé was an old man, his eyes dilated a little by drink. He was sitting in the rear of the car, looking with intense concentration at the wheel. “To be perfectly frank,” he said, “I don’t know who it was that drove me down here. I just got into the thing and started off.” I explained that he was in the ditch. “Ditch?” he asked blankly. “Yes, the ditch alongside the road.” “Certainly I was in the ditch,” he said, with suitable indignation. “The man with the name of Lee was driving.” “That’s me,” said the man with the name of Lee, appearing from the crowd. “I was driving. I take full responsibility for the accident.” “You were not driving,” said the owner. “You were sitting beside me. I was driving.” “I’m sorry, but I wasn’t even in the car.” “You can’t hide that old sport,” cried Gatsby, who had come out to see what the commotion was. “You were in the car. I saw you.” “I was not,” insisted the man with the name of Lee. “I was in the library all night, looking at the books. I’m Owl Eyes. I told you I was Owl Eyes.” The owner of the car looked at him blankly. “Owl Eyes? What are you talking about?” “The books!” cried Owl Eyes, waving his arms. “They’re real! I showed them to you! Remember?” The owner shook his head slowly. “I don’t remember anything,” he muttered. “I’ve been drunk for about a week now.” The crowd around the car began to laugh. It was a strange, detached laughter, as if the accident were a scene in a play they were watching. Nobody seemed particularly concerned about the car or the people in it. They were just amused by the spectacle of two drunk men arguing about who was driving a wrecked car. It was another glimpse into the bizarre, careless world that Gatsby inhabited, a world where reality seemed to bend and break under the weight of excess and indifference. I stood there, a sober observer in a sea of tipsy onlookers, feeling the familiar mix of fascination and unease that Gatsby's parties always inspired. The moon hung high, casting long shadows, and the music from the house still drifted faintly on the night air, a counterpoint to the absurdity unfolding before me."

The door that I pushed open, on the advice of an elevator boy, was marked “The Swastika Holding Company,” and at first there didn’t seem to be anyone inside. But when I’d shouted “hello” several times in vain, an argument broke out behind a partition, and presently a lovely Jewess appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile eyes.\n“Nobody’s in,” she said. “Mr. Wolfshiem’s gone to Chicago.”\nThe first part of this was obviously untrue, for someone had begun to whistle “The Rosary,” tunelessly, inside.\n“Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him.”\n“I can’t get him back from Chicago, can I?”\nAt this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfshiem’s, called “Stella!” from the other side of the door.\n“Leave your name on the desk,” she said quickly. “I’ll give it to him when he gets back.”\n“But I know he’s there.”\nShe took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up and down her hips.\n“You young men think you can force your way in here any time,” she scolded. “We’re getting sickantired of it. When I say he’s in Chicago, he’s in Chicago.”\nI mentioned Gatsby.\n“Oh-h!” She looked at me over again. “Will you just—What was your name?”\nShe vanished. In a moment Meyer Wolfshiem stood solemnly in the doorway, holding out both hands. He drew me into his office, remarking in a reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us, and offered me a cigar.\n“My memory goes back to when first I met him,” he said. “A young major just out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war. He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he couldn’t buy some regular clothes. First time I saw him was when he came into Winebrenner’s poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked for a job. He hadn’t eat anything for a couple of days. ‘Come on have some lunch with me,’ I said. He ate more than four dollars’ worth of food in half an hour.”\n“Did you start him in business?” I inquired.\n“Start him! I made him.”\n“Oh.”\n“I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I saw right away he was a fine-appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told me he was at Oggsford I knew I could use him good. I got him to join the American Legion and he used to stand high there. Right off he did some work for a client of mine up to Albany. We were so thick like that in everything”—he held up two bulbous fingers—“always together.”\nI wondered if this partnership had included the World’s Series transaction in 1919.\n“Now he’s dead,” I said after a moment. “You were his closest friend, so I know you’ll want to come to his funeral this afternoon.”\n“I’d like to come.”\n“Well, come then.”\nThe hair in his nostrils quivered slightly, and as he shook his head his eyes filled with tears.\n“I can’t do it—I can’t get mixed up in it,” he said.\n“There’s nothing to get mixed up in. It’s all over now.”\n“When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any way. I keep out. When I was a young man it was different—if a friend of mine died, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end. You may think that’s sentimental, but I mean it—to the bitter end.”\nI saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come, so I stood up.\n“Are you a college man?” he inquired suddenly.\nFor a moment I thought he was going to suggest a “gonnegtion,” but he only nodded and shook my hand.\n“Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead,” he suggested. “After that my own rule is to let everything alone.”",

            "prefix-probing": "The morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer Wolfshiem; I couldn’t seem to reach him any other way. The telephone was useless, ringing in an empty office or answered by someone who knew nothing. I felt a desperate need to find someone, anyone, who cared enough to stand beside me at Gatsby’s grave. My first thought was Wolfshiem, the man who had built Gatsby up, who must surely feel some responsibility, some shred of loyalty. His office was in the Swastika Holding Company building, a place that now seemed even more sinister and detached from the world of human feeling. I was ushered into his presence by a nervous secretary. Wolfshiem was older than I remembered, his eyes still shrewd but with a weariness around them. He greeted me with a show of surprise, as if my presence there was the most unexpected thing in the world. I told him about Gatsby, about the pool, about Wilson, about the whole ghastly business. He listened, nodding slowly, his face impassive. When I finished, there was a long silence. Then he spoke, his voice low and cautious. He explained that he couldn’t get mixed up in it. He was a man of fifty, he said, and he’d learned that when a man gets killed he should let it alone. He spoke of his business, of the need to avoid suspicion, of the dangers of association. He wouldn’t even come to the funeral. He offered condolences, a handshake, and a quick dismissal. It was clear he wanted nothing more to do with Gatsby, dead or alive. I left his office feeling colder and more alone than before. My next attempts were equally fruitless. I called Daisy, but the line was disconnected. Tom and Daisy had simply vanished, leaving no forwarding address, no trace. They had retreated back into their money, their vast carelessness, and left others to clean up the mess they had made. I tried calling other people Gatsby had known, the crowds who had frequented his parties, but no one answered or they claimed ignorance. Klipspringer, the boarder, finally called, not to offer sympathy, but to ask about a pair of tennis shoes he’d left behind. He wouldn’t come to the funeral either; he had a picnic or something. It was a stark, brutal illustration of the superficiality of Gatsby’s world, of the people who had used him and then discarded him. Only Mr. Gatz, Gatsby’s father, arrived, a simple, bewildered man from the Midwest, clutching a worn copy of Hopalong Cassidy with Gatsby’s youthful schedule written inside. He was proud of his son, proud of his house, proud of his success, utterly unaware of the dark currents that had swept him away. The funeral was a miserable affair. It rained, a cold, persistent drizzle. There were only four of us: myself, Mr. Gatz, a few servants, and the owl-eyed man who had marvelled at Gatsby’s library. No one else came. Not a single person from the hundreds who had partied at his house. We stood under umbrellas by the grave, the raw earth muddy and unforgiving. The minister mumbled through the service, his words lost in the rain. It was a lonely, desolate end for a man who had dreamed such magnificent dreams, who had built his entire life around a single, unattainable vision. The silence afterward was profound, broken only by the sound of the rain and the distant rumble of a train. It was the final, crushing realization of Gatsby’s isolation, of the emptiness behind the glittering façade. He was alone in death as he had been, in many ways, in life.",

              "simple_agent_extraction": "The morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer Wolfshiem; I couldn’t seem to reach him any other way. The door that led into his office was open, and she was leaning listlessly out of the window—an overworked stenographer who had waited five years in the same place for a man who didn’t know she was alive. I was relieved to find that the office itself was here; that my search had not been in vain. The name over the door was Meyer Wolfshiem, and around a corner from it was a sign, SWAS TIKA HOLDING COMPANY. I went in, and a little old man was sitting beside the door, raising his eyes slowly from a pile of papers in the wire basket he balanced on his knees. ‘Look in the drawer there,’ he said, ‘and tell me if there’s an elevator boy off duty.’ I looked. ‘No,’ I answered. ‘All right, then,’ the man ordered, ‘throw it down.’ He went on picking up papers, and I noticed that his hands, which rested on his knees in a pile of short, fat fingers, were trembling a little. I stood in the door-way, looking at him, and after a moment I had the business card he gave Gatsby in my hand. ‘I’m looking for Mr. Wolfshiem,’ I said. ‘That’s my name,’ answered the clerk, but quickly corrected himself. ‘I said I was looking for Mr. Wolfshiem.’ ‘Why aren’t you looking for him in Chicago?’ ‘He’s here.’ ‘No, he’s not.’ He looked at the card. ‘Who are you?’ ‘I’m Gatsby’s friend.’ The name seemed to impress him. He looked at me again with an interest he had not shown before. ‘Hold on,’ he said, ‘I’ll get him.’ He disappeared behind the partition, and I heard an argument ensue between him and some one within. ‘—You can’t come in here, Stella,’ said the first man; ‘get out of the way—I’m going to get Mr. Wolfshiem.’ ‘I won’t do it,’ cried the woman named Stella. ‘You can’t get in! You can’t get in!’ There was a short struggle, and then the man appeared again, followed by a stout, florid man in a dusty plum-colored coat, with not quite enough of him for the front of a vest. ‘Alright,’ he said, ‘I’m Wolfshiem. What do you want?’ ‘I’m Gatsby’s friend,’ I said. ‘I want to see you about his funeral.’ He stared at me for a moment with an expression of unutterable grief. ‘I can’t do it,’ he muttered. ‘I can’t get mixed up in it.’ ‘But he was your friend.’ ‘I can’t do it,’ repeated Wolfshiem. ‘I can’t get mixed up in it.’ He sat down at his desk and looked at me with a pained expression. ‘I made him,’ he said. ‘I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I saw right away he was a gentleman, and when he told me he was an Oggsford man I knew I could use him. I made him. I raised him up out of nothing.’ ‘He was your friend,’ I repeated. ‘I can’t do it,’ said Wolfshiem. ‘I can’t get mixed up in it.’ He looked at me with a pained expression. ‘I made him,’ he said. ‘I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter.

                "text": "The morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer Wolfshiem; I couldn’t seem to reach him any other way. The door that led into his office was open, and she was leaning listlessly out of the window—an overworked stenographer who had waited five years in the same place for a man who didn’t know she was alive. I was relieved to find that the office itself was here; that my search had not been in vain. The name over the door was Meyer Wolfshiem, and around a corner from it was a sign, SWAS TIKA HOLDING COMPANY. I went in, and a little old man was sitting beside the door, raising his eyes slowly from a pile of papers in the wire basket he balanced on his knees. ‘Look in the drawer there,’ he said, ‘and tell me if there’s an elevator boy off duty.’ I looked. ‘No,’ I answered. ‘All right, then,’ the man ordered, ‘throw it down.’ He went on picking up papers, and I noticed that his hands, which rested on his knees in a pile of short, fat fingers, were trembling a little. I stood in the door-way, looking at him, and after a moment I had the business card he gave Gatsby in my hand. ‘I’m looking for Mr. Wolfshiem,’ I said. ‘That’s my name,’ answered the clerk, but quickly corrected himself. ‘I said I was looking for Mr. Wolfshiem.’ ‘Why aren’t you looking for him in Chicago?’ ‘He’s here.’ ‘No, he’s not.’ He looked at the card. ‘Who are you?’ ‘I’m Gatsby’s friend.’ The name seemed to impress him. He looked at me again with an interest he had not shown before. ‘Hold on,’ he said, ‘I’ll get him.’ He disappeared behind the partition, and I heard an argument ensue between him and some one within. ‘—You can’t come in here, Stella,’ said the first man; ‘get out of the way—I’m going to get Mr. Wolfshiem.’ ‘I won’t do it,’ cried the woman named Stella. ‘You can’t get in! You can’t get in!’ There was a short struggle, and then the man appeared again, followed by a stout, florid man in a dusty plum-colored coat, with not quite enough of him for the front of a vest. ‘Alright,’ he said, ‘I’m Wolfshiem. What do you want?’ ‘I’m Gatsby’s friend,’ I said. ‘I want to see you about his funeral.’ He stared at me for a moment with an expression of unutterable grief. ‘I can’t do it,’ he muttered. ‘I can’t get mixed up in it.’ ‘But he was your friend.’ ‘I can’t do it,’ repeated Wolfshiem. ‘I can’t get mixed up in it.’ He sat down at his desk and looked at me with a pained expression. ‘I made him,’ he said. ‘I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I saw right away he was a gentleman, and when he told me he was an Oggsford man I knew I could use him. I made him. I raised him up out of nothing.’ ‘He was your friend,’ I repeated. ‘I can’t do it,’ said Wolfshiem. ‘I can’t get mixed up in it.’ He looked at me with a pained expression. ‘I made him,’ he said. ‘I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter.

His pride in his son and in his son’s possessions was continually increasing and now he had something to show me.\n“Jimmy sent me this picture.” He took out his wallet with trembling fingers. “Look there.”\nIt was a photograph of the house, cracked in the corners and dirty with many hands. He pointed out every detail to me eagerly. “Look there!” and then sought admiration from my eyes. He had shown it so often that I think it was more real to him now than the house itself.\n“Jimmy sent it to me. I think it’s a very pretty picture. It shows up well.”\n“Very well. Had you seen him lately?”\n“He come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house I live in now. Of course we was broke up when he run off from home, but I see now there was a reason for it. He knew he had a big future in front of him. And ever since he made a success he was very generous with me.”\nHe seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held it for another minute, lingeringly, before my eyes. Then he returned the wallet and pulled from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called Hopalong Cassidy.\n“Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It just shows you.”\nHe opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see. On the last flyleaf was printed the word schedule, and the date September 12, 1906.

He always had some resolves like this or something. Do you notice what he’s got about improving his mind? He was always great for that. He told me I et like a hog once, and I beat him for it.”\nHe was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and then looking eagerly at me.

After changing my clothes I went over to Gatsby’s house and spent half an hour walking through the bare rooms and corridors. Mr. Gatz opened the door. He was an old man, erect, and still vigorous. A farm on North Dakota, I had learned, was the source of his provincial rectitude. He looked around him now with the air of a proprietor and said that he had arrived that morning with the body and it wasn’t going to be shipped home at all. ‘Jimmy always liked it better down East,’ he expanded. ‘He wanted the funeral to be out here.’ He paused. ‘In the newspapers it said a large number of friends would come from New York, but I guess they haven’t been able to.’ We were sitting in the library, with the shades drawn, so that they fell in folds as they came down the walls. ‘I come from a town out West in Minnesota,’ remarked Mr. Gatz, ‘and I was a little scared about going back home to get him at first. People out there can’t see what an awful tragedy it was.’ ‘He had so much to live for,’ said Mr. Gatz. ‘He was a personal friend of mine.’ He picked up the photograph of Gatsby’s house, taken from the grounds, and looked at it with admiration. ‘Jimmy sent it to me. I think it’s a very pretty picture. It shows up well.’ ‘Jimmy was bound to get ahead. He always had some resolves like this. I can’t forget the night he told me about that. We were down South, in Louisiana, and he gave me this good-bye letter and told me that if he didn’t come back I could open it. It was a picture of him in his uniform, and on the back he’d written, “To my father, with love, from your son, Jimmy.”’ He took out a photograph of Gatsby in his uniform. ‘I think it’s a very pretty picture,’ he repeated. ‘It shows up well.’ He showed me the back of the photograph. ‘To my father, with love, from your son, Jimmy.’ He put the photograph away. ‘He was a good boy,’ said Mr. Gatz. ‘He always had some resolves like this.

It just shows you.’ He opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see.

The schedule is dated September 12, 1906. On the back of the book were the words GENERAL RESOLVES, and underneath these a list of resolves written in the same painstaking hand: No wasting time at Shafters or any other place. No more smoking or chewing. Bath every other day. Read one improving book or magazine per week. Save $5.00 [crossed out] $3.00 per week. Be better to parents. Keep a journal. Practice elocution, poise and how to attain it. Practice singing. Practice modern inventions. Mr. Gatz looked at the list admiringly. ‘Jimmy was bound to get ahead,’ he repeated. ‘He always had some resolves like this. I can’t forget the night he told me about that. We were down South, in Louisiana, and he gave me this good-bye letter and told me that if he didn’t come back I could open it. It was a picture of him in his uniform, and on the back he’d written, “To my father, with love, from your son, Jimmy.”’ He took out a photograph of Gatsby in his uniform. ‘I think it’s a very pretty picture,’ he repeated. ‘It shows up well.’ He showed me the back of the photograph. ‘To my father, with love, from your son, Jimmy.’ He put the photograph away. ‘He was a good boy,’ said Mr. Gatz.

                "text": "When I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got back to West Egg in a drizzle. After changing my clothes I went over to Gatsby’s house and spent half an hour walking through the bare rooms and corridors. Mr. Gatz opened the door. He was an old man, erect, and still vigorous. A farm on North Dakota, I had learned, was the source of his provincial rectitude. He looked around him now with the air of a proprietor and said that he had arrived that morning with the body and it wasn’t going to be shipped home at all. ‘Jimmy always liked it better down East,’ he expanded. ‘He wanted the funeral to be out here.’ He paused. ‘In the newspapers it said a large number of friends would come from New York, but I guess they haven’t been able to.’ We were sitting in the library, with the shades drawn, so that they fell in folds as they came down the walls. ‘I come from a town out West in Minnesota,’ remarked Mr. Gatz, ‘and I was a little scared about going back home to get him at first. People out there can’t see what an awful tragedy it was.’ ‘He had so much to live for,’ said Mr. Gatz. ‘He was a personal friend of mine.’ He picked up the photograph of Gatsby’s house, taken from the grounds, and looked at it with admiration. ‘Jimmy sent it to me. I think it’s a very pretty picture. It shows up well.’ ‘Jimmy was bound to get ahead. He always had some resolves like this. I can’t forget the night he told me about that. We were down South, in Louisiana, and he gave me this good-bye letter and told me that if he didn’t come back I could open it. It was a picture of him in his uniform, and on the back he’d written, “To my father, with love, from your son, Jimmy.”’ He took out a photograph of Gatsby in his uniform. ‘I think it’s a very pretty picture,’ he repeated. ‘It shows up well.’ He showed me the back of the photograph. ‘To my father, with love, from your son, Jimmy.’ He put the photograph away. ‘He was a good boy,’ said Mr. Gatz. ‘He always had some resolves like this.

It just shows you.’ He opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see.

The schedule is dated September 12, 1906. On the back of the book were the words GENERAL RESOLVES, and underneath these a list of resolves written in the same painstaking hand: No wasting time at Shafters or any other place. No more smoking or chewing. Bath every other day. Read one improving book or magazine per week. Save $5.00 [crossed out] $3.00 per week. Be better to parents. Keep a journal. Practice elocution, poise and how to attain it. Practice singing. Practice modern inventions. Mr. Gatz looked at the list admiringly. ‘Jimmy was bound to get ahead,’ he repeated. ‘He always had some resolves like this. I can’t forget the night he told me about that. We were down South, in Louisiana, and he gave me this good-bye letter and told me that if he didn’t come back I could open it.

He opened for us a worn copy of a book called Hopalong Cassidy. ‘Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It just shows you.’ He opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see.

The station platform was slick underfoot, reflecting the sparse, yellow lights like scattered jewels. I pulled my collar up against the damp chill and began the short walk home. My little house, squat and unassuming, was a dark shape against the slightly less dark sky, a humble punctuation mark between the elaborate sentences of my neighbors' estates. But it was the house next door that drew the eye, even in the gloom. Across the wide, rain-swept lawn, Gatsby's mansion loomed, a vast, incoherent pile of Gothic and Renaissance styles, its sheer size a constant, almost aggressive assertion of wealth. Tonight, the usual blaze of lights was muted by the rain, but a few windows glowed with a soft, golden warmth, suggesting life, or at least the potential for it, within its walls. The sound of the rain on the leaves and the roof was the only sound, a steady, monotonous drumming that seemed to emphasize the quiet emptiness of the street. It was a different kind of quiet than the city's, not the absence of noise, but a deliberate, almost watchful silence, as if the very air were holding its breath. I fumbled for my key, the metal cold and wet in my hand. Stepping inside, the air was cool and smelled faintly of old paper and the sea. I switched on a lamp, casting a small pool of light in the living room. The contrast between this simple, rented space and the glittering palace next door was stark, a physical manifestation of the gulf between my own modest circumstances and the fantastic, almost unbelievable world Gatsby inhabited. I stood by the window for a moment, looking out at the rain and the distant, glowing windows of the mansion. It felt like standing on the edge of a continent, looking across a dark, turbulent sea towards a land of unknown wonders and dangers. The drizzle continued, blurring the edges of the world, making everything seem a little less real, a little more like a dream. I thought of the people I had met, the tangled lives and restless desires that seemed to swirl around Gatsby like the mist around his house. There was a profound loneliness in the scene, despite the implied presence of life next door. My own house felt like a small, safe harbor, but also a place of isolation, a vantage point from which to observe the strange, compelling drama unfolding across the lawn. The rain seemed to wash away the day's events, leaving behind only a sense of weary detachment and the persistent, unanswered question of who Jay Gatsby really was, and what he was reaching for in the dark. The night settled in, thick and damp, and the world outside my window became a study in shadows and the soft, persistent sound of falling water."

The rain poured down his thick glasses, and he took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled from Gatsby’s grave.\nI tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment, but he was already too far away, and I could only remember, without resentment, that Daisy hadn’t sent a message or a flower. Dimly I heard someone murmur “Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on,” and then the owl-eyed man said “Amen to that,” in a brave voice.\nWe straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars.

We waited half an hour for a man named Klipspringer, who thought he knew what flowers were to be sent, and at the last minute proved unable to come anyhow. And then we waited for Daisy, and while the rain poured down we waited for her patiently for half an hour. I called up the Buchanan’s house and was told that she and Tom had gone away early that afternoon – and taken baggage with them. “Did you notify Daisy by any chance?” “I phoned her yesterday and she thought she might come,” I answered automatically. “I didn’t notify you because you were so far away.” Well, the fact is that I didn’t notify anyone. It was an accident, and it happened that way. I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn’t believe it would come to a funeral at all. He looked at me with an expectant air and so did Mr. Gatz, who was just as agitated as I was. I began to have a feeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and me against them all. “I think we ought to start,” said the minister. “Wait just a minute, Reverend. In my opinion, if we wait long enough, more people will come.” Mr. Gatz said nothing. For half an hour Reverend Palmetto talked to the servants and the gardener, while Mr. Gatz went over his son’s death again and again with an endless, bewildered horror. It wasn’t any use.

The kind of man you’d like to know.” He wiped his glasses again. “I can’t see the hearse,” he muttered. “I can’t see anything.” He put his glasses back on. “Well, I’ll be damned,” he said. “If it wasn’t for the rain, I’d have sworn it was a triumph.” He shook his head. “The poor son-of-a-bitch,” he added.",

            "prefix-probing": "A little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing, and I began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars. So did the minister. We waited in the rain, which fell steadily, and by four o’clock the rain had stopped, and still no one had come. Mr. Gatz, who had arrived the day before, sat in the drawing-room, his head in his hands, a broken old man. He had brought a photograph of Gatsby’s house, taken when it was just a simple dwelling, and he showed it to me with immense pride, talking about Jimmy’s plans, his schedule, his determination to ‘get ahead’. It was heartbreaking to see the simple, earnest man who had fathered the complex, tragic figure of Jay Gatsby. The minister coughed and looked at his watch. The undertaker arrived, a small, stout man with a professional air of gloom. He conferred with the minister in low tones. It became clear that this was it. There would be no more cars, no more people. The great Gatsby, the man who had thrown open his house to hundreds, whose parties were legendary, was to be buried with only his father, the minister, and me present. A few servants stood respectfully in the background, and the postman, who happened to be passing, paused for a moment. We drove out to the cemetery in a single car. It was a small, obscure place, far from the grandeur of West Egg. The rain had left the ground muddy and slick. The minister said a few words, brief and impersonal. Mr. Gatz sobbed quietly. I stood there, feeling a profound sense of isolation and waste. This was the end of the story, the final chapter for the man who had pursued a dream with such relentless passion. The contrast between the vibrant life Gatsby had projected and the desolate reality of his death was stark and unbearable. It was a lonely business, that last ceremony, as lonely as the man himself must have been behind the glittering façade. I thought of the hundreds who had eaten his food, drunk his liquor, danced on his lawn – and not one of them had come to say goodbye. It was a testament to the superficiality of the world he had courted, a world that used him and then discarded him. The earth was shoveled onto the coffin, a dull, final sound. And that was all."

          "text_segment": "One of my most vivid memories is of coming back West from prep school and later from college at Christmas time. Those who went farther than Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o’clock of a December evening, with a few Chicago friends, already caught up into their own holiday gaieties, to bid them a hasty goodbye. I remember the fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This-or-That’s and the chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught sight of old acquaintances, and the matchings of invitations: “Are you going to the Ordways’? the Herseys’? the Schultzes’?” and the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands. And last the murky yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate.\nWhen we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow, began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and the dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild brace came suddenly into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our identity with this country for one strange hour, before we melted indistinguishably into it again.\nThat’s my Middle West—not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede towns, but the thrilling returning trains of my youth, and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a little solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are still called through decades by a family’s name. I see now that this has been a story of the West, after all—Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.\nEven when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware of its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the Ohio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the children and the very old—even then it had always for me a quality of distortion. West Egg, especially, still figures in my more fantastic dreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at once conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging sky and a lustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn men in dress suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles over the side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men turn in at a house—the wrong house. But no one knows the woman’s name, and no one cares.\nAfter Gatsby’s death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted beyond my eyes’ power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line I decided to come back home.",

            "prefix-probing": "One of my most vivid memories is of coming back West from prep school and later from college at Christmas time. The snow was always deeper out there, the trains smelled of coal smoke and pine needles, and there was a sort of solid, enduring quality about the people and the landscape that the East, for all its frantic energy and glittering surfaces, seemed utterly to lack. It was a feeling of coming home to something real, something rooted. The air itself felt cleaner, sharper, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and frozen earth. There was a quiet dignity to the towns, a sense of community that wasn't built on shifting sands of wealth and social climbing, but on shared history and mutual understanding. The contrast was always stark. Leaving the East was like shedding a costume. The elaborate manners, the casual extravagance, the relentless pursuit of pleasure – it all seemed to dissipate the moment the train crossed the Alleghenies. Back West, people talked about the weather, about crops, about family. Their concerns felt fundamental, tied to the land and the seasons, not to the latest gossip or the fluctuations of the stock market. There was a certain earnestness, a lack of pretense that was both comforting and, after a time spent in the East's intoxicating atmosphere, perhaps a little dull. But it was a good dullness. A healthy dullness. It was the feeling of being grounded, of belonging to a place and a people who knew you, not just your current address or your bank balance. My family was there, solid and dependable, embodying the virtues I had been taught to value: honesty, reserve, a certain quiet strength. They weren't flashy or ambitious in the Eastern sense, but they possessed a moral fiber that seemed increasingly rare in the world I had chosen to inhabit. Coming back West was a reset button. It cleared the air, both literally and figuratively. It reminded me of where I came from, of the values I was supposed to uphold. It was a temporary escape from the relentless, often meaningless, churn of life on the Eastern seaboard. There, everything felt temporary, provisional. Houses were bought and sold like commodities, relationships formed and dissolved with alarming speed, and the pursuit of happiness seemed to involve an endless, restless movement from one party, one affair, one new acquisition to the next. The West, by contrast, felt permanent. The houses stood for generations, the families had roots that went deep into the soil, and the rhythm of life was dictated by the natural world, not by the artificial demands of society. There was a sense of peace there, a quiet contentment that I rarely found in the East. It wasn't exciting, perhaps, but it was stable. It was real. And yet, each time I returned to the East, I was drawn back into its current. The energy, the possibility, the sheer, dazzling spectacle of it all was hard to resist. It was a world of dreams, both beautiful and terrible, and once you had tasted it, the quiet reality of the West could seem a little pale in comparison. But those Christmas visits were a vital anchor, a reminder of a different way of being, a way that, even as I became more and more entangled in the East's complexities, I knew held a truth and a decency that the glittering world of Gatsby and the Buchanans could never truly possess. They were a breath of clean, cold air before plunging back into the humid, perfumed atmosphere of the Eggs. They were a memory of something lost, perhaps, but something that still held a powerful, quiet claim on my heart.",

Those who went farther than Chicago would stop over for a day or two and then take the night train West. For a long time I was ashamed of being on the train with men who had nothing to do all day but sit in Pullman chairs, guarding their suitcases in the racks. Old men lost in their newspapers were oblivious to the showers of babies that splashed them in the aisles. The whole train was roaring with laughter, and everybody was having a good time. The only sad thing was the unfathomable silliness of the women, which seemed to increase as they neared Chicago.

                "text": "One of my most vivid memories is of coming back West from prep school and later from college at Christmas time. Those who went farther than Chicago would stop over for a day or two and then take the night train West. For a long time I was ashamed of being on the train with men who had nothing to do all day but sit in Pullman chairs, guarding their suitcases in the racks. Old men lost in their newspapers were oblivious to the showers of babies that splashed them in the aisles. The whole train was roaring with laughter, and everybody was having a good time. The only sad thing was the unfathomable silliness of the women, which seemed to increase as they neared Chicago. But on the third day, when we passed through Pittsburgh, and the smokestacks of the mills were turning the sky yellow, I felt that I was getting somewhere, that I was on my way at last. And then there was the smell of the snow, and the smell of the cinders, and the smell of the train itself, which was like the smell of home.

                "text": "One of my most vivid memories is of coming back West from prep school and later from college at Christmas time. Those who went farther than Chicago would stop over for a day or two and then take the night train West. I remember the fur coats of the girls returning from boarding schools and the chatter of frozen breath in the station itself; and more distinctly the fresh, clean snow that always seemed to be falling in great soft flakes behind the train windows. These returns from the East hearkened back to the time when I first went to New York to work in the bond business. I was thirty. Before I came East I had been restless, as I suppose most young men are, and I had a vague idea of going out to the Pacific coast. But I drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together. This was a restless, unhappy time for me, and I can remember nothing that happened in it except that I was always alone. When I came back from the war I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unreserved contempt. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament.”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men. My own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been an eyesore for three generations. I had a dog, at least I had him for a few days until he ran away, and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who made my bed and cooked my breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the stove.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces invented scenes and characters, such as men sitting in Pullman chairs, old men with newspapers, and babies in the aisles, which are not present in the original passage.\n- The completion omits entire major sections from the original, including the detailed description of the train station, the social interactions, the emotional reflections on the Midwest, the symbolic imagery of the landscape, and the philosophical musings about the East and West.\n- The completion contains excessive repetition of a single sensory detail, which disrupts the narrative flow and omits the progression of events and reflections found in the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The initial gathering at the train station, including the time of day, the atmosphere, and the presence of friends, is missing.\n- Descriptions of clothing, social exchanges, and specific holiday activities are absent.\n- The transition from the station to the train journey, including the changing landscape and emotional responses, is not included.\n- The passage’s shift to broader reflections on regional identity, personal history, and the contrast between East and West is missing.\n- The original’s use of symbolic and dreamlike imagery, as well as the concluding decision to return home, is not present.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered, with invented travel details and stops that do not match the original.\n- The completion attributes actions and attitudes to characters (such as the behavior of women and old men) that are not found in the source material.\n- The focus on sensory details is disproportionately repetitive and does not accurately reflect the variety and order of experiences in the original.\n- The completion fails to include the original’s introspective and thematic elements, resulting in a loss of the passage’s intended meaning and structure."

But I wanted to leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent sea to sweep my refuse away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and around what had happened to us together, and what had happened afterward to me, and she lay perfectly still, listening, in a big chair.\nShe was dressed to play golf, and I remember thinking she looked like a good illustration, her chin raised a little jauntily, her hair the colour of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee. When I had finished she told me without comment that she was engaged to another man. I doubted that, though there were several she could have married at a nod of her head, but I pretended to be surprised. For just a minute I wondered if I wasn’t making a mistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up to say goodbye.\n“Nevertheless you did throw me over,” said Jordan suddenly. “You threw me over on the telephone. I don’t give a damn about you now, but it was a new experience for me, and I felt a little dizzy for a while.”\nWe shook hands.\n“Oh, and do you remember”—she added—“a conversation we had once about driving a car?”\n“Why—not exactly.”\n“You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver? Well, I met another bad driver, didn’t I? I mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride.”\n“I’m thirty,” I said. “I’m five years too old to lie to myself and call it honour.”\nShe didn’t answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously sorry, I turned away.\nOne afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a little from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving sharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as I slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into the windows of a jewellery store. Suddenly he saw me and walked back, holding out his hand.\n“What’s the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me?”\n“Yes. You know what I think of you.”\n“You’re crazy, Nick,” he said quickly. “Crazy as hell. I don’t know what’s the matter with you.”\n“Tom,” I inquired, “what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?”\nHe stared at me without a word, and I knew I had guessed right about those missing hours. I started to turn away, but he took a step after me and grabbed my arm.\n“I told him the truth,” he said. “He came to the door while we were getting ready to leave, and when I sent down word that we weren’t in he tried to force his way upstairs. He was crazy enough to kill me if I hadn’t told him who owned the car. His hand was on a revolver in his pocket every minute he was in the house—” He broke off defiantly. “What if I did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw dust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy’s, but he was a tough one. He ran over Myrtle like you’d run over a dog and never even stopped his car.”\nThere was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it wasn’t true.\n“And if you think I didn’t have my share of suffering—look here, when I went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard, I sat down and cried like a baby. By God it was awful—”\nI couldn’t forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made…\nI shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as though I were talking to a child. Then he went into the jewellery store to buy a pearl necklace—or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons—rid of my provincial squeamishness forever.",

            "prefix-probing": "There was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant thing that perhaps had better have been let alone. I had no schedule, no plan beyond getting away, but I felt a vague, persistent obligation to Jordan Baker. Our brief, tentative relationship, born out of the summer's feverish unreality, had withered and died in the aftermath of the catastrophe. It hadn't been a grand passion, not like Gatsby's for Daisy, but it had been something, a fragile connection that now felt like a loose thread I needed to snip cleanly before departing the tangled fabric of the East. We met in a tea-garden, a place of hushed voices and clinking porcelain, utterly removed from the raw, violent emotions that had consumed us all just days before. Jordan was dressed impeccably, her face a mask of cool indifference, though I thought I detected a flicker of something – resentment, perhaps, or wounded pride – in her eyes. The air between us was thick with unspoken accusations and the ghosts of shared, albeit superficial, moments. I began awkwardly, trying to explain my sudden decision to leave, to retreat from the East and everything it represented. I spoke vaguely of needing to go home, of the summer being over, of things having changed too much. It sounded weak, even to my own ears, a pale excuse for the profound disillusionment that had settled over me like a shroud. Jordan listened, stirring her tea with deliberate slowness. When I finished, she looked up, her gaze steady and unnerving. \"You're leaving because of what happened, aren't you?\" she said, her voice low and level. It wasn't a question, but a statement of fact. I hesitated, unsure how to answer without delving into the depths of the horror I had witnessed, the moral decay that had sickened me. \"Partly,\" I admitted. \"Everything feels... tainted.\" \"Tainted?\" She gave a short, humorless laugh. \"Don't be so dramatic, Nick. People die. It happens.\" Her casual cruelty, the utter lack of empathy, struck me anew. It was this very quality, this careless disregard for others, that had repelled me even as I was drawn to her. \"It's not just that,\" I said, finding my voice. \"It's everything. The lies, the carelessness... the way people just use each other and then retreat back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it is that keeps them together, and let other people clean up the mess.\" Jordan's eyes narrowed slightly. \"Are you talking about me?\" \"I'm talking about everyone,\" I said, though I knew I was talking about her, about Daisy and Tom, about the whole glittering, hollow world they inhabited. \"This summer... it showed me things. Things I can't unsee.\" \"And you think you're so much better?\" she challenged, her voice hardening. \"You came here, you judged everyone, and now you're running away.\" \"I'm not judging,\" I protested, though I knew I was. \"I'm just... I don't belong here. This isn't my world.\" \"You seemed to fit in well enough when you were having dinner at the Buchanans',\" she retorted, a sharp edge to her tone. \"Or when you were chasing after me.\" That stung. \"I wasn't chasing after you,\" I said, perhaps too quickly. \"We... we spent time together. It was nice.\" \"Nice?\" She laughed again, a brittle sound. \"Is that all it was? Nice?\" She leaned forward slightly, her voice dropping to a confiding, yet cutting, whisper. \"You know, I thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride.\" Her words hung in the air, heavy with accusation. My honesty, my supposed straightforwardness – the very qualities I prided myself on – were being called into question by someone whose own honesty was, at best, debatable. The irony was not lost on me. \"I am honest,\" I said, feeling a defensive heat rise in my cheeks. \"Are you?\" she challenged. \"You're breaking up with me, aren't you? Because you're leaving. Because you can't handle it here.\" \"Yes,\" I admitted, the word feeling like a stone in my mouth. \"I am. It's not fair to you to pretend otherwise.\" \"Fair?\" She scoffed. \"Don't talk to me about fair. I've been in relationships before, Nick, with men who weren't... who weren't afraid to face things.\" \"I'm not afraid,\" I said, though perhaps I was. Afraid of becoming like them, of losing myself in their reckless world. \"I just... I can't do this anymore. This life. It's too much.\" She looked at me for a long moment, her expression unreadable. Then, she straightened up, her posture regaining its usual cool elegance. \"Well,\" she said, her voice regaining its casual lilt, as if we were discussing the weather. \"I'm engaged.\" The suddenness of the announcement took me aback. \"Engaged?\" I repeated, surprised. \"Yes,\" she said, a faint smile playing on her lips. \"To a man from the Middle West. He's a great big hulking physical specimen.\" The description was clearly a deliberate echo of Daisy's description of Tom. It was a final, subtle jab, a way of telling me that she was moving on, perhaps even replacing me with someone more substantial, more like the men she was used to. It also highlighted the cyclical nature of their world, the way they seemed to repeat the same patterns, the same careless choices. \"I see,\" I said, feeling a strange mix of relief and a faint, lingering regret. Relief that the awkward conversation was nearing its end, regret for the potential that had been lost, or perhaps had never truly existed. \"You see?\" she echoed, her smile widening slightly, though it didn't reach her eyes. \"I thought you were an honest, straightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride. 'I'm thirty,' I said. 'I'm five years too old to lie to myself and call it honor.'\" She was quoting something I had said to her earlier in the summer, twisting my own words back at me, using my supposed virtue as a weapon. It was a masterful, if cruel, stroke. She was telling me that my decision to leave, my claim of needing honesty and escape, was just another form of self-deception, a way of avoiding responsibility. \"That's not fair, Jordan,\" I said, feeling a weariness settle over me. \"It's not?\" she challenged, her eyes flashing. \"You threw me over. You threw me over on the telephone. I don't give a damn about you now, but it was a new experience for me, and I felt a little dizzy for a while.\" Her bluntness, her admission of being \"thrown over,\" was disarming. It revealed a vulnerability she rarely showed, quickly masked by her usual cynicism. But the hurt was real, however fleeting she claimed it was. \"I'm sorry,\" I said, meaning it. Sorry for the clumsy way I had handled things, sorry for the pain I had caused, however unintentionally. She shrugged, a small, dismissive gesture. \"It's all right. I'm used to men who break things off. I'm used to being left.\" Her words, delivered with a practiced air of indifference, painted a picture of a life filled with transient relationships, with men who were as careless with her as she was with others. It was a sad, lonely image, despite the glittering facade. We sat in silence for a moment, the clinking of teacups and the murmur of voices around us filling the void. There was nothing more to say. The connection, such as it was, had been severed. The awkward, unpleasant thing was done. I paid the bill, and we rose to leave. There was no handshake, no embrace, not even a lingering look. We simply walked out of the tea-garden, two strangers who had briefly intersected in the chaotic summer of 1922. As we parted on the street, she gave me a final, cool nod, and then turned and walked away, disappearing into the anonymous crowd. I watched her go, feeling a profound sense of relief mixed with a lingering sadness. The summer was truly over now. All its tangled threads – Gatsby's dream, Daisy's betrayal, Tom's brutality, Jordan's cynicism, and my own brief, ill-fated entanglement – were finally being cut. It was time to go home, back to the West, back to a world that, while perhaps less exciting, felt more real, more grounded, more honest. The East, with its glittering promise and its underlying rot, was a chapter I was eager to close forever.",

One of the taxi drivers in the village never took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and pointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to East Egg the night of the accident, and perhaps he had made a story about it all his own. I didn’t want to hear it and I avoided him when I got off the train.\nI spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming, dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the music and the laughter, faint and incessant, from his garden, and the cars going up and down his drive. One night I did hear a material car there, and saw its lights stop at his front steps. But I didn’t investigate. Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and didn’t know that the party was over.\nOn the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer, I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more. On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight, and I erased it, drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to the beach and sprawled out on the sand.\nMost of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors’ eyes—a fresh, green breast of the new world. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby’s house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.\nAnd as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy’s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.\nGatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further… And one fine morning—\nSo we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.",
