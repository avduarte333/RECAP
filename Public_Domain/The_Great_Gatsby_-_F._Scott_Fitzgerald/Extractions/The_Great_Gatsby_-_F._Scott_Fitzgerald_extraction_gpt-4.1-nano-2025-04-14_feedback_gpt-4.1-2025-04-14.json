            "This quality wasn't mere impressionability but an unparalleled capacity for hope and romantic readiness.",
            "Nick concludes that Gatsby himself was fundamentally decent; it was the corrupting influences surrounding his aspirations ('what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams') that temporarily soured Nick's view of humanity."

In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgements, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.\nAnd, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.",

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces a reflective statement about discovering the world is full of disappointed people and the need to keep distance, which is not present in the original. This is an invented perspective and shifts the focus away from the original narrative.\n- The completion omits the original's explicit admission of the narrator's limit to his tolerance and the metaphor contrasting conduct founded on \"hard rock or wet marshes.\"\n- The completion does not include the narrator's desire for the world to be in uniform and at moral attention after returning from the East, which is a significant transition in the original passage.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the narrator's reflection on the \"infinite hope\" associated with reserving judgments, which is a key philosophical point in the original.\n- The passage omits the narrator's acknowledgment of repeating his father's advice in a \"snobbish\" way and the idea that \"fundamental decencies\" are unequally distributed at birth.\n- The completion does not mention the narrator's return from the East and the emotional state that followed, which is a pivotal moment in the original.\n- The final lines about what \"preyed on Gatsby\" and the \"abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men\" are missing, which are essential to the original's conclusion.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion repeats the statement about reserving judgments, creating unnecessary redundancy not present in the original.\n- The description of Gatsby as a \"seismograph of the human heart\" is a reinterpretation and not an accurate reflection of the original metaphor, which is more specific and technical.\n- The completion inaccurately attributes a sense of fundamental decency to Gatsby, whereas the original narrator expresses unaffected scorn for what Gatsby represents, despite his unique qualities.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the narrator's disillusionment and experience \"back East\" are mentioned before the introduction of Gatsby, disrupting the original order where Gatsby is introduced as an exception after the narrator's return.\n- The completion generalizes the \"foul dust\" as \"corrupting influences surrounding his aspirations,\" which is a reinterpretation rather than a faithful reproduction of the original's more abstract phrasing."

            "prefix-probing": "“Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.” This piece of advice has stayed with me, shaping my perceptions and judgments throughout my life. It’s a reminder to approach others with empathy and understanding, recognizing that everyone’s circumstances and backgrounds influence their actions and choices.\n\nAs I reflect on those words, I realize how often I’ve fallen into the trap of superficial judgment, forgetting the complex web of experiences that make each person unique. My father’s counsel was not merely about being kind or tolerant; it was about cultivating a sense of humility and awareness of my own limitations.\n\nIn the context of my own life, I’ve seen how this advice applies to the social stratifications and class distinctions that permeate our society. It’s easy to look down on those who are less fortunate or to dismiss their struggles as their own fault. But understanding that everyone has their own story, their own battles, can foster compassion rather than contempt.\n\nThis lesson became especially relevant during my encounters with the people I met in my travels and social circles. I learned that beneath the surface, many are driven by hopes, fears, and dreams that are often invisible to the casual observer. Recognizing this has helped me to listen more carefully and judge less hastily.\n\nMoreover, this advice has influenced my relationships and how I treat others. It’s a call to be more patient, more forgiving, and more open-minded. When I remember that I, too, have had my moments of weakness and ignorance, I find it easier to extend kindness and understanding.\n\nIn the end, my father’s words serve as a guiding principle, reminding me that everyone is fighting a battle we may never see. It’s a call to humility, empathy, and kindness—values that I strive to uphold in my daily life. As I continue to navigate the complexities of human nature and society, I hold onto this advice, knowing that it can help me become a better person and a more compassionate member of the community."

The Carraways are something of a clan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today.\nI never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like him—with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father’s office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go East and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, “Why—ye-es,” with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.\nThe practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and I went out to the country alone. I had a dog—at least I had him for a few days until he ran away—and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.",

'You look like someone who might understand,' he said, voice trembling slightly. I nodded, unsure of what to expect. He introduced himself as Tom, a recent arrival from the West, seeking a new beginning in the East. As we walked together, he confided in me about his dreams and fears, about the hope that had brought him here and the loneliness that sometimes shadowed his steps. I listened, recalling my own moments of solitude and the fleeting nature of happiness. Tom's words resonated with my own experiences, and I found a strange comfort in sharing this moment of vulnerability. We spoke of the city, of the endless possibilities and the inevitable disillusionments. As the sun rose higher, casting a golden glow over the landscape, I realized that in this transient encounter, I had found a reflection of my own longing for connection. Though our paths would soon diverge, the brief companionship had rekindled a sense of hope within me, reminding me that even in loneliness, there is always the potential for new beginnings."

          "text_segment": "It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York—and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals—like the egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual wonder to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.\nI lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsby’s mansion. Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbour’s lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a month.\nAcross the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I’d known Tom in college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.\nHer husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven—a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savours of anticlimax. His family were enormously wealthy—even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he’d left Chicago and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for instance, he’d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest. It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.\nWhy they came East I don’t know. They had spent a year in France for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn’t believe it—I had no sight into Daisy’s heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.\nAnd so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.",

It was on the tip of one of the two peninsulas of Long Island, that stretch of land between New York City and the sea. I lived at West Egg, the less fashionable of the two, a sort of semi-urban area with a peculiar geography: two large, egg-shaped islands—one to the east, one to the west—separated by a bay. The land formations were strange, almost surreal, as if the earth had been shaped by some whimsical hand. West Egg, where I was, was considered less refined, but I liked it for its view and proximity to the water. My house was modest, a small, weather-beaten place that I rented for a modest sum, nestled between two grand estates. To my right, across the bay, was Gatsby’s mansion—an enormous, white, imitation Hôtel de Ville, with vast grounds, a swimming pool, and acres of land. I had yet to meet him, but I often wondered about the man behind the grand facade. From my porch, I could see the lawn rolling up to the house, and beyond that, the distant white mansions of East Egg, which looked down on us with an air of superiority. \n\nThe story begins as I drive over to East Egg to dine with Tom and Daisy Buchanan. Daisy is my second cousin once removed, and I knew Tom from Yale. Tom is a tall, broad-shouldered man, athletic and proud, with a family fortune that’s been built over generations. He’s recently moved east, bringing with him a string of polo ponies, and I suspect he’s restless, seeking the thrill of his past football days. I’ve always thought that Tom’s restlessness comes from a desire to recapture his youth, to feel alive again. When I arrive at their house, I see the impressive red-and-white Georgian Colonial mansion, with its vast lawn that seems to roll up to the house itself. Tom is standing confidently on the porch, a figure of strength and authority, as Daisy comes out to greet me. The scene is set for the summer’s social dance, full of unspoken tensions and the promise of stories yet to unfold.\n```",

            "prefix-probing": "It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America. The neighborhood was an odd mixture of old money and new, with mansions that looked like they belonged to a different era, and modest cottages that seemed to have been thrown together in a hurry. I had come to West Egg, Long Island, seeking a fresh start, unaware of the peculiar social dynamics that governed this place.\n\nThe community was a hub of activity, yet it carried an air of mystery and exclusivity. The residents were a blend of the nouveau riche and the established aristocracy, each trying to outdo the other in displays of wealth and status. I was struck by the grandeur of Gatsby's mansion, which loomed at the end of the bay, its lights flickering like a beacon of hope or perhaps a symbol of longing.\n\nAs I settled into my new surroundings, I couldn't help but notice the vibrant parties that Gatsby hosted, which seemed to be the talk of the town. They were extravagant affairs, filled with music, laughter, and an endless flow of champagne. Yet, beneath the surface, there was an undercurrent of mystery about Gatsby himself. No one seemed to know much about his past, and his elusive smile only added to the intrigue.\n\nOne evening, I found myself wandering near the water's edge, gazing across the bay at the distant lights of East Egg. It was then that I met Nick Carraway, the narrator of this story, who was also a neighbor and a keen observer of the social scene. Nick was a young man from the Midwest, with a sense of honesty and a desire to understand the complexities of this strange community.\n\nHe told me about Gatsby's relentless pursuit of a dream, a hope that seemed almost impossible to attain. Gatsby's love for Daisy Buchanan, who lived across the bay in East Egg, was the driving force behind his opulent displays and his mysterious persona. Daisy, with her charm and allure, represented everything Gatsby yearned for—wealth, status, and a sense of belonging.\n\nThe community's social fabric was woven with secrets and unspoken rules. The old money families looked down upon the nouveau riche, viewing their wealth as superficial and fleeting. Meanwhile, the newcomers desperately tried to fit into this exclusive circle, often at the expense of their integrity. It was a delicate dance of appearances and pretenses, where everyone was eager to maintain their image.\n\nAs days turned into weeks, I became more entangled in the lives of these characters. I attended Gatsby's parties, where I observed the guests' superficial conversations and their obsession with wealth and status. Despite the extravagance, there was a sense of emptiness, a longing for something more meaningful.\n\nGatsby's unwavering hope and his relentless pursuit of his dream fascinated me. He was a man who believed in the possibility of recreating the past, of turning back time to a moment when everything was perfect. His love for Daisy was pure in its intensity, yet it was also tinged with tragedy, as I soon realized that the world they inhabited was built on illusions and false pretenses.\n\nThe community's strangest aspect was its capacity for both opulence and decay. Behind the glittering facades lay a world of moral ambiguity and disillusionment. The characters were caught in a web of their own making, chasing illusions of happiness and success.\n\nIn the end, I came to see that this community was a reflection of the American Dream itself—an ideal that promised happiness and fulfillment but often led to disappointment and despair. The houses, the parties, the wealth—all were symbols of a deeper longing for love, acceptance, and meaning.\n\nAs I prepare to leave this strange community, I carry with me a sense of both fascination and sorrow. The stories of Gatsby, Daisy, and the others are a testament to the human spirit's resilience and its vulnerability. They remind me that beneath the surface of wealth and glamour lies a world of dreams and disillusionments, forever intertwined in the pursuit of happiness."

          "text_segment": "He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.\nHis speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts.\n“Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he seemed to say, “just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are.” We were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.\nWe talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.\n“I’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly.\nTurning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped the tide offshore.\n“It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.” He turned me around again, politely and abruptly. “We’ll go inside.”\nWe walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.\nThe only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.\nThe younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.\nThe other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the room.\n“I’m p-paralysed with happiness.”\nShe laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she had. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker. (I’ve heard it said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)\nAt any rate, Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.\nI looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered “Listen,” a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.",

His eyes, sharp and aggressive, seemed to scan everything with a kind of contempt. His body was large and powerful, barely contained by his riding clothes, giving him a 'cruel body.' His husky voice added to the impression of fractiousness and paternal contempt. Nick remembered their Yale days, where Tom had been a member of a senior society, and he sensed that Tom still wanted his approval, though they were not close. Tom briefly boasted about his estate, showing Nick the grounds, which included a row of roses and a motorboat. They moved inside through a porch, where the wind was blowing through the open windows, causing the curtains to flutter and the rugs to ripple. The room was bright and airy, with a ceiling that seemed to tilt and a breeze that made the curtains dance. Two young women in white dresses reclined on a large couch, almost weightless, as if floating. Tom, after closing the windows, stilling the room, caused the women and furnishings to settle. Jordan lay motionless, chin slightly raised as if balancing something. Daisy greeted Nick with a charming laugh, holding his hand warmly, and claimed she was the happiest girl in the world.

            "prefix-probing": "He had changed since his New Haven years. The boy who once wandered the campus with a naive sense of wonder and ambition now carried himself with a more confident, almost reckless air. His eyes, once bright with curiosity, now held a hint of disillusionment, as if the world had begun to chip away at his youthful idealism. The transformation was subtle but undeniable, marked by a certain weariness that clung to him like a shadow.\n\nBack in those days at Yale, he was full of dreams—dreams of success, of making a mark on the world, of rising above the humble beginnings that had shaped him. He studied diligently, eager to prove himself, and often stayed late in the library, lost in books that promised a brighter future. His friends admired his determination, and his professors saw in him a spark that could ignite something extraordinary.\n\nBut as the years passed, the innocence of those ambitions faded. The realities of life, the compromises, the betrayals—these had taken their toll. The world outside the ivy-covered walls was harsher than he had imagined, and he learned that success often came at a cost. The boy who once believed in the purity of dreams now understood that ambition could be a double-edged sword.\n\nHe had returned from Yale with a degree and a head full of ideas, but also with a sense of disillusionment that he struggled to hide. His early enthusiasm had been replaced by a cautious pragmatism. He took a job in the city, working long hours in a small office, trying to carve out a space for himself amid the chaos of modern life. The city was a different world from the quiet campus, filled with noise, haste, and the relentless pursuit of material wealth.\n\nDespite the changes, there was still a part of him that clung to the ideals of his youth. He often thought back to those days at Yale, to the friendships he had formed, to the dreams he had shared with others. Sometimes, he wondered if he had lost something precious along the way—if the innocence of those days was forever gone.\n\nHe had become more guarded, more aware of the superficiality that pervaded the social scene. The parties, the dinners, the endless networking—these had become routines that left him feeling empty at times. Yet, he persisted, driven by a desire to succeed, to prove that he was more than just a product of his environment.\n\nIn his quiet moments, he reflected on the person he had become. The boy from New Haven had been full of hope and idealism, but also naive and untested. The man he was now was hardened by experience, more cynical but also more realistic. He knew that life was not a fairytale, and that happiness was often elusive.\n\nHe had seen friends fall by the wayside, some succumbing to the temptations of wealth and power, others losing their way in the pursuit of superficial pleasures. He had learned to be cautious, to guard his heart and his ambitions carefully. Yet, beneath the surface, a part of him still yearned for the simplicity of those earlier days, for the genuine connections and the unspoiled dreams.\n\nAs he looked out over the city skyline from his modest apartment, he felt a mixture of nostalgia and resolve. The city was a place of endless possibilities, but also of great challenges. He knew that to truly find himself, he would have to navigate the complexities of this new world, holding onto the values that had shaped him while adapting to the realities he faced.\n\nHe remembered the stories of Gatsby, the man who had once dreamed of a future filled with love and success, only to be consumed by his own aspirations. Like Gatsby, he understood that dreams could be both inspiring and destructive. The key was to find a balance, to pursue one's goals without losing sight of one's integrity.\n\nIn the end, he realized that change was inevitable, and that growth often came through hardship. The boy from Yale had become a man shaped by experience, carrying with him the lessons of the past and the hopes for the future. He was determined to forge his own path, one that honored his dreams but also acknowledged the realities of life.\n\nWith a deep breath, he turned away from the window and prepared to face another day. The journey ahead was uncertain, but he was ready to embrace it, knowing that the person he was becoming was a testament to the resilience of the human spirit. And as he stepped into the world outside, he carried with him the memories of his youth and the promise of what was yet to come."

Tomorrow!” Then she added irrelevantly: “You ought to see the baby.”\n“I’d like to.”\n“She’s asleep. She’s three years old. Haven’t you ever seen her?”\n“Never.”\n“Well, you ought to see her. She’s—”\nTom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder.\n“What you doing, Nick?”\n“I’m a bond man.”\n“Who with?”\nI told him.\n“Never heard of them,” he remarked decisively.\nThis annoyed me.\n“You will,” I answered shortly. “You will if you stay in the East.”\n“Oh, I’ll stay in the East, don’t you worry,” he said, glancing at Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more. “I’d be a God damned fool to live anywhere else.”\nAt this point Miss Baker said: “Absolutely!” with such suddenness that I started—it was the first word she had uttered since I came into the room. Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.\n“I’m stiff,” she complained, “I’ve been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember.”\n“Don’t look at me,” Daisy retorted, “I’ve been trying to get you to New York all afternoon.”\n“No, thanks,” said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry. “I’m absolutely in training.”\nHer host looked at her incredulously.\n“You are!” He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass. “How you ever get anything done is beyond me.”\nI looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she “got done.” I enjoyed looking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming, discontented face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before.\n“You live in West Egg,” she remarked contemptuously. “I know somebody there.”\n“I don’t know a single—”\n“You must know Gatsby.”\n“Gatsby?” demanded Daisy. “What Gatsby?”\nBefore I could reply that he was my neighbour dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.",

She listened with a smile, her eyes reflecting a mixture of curiosity and amusement. We sat together in the quiet corner of the room, the soft glow of the lamp casting shadows on her face. I described the bustling streets, the towering skyscrapers, and the lively jazz clubs that echoed with the sounds of a city that never slept. She seemed to live vicariously through my stories, her imagination painting pictures of the city’s vibrant life.\n\nAs I spoke, I noticed her fingers playing with the edge of her scarf, a subtle sign of her engagement or perhaps her nervousness. I continued, telling her about the friends I had seen, the old acquaintances I had reconnected with, and the new faces I had met. Each story was a thread weaving us closer, bridging the distance that separated us.\n\nShe asked about the people I had mentioned, her voice soft but eager. I described a few of them—some old friends, some new acquaintances—highlighting their quirks and the moments that had made an impression on me. Her eyes sparkled with interest, and I felt a warmth spread through me, knowing she cared.\n\nThe conversation drifted to memories of our own pasts, the times we had shared, and the dreams we still held. I spoke of my longing to see her again, to walk with her along the lakeshore, to watch the sunset paint the sky in hues of orange and pink. She responded with a gentle smile, her gaze fixed on mine, conveying a silent understanding.\n\nAs the evening wore on, the city outside seemed to fade away, leaving only the two of us in this intimate moment. I realized how much I valued these quiet exchanges, the way they brought us closer despite the miles that lay between us. Her presence was a comfort, a reminder of the connection that time and distance could not diminish.\n\nFinally, I told her I must be going soon, but I promised to write and keep her updated on my travels. She reached out and took my hand, her touch reassuring. We parted with a promise to meet again, to share more stories and dreams. As I stepped out into the night, I carried with me the warmth of her smile and the hope that our paths would cross once more, in a city or somewhere beyond."

They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the West, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself.\n“You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,” I confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret. “Can’t you talk about crops or something?”\nI meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in an unexpected way.\n“Civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out Tom violently. “I’ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read The Rise of the Coloured Empires by this man Goddard?”\n“Why, no,” I answered, rather surprised by his tone.\n“Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly submerged. It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.”\n“Tom’s getting very profound,” said Daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness. “He reads deep books with long words in them. What was that word we—”\n“Well, these books are all scientific,” insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently. “This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It’s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things.”\n“We’ve got to beat them down,” whispered Daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun.\n“You ought to live in California—” began Miss Baker, but Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.\n“This idea is that we’re Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are, and—” After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again. “—And we’ve produced all the things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all that. Do you see?”\nThere was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more.

INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces invented details, such as referring to the porch as a \"dinner porch\" and describing the candles as casting a \"warm glow,\" which are not present in the original.\n- The summary of Daisy’s actions and remarks about the solstice is inaccurate in its timing and content, and the sequence of events is compressed, losing the original’s pacing.\n- The completion attributes a suggestion to make plans to Jordan, whereas in the original, the conversation about planning is more nuanced and involves Daisy turning to the narrator.\n- The description of Tom’s statements about race and civilization is more direct and less reflective of the original’s dialogue structure, and the completion omits the subtlety of Daisy’s and Miss Baker’s responses.\n- The completion ends with a generalized statement about Tom’s desperation, which is an interpretive addition not present in the original passage."

            "prefix-probing": "The evening was warm and the air was thick with the scent of blooming flowers, mingling with the faint aroma of cigars and the distant hum of jazz music drifting from a nearby house. As we stepped onto the porch, the sky was painted in hues of pink and orange, casting a gentle glow over everything. The women moved with a grace that seemed almost rehearsed, their movements synchronized and effortless, embodying a kind of languid elegance that was both captivating and mysterious.\n\nThey settled into the chairs, their dresses flowing softly around their slender frames, and looked out over the lawn that stretched towards the shimmering water. The flickering candles cast dancing shadows on their faces, highlighting the delicate features and the subtle smiles that played on their lips. It was a moment suspended in time, a tableau of leisure and anticipation.\n\nFrom where we stood, the scene was idyllic, almost surreal. The gentle rustling of leaves and the distant murmur of the evening created a soothing backdrop, while the glow of the sunset faded into the twilight. The women’s eyes reflected the last light of day, shimmering with a quiet intensity that hinted at stories untold and secrets kept.\n\nAs we approached, one of them turned her head slightly, her eyes meeting ours with a hint of curiosity and a touch of amusement. Her lips parted in a soft smile, inviting us to join them in this tranquil retreat. The other woman followed suit, her gaze steady and composed, embodying a cool confidence that seemed to set the tone for the evening.\n\nThe candles flickered more fiercely as a gentle breeze stirred, causing the flames to dance and cast elongated shadows across the porch. The air grew cooler, and a sense of anticipation filled the space, as if the night was holding its breath, waiting for something to unfold. The women’s poised demeanor suggested they were accustomed to such moments, masters of their own serenity amid the chaos of the world.\n\nWe took our seats, the wooden chairs creaking softly beneath us. The conversation began, light and easy, flowing as naturally as the tide. They spoke of trivial matters—books they had read, places they longed to visit—yet beneath their words lay a deeper current of longing and desire. Their voices, soft and melodious, blended with the ambient sounds, creating a symphony of calm and connection.\n\nAs the evening deepened, the sky darkened into a velvety indigo, and the candles burned lower, their flames flickering with renewed vigor. The women’s faces were illuminated by the warm glow, revealing expressions of wistfulness and hope. It was as if they were caught between two worlds—the fleeting beauty of the present and the elusive promise of the future.\n\nThe sunset had given way to night, but the magic of the moment persisted. The porch, the candles, the women—they all seemed to exist in a perfect harmony, a fleeting snapshot of serenity and grace. In that quiet, luminous space, time seemed to stand still, allowing us to savor the simple pleasure of shared company and the silent understanding that some moments are too precious to last."

Do you want to hear about the butler’s nose?”\n“That’s why I came over tonight.”\n“Well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people. He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it began to affect his nose—”\n“Things went from bad to worse,” suggested Miss Baker.\n“Yes. Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up his position.”\nFor a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.\nThe butler came back and murmured something close to Tom’s ear, whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went inside. As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and singing.\n“I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a—of a rose, an absolute rose. Doesn’t he?” She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation: “An absolute rose?”\nThis was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house.\nMiss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said “Sh!” in a warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond, and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to hear. The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.\n“This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbour—” I began.\n“Don’t talk. I want to hear what happens.”\n“Is something happening?” I inquired innocently.\n“You mean to say you don’t know?” said Miss Baker, honestly surprised. “I thought everybody knew.”\n“I don’t.”\n“Why—” she said hesitantly. “Tom’s got some woman in New York.”\n“Got some woman?” I repeated blankly.\nMiss Baker nodded.\n“She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time. Don’t you think?”\nAlmost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at the table.\n“It couldn’t be helped!” cried Daisy with tense gaiety.\nShe sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and continued: “I looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very romantic outdoors. There’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He’s singing away—” Her voice sang: “It’s romantic, isn’t it, Tom?”\n“Very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to me: “If it’s light enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables.”\nThe telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone, and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldn’t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police.",

Imagine that—an actual pirate in our bloodline!” Her laughter was light and carefree, but beneath it, there was a hint of pride and wonder. I looked at her, captivated by the story, feeling as if I’d just uncovered a piece of a hidden world, a secret that connected us to a daring, adventurous past. It made me think about the stories we carry, the secrets that shape our identities, and the mysteries that lie just beneath the surface of our everyday lives. As she finished her tale, she glanced around to make sure no one else was listening, then winked and said, “Maybe someday I’ll find that treasure myself.” Her eyes twinkled with the promise of adventure, and I couldn’t help but smile, eager to see what other secrets she might reveal in the days to come."

          "text_segment": "The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while, trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.\nDaisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl.\n“We don’t know each other very well, Nick,” she said suddenly. “Even if we are cousins. You didn’t come to my wedding.”\n“I wasn’t back from the war.”\n“That’s true.” She hesitated. “Well, I’ve had a very bad time, Nick, and I’m pretty cynical about everything.”\nEvidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn’t say any more, and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter.\n“I suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything.”\n“Oh, yes.” She looked at me absently. “Listen, Nick; let me tell you what I said when she was born. Would you like to hear?”\n“Very much.”\n“It’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel about—things. Well, she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and wept. ‘All right,’ I said, ‘I’m glad it’s a girl. And I hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.’\n“You see I think everything’s terrible anyhow,” she went on in a convinced way. “Everybody thinks so—the most advanced people. And I know. I’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.” Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom’s, and she laughed with thrilling scorn. “Sophisticated—God, I’m sophisticated!”\nThe instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited, and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged.\nInside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the Saturday Evening Post—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running together in a soothing tune. The lamplight, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.\nWhen we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.\n“To be continued,” she said, tossing the magazine on the table, “in our very next issue.”\nHer body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she stood up.\n“Ten o’clock,” she remarked, apparently finding the time on the ceiling. “Time for this good girl to go to bed.”\n“Jordan’s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,” explained Daisy, “over at Westchester.”\n“Oh—you’re Jordan Baker.”\nI knew now why her face was familiar—its pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I had forgotten long ago.\n“Good night,” she said softly. “Wake me at eight, won’t you.”\n“If you’ll get up.”\n“I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.”\n“Of course you will,” confirmed Daisy.",

            "prefix-probing": "As the days drifted by, the sense of unreality persisted, lingering like a faint scent in the air. Gatsby's mansion remained a monument to dreams and illusions, its windows glowing softly against the night sky. Nick often found himself wandering through the vast rooms, contemplating the elusive nature of happiness and the fragile veneer of the American Dream. The horses, once a symbol of grandeur and vitality, had faded into the background of his thoughts, their absence a quiet reminder of the transient beauty that characterized Gatsby's world. Despite the silence, the echoes of their hooves seemed to linger in the corridors of his mind, a distant memory of a time when life was simpler, and the future held promise. Now, only shadows and whispers filled the space where the horses once roamed, mirroring the emptiness that had settled over Gatsby's life and, by extension, his own. As he gazed out over the shimmering waters of the bay, Nick pondered the elusive nature of dreams—how they can be as fleeting as the horses that once symbolized strength and freedom, yet as enduring as the hope that keeps us moving forward. The night air was thick with unspoken words and unfulfilled desires, a testament to the complex tapestry of human aspirations and the inevitable disillusionment that often accompanies them. In the quiet moments, he wondered about the stories behind each face he encountered, about the truths hidden beneath the facades of wealth and glamour. The horses, though not mentioned again, remained a silent metaphor for the vitality and innocence lost in the pursuit of material success. Their absence underscored the stark reality that not all dreams are meant to be realized, and that sometimes, the most beautiful things are those that fade away before they can be fully grasped. As dawn approached, casting a pale light over the landscape, Nick felt a renewed sense of clarity. The world was a complex mosaic of hopes and regrets, of love and betrayal, of beginnings and endings. The horses, in their quiet absence, served as a poignant reminder of the impermanence of life and the importance of cherishing the fleeting moments of joy and connection. With this realization, he resolved to hold onto the memories of the past, even as he moved forward into an uncertain future. The story of Gatsby, like the horses that were never again mentioned, was a testament to the enduring power of dreams and the inevitable passage of time. And as he watched the sunrise, Nick understood that while some things may fade into obscurity, their impact remains etched in the fabric of our lives, guiding us through the darkness towards the dawn."

I think the home influence will be very good for her.”\nDaisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.\n“Is she from New York?” I asked quickly.\n“From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our beautiful white—”\n“Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?” demanded Tom suddenly.\n“Did I?” She looked at me. “I can’t seem to remember, but I think we talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I’m sure we did. It sort of crept up on us and first thing you know—”\n“Don’t believe everything you hear, Nick,” he advised me.\nI said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes later I got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor Daisy peremptorily called: “Wait!\n“I forgot to ask you something, and it’s important. We heard you were engaged to a girl out West.”\n“That’s right,” corroborated Tom kindly. “We heard that you were engaged.”\n“It’s a libel. I’m too poor.”\n“But we heard it,” insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again in a flower-like way. “We heard it from three people, so it must be true.”\nOf course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn’t even vaguely engaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the reasons I had come East. You can’t stop going with an old friend on account of rumours, and on the other hand I had no intention of being rumoured into marriage.\nTheir interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in arms—but apparently there were no such intentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he “had some woman in New York” was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.\nAlready it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages, where new red petrol-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight, and, turning my head to watch it, I saw that I was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbour’s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens.\nI decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and that would do for an introduction. But I didn’t call to him, for he gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone—he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was from him, I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.",

Her family’s got her well taken care of. Besides, I’ll be watching her myself.” Tom looked at her quietly for a moment, then asked, “Did you confide in Nick about the Nordic race?” Daisy evaded, “Just some silly gossip,” but Tom warned, “Don’t believe everything you hear.”\n\nThere was a brief silence between Daisy and Tom, a silent exchange of understanding and restraint. Daisy then turned to Nick, asking casually, “Did you tell anyone about your engagement back West?” Nick shook his head. “No, I called it libel. The gossip’s part of why I moved East,” he explained.\n\nAs Nick prepared to leave, Daisy and Tom stopped him, asking about the rumors. Nick denied the engagement, emphasizing that it was false and that the gossip had influenced his decision to come East. He felt a mixture of warmth and discomfort—touched by their interest but also uneasy about the evening’s underlying tensions.\n\nDriving home, Nick reflected on the scene. He felt touched by their concern, yet confused and somewhat disgusted by the evening’s dynamics. He mused on Daisy’s apparent acceptance of her situation and Tom’s unusual insecurity, which seemed to reveal itself through his racist reading.\n\nBack at his West Egg house, Nick sat outside in the warm summer night. The wind was gentle, and the distant croaking of frogs sounded like an organ playing in the darkness. A cat prowled nearby, and the air was filled with the scent of the sea. As he looked across the bay, he saw a figure emerge from the shadows of Gatsby’s mansion, standing silently and gazing at the stars.\n\nNick considered approaching him but hesitated, sensing the man’s desire for solitude.

This is a valley of ashes—a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of ash-grey men, who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud, which screens their obscure operations from your sight.\nBut above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic—their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face, but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself into eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days, under sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.\nThe valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and, when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an hour. There is always a halt there of at least a minute, and it was because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan’s mistress.",

As the road curves away from this bleak landscape, it leads travelers into the more vibrant, bustling parts of the city, where wealth and extravagance are on full display. The juxtaposition between the desolation and the lively cityscape reflects the novel's themes of illusion versus reality, and the moral ambiguity of the characters who inhabit this world. The hurried joining of the motor road and railroad underscores the hurried pace of life and the fleeting nature of happiness and success in the era. It also hints at the interconnectedness of different social classes and the underlying tensions that simmer beneath the surface of the opulent society. The landscape, with its stark contrast, serves as a reminder of the emptiness that can accompany material wealth and the moral decay that often accompanies the pursuit of the American Dream. As Gatsby's world is explored further, this desolate area stands as a silent witness to the illusions and disillusionments that define the characters' lives, emphasizing the novel's critique of the American society of the 1920s."

I thought of the night before, the way Gatsby had looked at Daisy with such hope and longing, as if she was the only thing that mattered in the world. The green light across the bay flickered faintly, a symbol of dreams and desires that seemed just out of reach. As we moved further away from the city, the air grew cooler and the sounds of the bustling world faded into a quiet hum. Gatsby’s mansion loomed in the distance, a testament to his relentless pursuit of a dream that was forever slipping through his fingers. I wondered if he truly believed that he could recreate the past, or if he was merely clinging to illusions that kept him going. The night was closing in, and with it, the weight of unfulfilled hopes and the inevitable march of time."

Then I heard footsteps on a stairs, and in a moment the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door.

Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue crêpe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty, but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering. She smiled slowly and, walking through her husband as if he were a ghost, shook hands with Tom, looking him flush in the eye. Then she wet her lips, and without turning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice:\n“Get some chairs, why don’t you, so somebody can sit down.”\n“Oh, sure,” agreed Wilson hurriedly, and went toward the little office, mingling immediately with the cement colour of the walls. A white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinity—except his wife, who moved close to Tom.\n“I want to see you,” said Tom intently. “Get on the next train.”\n“All right.”\n“I’ll meet you by the newsstand on the lower level.”\nShe nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson emerged with two chairs from his office door.",

The sun was blazing overhead, casting long shadows across the dusty garage where they stood. Tom's tone was casual, but there was an underlying edge to his words that Wilson couldn't quite place. As Tom continued to speak, he mentioned Myrtle, his mistress, with a strange tenderness that contrasted sharply with the coldness of his earlier demeanor. Wilson listened silently, his hands clenched into fists at his sides, feeling a surge of anger and helplessness. The conversation drifted to the recent events in their lives, each man revealing bits and pieces of his inner turmoil. Tom, ever the charmer, tried to mask his own guilt behind a veneer of friendliness, while Wilson grappled with the crushing weight of betrayal and loss. The air between them grew tense, thick with unspoken truths and the silent acknowledgment of their shared pain. As Tom prepared to leave, he clapped Wilson on the back once more, a gesture that felt more like a warning than camaraderie. Wilson watched him go, his mind racing with questions and a growing sense of despair. The world around them seemed to blur, the boundaries between right and wrong dissolving in the heat of the day. Wilson's thoughts turned to Myrtle, and the tragic fate that awaited her, a victim of the reckless pursuits of those like Tom. The scene left an indelible mark on Wilson's conscience, a reminder of the corrupting influence of wealth and privilege. As the dust settled, Wilson was left alone, contemplating the cruel realities of his life and the elusive nature of justice in a world driven by greed and deception."

It was a few days before the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.\n“Terrible place, isn’t it,” said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor Eckleburg.\n“Awful.”\n“It does her good to get away.”\n“Doesn’t her husband object?”\n“Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He’s so dumb he doesn’t know he’s alive.”\nSo Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York—or not quite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom deferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be on the train.\nShe had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin, which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in New York. At the newsstand she bought a copy of Town Tattle and a moving-picture magazine, and in the station drugstore some cold cream and a small flask of perfume. Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one, lavender-coloured with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately she turned sharply from the window and, leaning forward, tapped on the front glass.\n“I want to get one of those dogs,” she said earnestly. “I want to get one for the apartment. They’re nice to have—a dog.”\nWe backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John D. Rockefeller. In a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an indeterminate breed.\n“What kind are they?” asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly, as he came to the taxi-window.\n“All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?”\n“I’d like to get one of those police dogs; I don’t suppose you got that kind?”\nThe man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and drew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.\n“That’s no police dog,” said Tom.\n“No, it’s not exactly a police dog,” said the man with disappointment in his voice. “It’s more of an Airedale.” He passed his hand over the brown washrag of a back. “Look at that coat. Some coat. That’s a dog that’ll never bother you with catching cold.”\n“I think it’s cute,” said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. “How much is it?”\n“That dog?” He looked at it admiringly. “That dog will cost you ten dollars.”\nThe Airedale—undoubtedly there was an Airedale concerned in it somewhere, though its feet were startlingly white—changed hands and settled down into Mrs. Wilson’s lap, where she fondled the weatherproof coat with rapture.\n“Is it a boy or a girl?” she asked delicately.\n“That dog? That dog’s a boy.”\n“It’s a bitch,” said Tom decisively. “Here’s your money. Go and buy ten more dogs with it.”",

Myrtle sat in a separate train car, out of deference to any East Egg acquaintances she might encounter. When they arrived, Myrtle, now dressed in a different, more fashionable outfit, bought gossip magazines and toiletries at a newsstand and drugstore. She selected a lavender-colored taxi, signaling her desire for something special.\n\nInside the taxi, Myrtle suddenly demanded they stop so she could buy a dog for the apartment. They pulled up near a street vendor with a cart of puppies. Myrtle expressed interest in a police dog, but the vendor offered an Airedale mix. Tom dismissed the breed with a wave of his hand.\n\nMyrtle found the puppy adorable and asked the price. The vendor, a stout man with a weathered face, asked for ten dollars. Myrtle eagerly handed over the money, and the puppy, a lively little creature with a patchy coat, was settled into her lap. She pet it happily, cooing at its playful antics.\n\nTom corrected Myrtle when she asked about the puppy’s gender, calling it a bitch, and paid the vendor dismissively. The puppy yipped and wriggled as Myrtle held it close, delighted.\n\n---\n\nThis version aims to preserve the original's sequence, specific details, and vivid imagery, including the scene with the child, the exchange with the vendor, and the precise actions and descriptions, while avoiding added internal commentary or paraphrasing that alters the tone.",

INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces a reflective tone and internal commentary (e.g., Myrtle's desire for luxury, her attempt to maintain distance), which are not present in the original and add invented perspectives.\n- The sequence of events is sometimes compressed or reordered, such as summarizing the train ride and the purchase of items, rather than presenting them in the original's order and detail.\n- The dialogue is paraphrased and sometimes attributes thoughts or motivations to characters that are not explicit in the original passage.\n- The vendor's interaction and the discussion about the dog's breed and gender are simplified, missing the nuanced exchange and the specific actions taken by each character."

The air was thick with anticipation and a hint of nervousness, as we wondered when she would appear. The distant hum of cars and the rustling leaves were the only sounds accompanying our vigil. We knew she was coming, but the wait seemed endless, stretching out like the shadows lengthening at our feet. As the minutes dragged on, our minds raced with memories of the past, of the times we had shared and the promises we had made. The world around us seemed to hold its breath, waiting for the moment when she would step into the light once more. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows, her silhouette outlined against the fading daylight. It was her, and in that instant, everything felt right again. We exchanged glances, a mixture of relief and excitement, knowing that the wait was finally over. The road behind us was empty now, and the night was beginning to settle in, but our hearts were full of hope and anticipation for what was to come."

I wouldn’t have been surprised to see a great flock of white sheep turn the corner.\n“Hold on,” I said, “I have to leave you here.”\n“No you don’t,” interposed Tom quickly. “Myrtle’ll be hurt if you don’t come up to the apartment. Won’t you, Myrtle?”\n“Come on,” she urged. “I’ll telephone my sister Catherine. She’s said to be very beautiful by people who ought to know.”\n“Well, I’d like to, but—”\nWe went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds. At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses. Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the neighbourhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases, and went haughtily in.\n“I’m going to have the McKees come up,” she announced as we rose in the elevator. “And, of course, I got to call up my sister, too.”\nThe apartment was on the top floor—a small living-room, a small dining-room, a small bedroom, and a bath. The living-room was crowded to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it, so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was an over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock. Looked at from a distance, however, the hen resolved itself into a bonnet, and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room. Several old copies of Town Tattle lay on the table together with a copy of Simon Called Peter, and some of the small scandal magazines of Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with the dog. A reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk, to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large, hard dog biscuits—one of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whisky from a locked bureau door.",

As we strolled along, the air was filled with the scent of blooming flowers and the distant hum of a lawnmower. The neighborhood was alive with the gentle sounds of a lazy Sunday, children’s laughter echoing from distant yards and the occasional bark of a dog. We passed by a group of young women sitting on a porch, their dresses fluttering in the warm breeze, their faces glowing with the contentment of the day. The sun cast a golden hue over everything, making the white facades of the houses sparkle and the trees shimmer with a vibrant green. It was a picture of idyllic tranquility, a perfect summer afternoon that seemed to pause in time. As we continued our walk, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of nostalgia, a longing for a simpler, more innocent time. The quiet elegance of Fifth Avenue, with its stately homes and well-kept gardens, seemed to embody a world of comfort and stability, a stark contrast to the chaos and uncertainty that often lurked just beyond its borders. The atmosphere was almost dreamlike, a fleeting glimpse into a world of wealth and leisure, where life moved at a gentle, unhurried pace. We paused for a moment on a small bridge that overlooked a pond, watching the ducks glide lazily across the water. The scene was so peaceful that it felt like a sanctuary, a place where worries could be left behind and the beauty of the day could be savored. As the afternoon waned, the sky turned a soft pink, and the shadows grew longer, hinting at the approaching evening. We took one last look at the charming street, feeling grateful for the serenity and the simple pleasures of this summer Sunday. It was a perfect day, etched into our memories as a moment of pure, unspoiled happiness."

Sitting on Tom’s lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the telephone; then there were no cigarettes, and I went out to buy some at the drugstore on the corner. When I came back they had both disappeared, so I sat down discreetly in the living-room and read a chapter of Simon Called Peter—either it was terrible stuff or the whisky distorted things, because it didn’t make any sense to me.\nJust as Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called each other by our first names) reappeared, company commenced to arrive at the apartment door.\nThe sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty, with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky white. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle, but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved about there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary haste, and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I wondered if she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed immoderately, repeated my question aloud, and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel.\nMr. McKee was a pale, feminine man from the flat below. He had just shaved, for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone, and he was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room. He informed me that he was in the “artistic game,” and I gathered later that he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs. Wilson’s mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall. His wife was shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible. She told me with pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven times since they had been married.\nMrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before, and was now attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream-coloured chiffon, which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room. With the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a change. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage was converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her assertions became more violently affected moment by moment, and as she expanded the room grew smaller around her, until she seemed to be revolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.",

The air was thick with the scent of fresh flowers and the sweet aroma of wine, mingling into a heady perfume that seemed to lift our spirits higher with each passing hour. As the afternoon waned, the sunlight gradually faded, replaced by the soft glow of lamps and the flickering of candles, creating an intimate, almost magical atmosphere.\n\nThe conversation flowed effortlessly, punctuated by bursts of laughter and the clinking of glasses. I recall feeling a sense of carefree joy, the kind that comes with good company and the warmth of a summer day lingering in the air. My mind, however, is clouded with a haze of alcohol, blurring the details and making it difficult to distinguish where one moment ends and another begins.\n\nAt some point, the music grew louder, and we danced with reckless abandon, our movements uncoordinated but spirited. I remember the feeling of the cool breeze from an open window, mingling with the heat of the room, and how it seemed to invigorate us all. The hours slipped by unnoticed, and the world outside faded into insignificance.\n\nAs evening approached, the atmosphere shifted subtly. The cheerful sun was replaced by a softer, more subdued light, and the conversations took on a more reflective tone. I felt a gentle dizziness, a reminder of my intoxication, yet I was content, immersed in the moment. The faces around me appeared slightly blurred, yet familiar, each one etched into my memory as part of that fleeting, luminous afternoon.\n\nLooking back, I realize that those hours were a fleeting escape from reality, a brief respite filled with laughter, warmth, and the simple pleasure of good company. Though the details are fuzzy, the feelings of happiness and camaraderie remain vivid in my mind. That afternoon, with its cheerful sun and lively spirits, encapsulated a moment of pure, unadulterated joy, a memory I cherish despite the haze that now clouds its clarity."

She goes around looking at people’s feet in their own homes.”\n“I like your dress,” remarked Mrs. McKee, “I think it’s adorable.”\nMrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain.\n“It’s just a crazy old thing,” she said. “I just slip it on sometimes when I don’t care what I look like.”\n“But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,” pursued Mrs. McKee. “If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could make something of it.”\nWe all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side, and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face.\n“I should change the light,” he said after a moment. “I’d like to bring out the modelling of the features. And I’d try to get hold of all the back hair.”\n“I wouldn’t think of changing the light,” cried Mrs. McKee. “I think it’s—”\nHer husband said “Sh!” and we all looked at the subject again, whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.\n“You McKees have something to drink,” he said. “Get some more ice and mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.”\n“I told that boy about the ice.” Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness of the lower orders. “These people! You have to keep after them all the time.”\nShe looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.\n“I’ve done some nice things out on Long Island,” asserted Mr. McKee.\nTom looked at him blankly.\n“Two of them we have framed downstairs.”\n“Two what?” demanded Tom.\n“Two studies. One of them I call Montauk Point—The Gulls, and the other I call Montauk Point—The Sea.”\nThe sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch.\n“Do you live down on Long Island, too?” she inquired.\n“I live at West Egg.”\n“Really? I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man named Gatsby’s. Do you know him?”\n“I live next door to him.”\n“Well, they say he’s a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm’s. That’s where all his money comes from.”\n“Really?”\nShe nodded.\n“I’m scared of him. I’d hate to have him get anything on me.”\nThis absorbing information about my neighbour was interrupted by Mrs. McKee’s pointing suddenly at Catherine:\n“Chester, I think you could do something with her,” she broke out, but Mr. McKee only nodded in a bored way, and turned his attention to Tom.\n“I’d like to do more work on Long Island, if I could get the entry. All I ask is that they should give me a start.”\n“Ask Myrtle,” said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as Mrs. Wilson entered with a tray. “She’ll give you a letter of introduction, won’t you, Myrtle?”\n“Do what?” she asked, startled.\n“You’ll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can do some studies of him.” His lips moved silently for a moment as he invented, “ ‘George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,’ or something like that.”\nCatherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear:\n“Neither of them can stand the person they’re married to.”\n“Can’t they?”\n“Can’t stand them.” She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom. “What I say is, why go on living with them if they can’t stand them? If I was them I’d get a divorce and get married to each other right away.”\n“Doesn’t she like Wilson either?”\nThe answer to this was unexpected. It came from Myrtle, who had overheard the question, and it was violent and obscene.\n“You see,” cried Catherine triumphantly. She lowered her voice again. “It’s really his wife that’s keeping them apart. She’s a Catholic, and they don’t believe in divorce.”\nDaisy was not a Catholic, and I was a little shocked at the elaborateness of the lie.\n“When they do get married,” continued Catherine, “they’re going West to live for a while until it blows over.”\n“It’d be more discreet to go to Europe.”\n“Oh, do you like Europe?” she exclaimed surprisingly. “I just got back from Monte Carlo.”\n“Really.”\n“Just last year. I went over there with another girl.”\n“Stay long?”\n“No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back. We went by way of Marseilles. We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started, but we got gyped out of it all in two days in the private rooms. We had an awful time getting back, I can tell you. God, how I hated that town!”\nThe late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue honey of the Mediterranean—then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called me back into the room.\n“I almost made a mistake, too,” she declared vigorously. “I almost married a little kike who’d been after me for years. I knew he was below me. Everybody kept saying to me: ‘Lucille, that man’s way below you!’ But if I hadn’t met Chester, he’d of got me sure.”\n“Yes, but listen,” said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down, “at least you didn’t marry him.”\n“I know I didn’t.”\n“Well, I married him,” said Myrtle, ambiguously. “And that’s the difference between your case and mine.”\n“Why did you, Myrtle?” demanded Catherine. “Nobody forced you to.”\nMyrtle considered.\n“I married him because I thought he was a gentleman,” she said finally. “I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn’t fit to lick my shoe.”\n“You were crazy about him for a while,” said Catherine.\n“Crazy about him!” cried Myrtle incredulously. “Who said I was crazy about him? I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that man there.”\nShe pointed suddenly at me, and everyone looked at me accusingly. I tried to show by my expression that I expected no affection.\n“The only crazy I was was when I married him. I knew right away I made a mistake. He borrowed somebody’s best suit to get married in, and never even told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he was out: ‘Oh, is that your suit?’ I said. ‘This is the first I ever heard about it.’ But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to beat the band all afternoon.”",

And Tom’s the first sweetie she ever had.”\nThe bottle of whisky—a second one—was now in constant demand by all present, excepting Catherine, who “felt just as good on nothing at all.” Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches, which were a complete supper in themselves. I wanted to get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight, but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild, strident argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I saw him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.\nMyrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.\n“It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the last ones left on the train. I was going up to New York to see my sister and spend the night. He had on a dress suit and patent leather shoes, and I couldn’t keep my eyes off him, but every time he looked at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head. When we came into the station he was next to me, and his white shirtfront pressed against my arm, and so I told him I’d have to call a policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into a taxi with him I didn’t hardly know I wasn’t getting into a subway train. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was ‘You can’t live forever; you can’t live forever.’ ”\nShe turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial laughter.\n“My dear,” she cried, “I’m going to give you this dress as soon as I’m through with it. I’ve got to get another one tomorrow. I’m going to make a list of all the things I’ve got to get. A massage and a wave, and a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ashtrays where you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother’s grave that’ll last all summer. I got to write down a list so I won’t forget all the things I got to do.”\nIt was nine o’clock—almost immediately afterward I looked at my watch and found it was ten. Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists clenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action. Taking out my handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the spot of dried lather that had worried me all the afternoon.\nThe little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through the smoke, and from time to time groaning faintly. People disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost each other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet away. Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood face to face discussing, in impassioned voices, whether Mrs. Wilson had any right to mention Daisy’s name.",

Tom’s her first ‘sweetie,’ as she calls him, and she’s not going to give him up now.” The second bottle of whiskey was now in circulation, and only Catherine abstained. Tom ordered sandwiches, and I tried to get away, but I was drawn back into the loud, confused argument. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.

            "prefix-probing": "“She really ought to get away from him,” resumed Catherine to me, her voice tinged with a mixture of concern and disdain. “He’s no good for her, always dragging her down with his reckless ways.” I looked at her, noting the sharpness in her eyes, the way her hands clenched slightly at her sides. It was clear she cared deeply, perhaps more than she admitted openly.\n\nWe were sitting in the shade of a large sycamore, the summer heat shimmering in the air around us. The city was alive with the hum of activity, but here, in this quiet corner, the world seemed to pause. Catherine’s words echoed in my mind, a reminder of the tangled web of relationships that defined our lives.\n\nDaisy, the woman she referred to, was a delicate creature, with a voice like a songbird and a smile that could light up the darkest room. Yet, beneath her gentle exterior lay a vulnerability that made her susceptible to the influence of those around her. Her relationship with Tom Buchanan was complicated, filled with moments of tenderness and bursts of anger.\n\nTom, with his imposing presence and old-money arrogance, was a man who believed himself above the rules of society. His affair with Myrtle Wilson was a secret that threatened to unravel the fragile fabric of their lives. Myrtle, on the other hand, was desperate to climb the social ladder, to escape the confines of her modest existence in the Valley of Ashes.\n\nCatherine’s words reflected her concern for Daisy, who seemed caught in a web of deception and desire. I wondered if Daisy truly understood the extent of Tom’s infidelity or if she chose to ignore it, blinded by her love or perhaps her resignation.\n\nAs I pondered these thoughts, a distant figure caught my eye—Tom, striding confidently through the crowd, his face set with determination. He was a man who knew what he wanted and was willing to do anything to get it. His eyes, cold and calculating, scanned the horizon as if searching for something or someone.\n\nThe tension between the characters was palpable, a testament to the complex interplay of love, greed, and social ambition that defined our world. Each person was caught in their own struggle, trying to find happiness or escape from their circumstances.\n\nCatherine leaned in closer, her voice dropping to a whisper. “I just hope Daisy sees him for what he really is before it’s too late. Sometimes, people are blinded by their own desires, and they don’t realize the damage they’re doing until it’s gone too far.”\n\nHer words resonated with me, a reminder of the fragile nature of human relationships and the destructive power of obsession. In the end, we are all prisoners of our passions, unable to see beyond the illusions we create for ourselves.\n\nThe sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the city. Shadows lengthened, and the world seemed to hold its breath, waiting for the inevitable moment of truth. I knew that soon, the delicate balance would be shattered, and the characters in this story would be forced to confront their own realities.\n\nAs I sat there, lost in thought, I couldn’t help but wonder what the future held for Daisy and the others. Would she find the strength to break free from Tom’s grip? Or would she remain ensnared in a life of illusion and regret? Only time would tell, but one thing was certain: the story of the Great Gatsby was far from over."

Wilson’s voice cracked as she called out again, her cry echoing through the room and piercing the silence that had settled over the gathering. The scene was a stark reminder of the tragic divide between the classes, the unbridgeable gap that had grown between her and the world of wealth and privilege that Daisy represented. Wilson’s grief was palpable, a raw and aching thing that revealed the depths of her despair. She was caught in a moment of heartbreak, her voice a desperate plea for recognition, for understanding, for a love that had long since slipped away. The room seemed to hold its breath, the tension mounting as the characters around her watched in silent sympathy and helplessness, knowing that this moment marked a turning point in the tragic story of love, loss, and the American Dream."

The melodies drifted over the fence, sometimes lively jazz, sometimes soft ballads, filling the warm air with a sense of carefree abandon. I often found myself drawn to the window, watching the flickering lights and imagining the stories unfolding inside. It was a reminder of the exuberance and the fleeting nature of youth, a stark contrast to my own contemplative existence. The music seemed to symbolize the allure of the new, the promise of escape from the mundane, and the possibility of happiness that was just within reach. Yet, beneath the lively tunes, there was an undercurrent of longing, a desire for something more profound than the fleeting pleasures of the night. As the summer waned, the music gradually faded, replaced by the quiet of autumn, leaving behind only memories of those warm, spirited evenings. The sounds had become a part of the landscape, a soundtrack to a time of innocence and discovery. They reminded me of the endless possibilities that life held, and the importance of embracing the moment, even if only for a night. In those melodies, I found a reflection of my own hopes and dreams, a reminder that beneath the surface of our everyday lives, there is always a rhythm waiting to be heard, a song waiting to be sung."

My voice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden.\n“I thought you might be here,” she responded absently as I came up. “I remembered you lived next door to—”\nShe held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she’d take care of me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses, who stopped at the foot of the steps.\n“Hello!” they cried together. “Sorry you didn’t win.”\nThat was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week before.\n“You don’t know who we are,” said one of the girls in yellow, “but we met you here about a month ago.”\n“You’ve dyed your hair since then,” remarked Jordan, and I started, but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer’s basket. With Jordan’s slender golden arm resting in mine, we descended the steps and sauntered about the garden. A tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight, and we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble.\n“Do you come to these parties often?” inquired Jordan of the girl beside her.\n“The last one was the one I met you at,” answered the girl, in an alert confident voice. She turned to her companion: “Wasn’t it for you, Lucille?”\nIt was for Lucille, too.\n“I like to come,” Lucille said. “I never care what I do, so I always have a good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked me my name and address—inside of a week I got a package from Croirier’s with a new evening gown in it.”\n“Did you keep it?” asked Jordan.\n“Sure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the bust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two hundred and sixty-five dollars.”\n“There’s something funny about a fellow that’ll do a thing like that,” said the other girl eagerly. “He doesn’t want any trouble with anybody.”\n“Who doesn’t?” I inquired.\n“Gatsby. Somebody told me—”\nThe two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.\n“Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.”\nA thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward and listened eagerly.\n“I don’t think it’s so much that,” argued Lucille sceptically; “It’s more that he was a German spy during the war.”\nOne of the men nodded in confirmation.\n“I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in Germany,” he assured us positively.\n“Oh, no,” said the first girl, “it couldn’t be that, because he was in the American army during the war.” As our credulity switched back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm. “You look at him sometimes when he thinks nobody’s looking at him. I’ll bet he killed a man.”\nShe narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned and looked around for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who had found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this world.",

Her face was expressionless, yet there was a hint of amusement in her eyes, as if she found the whole situation amusing in a way I couldn't quite grasp. I hesitated for a moment, then approached her, feeling a mixture of shame and curiosity.\n\n\"Hello, Jordan,\" I said, trying to keep my voice steady.\n\nShe turned her head slightly and looked at me with a cool, detached gaze. \"Hello,\" she replied softly. \"You look like you could use a drink.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling the weight of my embarrassment pressing down on me. \"Yeah, I think I do.\"\n\nShe gestured toward the house. \"Come inside. We can talk there.\"\n\nAs we entered, the house was filled with a faint scent of perfume and the lingering warmth of the afternoon sun. The rooms were lavishly decorated, but there was an air of emptiness about them, as if they were more for show than comfort. Jordan led me into a sitting room, where a bottle of whiskey and two glasses sat on a small table.\n\nShe poured us each a drink and sat down on a plush armchair, crossing her legs elegantly. \"So,\" she said, taking a sip, \"what's got you so upset?\"\n\nI hesitated, then blurted out, \"It's just... everything's falling apart. I feel like I'm losing control.\"\n\nJordan looked at me with a mixture of amusement and understanding. \"That's life, isn't it? Always a little chaos.\"\n\nI looked at her, surprised by her calm demeanor. \"How do you stay so detached?\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"It's a game, really. You learn to play it, or you get played.\"\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to steady myself. \"I just don't know what to do anymore.\"\n\nShe leaned forward slightly, her eyes sharp. \"Sometimes, you have to let go of what you can't control. Focus on what you can.\"\n\nHer words resonated with me, and I felt a flicker of hope. Maybe I didn't have to fight so hard against the chaos.\n\nWe sat in silence for a moment, each lost in our thoughts. Outside, the garden was alive with the sounds of crickets and the distant hum of traffic. The sun was beginning to set, casting a golden glow over everything.\n\nFinally, Jordan broke the silence. \"You know, Gatsby's not so different from us. He's chasing something that may never be real.\"\n\nI looked at her, puzzled. \"What do you mean?\"\n\nShe smiled faintly. \"Dreams. We all have them, but sometimes, they lead us astray.\"\n\nI nodded slowly, contemplating her words. The room seemed to grow quieter, the weight of the evening settling in.\n\nAs I finished my drink, I felt a strange sense of clarity. Perhaps, in this moment, I could find a way to face whatever was coming next. With Jordan's words echoing in my mind, I stood up, ready to confront the chaos rather than be overwhelmed by it.\n\nWe exchanged a brief, understanding look, then I stepped out into the evening, feeling a little lighter, a little more prepared for whatever lay ahead."

There were three married couples and Jordan’s escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo, and obviously under the impression that sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling, this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the countryside—East Egg condescending to West Egg and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gaiety.\n“Let’s get out,” whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate half-hour; “this is much too polite for me.”\nWe got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host: I had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. The undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.\nThe bar, where we glanced first, was crowded, but Gatsby was not there. She couldn’t find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn’t on the veranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas.\nA stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.\n“What do you think?” he demanded impetuously.\n“About what?”\nHe waved his hand toward the bookshelves.\n“About that. As a matter of fact you needn’t bother to ascertain. I ascertained. They’re real.”\n“The books?”\nHe nodded.\n“Absolutely real—have pages and everything. I thought they’d be a nice durable cardboard. Matter of fact, they’re absolutely real. Pages and—Here! Lemme show you.”\nTaking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and returned with Volume One of the Stoddard Lectures.\n“See!” he cried triumphantly. “It’s a bona-fide piece of printed matter. It fooled me. This fella’s a regular Belasco. It’s a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop, too—didn’t cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?”\nHe snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf, muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse.\n“Who brought you?” he demanded. “Or did you just come? I was brought. Most people were brought.”\nJordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without answering.\n“I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,” he continued. “Mrs. Claud Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I’ve been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.”\n“Has it?”\n“A little bit, I think. I can’t tell yet. I’ve only been here an hour. Did I tell you about the books? They’re real. They’re—”\n“You told us.”\nWe shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.",

The air was thick with the scent of summer flowers and the faint aroma of wine and food. Jordan’s friends, a lively and diverse group, welcomed me with warm smiles and eager chatter. They were dressed in the latest fashion, their laughter ringing out like music, creating an atmosphere of carefree joy and opulence.\n\nJordan herself was radiant, her eyes sparkling with mischief and amusement. She gestured for me to sit beside her, and I took my place at the table, feeling a strange mixture of excitement and unease. The conversation flowed easily, touching on topics from the latest social scandals to the upcoming events in New York. Jordan was the perfect hostess, her wit sharp and her manner charming.\n\nAs the night deepened, the party grew more animated. Someone started playing a piano nearby, and soon everyone was singing along to popular tunes, their voices blending into a harmonious chorus. The food was abundant—platters of cold meats, fresh fruits, and delicate pastries—and the drinks kept flowing, fueling the lively atmosphere.\n\nDespite the merriment, I couldn’t help but notice the underlying sense of fleetingness, of moments slipping away into memory. The guests seemed to revel in the present, yet there was an unspoken acknowledgment that such nights were rare and precious. Jordan, with her effortless grace, seemed to embody this transient beauty, her laughter echoing into the night.\n\nAs I looked around, I saw the faces of those who, like me, were caught in the web of this glamorous world. Some appeared lost in their own thoughts, others eager to share stories or flirtatious glances. The garden was alive with energy, yet beneath it all, I sensed a hint of longing, a desire for something more enduring than the fleeting pleasures of the evening.\n\nThe moon cast a silvery glow over the scene, illuminating the delicate balance between illusion and reality. It was a night of enchantment, a fleeting escape from the mundane, yet I knew that dawn would bring a return to the ordinary. Still, for now, I was content to be part of this ephemeral gathering, to indulge in the beauty of the moment, and to listen to the stories that wove the fabric of this extraordinary night."

By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian, and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz, and between the numbers people were doing “stunts” all over the garden, while happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A pair of stage twins, who turned out to be the girls in yellow, did a baby act in costume, and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger-bowls. The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn.\nI was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl, who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying myself now. I had taken two finger-bowls of champagne, and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental, and profound.\nAt a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.\n“Your face is familiar,” he said politely. “Weren’t you in the First Division during the war?”\n“Why yes. I was in the Twenty-eighth Infantry.”\n“I was in the Sixteenth until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I’d seen you somewhere before.”\nWe talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France. Evidently he lived in this vicinity, for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane, and was going to try it out in the morning.\n“Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound.”\n“What time?”\n“Any time that suits you best.”\nIt was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around and smiled.\n“Having a gay time now?” she inquired.\n“Much better.” I turned again to my new acquaintance. “This is an unusual party for me. I haven’t even seen the host. I live over there—” I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, “and this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation.”\nFor a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.\n“I’m Gatsby,” he said suddenly.\n“What!” I exclaimed. “Oh, I beg your pardon.”\n“I thought you knew, old sport. I’m afraid I’m not a very good host.”\nHe smiled understandingly—much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced—or seemed to face—the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey. Precisely at that point it vanished—and I was looking at an elegant young roughneck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced himself I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care.",

            "prefix-probing": "The scene was one of vibrant chaos, a whirl of color and movement that seemed to embody the very essence of the Jazz Age. Gatsby's mansion, illuminated by countless lights, cast a golden glow over the lush lawns, where guests reveled in the opulence of the evening. The air was thick with the scent of champagne and the sweet aroma of blooming roses, mingling with the sounds of lively jazz and laughter that echoed into the night.\n\nAmidst the revelry, Daisy Buchanan appeared, her face radiant and her eyes sparkling with a mixture of amusement and nostalgia. She moved gracefully through the crowd, her presence a beacon of elegance and charm. Gatsby watched her from a distance, his heart pounding with a mixture of hope and longing. He had orchestrated this gathering to impress her, to rekindle the spark that once drew them together.\n\nAs the music swelled, couples spun around the dance floor, their movements synchronized and fluid, yet tinged with a certain desperation to hold onto the fleeting moments of happiness. The older men, with their graying hair and weathered faces, seemed to push the younger girls in a dance that was both a celebration and a reminder of the passage of time. The young women, in their flapper dresses and bobbed hair, laughed and twirled, their carefree spirits momentarily masking the underlying emptiness of their pursuits.\n\nIn one corner, a group of single girls danced alone, their expressions a mix of joy and wistfulness. They relished the brief respite from the social expectations that confined them, finding solace in the rhythm of the music and the freedom of movement. Occasionally, they would pause to listen to the orchestra, their faces lit by the flickering candlelight, before returning to their solitary dances.\n\nGatsby's eyes lingered on Daisy, who now approached him, her smile both inviting and elusive. They exchanged a few words, their voices barely audible over the music, but their eyes spoke volumes. Gatsby felt a surge of hope, believing that perhaps this night could mark a new beginning, a rekindling of the love that had once seemed so distant.\n\nYet, amidst the gaiety, there was an undercurrent of melancholy. The party was a fleeting illusion, a grand spectacle that masked the emptiness of the lives led by those in attendance. The old men, clinging to their youth through the dance, and the young girls, seeking meaning in transient pleasures, all seemed to be chasing shadows of happiness.\n\nAs the night deepened, the music slowed, and the guests began to drift away, their laughter fading into the darkness. Gatsby remained, watching Daisy as she disappeared into the house, her figure silhouetted against the glowing windows. He felt a mixture of hope and despair, knowing that the night had been a beautiful illusion, a fleeting moment of joy in an otherwise hollow world.\n\nIn the quiet that followed, Gatsby stood alone on the lawn, contemplating the elusive nature of happiness and the American Dream. The garden, once alive with movement and music, now seemed still and silent, a silent witness to the fleeting nature of dreams and the enduring human longing for something more."

He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn.\n“If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,” he urged me. “Excuse me. I will rejoin you later.”\nWhen he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan—constrained to assure her of my surprise. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in his middle years.\n“Who is he?” I demanded. “Do you know?”\n“He’s just a man named Gatsby.”\n“Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?”\n“Now you’re started on the subject,” she answered with a wan smile. “Well, he told me once he was an Oxford man.”\nA dim background started to take shape behind him, but at her next remark it faded away.\n“However, I don’t believe it.”\n“Why not?”\n“I don’t know,” she insisted, “I just don’t think he went there.”\nSomething in her tone reminded me of the other girl’s “I think he killed a man,” and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I would have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York. That was comprehensible. But young men didn’t—at least in my provincial inexperience I believed they didn’t—drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island Sound.\n“Anyhow, he gives large parties,” said Jordan, changing the subject with an urban distaste for the concrete. “And I like large parties. They’re so intimate. At small parties there isn’t any privacy.”\nThere was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.\n“Ladies and gentlemen,” he cried. “At the request of Mr. Gatsby we are going to play for you Mr. Vladmir Tostoff’s latest work, which attracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the papers you know there was a big sensation.” He smiled with jovial condescension, and added: “Some sensation!” Whereupon everybody laughed.\n“The piece is known,” he concluded lustily, “as ‘Vladmir Tostoff’s Jazz History of the World!’ ”\nThe nature of Mr. Tostoff’s composition eluded me, because just as it began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and looking from one group to another with approving eyes. His tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister about him. I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased. When the “Jazz History of the World” was over, girls were putting their heads on men’s shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into men’s arms, even into groups, knowing that someone would arrest their falls—but no one swooned backward on Gatsby, and no French bob touched Gatsby’s shoulder, and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby’s head for one link.",

His face, usually so composed, betrayed a flicker of concern as he listened to the voice on the other end. The conversation was brief, but the implications were clear—business matters, perhaps, or personal affairs that demanded his immediate attention. As he hung up, Gatsby's mind raced, contemplating the significance of the call and what it might mean for his carefully constructed world.\n\nHe straightened his shoulders and turned back to his guests, attempting to mask the brief moment of distraction. The party was in full swing, with laughter and music filling the air, but Gatsby's thoughts were elsewhere. He had built this mansion as a testament to his dreams, to the hope that someday, he would be reunited with Daisy and they would live happily ever after. Yet, beneath the surface of his charm and confidence, there was a persistent anxiety, a sense that something was about to change.\n\nAs the evening progressed, Gatsby moved through the crowd with a practiced ease, engaging in conversations that fluttered around him like butterflies. He was the perfect host, but his mind was elsewhere. The call from Chicago had stirred a restless energy within him, a reminder of the business ventures and ambitions that fueled his rise from poverty to wealth.\n\nMeanwhile, Daisy, unaware of the call, enjoyed the evening, her laughter ringing out like a bell. She was radiant, her beauty captivating everyone around her. Gatsby watched her from a distance, feeling a mixture of love and apprehension. He wondered if the call was a sign of good news or bad, a harbinger of change that could threaten the fragile happiness he so desperately sought.\n\nAs the night deepened, Gatsby found himself alone for a moment, gazing out over the shimmering lights of West Egg. The stars above seemed to mirror the glittering lights of his mansion, both symbols of dreams and illusions. He took a deep breath, trying to steady his nerves, and resolved to face whatever was coming with the same determination that had brought him this far.\n\nIn the quiet of that moment, Gatsby reaffirmed his hope that the future held promise, that the call from Chicago was just another step on his journey toward the life he envisioned. He knew that the path ahead might be fraught with challenges, but he was ready to meet them head-on, driven by the unwavering belief that his dreams were within reach. As he turned back to rejoin his guests, a faint smile played on his lips, a silent testament to his enduring optimism and the relentless pursuit of his elusive American Dream."

          "text_segment": "“I beg your pardon.”\nGatsby’s butler was suddenly standing beside us.\n“Miss Baker?” he inquired. “I beg your pardon, but Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you alone.”\n“With me?” she exclaimed in surprise.\n“Yes, madame.”\nShe got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment, and followed the butler toward the house. I noticed that she wore her evening-dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes—there was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.\nI was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and intriguing sounds had issued from a long, many-windowed room which overhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan’s undergraduate, who was now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who implored me to join him, I went inside.\nThe large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was playing the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of champagne, and during the course of her song she had decided, ineptly, that everything was very, very sad—she was not only singing, she was weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks—not freely, however, for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky colour, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face, whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair, and went off into a deep vinous sleep.\n“She had a fight with a man who says he’s her husband,” explained a girl at my elbow.\nI looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan’s party, the quartet from East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of the men was talking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife, after attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent way, broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks—at intervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed: “You promised!” into his ear.\nThe reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant wives. The wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices.\n“Whenever he sees I’m having a good time he wants to go home.”\n“Never heard anything so selfish in my life.”\n“We’re always the first ones to leave.”\n“So are we.”\n“Well, we’re almost the last tonight,” said one of the men sheepishly. “The orchestra left half an hour ago.”\nIn spite of the wives’ agreement that such malevolence was beyond credibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives were lifted, kicking, into the night.",

I watched her go, noting her poised walk, reminiscent of a golfer's stride.\n\nAlone again near two a.m., I heard strange, confused sounds emanating from a room overlooking the terrace. Avoiding Jordan's former escort, now busy with chorus girls, I decided to go inside. The room was large and crowded. A girl in yellow was playing the piano, while a red-haired chorus singer, heavily intoxicated with champagne, was singing.

Even Jordan's sophisticated East Egg crowd had descended into discord; one man was fixated on an actress, while his wife alternated between feigned indifference and whispered accusations.\n\nThe resistance to leaving wasn't limited to men; two sober men were being urged to depart by their indignant wives. The wives loudly complained about their husbands wanting to leave whenever they were having fun, calling it selfish. One husband, sheepishly, pointed out that they were nearly the last guests, as the orchestra had already left.

I wanted to explain that I’d hunted for him early in the evening and to apologize for not having known him in the garden.\n“Don’t mention it,” he enjoined me eagerly. “Don’t give it another thought, old sport.” The familiar expression held no more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. “And don’t forget we’re going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning, at nine o’clock.”\nThen the butler, behind his shoulder:\n“Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir.”\n“All right, in a minute. Tell them I’ll be right there… Good night.”\n“Good night.”\n“Good night.” He smiled—and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant significance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired it all the time. “Good night, old sport… Good night.”",

However, the completion condenses some interactions and omits certain transitions, which affects the pacing and flow of the original passage.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the detail of Jordan lingering specifically to shake hands, which is a small but notable action.\n- The original includes a moment where Jordan yawned gracefully in the narrator's face, which is only briefly referenced and lacks the specific context and nuance.\n- The completion does not mention the narrator's internal feeling of shame about staying late until after Jordan leaves, whereas the original transitions this feeling more fluidly.\n- The original passage includes the butler's presence and his position behind Gatsby's shoulder, which is not described in the completion.\n- The repeated exchange of 'Good night' between Gatsby and the narrator is condensed, missing the layered repetition and the subtle emotional impact of the farewell.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion slightly alters the sequence by having the narrator's feeling of embarrassment occur after Jordan leaves, rather than as a transition between her departure and joining Gatsby's group.\n- The completion generalizes Gatsby's response to the narrator's apology, omitting the specific gestures and tone that convey the lack of true familiarity.\n- The sense of significance in being among the last guests is described, but the completion does not capture the original's implication that Gatsby may have desired this outcome all along.\n- The completion paraphrases the butler's message and Gatsby's response, but does not maintain the original's structure of dialogue and the brief exchange that follows."

Gatsby's smile was gentle, almost shy, as he looked at her, and Jordan's eyes sparkled with a mixture of amusement and affection. I watched them from my vantage point, feeling a strange flutter of emotion—perhaps envy, perhaps admiration. Gatsby's presence was magnetic, and Jordan, with her poised elegance, complemented him perfectly. As they moved down the hall, their conversation was light, filled with laughter that echoed softly against the walls. I wondered what they had been discussing, what secrets lay behind their smiles. The air between them seemed charged with unspoken understanding, a silent language only they shared. Gatsby's gaze lingered on Jordan a moment longer before he turned away, his expression contemplative. Jordan, meanwhile, glanced back over her shoulder, her lips curved in a knowing smile. I sensed that whatever was between them was complex, layered with past and present, hope and hesitation. The moment was fleeting, yet it left an indelible impression on me, a glimpse into the mysterious world they inhabited. As they disappeared from view, I felt a mixture of curiosity and longing, eager to unravel the stories behind their smiles and the silent promises they held."

In the ditch beside the road, right side up, but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupé which had left Gatsby’s drive not two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However, as they had left their cars blocking the road, a harsh, discordant din from those in the rear had been audible for some time, and added to the already violent confusion of the scene.\nA man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in the middle of the road, looking from the car to the tyre and from the tyre to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.\n“See!” he explained. “It went in the ditch.”\nThe fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and I recognized first the unusual quality of wonder, and then the man—it was the late patron of Gatsby’s library.\n“How’d it happen?”\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\n“I know nothing whatever about mechanics,” he said decisively.\n“But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?”\n“Don’t ask me,” said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole matter. “I know very little about driving—next to nothing. It happened, and that’s all I know.”\n“Well, if you’re a poor driver you oughtn’t to try driving at night.”\n“But I wasn’t even trying,” he explained indignantly, “I wasn’t even trying.”\nAn awed hush fell upon the bystanders.\n“Do you want to commit suicide?”\n“You’re lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even trying!”\n“You don’t understand,” explained the criminal. “I wasn’t driving. There’s another man in the car.”\nThe shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained “Ah-h-h!” as the door of the coupé swung slowly open. The crowd—it was now a crowd—stepped back involuntarily, and when the door had opened wide there was a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale, dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.\nBlinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant groaning of the horns, the apparition stood swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the duster.\n“Wha’s matter?” he inquired calmly. “Did we run outa gas?”\n“Look!”\nHalf a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel—he stared at it for a moment, and then looked upward as though he suspected that it had dropped from the sky.\n“It came off,” someone explained.\nHe nodded.\n“At first I din’ notice we’d stopped.”\nA pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders, he remarked in a determined voice:\n“Wonder’ff tell me where there’s a gas’line station?”\nAt least a dozen men, some of them a little better off than he was, explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond.\n“Back out,” he suggested after a moment. “Put her in reverse.”\n“But the wheel’s off!”\nHe hesitated.\n“No harm in trying,” he said.\nThe caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and cut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsby’s house, making the night fine as before, and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden. A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host, who stood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.",

It was a night that seemed suspended in time, a fleeting moment of perfection amidst the chaos of the world. As I moved further into the garden, I noticed Gatsby standing alone by the fountain, gazing up at the stars with a wistful expression. His face was illuminated by the moonlight, revealing a mixture of hope and longing. I approached him quietly, feeling the weight of unspoken words between us. The evening was winding down, but the magic lingered, hinting at stories yet to be told and dreams yet to be realized."

          "text_segment": "Reading over what I have written so far, I see I have given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me. On the contrary, they were merely casual events in a crowded summer, and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs.\nMost of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their first names, and lunched with them in dark, crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction, so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow quietly away.\nI took dinner usually at the Yale Club—for some reason it was the gloomiest event of my day—and then I went upstairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour. There were generally a few rioters around, but they never came into the library, so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night was mellow, I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel, and over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station.\nI began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night, and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever know or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness. At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others—poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner—young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.\nAgain at eight o’clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were lined five deep with throbbing taxicabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside. Imagining that I, too, was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate excitement, I wished them well.\nFor a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I found her again. At first I was flattered to go places with her, because she was a golf champion, and everyone knew her name. Then it was something more. I wasn’t actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed something—most affectations conceal something eventually, even though they don’t in the beginning—and one day I found what it was. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about it—and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at Daisy’s. At her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapers—a suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round. The thing approached the proportions of a scandal—then died away. A caddy retracted his statement, and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.\nJordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest. She wasn’t able to endure being at a disadvantage and, given this unwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body.\nIt made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeply—I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on that same house-party that we had a curious conversation about driving a car. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one man’s coat.\n“You’re a rotten driver,” I protested. “Either you ought to be more careful, or you oughtn’t to drive at all.”\n“I am careful.”\n“No, you’re not.”\n“Well, other people are,” she said lightly.\n“What’s that got to do with it?”\n“They’ll keep out of my way,” she insisted. “It takes two to make an accident.”\n“Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.”\n“I hope I never will,” she answered. “I hate careless people. That’s why I like you.”\nHer grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved her. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home. I’d been writing letters once a week and signing them: “Love, Nick,” and all I could think of was how, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint moustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.\nEveryone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.",

            "prefix-probing": "In truth, my mind was a tumult of thoughts and memories, each vying for attention, each adding its own hue to the kaleidoscope of my experience. The nights I spent in West Egg, the days in the city, the fleeting encounters and the lingering regrets—all of these occupied my consciousness more than I cared to admit. I was caught in a web of illusions and realities, each feeding into the other, blurring the lines between what was and what I wished to be. The green light across the bay, the endless parties, the silent longing that haunted my every step—these were the threads that wove the fabric of my days and nights. As I reflect now, I realize that my obsession with Daisy, with reclaiming a lost past, was but a symptom of a deeper, more pervasive discontent. The world I inhabited was a mirror of my own illusions, shimmering with promise yet fragile beneath the surface. And so, my story is not merely of three nights, but of a lifetime of yearning, of dreams deferred and hopes dashed, all culminating in the tragic realization that some things are forever out of reach."

          "text_segment": "On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages alongshore, the world and its mistress returned to Gatsby’s house and twinkled hilariously on his lawn.\n“He’s a bootlegger,” said the young ladies, moving somewhere between his cocktails and his flowers. “One time he killed a man who had found out that he was nephew to Von Hindenburg and second cousin to the devil. Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there crystal glass.”\nOnce I wrote down on the empty spaces of a timetable the names of those who came to Gatsby’s house that summer. It is an old timetable now, disintegrating at its folds, and headed “This schedule in effect July 5th, 1922.” But I can still read the grey names, and they will give you a better impression than my generalities of those who accepted Gatsby’s hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing whatever about him.\nFrom East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches, and a man named Bunsen, whom I knew at Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet, who was drowned last summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and the Willie Voltaires, and a whole clan named Blackbuck, who always gathered in a corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near. And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and Mr. Chrystie’s wife), and Edgar Beaver, whose hair, they say, turned cotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.\nClarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He came only once, in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the garden. From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O. R. P. Schraeders, and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia, and the Fishguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there three days before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive that Mrs. Ulysses Swett’s automobile ran over his right hand. The Dancies came, too, and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over sixty, and Maurice A. Flink, and the Hammerheads, and Beluga the tobacco importer, and Beluga’s girls.\nFrom West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Schoen and Gulick the State senator and Newton Orchid, who controlled Films Par Excellence, and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don S. Schwartz (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the movies in one way or another. And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G. Earl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his wife. Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B. (“Rot-Gut”) Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly—they came to gamble, and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was cleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably next day.\nA man named Klipspringer was there so often that he became known as “the boarder”—I doubt if he had any other home. Of theatrical people there were Gus Waize and Horace O’Donavan and Lester Myer and George Duckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New York were the Chromes and the Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry L. Palmetto, who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train in Times Square.\nBenny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite the same ones in physical person, but they were so identical one with another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before. I have forgotten their names—Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela, or Gloria or Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American capitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves to be.\nIn addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O’Brien came there at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer, who had his nose shot off in the war, and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag, his fiancée, and Ardita Fitz-Peters and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of the American Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip, with a man reputed to be her chauffeur, and a prince of something, whom we called Duke, and whose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten.\nAll these people came to Gatsby’s house in the summer.",

From East Egg, the list included families like the Chester Beckers, the Leeches, the Hornbeams, Willie Voltaires, and the Blackbucks, along with individuals such as Bunsen, Doctor Civet, the Ismays, Chrysties, Edgar Beaver—who had a peculiar hairdo—and Clarence Endive, who was involved in a quarrel and was later seen in a different outfit.\n\nFarther out on Long Island, guests included the Cheadles, O. R. P. Schraeders, Stonewall Jackson Abrams, Fishguards, Ripley Snell—who had an incident that led to jail—, the Dancies, S. B. Whitebait, Maurice A. Fink, the Hammerheads, and Beluga, a tobacco importer with his daughters.\n\nFrom West Egg, many were associated with the film industry: the Poles, Mulreadys, Cecil Roebuck, Cecil Schoen, Senator Gulick, Newton Orchid, Eckhaust, Clyde Cohen, Don S. Schwartz, Arthur McCarty, Catlips, Bembergs, and G. Earl Muldoon, whose brother had committed murder. Promoters and gamblers like Da Fontano, Ed Legros, James B. “Rot-Gut” Ferret, the De Jongs, and Ernest Lilly also appeared; Ferret’s presence in the garden was a sign of gambling losses. The ever-present Klipspringer, dubbed “the boarder,” was a fixture.\n\nThe theatrical crowd included Gus Waize, Horace O’Donavan, Lester Myer, George Duckweed, and Francis Bull. A lengthy list of New York guests followed: the Chromes, Backhyssons, Dennickers, Russel Betty, the Corrigans, Kellehers, Dewars, Scullys, S. W. Belcher, Smirkes, the divorced Quinns, and Henry L. Palmetto, who had died by suicide.\n\nBenny McClenahan was a constant, always arriving with four young women—though their identities changed, they seemed identical and claimed dubious connections to wealthy families. Nick also remembered Faustina O’Brien, the Baedeker girls, young Brewer (who had been injured in the war), Mr. Albrucksburger and his fiancée Miss Haag, Ardita Fitz-Peters, Mr. P. Jewett, Miss Claudia Hip (who had a chauffeur she claimed was her own), and an unnamed prince called Duke.\n\nThroughout, the guests circulated, gossiping and drinking, accepting Gatsby’s hospitality while knowing little about him, their names and stories forming a long, strange roll call of the summer’s revelers.",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the direct transition from the rumors and party scene to the narrator’s act of writing down names, which in the original is a distinct narrative shift. This makes the structure less clear and blurs the separation between the party atmosphere and the cataloguing of guests.\n- The completion condenses or summarizes some sections that in the original are presented as detailed lists, reducing the sense of accumulation and specificity that characterizes the passage.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion does not include the specific dialogue among the young ladies, which in the original provides both rumor content and a sense of their personalities and interactions.\n- The completion omits the description of the timetable’s physical state and its heading, which in the original provides a concrete sense of time and artifact.\n- Several unique details about individual guests are missing, such as specific anecdotes, physical descriptions, or unusual behaviors (e.g., the Blackbucks’ mannerisms, Edgar Beaver’s hair, Clarence Endive’s attire and altercation, and the fate of Henry L. Palmetto).\n- The completion does not mention the narrator’s reflection on the value of the list compared to generalizations, which is present in the original as a narrative aside.\n- Some minor guests and their distinguishing features are omitted, especially in the latter part of the list.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion sometimes generalizes or groups guests in ways that do not match the original sequence or associations (e.g., combining families and individuals or attributing certain actions or fates to the wrong people).\n- There are inaccuracies in the sequence of events, such as the order in which guests are introduced and the placement of certain anecdotes (e.g., the incident involving Ripley Snell is not described with the same timing or detail).\n- Some invented or inferred content appears, such as the suggestion that all the women accompanying Benny McClenahan claimed connections to wealthy families, which is more speculative than the original.\n- The completion attributes a more reflective or summarizing tone to the narrator than is present in the original, especially in the way the list is introduced and concluded."

            "prefix-probing": "The sun was shining brightly, casting a golden hue over the manicured lawns and the shimmering pool that reflected the clear blue sky. Guests, dressed in their finest attire, mingled and laughed, their voices blending with the distant chimes of the church bells. Gatsby, standing at the edge of his lawn, watched the scene with a mixture of satisfaction and melancholy. The party was in full swing, yet beneath the surface, a sense of emptiness lingered. The world and its mistress—money, status, and superficial pleasures—had returned to his house, filling it with life and noise, but not with genuine happiness.\n\nThe air was thick with the scent of champagne and the aroma of freshly cut grass. Servants moved swiftly, ensuring every detail was perfect, while the guests reveled in the opulence that Gatsby had painstakingly created. Laughter erupted from clusters of people, glasses clinked in celebration, and the music from a distant gramophone added a lively backdrop to the scene.\n\nGatsby’s eyes wandered over the crowd, searching for a familiar face, perhaps Daisy, who had promised to join him that morning. His heart fluttered with anticipation, yet a shadow of doubt clouded his mind. He knew that beneath the glittering surface, the world was a fragile illusion, a fleeting mirage that could vanish with the slightest gust of reality.\n\nAs the morning progressed, the party grew more exuberant. Young men and women danced on the lawn, their movements carefree and spirited. The older guests sipped their drinks, exchanging stories of wealth and adventure. The mistress of the world—material success—seemed to reign supreme, her laughter echoing through the estate.\n\nBut Gatsby remained somewhat apart, observing the scene with a contemplative gaze. His mansion, once a symbol of his dreams and aspirations, now stood as a testament to his relentless pursuit of a future that seemed just out of reach. He had built this world to impress Daisy, to win her back, to recreate the past that haunted him.\n\nSuddenly, a car pulled up at the driveway, and a figure stepped out—a young woman with a gentle smile and eyes that held a hint of longing. It was Daisy. Gatsby’s heart leapt as he hurried to greet her, his face lighting up with hope.\n\n“Daisy,” he said softly, taking her hand. “I’m so glad you could come.”\n\nShe looked around at the lively scene, her expression a mixture of amusement and nostalgia. “It’s beautiful, Gatsby,” she replied. “You’ve really outdone yourself.”\n\nThey moved together through the crowd, their conversation light but tinged with unspoken emotion. Gatsby’s mind raced with memories of their past, of the days when love seemed simple and pure. Now, surrounded by the world’s glitter and noise, he wondered if she truly saw him or if she was merely indulging in the spectacle.\n\nAs the morning wore on, the party’s energy showed no signs of waning. Guests lounged on chaise longues, some dipping their toes in the pool, others engaging in spirited conversations. The atmosphere was one of carefree abandon, a fleeting escape from the realities of life.\n\nYet, amidst the revelry, Gatsby’s thoughts drifted to the future. He knew that this moment, like all others, was temporary. The world and its mistress—wealth, pleasure, and superficial charm—would eventually fade, leaving behind only memories and the hollow echo of laughter.\n\nHe looked at Daisy, her face illuminated by the sunlight, and wondered if she truly understood the depth of his longing. Did she see the man behind the facade, the one who had sacrificed so much for a chance at happiness?\n\nAs the church bells continued to ring, marking the passage of time, Gatsby felt a bittersweet sense of hope and despair. The morning was a fleeting illusion, a brief respite in the ongoing pursuit of a dream that might never be fully realized.\n\nIn that moment, he resolved to cherish what he had, to hold onto the fragile beauty of the present, even as the world around him spun on in its relentless pursuit of pleasure and status. For in the end, all that remained were memories—of love, of longing, and of a house that shimmered hilariously on his lawn, a testament to dreams that perhaps were never meant to come true."

          "text_segment": "At nine o’clock, one morning late in July, Gatsby’s gorgeous car lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody from its three-noted horn.\nIt was the first time he had called on me, though I had gone to two of his parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation, made frequent use of his beach.\n“Good morning, old sport. You’re having lunch with me today and I thought we’d ride up together.”\nHe was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American—that comes, I suppose, with the absence of lifting work in youth and, even more, with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games. This quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.\nHe saw me looking with admiration at his car.\n“It’s pretty, isn’t it, old sport?” He jumped off to give me a better view. “Haven’t you ever seen it before?”\nI’d seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream colour, bright with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and toolboxes, and terraced with a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory, we started to town.\nI had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and found, to my disappointment, that he had little to say. So my first impression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate roadhouse next door.\nAnd then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn’t reached West Egg village before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-coloured suit.\n“Look here, old sport,” he broke out surprisingly, “what’s your opinion of me, anyhow?”\nA little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that question deserves.\n“Well, I’m going to tell you something about my life,” he interrupted. “I don’t want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear.”\nSo he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavoured conversation in his halls.\n“I’ll tell you God’s truth.” His right hand suddenly ordered divine retribution to stand by. “I am the son of some wealthy people in the Middle West—all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford, because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It is a family tradition.”\nHe looked at me sideways—and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was lying. He hurried the phrase “educated at Oxford,” or swallowed it, or choked on it, as though it had bothered him before. And with this doubt, his whole statement fell to pieces, and I wondered if there wasn’t something a little sinister about him, after all.\n“What part of the Middle West?” I inquired casually.\n“San Francisco.”\n“I see.”\n“My family all died and I came into a good deal of money.”\nHis voice was solemn, as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan still haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg, but a glance at him convinced me otherwise.\n“After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of Europe—Paris, Venice, Rome—collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago.”\nWith an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The very phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a turbaned “character” leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne.\n“Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief, and I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a commission as first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest I took the remains of my machine-gun battalion so far forward that there was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn’t advance. We stayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty men with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of dead. I was promoted to be a major, and every Allied government gave me a decoration—even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea!”\nLittle Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded at them—with his smile. The smile comprehended Montenegro’s troubled history and sympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people. It appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had elicited this tribute from Montenegro’s warm little heart. My incredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming hastily through a dozen magazines.\nHe reached in his pocket, and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon, fell into my palm.\n“That’s the one from Montenegro.”\nTo my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look. “Orderi di Danilo,” ran the circular legend, “Montenegro, Nicolas Rex.”\n“Turn it.”\n“Major Jay Gatsby,” I read, “For Valour Extraordinary.”\n“Here’s another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Oxford days. It was taken in Trinity Quad—the man on my left is now the Earl of Doncaster.”\nIt was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an archway through which were visible a host of spires. There was Gatsby, looking a little, not much, younger—with a cricket bat in his hand.",

Now, at last, he was my guest. He was a remarkably handsome young man, with a hard, clean face and a tan, and he was dressed in a white flannel suit, which seemed to suit him perfectly.\n\nHe invited me to lunch, and I accepted, and we set off together in his car, which was cream-colored, with nickel fittings and a monstrous length, filled with compartments and mirrors. As we drove into town, Gatsby was fidgeting nervously, constantly adjusting his tie and tapping his knee.\n\nHe noticed me looking at his car and, with a proud smile, asked me to take a closer look. The car was opulent—gleaming, with a sleek, polished finish, and I could see the reflection of the green leather interior through the windows.\n\nDuring the ride, Gatsby was somewhat reserved, and I remembered how I had been disappointed by his silence at our previous conversations, which had made me think less of him. Now, as he grew more agitated, he left sentences unfinished and kept tapping his knee, clearly nervous.\n\nSuddenly, he asked me what I thought of him. I started to evade the question politely, but he cut me off, eager to tell his story to dispel rumors.

The sun was just beginning to cast a golden hue over West Egg, illuminating the lush greenery and the shimmering waters of the bay. As I watched, the car's sleek, silver body gleamed in the sunlight, and I could see Gatsby himself behind the wheel, his face alight with anticipation. He was dressed impeccably, as always, with a calm confidence that seemed to set him apart from the ordinary world around him.\n\nGatsby's arrival was not unusual, but the timing was. It was a quiet morning, the kind that invites reflection and a slow start to the day. Yet, Gatsby's presence always seemed to inject a sense of purpose and excitement into the air. I opened the door and stepped outside, the warm breeze brushing against my face.\n\nGatsby stepped out of his car with a graceful ease, adjusting his tie and offering a broad, genuine smile. \"Good morning,\" he greeted, his voice smooth and inviting. \"I hope I haven't disturbed you.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" I replied, returning his smile. \"It's a lovely morning.\"\n\nHe nodded, glancing around at the tranquil scene before us. \"I thought I’d come by early. I have something special planned for today, and I wanted to see if you’d like to join me.\"\n\nCuriosity piqued, I asked, \"What’s the occasion?\"\n\nGatsby’s eyes sparkled with a hint of mischief. \"A little adventure. Something different.\"\n\nI hesitated for a moment, then nodded. \"I’d love to.\"\n\nHe extended his hand, and I took it, feeling a rush of excitement. We set off together in his car, the engine humming softly as we headed toward the city. The drive was filled with light conversation, Gatsby’s voice animated as he shared his plans.\n\nAs we approached the city, the skyline came into view—tall buildings reaching toward the sky, bustling streets alive with energy. Gatsby parked near a small, discreet café, and we stepped inside. The aroma of fresh coffee and baked goods enveloped us.\n\nOver breakfast, Gatsby revealed that he had arranged for us to attend a private art exhibition, a rare collection of works from renowned artists. His enthusiasm was contagious, and I found myself caught up in his excitement.\n\nAfterward, we wandered through the galleries, admiring the paintings and sculptures, each piece telling its own story. Gatsby was particularly drawn to a vibrant landscape, his eyes lingering on it as if it held a special meaning.\n\nAs the afternoon progressed, we decided to take a walk along the riverfront. The city’s chaos seemed to fade away as we strolled, talking about dreams, ambitions, and the future. Gatsby confided in me about his aspirations, his voice tinged with a mixture of hope and longing.\n\nBy evening, we returned to West Egg, the sky painted in shades of pink and orange. Gatsby’s car glided smoothly along the drive, the stars beginning to twinkle above.\n\nWhen we reached my house, Gatsby turned to me with a gentle smile. \"Thank you for spending the day with me. It’s been a rare pleasure.\"\n\nI looked at him, feeling a deep sense of connection. \"It’s been a wonderful day. Thank you for inviting me.\"\n\nHe nodded, his expression serious yet warm. \"There’s more to come. I want to share everything with you.\"\n\nAs he drove away, I watched his car disappear into the night, feeling a mixture of admiration and curiosity about the man who could turn an ordinary day into an extraordinary memory."

I didn’t want you to think I was just some nobody. You see, I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad things that happened to me.” He hesitated. “You’ll hear about it this afternoon.”\n“At lunch?”\n“No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you’re taking Miss Baker to tea.”\n“Do you mean you’re in love with Miss Baker?”\n“No, old sport, I’m not.

Then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a glimpse of Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting vitality as we went by.\nWith fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half Astoria—only half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevated I heard the familiar “jug-jug-spat!” of a motorcycle, and a frantic policeman rode alongside.\n“All right, old sport,” called Gatsby. We slowed down. Taking a white card from his wallet, he waved it before the man’s eyes.\n“Right you are,” agreed the policeman, tipping his cap. “Know you next time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse me!”\n“What was that?” I inquired. “The picture of Oxford?”\n“I was able to do the commissioner a favour once, and he sends me a Christmas card every year.”\nOver the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of nonolfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.\nA dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two carriages with drawn blinds, and by more cheerful carriages for friends. The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short upper lips of southeastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of Gatsby’s splendid car was included in their sombre holiday. As we crossed Blackwell’s Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white chauffeur, in which sat three modish negroes, two bucks and a girl. I laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in haughty rivalry.\n“Anything can happen now that we’ve slid over this bridge,” I thought; “anything at all…”\nEven Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.",

            "prefix-probing": "Then it was all true. The rumors, the whispers, the stories that had circulated through West Egg and East Egg alike—they all bore the weight of truth. Gatsby's mansion, with its shimmering lights and endless parties, was not just a symbol of wealth but a testament to a dream that refused to die. I remember standing on the lawn that evening, the air thick with the scent of roses and the sound of jazz, feeling the weight of the revelation settle over me.\n\nGatsby's life, as I came to understand, was a tapestry woven with hope, ambition, and a relentless pursuit of a love that had once seemed lost forever. Daisy, the elusive star he reached for across the dark waters of the bay, was more than just a distant memory; she was the embodiment of his aspirations, the reason behind every grand gesture and every whispered promise.\n\nAs I looked around at the opulence surrounding us, I couldn't help but think of the sacrifices behind the glittering facade. Gatsby's mansion was filled with guests who knew little of the man himself, only that he was a figure of mystery and allure. Yet, beneath the surface, there was a loneliness that no amount of wealth could mask. His eyes, often described as being full of hope and longing, seemed to hold a universe of unspoken stories.\n\nThe night grew deeper, and the truth of Gatsby's past began to unravel in my mind. His humble beginnings, the boy from North Dakota who had dreamed of a different life, now seemed like a distant echo. He had reinvented himself, crafting an identity that would attract Daisy and make his dreams tangible. But in doing so, he had also created a barrier between himself and the world, a barrier built on illusions and the desire to be someone else.\n\nI remembered the first time I met Gatsby, how his smile had seemed both genuine and guarded. There was a kindness in his eyes, yet a sadness that lingered beneath the surface. He was a man who had loved deeply and lost, a man who believed in the green light at the end of Daisy's dock as a symbol of hope and possibility.\n\nAs the evening wore on, I realized that Gatsby's story was not just about wealth or love, but about the American Dream itself. It was about the pursuit of happiness, the hope that one could reinvent oneself and find fulfillment. Yet, it also served as a cautionary tale—reminding us that dreams, no matter how fervently held, can sometimes lead us astray.\n\nIn the end, Gatsby's life was a testament to the power of hope and the tragedy of unfulfilled dreams. His unwavering belief in a future where everything was possible had driven him to extraordinary heights, but it also left him vulnerable to the harsh realities of the world. As I looked at his mansion, illuminated against the night sky, I knew that his story would linger in my mind—a reminder of the fragile nature of dreams and the enduring human spirit that seeks to realize them."

Blinking away the brightness of the street outside, my eyes picked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.\n“Mr. Carraway, this is my friend Mr. Wolfshiem.”\nA small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half-darkness.\n“—So I took one look at him,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, shaking my hand earnestly, “and what do you think I did?”\n“What?” I inquired politely.\nBut evidently he was not addressing me, for he dropped my hand and covered Gatsby with his expressive nose.\n“I handed the money to Katspaugh and I said: ‘All right, Katspaugh, don’t pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.’ He shut it then and there.”\nGatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the restaurant, whereupon Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was starting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction.\n“Highballs?” asked the head waiter.\n“This is a nice restaurant here,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, looking at the presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. “But I like across the street better!”\n“Yes, highballs,” agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfshiem: “It’s too hot over there.”\n“Hot and small—yes,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “but full of memories.”\n“What place is that?” I asked.\n“The old Metropole.”\n“The old Metropole,” brooded Mr. Wolfshiem gloomily. “Filled with faces dead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I can’t forget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. It was six of us at the table, and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening. When it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a funny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside. ‘All right,’ says Rosy, and begins to get up, and I pulled him down in his chair.\n“ ‘Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don’t you, so help me, move outside this room.’\n“It was four o’clock in the morning then, and if we’d of raised the blinds we’d of seen daylight.”\n“Did he go?” I asked innocently.\n“Sure he went.” Mr. Wolfshiem’s nose flashed at me indignantly. “He turned around in the door and says: ‘Don’t let that waiter take away my coffee!’ Then he went out on the sidewalk, and they shot him three times in his full belly and drove away.”\n“Four of them were electrocuted,” I said, remembering.\n“Five, with Becker.” His nostrils turned to me in an interested way. “I understand you’re looking for a business gonnegtion.”\nThe juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered for me:\n“Oh, no,” he exclaimed, “this isn’t the man.”\n“No?” Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed.\n“This is just a friend. I told you we’d talk about that some other time.”\n“I beg your pardon,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “I had a wrong man.”\nA succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting the more sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with ferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around the room—he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly behind. I think that, except for my presence, he would have taken one short glance beneath our own table.",

Why has it all got to come through Miss Baker?”\n“Oh, it’s nothing underhand,” he assured me. “Miss Baker’s a great sportswoman, you know, and she’d never do anything that wasn’t all right.”\nSuddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up, and hurried from the room, leaving me with Mr. Wolfshiem at the table.\n“He has to telephone,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, following him with his eyes. “Fine fellow, isn’t he? Handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman.”\n“Yes.”\n“He’s an Oggsford man.”\n“Oh!”\n“He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?”\n“I’ve heard of it.”\n“It’s one of the most famous colleges in the world.”\n“Have you known Gatsby for a long time?” I inquired.\n“Several years,” he answered in a gratified way. “I made the pleasure of his acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a man of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to myself: ‘There’s the kind of man you’d like to take home and introduce to your mother and sister.’ ” He paused. “I see you’re looking at my cuff buttons.”\nI hadn’t been looking at them, but I did now. They were composed of oddly familiar pieces of ivory.\n“Finest specimens of human molars,” he informed me.\n“Well!” I inspected them. “That’s a very interesting idea.”\n“Yeah.” He flipped his sleeves up under his coat. “Yeah, Gatsby’s very careful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend’s wife.”\nWhen the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat down Mr. Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet.\n“I have enjoyed my lunch,” he said, “and I’m going to run off from you two young men before I outstay my welcome.”\n“Don’t hurry Meyer,” said Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfshiem raised his hand in a sort of benediction.\n“You’re very polite, but I belong to another generation,” he announced solemnly. “You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and your—” He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his hand. “As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won’t impose myself on you any longer.”\nAs he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling. I wondered if I had said anything to offend him.\n“He becomes very sentimental sometimes,” explained Gatsby. “This is one of his sentimental days. He’s quite a character around New York—a denizen of Broadway.”\n“Who is he, anyhow, an actor?”\n“No.”\n“A dentist?”\n“Meyer Wolfshiem? No, he’s a gambler.” Gatsby hesitated, then added, coolly: “He’s the man who fixed the World’s Series back in 1919.”\n“Fixed the World’s Series?” I repeated.\nThe idea staggered me. I remembered, of course, that the World’s Series had been fixed in 1919, but if I had thought of it at all I would have thought of it as a thing that merely happened, the end of some inevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million people—with the single-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe.\n“How did he happen to do that?” I asked after a minute.\n“He just saw the opportunity.”\n“Why isn’t he in jail?”\n“They can’t get him, old sport. He’s a smart man.”\nI insisted on paying the check. As the waiter brought my change I caught sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room.\n“Come along with me for a minute,” I said; “I’ve got to say hello to someone.”\nWhen he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our direction.\n“Where’ve you been?” he demanded eagerly. “Daisy’s furious because you haven’t called up.”\n“This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.”\nThey shook hands briefly, and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over Gatsby’s face.\n“How’ve you been, anyhow?” demanded Tom of me. “How’d you happen to come up this far to eat?”\n“I’ve been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.”\nI turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there.",

An Oggsford man.”\n\nHe confirmed he had attended Oggsford College, calling it one of the most famous in the world.\n\n“I’ve known Gatsby for several years,” Wolfshiem added, “since just after the war. I saw his fine breeding right away. He’s respectable enough to introduce to my mother and sister.”\n\nHe seemed to notice my glance at his cufflinks.\n\n“They’re made from human molars,” he said quietly.\n\nHe then spoke about Gatsby’s respectability concerning women, asserting he would never disrespect a friend’s marriage.\n\nGatsby returned to the table.\n\nWolfshiem finished his coffee and stood up.\n\n“I’m leaving,” he said. “Old-fashioned, I suppose, but I belong to an older generation. I don’t want to impose.”\n\nGatsby suggested he stay, but Wolfshiem gave a blessing-like gesture and left, his tragic nose trembling.\n\nGatsby explained that Wolfshiem was a character around New York—a denizen of Broadway—and that he was a gambler.\n\nHe then revealed, with a coolness that surprised me, that Wolfshiem had fixed the World’s Series back in 1919.\n\nI was staggered, considering the event a historical occurrence rather than the act of a man manipulating national faith.\n\nGatsby said Wolfshiem just saw the opportunity and was too smart to be caught.\n\nI insisted on paying the bill.\n\nAs the waiter brought the change, I saw Tom Buchanan across the room and asked Gatsby to come meet him.\n\nTom approached eagerly, asking where I’d been and mentioning Daisy’s annoyance.\n\nI introduced Gatsby to Tom.\n\nThey shook hands briefly; an unusual look of strain and embarrassment appeared on Gatsby’s face.\n\nWhile Tom continued questioning me about being so far uptown, I turned to include Gatsby in the conversation, only to find he had disappeared.",

You have a way of catching people off guard.\" He smiled, a little sheepishly, and looked out over the water. The sun was beginning to set, casting a golden glow over West Egg. \"I didn't mean to upset you,\" he said softly. \"It's just that I get carried away sometimes, thinking about the past and what might have been.\" I looked at him, noting the earnestness in his eyes. \"Gatsby, you can't live in the past. You have to face the present.\" He nodded, but I could see the flicker of longing in his gaze. \"You're right,\" he admitted. \"But the past is a part of me, and I can't help but hold onto it.\" We sat in silence for a moment, the only sounds the gentle lapping of the water and the distant hum of the city. Then Gatsby broke the silence. \"Tell me, old sport, do you think Daisy will ever come back to me?\" I hesitated, knowing the answer was complicated. \"Gatsby, she's married now. Things have changed.\" He looked down, his jaw clenched. \"I know, but I still believe in us. I believe that someday, she'll see that I was the one for her.\" I felt a pang of sympathy for him. His hope was both admirable and tragic. \"Gatsby, hope is a dangerous thing,\" I said quietly. \"It can lift us up, but it can also break us.\" He looked at me, a faint smile on his lips. \"Maybe. But I have to believe in something.\" As the evening deepened, we continued our conversation, the city lights flickering on in the distance. Gatsby's dreams seemed as vivid as ever, shimmering like the stars above. I wondered how long he could hold onto them, and what the future might hold for a man so consumed by his hopes."

          "text_segment": "One October day in nineteen-seventeen—\n(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)\n—I was walking along from one place to another, half on the sidewalks and half on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on shoes from England with rubber knobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground. I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind, and whenever this happened the red, white, and blue banners in front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tut-tut-tut-tut, in a disapproving way.\nThe largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to Daisy Fay’s house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She dressed in white, and had a little white roadster, and all day long the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night. “Anyways, for an hour!”\nWhen I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside the kerb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen before. They were so engrossed in each other that she didn’t see me until I was five feet away.\n“Hello, Jordan,” she called unexpectedly. “Please come here.”\nI was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older girls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross to make bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she couldn’t come that day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since. His name was Jay Gatsby, and I didn’t lay eyes on him again for over four years—even after I’d met him on Long Island I didn’t realize it was the same man.\nThat was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a few beaux myself, and I began to play in tournaments, so I didn’t see Daisy very often. She went with a slightly older crowd—when she went with anyone at all. Wild rumours were circulating about her—how her mother had found her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas. She was effectually prevented, but she wasn’t on speaking terms with her family for several weeks. After that she didn’t play around with the soldiers any more, but only with a few flat-footed, shortsighted young men in town, who couldn’t get into the army at all.\nBy the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a début after the armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a man from New Orleans. In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago, with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He came down with a hundred people in four private cars, and hired a whole floor of the Muhlbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\nI was a bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in her flowered dress—and as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottle of Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.\n“ ’Gratulate me,” she muttered. “Never had a drink before, but oh how I do enjoy it.”\n“What’s the matter, Daisy?”\nI was scared, I can tell you; I’d never seen a girl like that before.\n“Here, dearies.” She groped around in a wastebasket she had with her on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls. “Take ’em downstairs and give ’em back to whoever they belong to. Tell ’em all Daisy’s change’ her mine. Say: ‘Daisy’s change’ her mine!’ ”\nShe began to cry—she cried and cried. I rushed out and found her mother’s maid, and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath. She wouldn’t let go of the letter. She took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up in a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the soap-dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.\nBut she didn’t say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress, and half an hour later, when we walked out of the room, the pearls were around her neck and the incident was over. Next day at five o’clock she married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver, and started off on a three months’ trip to the South Seas.",

            "prefix-probing": "One October day in nineteen-seventeen— the air was crisp and filled with the scent of fallen leaves, signaling the transition from summer to autumn. The sky was a clear, pale blue, and the sun cast a gentle glow over the rolling hills and the bustling streets of West Egg. It was a day that seemed to hold a quiet promise of change, a moment suspended between the warmth of summer and the chill of approaching winter.\n\nIn the midst of this changing season, Gatsby's mansion stood as a symbol of opulence and hope. Its grand facade gleamed under the sunlight, reflecting the dreams and ambitions of its owner. Inside, the house was alive with activity—servants preparing for an upcoming gathering, the faint hum of music drifting through the open windows, and the anticipation of guests arriving.\n\nNick Carraway, the novel's narrator, found himself wandering through the grounds, observing the scene with a mixture of curiosity and detachment. He was drawn to the contrast between the vibrant life of the estate and the underlying sense of longing that seemed to permeate the air. As he strolled, he thought about Gatsby's relentless pursuit of a dream—an ideal of love and success that seemed just out of reach.\n\nMeanwhile, across the bay, Tom Buchanan was engaged in a different kind of reflection. His world was one of privilege and entitlement, yet beneath his confident exterior lay a sense of unease. The social fabric that had once defined his status was beginning to fray, and he was acutely aware of the shifting tides of wealth and power.\n\nDaisy Buchanan, meanwhile, was preparing for the day with a quiet grace. Her voice, soft and musical, carried a hint of nostalgia as she looked out over the water, contemplating the life she had and the life she yearned for. Her thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of her cousin Nick, who had come to visit her at her home in East Egg.\n\nAs the day unfolded, the characters' paths began to intersect in subtle ways. Gatsby, ever the gracious host, welcomed his guests with a charm that masked his inner turmoil. His eyes often lingered on the horizon, as if searching for something just beyond reach. The party was lively, filled with laughter, music, and the clinking of glasses, yet beneath the surface, there was an undercurrent of longing and unfulfilled desire.\n\nThe evening drew near, and the sky darkened, stars beginning to twinkle overhead. The guests, intoxicated by the glamour and the moment, danced and reveled into the night. Gatsby watched from a distance, his mind wandering to the past and to the elusive future he envisioned.\n\nIn the quiet moments of the night, Nick reflected on the nature of dreams and the human condition. He thought about Gatsby's unwavering hope, Daisy's delicate charm, Tom's arrogance, and the complex web of relationships that bound them all together. The day in nineteen-seventeen was a snapshot of a world on the brink of change, a world where illusions and realities intertwined.\n\nAs dawn approached, the party wound down, and the guests departed, leaving Gatsby alone with his thoughts. The mansion stood silent, a monument to aspirations and heartbreaks. Nick, feeling a mixture of sympathy and disillusionment, prepared to leave, knowing that the days ahead would bring new challenges and revelations.\n\nThis October day in nineteen-seventeen encapsulated the essence of the novel—an exploration of love, ambition, and the elusive nature of the American Dream. It was a day that would linger in the memories of those who experienced it, a testament to the enduring human desire for happiness and fulfillment amidst the complexities of life."

She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour, rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable delight. It was touching to see them together—it made you laugh in a hushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A week after I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night, and ripped a front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got into the papers, too, because her arm was broken—she was one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.\nThe next April Daisy had her little girl, and they went to France for a year. I saw them one spring in Cannes, and later in Deauville, and then they came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in Chicago, as you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation. Perhaps because she doesn’t drink. It’s a great advantage not to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue and, moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they don’t see or care. Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour at all—and yet there’s something in that voice of hers…\nWell, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first time in years. It was when I asked you—do you remember?—if you knew Gatsby in West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me up, and said: “What Gatsby?” and when I described him—I was half asleep—she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know.

Jordan Baker, narrating, recalls seeing Daisy and Tom Buchanan shortly after their honeymoon, with Daisy utterly infatuated, her eyes fixed on Tom with an 'unfathomable delight.' Jordan found their intense affection touching, yet slightly amusing. A week later, Tom was involved in a car accident on Ventura Road, which became public when a chambermaid from the Santa Barbara Hotel broke her arm, revealing Tom's early infidelity. The following April, Daisy gave birth to their daughter, and the Buchanans spent a year traveling in France—Cannes and Deauville—during which Jordan saw them abroad. They eventually returned to Chicago, where Daisy became a prominent figure among the young, wealthy, and 'wild' social set, maintaining an 'absolutely perfect reputation,' partly due to her abstinence from alcohol, which kept her discreet among heavy drinkers. Jordan muses on Daisy's enigmatic nature, wondering if she ever had affairs. About six weeks prior, Daisy heard Gatsby's name for the first time in years when Jordan asked Nick if he knew Gatsby. That evening, Daisy came to Jordan’s room, woke her, and asked, 'What Gatsby?' When Jordan described him, Daisy's reaction was strange—she said he must be the man she used to know. It was then that Jordan finally connected the wealthy Jay Gatsby of West Egg with the young lieutenant Daisy had been with in Louisville years earlier, in the white roadster.\n\n---",

Based on your detailed guidance, here's a more accurate reconstruction of the original passage, closely aligned with the provided detailed summary and opening line, avoiding added interpretations or invented details:\n\n---\n\n**IV**\n\nI saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back, and I thought I’d never seen a girl so mad about her husband. Jordan continues her story, recalling seeing the Buchanans shortly after their honeymoon. She describes Daisy sitting with Tom on the sand, gazing at him with an 'unfathomable delight,' and becoming anxious if he briefly left her side. Jordan found their affection touching, though a little amusing. About a week later, Tom was involved in a car accident on the Ventura road. The incident became public because his passenger, a chambermaid from the Santa Barbara Hotel, broke her arm, exposing Tom’s early infidelity. The following April, Daisy gave birth to their daughter. The Buchanans then spent a year traveling in France—Cannes and Deauville. Jordan saw them during their time abroad. They eventually returned to the United States and settled in Chicago, where Daisy became a popular figure among the young, wealthy, and 'wild' social set. Jordan emphasizes that Daisy maintained an 'absolutely perfect reputation,' partly because she abstained from alcohol, which helped her keep her composure and discretion among heavy-drinking peers. Jordan muses on whether Daisy ever had affairs, alluding to an enigmatic quality in her voice. She then explains that about six weeks ago, Daisy heard Gatsby’s name for the first time in years. This happened when Jordan asked Nick if he knew Gatsby. After Nick left that day, Daisy came to Jordan’s room, woke her, and asked, 'What Gatsby?' When Jordan, half-asleep, described him, Daisy reacted strangely, saying it must be the man she used to know. Jordan states that it was only then that she finally connected the wealthy Jay Gatsby of West Egg with the young lieutenant Daisy had been with in Louisville years earlier.\n\n---\n\nThis version aims to stay true to the original content, including the specific details about Daisy’s actions, the timeline, and the sequence of events, without adding interpretations or extraneous information.",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces invented narrative framing by explicitly naming the narrator and referencing the honeymoon, which is not present in the original passage.\n- There is an added reflection on Tom's early infidelity, which is an interpretation not directly stated in the original.\n- The completion invents a connection to Louisville and the white roadster at the end, which is not part of the original passage's conclusion.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits specific behavioral details about Daisy's actions and expressions when Tom leaves the room, as well as the description of her sitting with Tom on the sand.\n- The original's depiction of the emotional effect of seeing Daisy and Tom together, including the nuanced reaction it provokes, is not fully captured.\n- The sequence and details of the car accident, including the timing and the nature of the incident, are summarized but lack some of the original's specifics.\n- The completion does not include the detail about Daisy's daughter being born in April and the subsequent timeline leading to their travels.\n- The process by which Daisy maintains her reputation in Chicago, including the specific advantages of not drinking, is condensed and lacks some of the original's reasoning.\n- The original's account of Daisy's reaction upon hearing Gatsby's name, including the context of the conversation and the narrator's state of mind, is abbreviated.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes certain reflections and musings to the narrator that are not present in the original, such as speculation about Daisy's affairs and the explicit mention of Louisville and the white roadster.\n- The sequence of events is sometimes compressed or reordered, such as the connection between Gatsby and the officer being made earlier than in the original.\n- There are inaccuracies in the description of the car accident, including the implication of infidelity and the nature of the public attention it received.\n- The completion misattributes the conversation about Gatsby, suggesting a different dynamic and timing than in the original passage."

It was as if she had just discovered a secret that only she knew, and she was eager to share it with the world. Her laughter was contagious, ringing out like music, and everyone around could feel the warmth radiating from her. I remember thinking how fortunate her husband was to have such a devoted wife, someone who loved him so fiercely and unconditionally. It was a rare sight, the kind that makes you believe in the pure, unadulterated power of love. As they danced together, I could see the way she looked at him—her eyes full of admiration and adoration, her face lit up with a joy that seemed to transcend the moment. It was a scene straight out of a fairy tale, and I felt a pang of envy mixed with happiness for them. They seemed to belong to each other completely, lost in their own world, oblivious to everything else around them. That day in Santa Barbara, I realized that true love is not just about passion or romance, but about a deep, unwavering connection that withstands the test of time. Watching them, I understood that such love is rare and precious, something to cherish and hold onto fiercely. It made me reflect on my own relationships and the importance of genuine affection and commitment. As I left that day, I carried with me the image of her radiant smile and the way she looked at her husband—so madly in love, so completely devoted. It was a reminder that sometimes, the most beautiful moments are simple, shared between two people who truly care for each other. And in that moment, I felt a renewed hope that love, in its purest form, still exists in this world, shining brightly for those willing to see it."

Jordan Baker, with her usual composed demeanor, glanced out the window, her eyes reflecting a mixture of amusement and contemplation. As we navigated the winding paths of Central Park, the distant sounds of children playing and the rustling leaves created a gentle symphony that contrasted sharply with the bustling city life beyond. I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia, recalling the days when the city felt simpler, when dreams seemed more attainable. Jordan, ever the epitome of grace, broke the silence with a light laugh, her voice soft yet confident. 'You know,' she said, 'people are often more complicated than they appear. There's always more beneath the surface.' I nodded, understanding her words in a way that went beyond mere conversation. The city around us was alive, vibrant, full of stories waiting to unfold. As we continued our drive, the lights of Manhattan flickered on, illuminating the skyline with a dazzling array of colors. The Empire State Building stood tall and proud, a symbol of ambition and resilience. I thought about Gatsby, about his relentless pursuit of a dream that seemed just out of reach. His hope was as luminous as the city lights, yet fragile, easily shattered by the realities of the world. Jordan's words lingered in my mind, reminding me that appearances could deceive and that beneath the surface, everyone carried their own secrets and struggles. The air grew cooler, and I pulled my coat tighter around me, feeling a strange mixture of hope and melancholy. The city, with all its grandeur and chaos, was a reflection of the human condition—beautiful, complex, and often elusive. As the drive came to an end and we returned to our starting point, I was left with a renewed sense of awareness about the masks people wear and the truths they hide. The night had deepened, and the city seemed to whisper stories of love, loss, and the endless pursuit of happiness. I realized that, like Gatsby, we are all chasing something just beyond our grasp, driven by dreams that define us yet also threaten to destroy us."

          "text_segment": "When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that my house was on fire. Two o’clock and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light, which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a corner, I saw that it was Gatsby’s house, lit from tower to cellar.\nAt first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved itself into “hide-and-go-seek” or “sardines-in-the-box” with all the house thrown open to the game. But there wasn’t a sound. Only wind in the trees, which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned away I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.\n“Your place looks like the World’s Fair,” I said.\n“Does it?” He turned his eyes toward it absently. “I have been glancing into some of the rooms. Let’s go to Coney Island, old sport. In my car.”\n“It’s too late.”\n“Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven’t made use of it all summer.”\n“I’ve got to go to bed.”\n“All right.”\nHe waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.\n“I talked with Miss Baker,” I said after a moment. “I’m going to call up Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea.”\n“Oh, that’s all right,” he said carelessly. “I don’t want to put you to any trouble.”\n“What day would suit you?”\n“What day would suit you?” he corrected me quickly. “I don’t want to put you to any trouble, you see.”\n“How about the day after tomorrow?”\nHe considered for a moment. Then, with reluctance: “I want to get the grass cut,” he said.\nWe both looked down at the grass—there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began. I suspected that he meant my grass.\n“There’s another little thing,” he said uncertainly, and hesitated.\n“Would you rather put it off for a few days?” I asked.\n“Oh, it isn’t about that. At least—” He fumbled with a series of beginnings. “Why, I thought—why, look here, old sport, you don’t make much money, do you?”\n“Not very much.”\nThis seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently.\n“I thought you didn’t, if you’ll pardon my—you see, I carry on a little business on the side, a sort of side line, you understand. And I thought that if you don’t make very much—You’re selling bonds, aren’t you, old sport?”\n“Trying to.”\n“Well, this would interest you. It wouldn’t take up much of your time and you might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing.”\nI realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might have been one of the crises of my life. But, because the offer was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no choice except to cut him off there.\n“I’ve got my hands full,” I said. “I’m much obliged but I couldn’t take on any more work.”\n“You wouldn’t have to do any business with Wolfshiem.” Evidently he thought that I was shying away from the “gonnegtion” mentioned at lunch, but I assured him he was wrong. He waited a moment longer, hoping I’d begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he went unwillingly home.\nThe evening had made me lightheaded and happy; I think I walked into a deep sleep as I entered my front door. So I don’t know whether or not Gatsby went to Coney Island, or for how many hours he “glanced into rooms” while his house blazed gaudily on.",

            "prefix-probing": "The moon had just risen, casting a silvery glow over the shimmering bay, and the cool night air was filled with the distant hum of activity from the parties that never seemed to end. As I approached my modest home, the flickering lights and the faint sounds of laughter and music made me pause, a strange unease settling in my chest. For a moment, I thought perhaps my house was ablaze, consumed by flames that would leave nothing but ashes and smoke in their wake. The thought was so sudden and vivid that I stood still, heart pounding, eyes scanning the darkened windows and the surrounding yard.\n\nBut as I drew closer, I realized the flickering was merely the reflection of the moonlight on the windows, and the sounds I heard were the distant echoes of the parties that Tom and Daisy often hosted. My house, though modest, was still intact, standing quietly amidst the chaos of West Egg. I let out a breath I hadn't realized I was holding, feeling a mixture of relief and a strange sense of vulnerability. The night was quiet again, save for the gentle lapping of the water against the shore and the occasional clink of glasses from the neighboring mansions.\n\nI stepped inside, the familiar creak of the wooden floor welcoming me home. The room was dimly lit by a single lamp, casting long shadows on the walls. I looked around, taking in the simple furnishings and the photographs that lined the shelves—memories of a life I was trying to hold onto amidst the swirling tide of wealth and decadence that defined West Egg. Despite the grandeur of the nearby estates, my house remained humble, a quiet refuge from the extravagance that seemed to consume the area.\n\nAs I sat down, I couldn't help but reflect on the events of the evening. The night had been filled with the usual chatter and laughter, yet beneath the surface, there was an undercurrent of tension. I thought about Gatsby, whose presence seemed to hover like a ghost in the background, always just out of reach. His dreams, so grand and yet so fragile, seemed to hang in the air, shimmering like the stars above.\n\nThe fear I had felt earlier was a fleeting moment, a reminder of how fragile our sense of security can be in a world so uncertain. The fire I imagined was not real, but it symbolized the burning anxieties that often plagued me—worries about the future, about love, about the hollow pursuit of happiness that seemed to define our lives here.\n\nI poured myself a glass of whiskey, the warmth spreading through my chest, and looked out the window at the darkened water. The bay was calm now, the only movement the gentle ripple of the tide. I thought about Daisy, her voice echoing in my mind, her laughter, her tears. She was the reason I was here, the reason I kept returning to this place, despite the emptiness that sometimes threatened to swallow me whole.\n\nIn the quiet of the night, I felt a strange sense of peace, mingled with an undercurrent of longing. The world outside was full of illusions and dreams, but inside this humble house, I found a moment of stillness—a brief respite from the chaos. I knew that tomorrow would bring new challenges, new hopes, and perhaps new disappointments, but for now, I was content to sit in the darkness and listen to the gentle rhythm of the night.\n\nAs I finally settled into my chair, I thought about the future, about the possibilities that lay ahead. The fire I feared was only a fleeting shadow, a symbol of the fears that haunted us all. But in this moment, I was reminded that even in the darkest times, there is a quiet strength to be found in the simple act of coming home, of finding solace in the familiar, and of holding onto hope amidst the uncertainty."

At eleven o’clock a man in a raincoat, dragging a lawn-mower, tapped at my front door and said that Mr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass. This reminded me that I had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back, so I drove into West Egg Village to search for her among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buy some cups and lemons and flowers.\nThe flowers were unnecessary, for at two o’clock a greenhouse arrived from Gatsby’s, with innumerable receptacles to contain it. An hour later the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold-coloured tie, hurried in. He was pale, and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes.\n“Is everything all right?” he asked immediately.\n“The grass looks fine, if that’s what you mean.”\n“What grass?” he inquired blankly. “Oh, the grass in the yard.” He looked out the window at it, but, judging from his expression, I don’t believe he saw a thing.\n“Looks very good,” he remarked vaguely. “One of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four. I think it was The Journal. Have you got everything you need in the shape of—of tea?”\nI took him into the pantry, where he looked a little reproachfully at the Finn. Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen shop.\n“Will they do?” I asked.\n“Of course, of course! They’re fine!” and he added hollowly, “… old sport.”\nThe rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist, through which occasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyes through a copy of Clay’s Economics, starting at the Finnish tread that shook the kitchen floor, and peering towards the bleared windows from time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking place outside. Finally he got up and informed me, in an uncertain voice, that he was going home.\n“Why’s that?”\n“Nobody’s coming to tea. It’s too late!” He looked at his watch as if there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere. “I can’t wait all day.”\n“Don’t be silly; it’s just two minutes to four.”",

The sun was shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the green lawns and the shimmering lake beyond. As I waited for her to arrive, I couldn't help but reflect on the past, on the days when Daisy and I were young and carefree, dreaming of a future together. When she finally arrived, her face lit up with a smile that made my heart flutter. We sat in the garden, sipping tea and talking about everything and nothing, the air filled with the scent of blooming flowers. It was a moment of pure happiness, a brief escape from the complexities of our lives. As the afternoon wore on, I felt a renewed sense of hope, believing that perhaps, amidst all the chaos and disillusionment, there was still a chance for us to find happiness together. Daisy's laughter was like music, and her presence brought a warmth to the coldest of days. We reminisced about the old times, and I was reminded of the depth of my feelings for her. Despite the years and the changes, some things remained the same—her beauty, her charm, and the way she made me feel alive. As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the lawn, I knew that this day would stay with me forever. It was a reminder of what once was, and what might still be possible. I watched her leave, her figure disappearing into the distance, and I felt a bittersweet ache in my chest. Yet, I was grateful for the moment, for the chance to reconnect and to hold onto the hope that someday, somehow, we might find our way back to each other. The day had been a fleeting glimpse of happiness, a beautiful memory to cherish in the days to come."

Daisy’s face, tipped sideways beneath a three-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic smile.\n“Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?”\nThe exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I had to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone, before any words came through. A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek, and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car.\n“Are you in love with me,” she said low in my ear, “or why did I have to come alone?”\n“That’s the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go far away and spend an hour.”\n“Come back in an hour, Ferdie.” Then in a grave murmur: “His name is Ferdie.”\n“Does the gasoline affect his nose?”\n“I don’t think so,” she said innocently. “Why?”\nWe went in. To my overwhelming surprise the living-room was deserted.\n“Well, that’s funny,” I exclaimed.\n“What’s funny?”\nShe turned her head as there was a light dignified knocking at the front door. I went out and opened it. Gatsby, pale as death, with his hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a puddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes.\nWith his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the hall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire, and disappeared into the living-room. It wasn’t a bit funny. Aware of the loud beating of my own heart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain.\nFor half a minute there wasn’t a sound. Then from the living-room I heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh, followed by Daisy’s voice on a clear artificial note:\n“I certainly am awfully glad to see you again.”\nA pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing to do in the hall, so I went into the room.\nGatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of boredom. His head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a defunct mantelpiece clock, and from this position his distraught eyes stared down at Daisy, who was sitting, frightened but graceful, on the edge of a stiff chair.\n“We’ve met before,” muttered Gatsby. His eyes glanced momentarily at me, and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh. Luckily the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his head, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers, and set it back in place. Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of the sofa and his chin in his hand.\n“I’m sorry about the clock,” he said.\nMy own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn. I couldn’t muster up a single commonplace out of the thousand in my head.\n“It’s an old clock,” I told them idiotically.\nI think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on the floor.\n“We haven’t met for many years,” said Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact as it could ever be.\n“Five years next November.”\nThe automatic quality of Gatsby’s answer set us all back at least another minute.",

I looked up and saw a yellow car pulling in, its engine humming softly as it came to a stop. The driver, a tall man with a stern face, stepped out and approached us. His eyes were sharp, and he seemed to scrutinize everything around him.\n\n\"Hello,\" he said, his voice calm but commanding. \"I'm Tom Buchanan. I believe you're Nick Carraway?\"\n\nI nodded, feeling a mixture of curiosity and apprehension. Tom extended his hand, which I shook politely.\n\n\"I was just on my way to see my wife,\" he continued, glancing over at the house in the distance. \"She’s expecting me.\"\n\nThe man who had been sitting there looked up at Tom, then quickly looked away, as if embarrassed. I sensed there was some tension between them, but I couldn't quite place it.\n\n\"Well,\" Tom said, turning back to me, \"if you're interested, I can give you a ride. It’s a long way to West Egg, and I’d rather not leave you stranded.\"\n\nI hesitated for a moment, then nodded. \"Thank you,\" I said. \"That would be very kind of you.\"\n\nAs we got into the car, I noticed the interior was luxurious, the leather seats gleaming in the sunlight. Tom started the engine and we pulled away from the curb.\n\n\"So,\" Tom began, glancing at me with a hint of a smile, \"you're new to West Egg, I hear.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied. \"I just moved in a few days ago.\"\n\nHe nodded thoughtfully. \"It's a quiet place, but there's a lot going on beneath the surface.\"\n\nI looked out the window, watching the houses and the distant water. The sun was shining brightly, but I felt a strange chill in my bones.\n\n\"Tell me about yourself,\" Tom said suddenly. \"What brings you to New York?\"\n\n\"I'm a bond salesman,\" I answered. \"I work in the city.\"\n\nHe raised an eyebrow. \"A bond salesman? That’s an interesting line of work.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, smiling slightly. \"It keeps me busy.\"\n\nWe drove in silence for a moment, then Tom spoke again.\n\n\"You know, I’ve been thinking about the old days,\" he said. \"Things were simpler then.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I agreed. \"Sometimes I think about that too.\"\n\nHe looked at me sharply. \"You seem like a thoughtful man, Nick.\"\n\n\"I try to be,\" I replied. \"I believe in being honest.\"\n\nTom chuckled softly. \"Honesty is a good trait. But sometimes, it’s better to keep things to yourself.\"\n\nI nodded, unsure of what to say next. The car continued along the road, the city skyline beginning to appear in the distance.\n\nAs we approached West Egg, Tom pointed out a grand mansion on the hill.\n\n\"That’s Gatsby’s place,\" he said. \"He’s quite a character.\"\n\nI looked at the house, its lights flickering in the late afternoon sun. It seemed to glow with an almost otherworldly aura.\n\n\"He’s a mysterious man,\" Tom added. \"But he throws some of the wildest parties you’ve ever seen.\"\n\nI was about to ask more when we arrived at my destination. Tom pulled up in front of a modest house, and I thanked him for the ride.\n\nAs I stepped out, Tom nodded. \"Good luck, Nick. And if you ever need anything, just ask.\"\n\nI watched him drive away, then turned to face the house. The evening was settling in, and I felt a strange mixture of anticipation and unease about what lay ahead."

          "text_segment": "I had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in on a tray.\nAmid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical decency established itself. Gatsby got himself into a shadow and, while Daisy and I talked, looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with tense, unhappy eyes. However, as calmness wasn’t an end in itself, I made an excuse at the first possible moment, and got to my feet.\n“Where are you going?” demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm.\n“I’ll be back.”\n“I’ve got to speak to you about something before you go.”\nHe followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door, and whispered: “Oh, God!” in a miserable way.\n“What’s the matter?”\n“This is a terrible mistake,” he said, shaking his head from side to side, “a terrible, terrible mistake.”\n“You’re just embarrassed, that’s all,” and luckily I added: “Daisy’s embarrassed too.”\n“She’s embarrassed?” he repeated incredulously.\n“Just as much as you are.”\n“Don’t talk so loud.”\n“You’re acting like a little boy,” I broke out impatiently. “Not only that, but you’re rude. Daisy’s sitting in there all alone.”\nHe raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable reproach, and, opening the door cautiously, went back into the other room.\nI walked out the back way—just as Gatsby had when he had made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour before—and ran for a huge black knotted tree, whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain. Once more it was pouring, and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by Gatsby’s gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric marshes. There was nothing to look at from under the tree except Gatsby’s enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church steeple, for half an hour. A brewer had built it early in the “period” craze, a decade before, and there was a story that he’d agreed to pay five years’ taxes on all the neighbouring cottages if the owners would have their roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their refusal took the heart out of his plan to Found a Family—he went into an immediate decline. His children sold his house with the black wreath still on the door. Americans, while willing, even eager, to be serfs, have always been obstinate about being peasantry.\nAfter half an hour, the sun shone again, and the grocer’s automobile rounded Gatsby’s drive with the raw material for his servants’ dinner—I felt sure he wouldn’t eat a spoonful. A maid began opening the upper windows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and, leaning from the large central bay, spat meditatively into the garden. It was time I went back. While the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and swelling a little now and then with gusts of emotion. But in the new silence I felt that silence had fallen within the house too.\nI went in—after making every possible noise in the kitchen, short of pushing over the stove—but I don’t believe they heard a sound. They were sitting at either end of the couch, looking at each other as if some question had been asked, or was in the air, and every vestige of embarrassment was gone. Daisy’s face was smeared with tears, and when I came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before a mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply confounding. He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little room.\n“Oh, hello, old sport,” he said, as if he hadn’t seen me for years. I thought for a moment he was going to shake hands.\n“It’s stopped raining.”\n“Has it?” When he realized what I was talking about, that there were twinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man, like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to Daisy. “What do you think of that? It’s stopped raining.”\n“I’m glad, Jay.” Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told only of her unexpected joy.\n“I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,” he said, “I’d like to show her around.”\n“You’re sure you want me to come?”\n“Absolutely, old sport.”",

The lawn was slick and glistening, the windows reflecting the dull gray sky. I thought about the house’s history—how it had once belonged to a wealthy family who had fallen into decline, and how the cottages nearby had been part of a failed plan to create a sort of genteel community, which had long since crumbled. The house’s grandeur was now faded, its windows dark and watchful. I noticed the maid at the window, peering out anxiously, and the faint hum of activity inside. The rain continued to fall softly, and I felt the weight of time passing. After half an hour, the clouds parted, and the sun emerged, casting a pale light over the estate.

I made some noise as I approached the house again, and when I entered, I found Gatsby and Daisy sitting at opposite ends of the couch, staring at each other. All trace of embarrassment was gone.

Daisy responded with a soft laugh, her eyes shining.

INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is sometimes altered, such as the narrator's decision to leave being presented as a feeling of being superfluous rather than a deliberate excuse.\n- The completion introduces a reflective summary about American tendencies that is less specific and omits the original's pointed commentary.\n- The emotional responses of the characters, particularly Gatsby's and Daisy's, are generalized rather than shown through their actions and dialogue as in the original.\n- The invitation to Gatsby's house is presented as a simple offer, missing the layered exchange and the reassurance sought by the narrator.\n\nTo improve, focus on preserving the full sequence of actions and dialogue, including environmental and emotional details, and avoid summarizing or generalizing key moments."

Outside, the summer sun cast a golden hue over the lush green lawns, but inside, the atmosphere was heavy with unspoken words and lingering memories. I watched as they hesitated, their eyes darting between each other, unsure of what to do next.\n\n\"Come on,\" I urged, trying to keep my voice steady despite the tremor of anxiety that threatened to betray me. \"Help me make some tea. It’s just a simple thing, really. We could all use a little comfort right now.\"\n\nFinn, with his wild hair and mischievous grin, clattered into the kitchen, balancing the tray with a surprising steadiness. His eyes sparkled with a hint of mischief, but there was a flicker of concern behind his gaze. The tray wobbled slightly as he set it down, and I could see the faint tremor in his hands.\n\nThe others finally moved, hesitantly approaching the kitchen, their footsteps tentative. The room was small, cluttered with mismatched chairs and a battered table, but it was also filled with a strange warmth, a sense of familiarity that clung to the walls like an old friend.\n\nI reached for the kettle, feeling the weight of the moment pressing down on me. The act of making tea, so simple on the surface, suddenly felt monumental. It was a gesture of normalcy, a small act of rebellion against the chaos that had engulfed us.\n\nAs I poured water over the tea leaves, I caught a glimpse of their faces—each etched with a mixture of hope and despair. It was in these quiet moments that the true nature of our struggles revealed itself. We were all searching for something to hold onto, some semblance of peace amid the turmoil.\n\nFinn, ever the impetuous one, broke the silence with a joke, his voice ringing out unexpectedly. \"Well, if this doesn’t turn out to be the best cup of tea you’ve ever had, I’ll eat my hat!\" His laughter was infectious, and for a moment, the tension eased.\n\nThe others chuckled softly, and I felt a flicker of relief. It was as if, through this simple act, we had momentarily escaped the weight of our worries. The warmth of the tea seeped into my hands, grounding me in the present.\n\nWe sat around the table, sipping the steaming brew, and for a while, the world outside seemed to fade away. The conversation drifted from trivialities to memories, each story weaving a tapestry of shared history and unspoken understanding.\n\nIn that small kitchen, amidst the clutter and the chaos, there was a sense of unity—a fragile but resilient bond that held us together. It was in these moments of quiet camaraderie that I realized the true power of simple acts of kindness and the importance of holding onto hope, even when everything else seemed lost.\n\nAs the sun dipped lower, casting long shadows across the room, I knew that the days ahead would be challenging. But for now, we had this moment—a brief respite, a reminder that amidst the darkness, there is always a flicker of light, waiting to be kindled by the smallest of gestures."

          "text_segment": "Daisy went upstairs to wash her face—too late I thought with humiliation of my towels—while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn.\n“My house looks well, doesn’t it?” he demanded. “See how the whole front of it catches the light.”\nI agreed that it was splendid.\n“Yes.” His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower. “It took me just three years to earn the money that bought it.”\n“I thought you inherited your money.”\n“I did, old sport,” he said automatically, “but I lost most of it in the big panic—the panic of the war.”\nI think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what business he was in he answered: “That’s my affair,” before he realized that it wasn’t an appropriate reply.\n“Oh, I’ve been in several things,” he corrected himself. “I was in the drug business and then I was in the oil business. But I’m not in either one now.” He looked at me with more attention. “Do you mean you’ve been thinking over what I proposed the other night?”\nBefore I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight.\n“That huge place there?” she cried pointing.\n“Do you like it?”\n“I love it, but I don’t see how you live there all alone.”\n“I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People who do interesting things. Celebrated people.”\nInstead of taking the shortcut along the Sound we went down to the road and entered by the big postern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the gardens, the sparkling odour of jonquils and the frothy odour of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odour of kiss-me-at-the-gate. It was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but bird voices in the trees.\nAnd inside, as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music-rooms and Restoration Salons, I felt that there were guests concealed behind every couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through. As Gatsby closed the door of “the Merton College Library” I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into ghostly laughter.\nWe went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing-rooms and poolrooms, and bathrooms with sunken baths—intruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pyjamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. It was Mr. Klipspringer, the “boarder.” I had seen him wandering hungrily about the beach that morning. Finally we came to Gatsby’s own apartment, a bedroom and a bath, and an Adam’s study, where we sat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall.\nHe hadn’t once ceased looking at Daisy, and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes. Sometimes too, he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way, as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer real. Once he nearly toppled down a flight of stairs.\nHis bedroom was the simplest room of all—except where the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush with delight, and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and began to laugh.\n“It’s the funniest thing, old sport,” he said hilariously. “I can’t—When I try to—”\nHe had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third. After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder at her presence. He had been full of the idea so long, dreamed it right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to speak, at an inconceivable pitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction, he was running down like an over-wound clock.\nRecovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and his shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high.\n“I’ve got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.”\nHe took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one, before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel, which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in many-coloured disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher—shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange, with monograms of indian blue. Suddenly, with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily.\n“They’re such beautiful shirts,” she sobbed, her voice muffled in the thick folds. “It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such—such beautiful shirts before.”",

            "prefix-probing": "The sun was beginning to set, casting a golden hue over the lush green of the lawn and the shimmering waters of the bay. Gatsby, standing stiffly with his hands in his pockets, looked out across the horizon, his face a mask of anticipation and something else—perhaps hope or longing. I watched him, feeling a mixture of admiration and unease, aware of the fragile veneer of civility that held us together in this moment.\n\nThe house behind us was a grand mansion, its windows glowing softly as Daisy moved inside, her face perhaps reflecting her own inner turmoil. I wondered what she was thinking, whether she felt the same tension that I did, or if she was simply lost in her own world of memories and dreams.\n\nGatsby broke the silence, his voice low and steady. \"She’s not leaving us tonight,\" he said, almost to himself. \"I can feel it.\"\n\nI nodded, unsure of what to say. The air was thick with unspoken words, with the weight of expectations and the ghosts of the past. We had come so far, yet the future still seemed uncertain, shrouded in the mists of possibility and doubt.\n\nSuddenly, Daisy appeared at the top of the stairs, her face washed clean, her eyes bright with a mixture of innocence and something more complex—perhaps a hint of regret or longing. She called down softly, \"Are you coming up?\"\n\nGatsby and I exchanged a glance before I responded, \"Yes, we’ll be right there.\"\n\nAs we ascended the stairs, I couldn’t help but feel that this moment was a turning point, a delicate balance between hope and despair. The house was silent except for the faint sound of Daisy’s footsteps and the distant hum of the evening breeze.\n\nInside, Daisy’s face was calm, but her eyes betrayed a flicker of emotion. She looked at us, her voice gentle but firm. \"I’ve been thinking about everything. About us.\"\n\nGatsby stepped closer, his expression earnest. \"Daisy, I’ve always believed in us. I still do.\"\n\nShe looked away for a moment, then back at him, her voice trembling slightly. \"It’s not that simple, Gatsby. Things have changed.\"\n\nHe reached out, taking her hand in his. \"Nothing has to change. We can go back to the way things were.\"\n\nDaisy hesitated, then withdrew her hand, a sad smile touching her lips. \"I wish it were that easy.\"\n\nI watched them, feeling a pang of helplessness. The love and longing in Gatsby’s eyes were painfully evident, yet I knew that the world they inhabited was not so forgiving or simple.\n\nOutside, the sky darkened further, stars beginning to twinkle faintly above the horizon. The night was approaching, bringing with it a sense of finality and new beginnings.\n\nDaisy took a deep breath, her voice soft but resolute. \"I need some time to think.\"\n\nGatsby nodded, understanding the gravity of her words. \"Take all the time you need.\"\n\nAs she moved to leave the room, I felt a surge of emotion—hope intertwined with fear. The night stretched before us, full of possibilities and uncertainties.\n\nWe stood in silence for a moment, the only sound the gentle rustling of the curtains in the breeze. Then Gatsby spoke again, his voice barely above a whisper. \"No matter what happens, I’ll be here.\"\n\nI looked at him, seeing the unwavering devotion in his eyes. It was a testament to his love, a love that had endured so much and yet remained steadfast.\n\nOutside, the moon rose higher, casting a silver glow over the landscape. The world seemed to hold its breath, waiting for what was to come.\n\nIn that quiet, suspended moment, I realized that life was a series of fleeting instances—moments of joy, sorrow, hope, and despair. And in the midst of it all, love persisted, fragile yet resilient.\n\nDaisy returned to the room, her face now composed but her eyes still shining with unshed tears. She looked at us, a mixture of resolve and vulnerability.\n\n\"I’ll let you know my decision soon,\" she said softly.\n\nGatsby nodded again, a faint smile touching his lips. \"Whenever you’re ready.\"\n\nAs she left the room, I felt a strange sense of calm mixed with anticipation. The night was full of promise and uncertainty, and whatever the future held, we would face it together, with hope in our hearts and love as our guide."

Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star to the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one.\nI began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects in the half darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.\n“Who’s this?”\n“That? That’s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.”\nThe name sounded faintly familiar.\n“He’s dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.”\nThere was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the bureau—Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly—taken apparently when he was about eighteen.\n“I adore it,” exclaimed Daisy. “The pompadour! You never told me you had a pompadour—or a yacht.”\n“Look at this,” said Gatsby quickly. “Here’s a lot of clippings—about you.”\nThey stood side by side examining it. I was going to ask to see the rubies when the phone rang, and Gatsby took up the receiver.\n“Yes… Well, I can’t talk now… I can’t talk now, old sport… I said a small town… He must know what a small town is… Well, he’s no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small town…”\nHe rang off.\n“Come here quick!” cried Daisy at the window.\nThe rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west, and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.\n“Look at that,” she whispered, and then after a moment: “I’d like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around.”\nI tried to go then, but they wouldn’t hear of it; perhaps my presence made them feel more satisfactorily alone.\n“I know what we’ll do,” said Gatsby, “we’ll have Klipspringer play the piano.”\nHe went out of the room calling “Ewing!” and returned in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man, with shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blond hair. He was now decently clothed in a “sport shirt,” open at the neck, sneakers, and duck trousers of a nebulous hue.\n“Did we interrupt your exercise?” inquired Daisy politely.\n“I was asleep,” cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment. “That is, I’d been asleep. Then I got up…”\n“Klipspringer plays the piano,” said Gatsby, cutting him off. “Don’t you, Ewing, old sport?”\n“I don’t play well. I don’t—hardly play at all. I’m all out of prac—”\n“We’ll go downstairs,” interrupted Gatsby. He flipped a switch. The grey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light.\nIn the music-room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano. He lit Daisy’s cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her on a couch far across the room, where there was no light save what the gleaming floor bounced in from the hall.\nWhen Klipspringer had played “The Love Nest” he turned around on the bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.\n“I’m all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldn’t play. I’m all out of prac—”\n“Don’t talk so much, old sport,” commanded Gatsby. “Play!”\n“In the morning,\nIn the evening,\nAin’t we got fun—”\nOutside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the Sound. All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric trains, men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New York. It was the hour of a profound human change, and excitement was generating on the air.\n“One thing’s sure and nothing’s surer\nThe rich get richer and the poor get—children.\nIn the meantime,\nIn between time—”\nAs I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of bewilderment had come back into Gatsby’s face, as though a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness. Almost five years! There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams—not through her own fault, but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man can store up in his ghostly heart.\nAs I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand took hold of hers, and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion. I think that voice held him most, with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because it couldn’t be over-dreamed—that voice was a deathless song.\nThey had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand; Gatsby didn’t know me now at all. I looked once more at them and they looked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life. Then I went out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them there together.",

            "prefix-probing": "The rain had a rhythmic, soothing quality, tapping softly against the glass and blending with the distant roll of thunder. Gatsby’s face was calm, almost contemplative, as he gazed out at the gray expanse of water. His eyes, however, betrayed a flicker of restlessness, a hint of longing that he tried to conceal beneath his composed exterior.\n\nWe waited in silence, the only sounds the gentle patter of rain and the occasional splash of a passing car. The garden, usually vibrant and alive, now appeared subdued, the colors muted under the overcast sky. The midsummer flowers, which earlier had been bursting with color, drooped slightly, their petals heavy with moisture.\n\nGatsby finally broke the silence, his voice soft but steady. \"The Sound is always different, no matter the weather. Sometimes it’s calm and reflective, other times wild and tumultuous. It’s like life, I suppose.\"\n\nNick nodded, feeling the weight of Gatsby’s words. There was a poetic quality to his reflection, a sense that he saw beyond the surface of things, into the deeper currents of existence. The rain continued to fall, blurring the horizon and making the distant shoreline seem like a watercolor painting, indistinct and dreamlike.\n\nAs we stood there, Gatsby’s gaze shifted from the water to the sky, where dark clouds gathered, threatening to unleash more rain. He seemed lost in thought, perhaps recalling memories of days gone by, or contemplating the future that seemed just out of reach. His expression was a mixture of hope and melancholy, a testament to the complex nature of his dreams.\n\nThe hydroplane, which earlier had been a symbol of modernity and adventure, now lay silent on the water, its sleek form partially obscured by the rain. It was a reminder of the transient nature of luxury and the fleeting moments of excitement that punctuated Gatsby’s life. The house behind us, grand and imposing, stood as a testament to his aspirations, yet also as a symbol of the isolation that often accompanies such grandeur.\n\nWe remained there for a while, the rain gradually softening into a drizzle. The sound of the water against the window was a gentle lullaby, soothing yet tinged with a sense of longing. Gatsby’s eyes lingered on the horizon, as if searching for something just beyond sight.\n\nFinally, he spoke again, his voice tinged with a hint of wistfulness. \"Sometimes I think about the past, about the days when everything was simpler, when dreams seemed closer to reality. But the rain, the storm—those are reminders that nothing stays the same.\"\n\nNick looked at him, understanding the depth of his words. Gatsby’s relentless pursuit of his dreams was both admirable and tragic, a testament to his unwavering hope despite the inevitable passage of time and change. The rain, in a way, mirrored his own emotional landscape—constant, unpredictable, and often overwhelming.\n\nAs the clouds began to part slightly, allowing a sliver of pale light to filter through, Gatsby turned to us with a faint smile. \"Well, perhaps the rain will pass, and the sun will come out again. It always does.\"\n\nWe nodded, sharing a quiet moment of reflection. The world outside was still uncertain, but within that small space, there was a sense of peace, a recognition of the transient beauty of life’s storms. The rain had washed over everything, cleansing and renewing, leaving behind a fresh, if temporary, clarity.\n\nGatsby’s gaze returned to the Sound, now shimmering with the first hints of sunlight breaking through the clouds. The hydroplane, though silent, seemed to shimmer as well, ready to take flight once more when the weather permitted. The flowers, too, appeared to lift their heads, grateful for the brief respite.\n\nIn that moment, I realized that Gatsby’s dreams, like the weather, were ever-changing—sometimes stormy, sometimes serene. But through it all, he remained hopeful, believing in the possibility of a brighter future, even if it was just beyond the horizon.\n\nThe rain finally ceased, leaving behind a fresh, invigorating scent in the air. The sky gradually cleared, revealing patches of blue amidst the lingering clouds. The Sound sparkled under the newfound sunlight, a mirror to Gatsby’s own shimmering hopes.\n\nWe turned away from the window, feeling a renewed sense of optimism. The world was unpredictable, but that was part of its beauty. And Gatsby, with his unwavering spirit, was a reminder that even in the darkest storms, there is always the promise of dawn."

Contemporary legends such as the “underground pipeline to Canada” attached themselves to him, and there was one persistent story that he didn’t live in a house at all, but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore.

As the conversation unfolded, Gatsby's demeanor revealed a mixture of confidence and a touch of wistfulness, hinting at the complex layers of his personality and his mysterious past. The reporter, eager to capture a sensational story, pressed him for details about his wealth and background, but Gatsby remained evasive, speaking only in vague generalities. This encounter exemplifies the elusive nature of Gatsby himself—an enigmatic figure who is both open and guarded, always hiding something beneath his polished exterior. The interview, brief as it was, left an impression of Gatsby as a man driven by dreams and ambitions, yet also haunted by the shadows of his history. As the reporter left, Gatsby gazed across the water, contemplating the elusive American Dream that had brought him so far yet seemed forever out of reach."

His mansion, his parties, and his entire persona were all part of an elaborate illusion, a testament to his unwavering hope that he could recreate the past and win Daisy's love. Despite his wealth and grandeur, Gatsby remained a figure of mystery and longing, embodying the American Dream's promise and its inevitable disillusionment.

His brown, hardening body lived naturally through the half-fierce, half-lazy work of the bracing days. He knew women early, and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous of them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of the others because they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming self-absorption he took for granted.\nBut his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy’s wing.\nAn instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before, to the small Lutheran College of St. Olaf’s in southern Minnesota. He stayed there two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor’s work with which he was to pay his way through. Then he drifted back to Lake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the day that Dan Cody’s yacht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore.\nCody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields, of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since seventy-five. The transactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire found him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and, suspecting this, an infinite number of women tried to separate him from his money. The none too savoury ramifications by which Ella Kaye, the newspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in a yacht, were common property of the turgid journalism in 1902.

His name was Jay Gatsby, though few knew it, and even fewer understood the depths of his longing. Each day, he sought work that would sustain him, moving from one humble job to another, always with a glimmer of hope that somehow, somewhere, his dreams would materialize. The rugged landscape of the south shore was both a refuge and a reminder of his solitude, a place where he could hide from the world and reflect on the elusive future he yearned for.\n\nGatsby's life was a series of transient moments, each one fleeting yet filled with the possibility of something greater. His nights were spent under the vast, star-studded sky, contemplating the vastness of the universe and his insignificant place within it. Despite the hardships, he maintained an unwavering belief that he was destined for more, that his destiny lay beyond the cold waters and rocky shores.\n\nHe often thought of Daisy, the woman who represented everything he desired—wealth, beauty, and a life of ease. Her image haunted him, a constant reminder of what he was striving to attain. The distance between his humble existence and her world seemed insurmountable, yet he clung to the hope that someday, he would cross that divide.\n\nHis days were marked by physical labor, but his nights were filled with dreams and plans. He read voraciously, seeking knowledge and inspiration, and he kept a small, tattered photograph of Daisy in his pocket. That photograph was his talisman, a symbol of his unwavering hope and the love that fueled his relentless pursuit of a better life.\n\nAs the seasons changed, so did Gatsby’s resolve. The hardships of the south shore only strengthened his determination. He knew that his journey was far from over, and that someday, somehow, he would find his way to the life he envisioned—one filled with love, success, and the fulfillment of his most cherished dreams."

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the detail about women rubbing champagne into Gatsby's hair at parties, which illustrates his abstention from drinking and is an important anecdote in the middle of the passage.\n- The explanation that Gatsby never understood the legal device used against him is missing, which is important for conveying his confusion and the nature of his loss.\n- The final section omits the narrator's description of the timing and motivation for recounting this information, specifically the context of confusion and the narrator's own state of mind when hearing Gatsby's story.\n- The mention of the narrator taking advantage of a pause in the narrative to clarify misconceptions is not present.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately suggests that Gatsby's money was legally his, then taken by Ella Kaye, which misrepresents the legal situation described in the original.\n- There is a shift in perspective, with the completion adding the narrator's intention to help the reader understand Gatsby's character, rather than focusing on dispelling rumors as in the original.\n- The sequence of events is altered, with the inheritance and legal issues discussed before the influence on Gatsby's habits, which disrupts the original order.\n- The completion introduces generalizations about Gatsby's character development that are not present in the original passage."

It hung there, silent and unyielding, reflecting the faded glories of a bygone era, yet somehow still commanding attention amidst the luxury. Gatsby, with his relentless pursuit of a dream, seemed to be haunted by the ghosts of that past, the shadows cast by the portrait echoing in his relentless hope and tragic longing. The image served as a stark contrast to the shimmering parties and the bright allure of his mansion, revealing the darker undercurrents of the American Dream—its promises of prosperity intertwined with corruption and loss. As I looked at it, I wondered about the stories behind that face, the lives it had touched, and the inevitable decay that time would bring to all things, no matter how grand or fleeting."

For several weeks I didn’t see him or hear his voice on the phone—mostly I was in New York, trotting around with Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile aunt—but finally I went over to his house one Sunday afternoon. I hadn’t been there two minutes when somebody brought Tom Buchanan in for a drink. I was startled, naturally, but the really surprising thing was that it hadn’t happened before.\nThey were a party of three on horseback—Tom and a man named Sloane and a pretty woman in a brown riding-habit, who had been there previously.\n“I’m delighted to see you,” said Gatsby, standing on his porch. “I’m delighted that you dropped in.”\nAs though they cared!\n“Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar.” He walked around the room quickly, ringing bells. “I’ll have something to drink for you in just a minute.”\nHe was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there. But he would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in a vague way that that was all they came for. Mr. Sloane wanted nothing. A lemonade? No, thanks. A little champagne? Nothing at all, thanks… I’m sorry—\n“Did you have a nice ride?”\n“Very good roads around here.”\n“I suppose the automobiles—”\n“Yeah.”\nMoved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom, who had accepted the introduction as a stranger.\n“I believe we’ve met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan.”\n“Oh, yes,” said Tom, gruffly polite, but obviously not remembering. “So we did. I remember very well.”\n“About two weeks ago.”\n“That’s right. You were with Nick here.”\n“I know your wife,” continued Gatsby, almost aggressively.\n“That so?”\nTom turned to me.\n“You live near here, Nick?”\n“Next door.”\n“That so?”\nMr. Sloane didn’t enter into the conversation, but lounged back haughtily in his chair; the woman said nothing either—until unexpectedly, after two highballs, she became cordial.\n“We’ll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby,” she suggested. “What do you say?”\n“Certainly; I’d be delighted to have you.”\n“Be ver’ nice,” said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. “Well—think ought to be starting home.”\n“Please don’t hurry,” Gatsby urged them. He had control of himself now, and he wanted to see more of Tom. “Why don’t you—why don’t you stay for supper? I wouldn’t be surprised if some other people dropped in from New York.”\n“You come to supper with me,” said the lady enthusiastically. “Both of you.”\nThis included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.\n“Come along,” he said—but to her only.\n“I mean it,” she insisted. “I’d love to have you. Lots of room.”\nGatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go and he didn’t see that Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn’t.\n“I’m afraid I won’t be able to,” I said.\n“Well, you come,” she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.\nMr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear.\n“We won’t be late if we start now,” she insisted aloud.\n“I haven’t got a horse,” said Gatsby. “I used to ride in the army, but I’ve never bought a horse. I’ll have to follow you in my car. Excuse me for just a minute.”\nThe rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady began an impassioned conversation aside.\n“My God, I believe the man’s coming,” said Tom. “Doesn’t he know she doesn’t want him?”\n“She says she does want him.”\n“She has a big dinner party and he won’t know a soul there.” He frowned. “I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may be old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to suit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish.”\nSuddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted their horses.\n“Come on,” said Mr. Sloane to Tom, “we’re late. We’ve got to go.” And then to me: “Tell him we couldn’t wait, will you?”\nTom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod, and they trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August foliage just as Gatsby, with hat and light overcoat in hand, came out the front door.",

I had been drawn into the world of West Egg, where Gatsby's mansion stood as a symbol of his unyielding hope and relentless pursuit of a dream. The nights were filled with the glow of lights and the hum of jazz, a testament to the vibrant, yet superficial, life that he led. I often wondered about the man behind the opulence, about the origins of his wealth and the true nature of his aspirations.\n\nGatsby's parties were legendary, attended by a multitude of guests who came and went without knowing or caring about the man himself. They sought only the thrill, the novelty, the chance to be part of something glamorous. Yet, amidst the crowd, Gatsby remained a figure of mystery, his eyes often distant, as if he was watching a different world, one only he could see.\n\nMy association with his affairs had been a fleeting thing, a brief glimpse into a life that was both alluring and tragic. I had met him through Nick Carraway, who was his neighbor and confidant. Nick's perspective was crucial, for he saw Gatsby not just as a wealthy host, but as a man driven by a profound longing. Gatsby's love for Daisy Buchanan was the core of his existence, a beacon that guided his every action.\n\nDaisy, with her voice like money and her smile that concealed a thousand unspoken words, represented everything Gatsby desired. To him, she was the embodiment of perfection, the ultimate prize in his relentless pursuit of happiness. His obsession with her had transformed him from a young man of modest origins into a symbol of wealth and grandeur.\n\nHowever, my involvement in his affairs was limited. I observed from a distance, aware of the fragility of his dreams and the inevitable tragedy that awaited. Gatsby's unwavering hope was both inspiring and heartbreaking. He believed in the green light at the end of Daisy's dock, a symbol of his aspirations and the future he envisioned.\n\nAs I reflected on our brief association, I realized that Gatsby's life was a testament to the American Dream, a pursuit of happiness that often led to disillusionment. His relentless optimism was admirable, yet it blinded him to the realities of the world around him. The social divide, the corruption, and the moral decay of the era all played a part in shaping his destiny.\n\nIn the end, Gatsby's halt in my association with his affairs was not just a pause, but a sign of the inevitable. His dream was too grand, too fragile to withstand the harsh truths of life. Yet, his hope persisted, a testament to the human spirit's capacity to believe in the impossible.\n\nAs I moved away from West Egg, I carried with me the image of Gatsby standing by the water, reaching out towards the distant green light. It was a poignant reminder of the enduring power of dreams, and the tragic beauty of a life spent in pursuit of an ideal."

          "text_segment": "Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy’s running around alone, for on the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby’s party. Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness—it stands out in my memory from Gatsby’s other parties that summer. There were the same people, or at least the same sort of people, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-coloured, many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that hadn’t been there before. Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world complete in itself, with its own standards and its own great figures, second to nothing because it had no consciousness of being so, and now I was looking at it again, through Daisy’s eyes. It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment.\nThey arrived at twilight, and, as we strolled out among the sparkling hundreds, Daisy’s voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat.\n“These things excite me so,” she whispered. “If you want to kiss me any time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I’ll be glad to arrange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green card. I’m giving out green—”\n“Look around,” suggested Gatsby.\n“I’m looking around. I’m having a marvellous—”\n“You must see the faces of many people you’ve heard about.”\nTom’s arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.\n“We don’t go around very much,” he said; “in fact, I was just thinking I don’t know a soul here.”\n“Perhaps you know that lady.” Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white-plum tree. Tom and Daisy stared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies.\n“She’s lovely,” said Daisy.\n“The man bending over her is her director.”\nHe took them ceremoniously from group to group:\n“Mrs. Buchanan… and Mr. Buchanan—” After an instant’s hesitation he added: “the polo player.”\n“Oh no,” objected Tom quickly, “not me.”\nBut evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained “the polo player” for the rest of the evening.\n“I’ve never met so many celebrities,” Daisy exclaimed. “I liked that man—what was his name?—with the sort of blue nose.”\nGatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer.\n“Well, I liked him anyhow.”\n“I’d a little rather not be the polo player,” said Tom pleasantly, “I’d rather look at all these famous people in—in oblivion.”\nDaisy and Gatsby danced. I remember being surprised by his graceful, conservative foxtrot—I had never seen him dance before. Then they sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour, while at her request I remained watchfully in the garden. “In case there’s a fire or a flood,” she explained, “or any act of God.”\nTom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together. “Do you mind if I eat with some people over here?” he said. “A fellow’s getting off some funny stuff.”\n“Go ahead,” answered Daisy genially, “and if you want to take down any addresses here’s my little gold pencil.”… She looked around after a moment and told me the girl was “common but pretty,” and I knew that except for the half-hour she’d been alone with Gatsby she wasn’t having a good time.",

            "prefix-probing": "The evening was warm, and the air was thick with the scent of blooming flowers and the hum of lively conversation. Tom, observing the exuberance and carefree spirit of the crowd, felt a mixture of irritation and disdain. His eyes, sharp and scrutinizing, darted around the room, taking in the glittering chandeliers, the jazz band playing lively tunes, and the guests dancing with abandon. Daisy, radiant and seemingly unaware of Tom’s discomfort, moved gracefully among the guests, her laughter ringing clear. Tom’s presence at Gatsby’s party was a silent assertion, a challenge to the illusion of innocence that Gatsby’s world represented. As he watched Daisy mingle, Tom’s mind raced with suspicion and unease. He was acutely aware of the growing distance between himself and Daisy, and her apparent happiness in this new environment only deepened his unease. The night wore on, and Tom’s gaze remained fixed on Daisy, who, for her part, seemed to enjoy the evening without concern for the world outside Gatsby’s mansion. The party was a vivid tableau of wealth and excess, a stark contrast to the more subdued life Tom was accustomed to. Yet, beneath the surface, there was an undercurrent of tension, a silent acknowledgment of the fragile veneer of happiness that held the gathering together. Tom’s presence at the party was not merely to observe but also to assert his dominance, to remind Daisy of his authority and the life they shared. As the night progressed, he found himself increasingly perturbed by the carefree attitude of the guests and the way Daisy seemed to indulge in the festivities. His mind was preoccupied with thoughts of the future, of the inevitable confrontation that awaited him and Gatsby. The evening ended with a sense of unresolved tension, a foreshadowing of the conflicts yet to come. Tom’s visit to Gatsby’s party was a pivotal moment, revealing the cracks in the facade of their relationships and setting the stage for the tragic unraveling that would follow. The night’s events lingered in his mind, a reminder of the fragility of happiness and the destructive power of desire and deception."

          "text_segment": "We were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my fault—Gatsby had been called to the phone, and I’d enjoyed these same people only two weeks before. But what had amused me then turned septic on the air now.\n“How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?”\nThe girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my shoulder. At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes.\n“Wha’?”\nA massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf with her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker’s defence:\n“Oh, she’s all right now. When she’s had five or six cocktails she always starts screaming like that. I tell her she ought to leave it alone.”\n“I do leave it alone,” affirmed the accused hollowly.\n“We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: ‘There’s somebody that needs your help, Doc.’ ”\n“She’s much obliged, I’m sure,” said another friend, without gratitude, “but you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool.”\n“Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,” mumbled Miss Baedeker. “They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey.”\n“Then you ought to leave it alone,” countered Doctor Civet.\n“Speak for yourself!” cried Miss Baedeker violently. “Your hand shakes. I wouldn’t let you operate on me!”\nIt was like that. Almost the last thing I remember was standing with Daisy and watching the moving-picture director and his Star. They were still under the white-plum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale, thin ray of moonlight between. It occurred to me that he had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this proximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate degree and kiss at her cheek.\n“I like her,” said Daisy, “I think she’s lovely.”\nBut the rest offended her—and inarguably because it wasn’t a gesture but an emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented “place” that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village—appalled by its raw vigour that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a shortcut from nothing to nothing. She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand.\nI sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car. It was dark here in front; only the bright door sent ten square feet of light volleying out into the soft black morning. Sometimes a shadow moved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow, an indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an invisible glass.\n“Who is this Gatsby anyhow?” demanded Tom suddenly. “Some big bootlegger?”\n“Where’d you hear that?” I inquired.\n“I didn’t hear it. I imagined it. A lot of these newly rich people are just big bootleggers, you know.”\n“Not Gatsby,” I said shortly.\nHe was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the drive crunched under his feet.\n“Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie together.”\nA breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy’s fur collar.\n“At least they are more interesting than the people we know,” she said with an effort.\n“You didn’t look so interested.”\n“Well, I was.”\nTom laughed and turned to me.\n“Did you notice Daisy’s face when that girl asked her to put her under a cold shower?”\nDaisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper, bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again. When the melody rose her voice broke up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.\n“Lots of people come who haven’t been invited,” she said suddenly. “That girl hadn’t been invited. They simply force their way in and he’s too polite to object.”\n“I’d like to know who he is and what he does,” insisted Tom. “And I think I’ll make a point of finding out.”\n“I can tell you right now,” she answered. “He owned some drugstores, a lot of drugstores. He built them up himself.”\nThe dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive.\n“Good night, Nick,” said Daisy.\nHer glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps, where “Three O’Clock in the Morning,” a neat, sad little waltz of that year, was drifting out the open door. After all, in the very casualness of Gatsby’s party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from her world. What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside? What would happen now in the dim, incalculable hours? Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare and to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with one fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would blot out those five years of unwavering devotion.",

Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free, and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run up, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights were extinguished in the guestrooms overhead. When he came down the steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes were bright and tired.\n“She didn’t like it,” he said immediately.\n“Of course she did.”\n“She didn’t like it,” he insisted. “She didn’t have a good time.”\nHe was silent, and I guessed at his unutterable depression.\n“I feel far away from her,” he said. “It’s hard to make her understand.”\n“You mean about the dance?”\n“The dance?” He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of his fingers. “Old sport, the dance is unimportant.”\nHe wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say: “I never loved you.” After she had obliterated four years with that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken. One of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back to Louisville and be married from her house—just as if it were five years ago.\n“And she doesn’t understand,” he said. “She used to be able to understand. We’d sit for hours—”\nHe broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds and discarded favours and crushed flowers.\n“I wouldn’t ask too much of her,” I ventured. “You can’t repeat the past.”\n“Can’t repeat the past?” he cried incredulously. “Why of course you can!”\nHe looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.\n“I’m going to fix everything just the way it was before,” he said, nodding determinedly. “She’ll see.”\nHe talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy. His life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he could find out what that thing was…\n… One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight. They stopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of the year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees—he could climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.\nHis heart beat faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning-fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips’ touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.\nThrough all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was reminded of something—an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man’s, as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air. But they made no sound, and what I had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever.",

He believed this declaration would erase the past four years, allowing them to return to Louisville and marry as if it were five years ago. He expressed frustration that Daisy doesn't seem to understand or accept this plan. I advised Gatsby not to demand too much from Daisy, stating, 'You can't repeat the past.' Gatsby reacted with incredulous disagreement, passionately insisting that the past *can* be repeated. He vowed to 'fix everything just the way it was before.' Gatsby talked extensively about the past, conveying his longing to recover something essential—perhaps an idealized version of himself—that became intertwined with loving Daisy. He felt his life had been disordered since losing her and believed returning to a specific 'starting place' could clarify what was lost. He recounted a specific memory: walking with Daisy on a moonlit autumn night five years earlier. He described the magical atmosphere and his perception of the sidewalk as a symbolic ladder to a higher realm attainable only alone. He recalled the moment before kissing Daisy, realizing that doing so would forever bind his 'unutterable visions' to her 'perishable breath,' ending his purely imaginative, god-like state. He paused, then kissed her, feeling her 'blossom' and completing the 'incarnation' of his dream. Listening to Gatsby's intensely sentimental story, I felt a fleeting sense of recognition, as if recalling a lost fragment of wisdom or language.

The air was thick with the scent of jasmine and the distant hum of a jazz tune drifting from Gatsby's mansion. I lingered in the shadows, my mind racing with the events that had just transpired. The night had been a whirlwind of emotions—hope, despair, and a strange sense of clarity. As I looked across the bay at the shimmering lights of East Egg, I couldn't help but feel the weight of the world pressing down on me. The green light across the water seemed to beckon, a symbol of dreams and desires that perhaps would never be fulfilled. I stayed late that night, contemplating the elusive nature of happiness and the tragic beauty of the world we live in."

Tell him Mr. Carraway came over.”\n“Who?” he demanded rudely.\n“Carraway.”\n“Carraway. All right, I’ll tell him.”\nAbruptly he slammed the door.\nMy Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never went into West Egg village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered moderate supplies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that the kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the village was that the new people weren’t servants at all.\nNext day Gatsby called me on the phone.\n“Going away?” I inquired.\n“No, old sport.”\n“I hear you fired all your servants.”\n“I wanted somebody who wouldn’t gossip. Daisy comes over quite often—in the afternoons.”\nSo the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in her eyes.\n“They’re some people Wolfshiem wanted to do something for.

INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces a reflection by Nick about Gatsby dismantling his social spectacle due to Daisy's disapproval, which is more interpretive and less direct than the original's presentation of this realization.\n- The completion refers to Nick's housekeeper as his 'housekeeper' rather than using the term present in the original, which may lead to confusion about the character's identity.\n- The completion suggests that Gatsby \"confirmed\" he fired his staff, whereas in the original, Gatsby's explanation is more nuanced and includes his reasoning about gossip and Daisy's visits.\n- The completion states that the new staff are \"possibly siblings,\" which is a less direct presentation than the original's dialogue about their relationship and background."

Rumors spread among the neighbors, whispers of scandal and tragedy that seemed to cling to the crumbling facade. Daisy, distant and detached, watched from afar, her heart heavy with a mixture of pity and regret. Gatsby's dreams, once so vivid and alive, had faded into the shadows of his own making, lost amidst the glittering illusions he had so desperately clung to. The green light across the bay, which had symbolized hope and longing, now flickered faintly, a dim reminder of what once was. As the days grew darker, the city moved on, indifferent to the fallen figure who had once dreamed of a future beyond the horizon. Yet, in the quiet moments, some remembered the man who had believed in the possibility of happiness, who had dared to reach for the stars despite the odds. His story, a tragic testament to the elusiveness of the American Dream, lingered in the minds of those who knew him, a cautionary tale wrapped in the shimmering veneer of wealth and glamour. And so, Gatsby's house stood empty, a monument to aspirations that had burned brightly only to be consumed by the relentless march of time and the harsh realities of life."

The house was a charming estate, filled with the scent of fresh flowers and the soft hum of a piano in the background.

We sat in her sunlit garden, sipping tea and chatting about trivial matters, but beneath the surface, I sensed a deeper undercurrent of emotion. Daisy’s voice was light, but her eyes betrayed a hint of longing or regret. As the afternoon wore on, I couldn’t help but feel that this lunch was more than just a social call; it was a window into her soul, revealing her desires and disappointments. The conversation drifted to Gatsby, and Daisy’s tone softened, revealing her complex feelings for him. I realized that beneath her glamorous exterior, she was a woman caught between her dreams and her reality, longing for a love that seemed just out of reach. As I left her house, I felt a renewed sense of understanding of her character—beautiful, fragile, and deeply human."

In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the common store of life.\nThe room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool.

Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting laugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.\n“The rumour is,” whispered Jordan, “that that’s Tom’s girl on the telephone.”\nWe were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance: “Very well, then, I won’t sell you the car at all… I’m under no obligations to you at all… and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time, I won’t stand that at all!”\n“Holding down the receiver,” said Daisy cynically.\n“No, he’s not,” I assured her. “It’s a bona-fide deal. I happen to know about it.”\nTom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his thick body, and hurried into the room.\n“Mr. Gatsby!” He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed dislike. “I’m glad to see you, sir… Nick…”\n“Make us a cold drink,” cried Daisy.\nAs he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and pulled his face down, kissing him on the mouth.\n“You know I love you,” she murmured.\n“You forget there’s a lady present,” said Jordan.\nDaisy looked around doubtfully.\n“You kiss Nick too.”\n“What a low, vulgar girl!”\n“I don’t care!” cried Daisy, and began to clog on the brick fireplace. Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.\n“Bles-sed pre-cious,” she crooned, holding out her arms. “Come to your own mother that loves you.”\nThe child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and rooted shyly into her mother’s dress.\n“The bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy hair? Stand up now, and say—How-de-do.”\nGatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand. Afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise. I don’t think he had ever really believed in its existence before.\n“I got dressed before luncheon,” said the child, turning eagerly to Daisy.\n“That’s because your mother wanted to show you off.” Her face bent into the single wrinkle of the small white neck. “You dream, you. You absolute little dream.”\n“Yes,” admitted the child calmly. “Aunt Jordan’s got on a white dress too.”\n“How do you like mother’s friends?” Daisy turned her around so that she faced Gatsby. “Do you think they’re pretty?”\n“Where’s Daddy?”\n“She doesn’t look like her father,” explained Daisy. “She looks like me. She’s got my hair and shape of the face.”\nDaisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took a step forward and held out her hand.\n“Come, Pammy.”\n“Goodbye, sweetheart!”\nWith a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to her nurse’s hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back, preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.",

The wind seemed to carry with it the distant echoes of a world he longed to be part of, a world of wealth and privilege that he was forever trying to attain. As the bell continued to ring, I could see Gatsby’s mind racing, perhaps contemplating the significance of the call or the person on the other end. The house was silent except for the persistent chime, a reminder of the social obligations and the unspoken tensions that hovered in the air.\n\nInside, the grand hall was decorated with opulent furnishings and shimmering chandeliers, a testament to the Buchanans’ wealth. The walls were lined with portraits and fine art, each piece whispering stories of generations past. The atmosphere was one of effortless elegance, yet beneath the surface, there was an undercurrent of tension, a sense that appearances could be deceiving.\n\nGatsby shifted slightly, adjusting his tie, and looked toward the door with a mixture of anticipation and apprehension. I could tell he was eager to meet Daisy again, to see if the feelings he harbored were still alive and strong. The telephone’s persistent ringing seemed to echo the pounding of his heart, a symbol of the connection he desperately sought.\n\nFinally, the butler appeared, smoothing his coat and clearing his throat. \"Mr. Buchanan is on the line, sir,\" he announced, holding out the receiver. Gatsby nodded, taking the phone with a steady hand. As he listened, his expression remained composed, but I caught a flicker of hope in his eyes. Whatever was being said, it was significant.\n\nAfter a moment, Gatsby replaced the receiver gently and turned to me. \"That was Tom. He’s arranged for us to meet Daisy at her house. She’s expecting us soon.\" His voice was calm, but I could sense the underlying excitement. This meeting was a pivotal moment, a culmination of dreams and desires that had been building for years.\n\nWe stepped into the car, the engine roaring to life as we headed toward East Egg. The drive was brief, yet filled with a mixture of anticipation and reflection. Gatsby gazed out the window, lost in thought, perhaps imagining the reunion or contemplating the future.\n\nArriving at Daisy’s house, we found her waiting on the porch, her face radiant and welcoming. She looked as beautiful as ever, her voice soft and musical as she greeted us. The air was thick with unspoken words and the weight of past memories.\n\nAs we settled into the drawing room, the conversation flowed naturally, yet beneath the surface, there was an undercurrent of tension. Gatsby’s eyes kept drifting toward Daisy, searching for a sign of the affection he so desperately wanted to see. Daisy, for her part, seemed both delighted and conflicted, caught between her feelings and the realities of her life.\n\nThe afternoon passed in a haze of laughter, glances, and subtle exchanges. Gatsby’s dreams seemed to hang in the air, fragile yet persistent. He was determined to recreate the past, to turn back the clock and relive the moments that had defined his love for Daisy.\n\nAs evening approached, the mood shifted. The shadows lengthened, and the conversation grew more introspective. Gatsby’s hope was palpable, yet there was an underlying sadness, a recognition that some things could never be fully restored.\n\nWhen it was time to leave, Daisy’s farewell was tender, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. Gatsby watched her go, a mixture of longing and resignation in his gaze. The night air was cool and still as we drove back to West Egg, the city lights flickering in the distance.\n\nGatsby sat quietly, lost in thought, perhaps contemplating the elusive nature of his dreams. The wind continued to whisper through the night, carrying with it the echoes of a love that was both real and impossible, a testament to the enduring human desire for connection and the tragic beauty of hope."

On the green Sound, stagnant in the heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea. Gatsby’s eyes followed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed across the bay.\n“I’m right across from you.”\n“So you are.”\nOur eyes lifted over the rose-beds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse of the dog-days alongshore. Slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and the abounding blessed isles.\n“There’s sport for you,” said Tom, nodding. “I’d like to be out there with him for about an hour.”\nWe had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat, and drank down nervous gaiety with the cold ale.\n“What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon?” cried Daisy, “and the day after that, and the next thirty years?”\n“Don’t be morbid,” Jordan said. “Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.”\n“But it’s so hot,” insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, “and everything’s so confused. Let’s all go to town!”\nHer voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding its senselessness into forms.\n“I’ve heard of making a garage out of a stable,” Tom was saying to Gatsby, “but I’m the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage.”\n“Who wants to go to town?” demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby’s eyes floated toward her. “Ah,” she cried, “you look so cool.”\nTheir eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space. With an effort she glanced down at the table.\n“You always look so cool,” she repeated.\nShe had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was astounded. His mouth opened a little, and he looked at Gatsby, and then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as someone he knew a long time ago.\n“You resemble the advertisement of the man,” she went on innocently. “You know the advertisement of the man—”\n“All right,” broke in Tom quickly, “I’m perfectly willing to go to town. Come on—we’re all going to town.”\nHe got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife. No one moved.\n“Come on!” His temper cracked a little. “What’s the matter, anyhow? If we’re going to town, let’s start.”\nHis hand, trembling with his effort at self-control, bore to his lips the last of his glass of ale. Daisy’s voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive.\n“Are we just going to go?” she objected. “Like this? Aren’t we going to let anyone smoke a cigarette first?”\n“Everybody smoked all through lunch.”\n“Oh, let’s have fun,” she begged him. “It’s too hot to fuss.”\nHe didn’t answer.\n“Have it your own way,” she said. “Come on, Jordan.”\nThey went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky. Gatsby started to speak, changed his mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.\n“Have you got your stables here?” asked Gatsby with an effort.\n“About a quarter of a mile down the road.”\n“Oh.”\nA pause.\n“I don’t see the idea of going to town,” broke out Tom savagely. “Women get these notions in their heads—”\n“Shall we take anything to drink?” called Daisy from an upper window.\n“I’ll get some whisky,” answered Tom. He went inside.\nGatsby turned to me rigidly:\n“I can’t say anything in his house, old sport.”\n“She’s got an indiscreet voice,” I remarked. “It’s full of—” I hesitated.\n“Her voice is full of money,” he said suddenly.\nThat was it. I’d never understood before. It was full of money—that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals’ song of it… High in a white palace the king’s daughter, the golden girl…\nTom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and carrying light capes over their arms.\n“Shall we all go in my car?” suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, green leather of the seat. “I ought to have left it in the shade.”\n“Is it standard shift?” demanded Tom.\n“Yes.”\n“Well, you take my coupé and let me drive your car to town.”",

Gatsby's world was one of dreams and illusions, where the boundaries between reality and fantasy blurred into a shimmering haze. To him, the suggestion was not merely a matter of taste but a symbol of the superficiality and moral decay that he despised in the society around him.\n\nGatsby's eyes, usually filled with a hopeful glow, darkened with a hint of disdain. He understood that such suggestions were commonplace among the wealthy, yet they clashed painfully with his own sense of integrity and purpose. His life was a testament to his relentless pursuit of a better future, built on honesty and unwavering hope. The suggestion, therefore, felt like a betrayal of everything he stood for.\n\nHe remembered the days when he first arrived in West Egg, full of ambition and a desire to reinvent himself.

It reminded him of the corrupting influence of wealth and the hollow pursuits that many around him indulged in.\n\nGatsby's reaction was not just one of distaste but also of a quiet resolve. He knew that to maintain his dignity, he must distance himself from such vulgarity. His life was a delicate balancing act—striving to attain the American Dream while remaining true to his principles. The suggestion threatened to undermine that balance, to tarnish the ideal he had built.\n\nAs he looked across the room, his gaze fixed on the shimmering lights of his mansion, Gatsby felt a renewed sense of purpose. He would not let the sordidness of others' actions diminish his own integrity.

After a moment the proprietor emerged from the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.\n“Let’s have some gas!” cried Tom roughly. “What do you think we stopped for—to admire the view?”\n“I’m sick,” said Wilson without moving. “Been sick all day.”\n“What’s the matter?”\n“I’m all run down.”\n“Well, shall I help myself?” Tom demanded. “You sounded well enough on the phone.”\nWith an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and, breathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his face was green.\n“I didn’t mean to interrupt your lunch,” he said. “But I need money pretty bad, and I was wondering what you were going to do with your old car.”\n“How do you like this one?” inquired Tom. “I bought it last week.”\n“It’s a nice yellow one,” said Wilson, as he strained at the handle.\n“Like to buy it?”\n“Big chance,” Wilson smiled faintly. “No, but I could make some money on the other.”\n“What do you want money for, all of a sudden?”\n“I’ve been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and I want to go West.”\n“Your wife does,” exclaimed Tom, startled.\n“She’s been talking about it for ten years.” He rested for a moment against the pump, shading his eyes. “And now she’s going whether she wants to or not. I’m going to get her away.”\nThe coupé flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a waving hand.\n“What do I owe you?” demanded Tom harshly.\n“I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,” remarked Wilson. “That’s why I want to get away. That’s why I been bothering you about the car.”\n“What do I owe you?”\n“Dollar twenty.”\nThe relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had a bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadn’t alighted on Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world, and the shock had made him physically sick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour before—and it occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well. Wilson was so sick that he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty—as if he had just got some poor girl with child.\n“I’ll let you have that car,” said Tom.",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents a scene where Myrtle is seen looking down from a window and reacting with jealousy, which does not occur in the original passage. This addition introduces a perspective and event not present in the source material.\n- The completion omits the direct dialogue exchanges between Tom, Wilson, and the others, replacing them with summarized narration. This results in the loss of the original's back-and-forth conversational structure.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the specific sequence of actions involving the car stopping, Tom's impatient behavior, and the detailed physical description of Wilson's condition as he emerges and interacts with the group.\n- The original's detailed financial transaction, including the exact amount owed and the repeated questioning, is missing.\n- The nuanced internal reflection from the narrator about the difference between the sick and the well, and the emotional impact of Wilson's state, is only briefly summarized and lacks the depth and progression found in the original.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion presents events out of order, such as introducing Wilson's knowledge of the affair and his decision to move West before the financial discussion and Tom's offer regarding the car.\n- There is an inaccurate implication that Wilson is aware of the affair in a more explicit way than the original passage conveys at this point.\n- The completion attributes actions and emotional responses to characters (such as Myrtle's reaction from a window) that are not present in the original, and it misplaces the sequence of the coupé passing by and the subsequent dialogue.\n- The summary format leads to a loss of the original's tension and pacing, as well as the omission of key sensory details like the oppressive heat and the physical environment."

            "prefix-probing": "He had warned me that the world was full of illusions, and that beneath the glittering surface, there was often nothing but emptiness. As I looked at the dilapidated billboard, with its once-bright eyes now clouded and faded, I thought about how the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg seemed to watch over everything, yet saw nothing. They were a symbol of the moral decay that had seeped into the fabric of this society, a silent witness to the corruption and superficiality that defined the world of West Egg and East Egg.\n\nGatsby’s caution about gasoline was a metaphor for the fleeting nature of wealth and the danger of relying on material possessions for happiness. He believed that the pursuit of riches was like fueling a car—necessary for movement, but ultimately temporary and potentially destructive if not handled with care. The careless driving of the era, reckless and indifferent to the consequences, reflected the moral carelessness of those who chased after the American Dream.\n\nAs I continued to gaze at the billboard, I remembered how Gatsby’s dreams had been built on illusions—his love for Daisy, his hope for a new life, his belief that he could recreate the past. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg seemed to mock these illusions, watching silently as the characters in this story indulged in their pursuits, oblivious to the moral emptiness that lurked beneath.\n\nThe faded eyes also reminded me of the eyes of society—blind to the suffering of others, deaf to the cries of the less fortunate, and indifferent to the moral decay that was consuming them. They served as a haunting reminder that appearances can be deceiving, and that beneath the veneer of glamour and wealth, there was often a void.\n\nGatsby’s caution about gasoline was a warning about the dangers of excess and the importance of moderation. It was a reminder that the pursuit of happiness should not be driven by greed or superficial desires, but by genuine values and integrity. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, watching over the valley of ashes, seemed to echo this sentiment, urging us to look beyond the surface and seek the truth.\n\nIn that moment, I realized that the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg symbolized the moral conscience that society had long ignored. They stood as a testament to the need for honesty, humility, and compassion in a world obsessed with appearances and material success. As I turned away from the billboard, I felt a renewed sense of awareness, understanding that true fulfillment could not be found in wealth or illusions, but in authentic human connections and moral integrity."

          "text_segment": "That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of something behind. Over the ash-heaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil, but I perceived, after a moment, that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away.\nIn one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little, and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car. So engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed, and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture. Her expression was curiously familiar—it was an expression I had often seen on women’s faces, but on Myrtle Wilson’s face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on Jordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife.\nThere is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping precipitately from his control. Instinct made him step on the accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in sight of the easygoing blue coupé.\n“Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,” suggested Jordan. “I love New York on summer afternoons when everyone’s away. There’s something very sensuous about it—overripe, as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands.”\nThe word “sensuous” had the effect of further disquieting Tom, but before he could invent a protest the coupé came to a stop, and Daisy signalled us to draw up alongside.\n“Where are we going?” she cried.\n“How about the movies?”\n“It’s so hot,” she complained. “You go. We’ll ride around and meet you after.” With an effort her wit rose faintly. “We’ll meet you on some corner. I’ll be the man smoking two cigarettes.”\n“We can’t argue about it here,” Tom said impatiently, as a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind us. “You follow me to the south side of Central Park, in front of the Plaza.”\nSeveral times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight. I think he was afraid they would dart down a side-street and out of his life forever.\nBut they didn’t. And we all took the less explicable step of engaging the parlour of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.\nThe prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into that room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in the course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back. The notion originated with Daisy’s suggestion that we hire five bathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as “a place to have a mint julep.” Each of us said over and over that it was a “crazy idea”—we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought, or pretended to think, that we were being very funny…\nThe room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four o’clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from the Park. Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us, fixing her hair.\n“It’s a swell suite,” whispered Jordan respectfully, and everyone laughed.\n“Open another window,” commanded Daisy, without turning around.\n“There aren’t any more.”\n“Well, we’d better telephone for an axe—”\n“The thing to do is to forget about the heat,” said Tom impatiently. “You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it.”\nHe unrolled the bottle of whisky from the towel and put it on the table.\n“Why not let her alone, old sport?” remarked Gatsby. “You’re the one that wanted to come to town.”\nThere was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered, “Excuse me”—but this time no one laughed.\n“I’ll pick it up,” I offered.\n“I’ve got it.” Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered “Hum!” in an interested way, and tossed the book on a chair.\n“That’s a great expression of yours, isn’t it?” said Tom sharply.\n“What is?”\n“All this ‘old sport’ business. Where’d you pick that up?”\n“Now see here, Tom,” said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, “if you’re going to make personal remarks I won’t stay here a minute. Call up and order some ice for the mint julep.”\nAs Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn’s Wedding March from the ballroom below.\n“Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!” cried Jordan dismally.\n“Still—I was married in the middle of June,” Daisy remembered. “Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?”\n“Biloxi,” he answered shortly.\n“A man named Biloxi. ‘Blocks’ Biloxi, and he made boxes—that’s a fact—and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.”\n“They carried him into my house,” appended Jordan, “because we lived just two doors from the church. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy told him he had to get out. The day after he left Daddy died.” After a moment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent, “There wasn’t any connection.”\n“I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,” I remarked.\n“That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he left. He gave me an aluminium putter that I use today.”",

As I paused, my eyes scanning the shadows cast by the trees, I noticed a figure lurking at the edge of my vision—silent, still, watching. It was then that I realized the true nature of this place: a quiet, almost sinister veneer masking secrets that refused to be uncovered. The air grew heavier, and I sensed that whatever was behind me was not merely a figment of my imagination, but something real, something waiting."

He was a friend of Daisy’s.”\n“He was not,” she denied. “I’d never seen him before. He came down in the private car.”\n“Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville. Asa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room for him.”\nJordan smiled.\n“He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of your class at Yale.”\nTom and I looked at each other blankly.\n“Biloxi?”\n“First place, we didn’t have any president—”\nGatsby’s foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.\n“By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you’re an Oxford man.”\n“Not exactly.”\n“Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.”\n“Yes—I went there.”\nA pause. Then Tom’s voice, incredulous and insulting:\n“You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven.”\nAnother pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but the silence was unbroken by his “thank you” and the soft closing of the door. This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.\n“I told you I went there,” said Gatsby.\n“I heard you, but I’d like to know when.”\n“It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That’s why I can’t really call myself an Oxford man.”\nTom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. But we were all looking at Gatsby.\n“It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the armistice,” he continued. “We could go to any of the universities in England or France.”\nI wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one of those renewals of complete faith in him that I’d experienced before.\nDaisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.\n“Open the whisky, Tom,” she ordered, “and I’ll make you a mint julep. Then you won’t seem so stupid to yourself… Look at the mint!”\n“Wait a minute,” snapped Tom, “I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question.”\n“Go on,” Gatsby said politely.\n“What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?”\nThey were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.\n“He isn’t causing a row,” Daisy looked desperately from one to the other. “You’re causing a row. Please have a little self-control.”\n“Self-control!” repeated Tom incredulously. “I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife. Well, if that’s the idea you can count me out… Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next they’ll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white.”\nFlushed with his impassioned gibberish, he saw himself standing alone on the last barrier of civilization.\n“We’re all white here,” murmured Jordan.\n“I know I’m not very popular. I don’t give big parties. I suppose you’ve got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any friends—in the modern world.”\nAngry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened his mouth. The transition from libertine to prig was so complete.\n“I’ve got something to tell you, old sport—” began Gatsby. But Daisy guessed at his intention.\n“Please don’t!” she interrupted helplessly. “Please let’s all go home. Why don’t we all go home?”\n“That’s a good idea,” I got up. “Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.”\n“I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.”\n“Your wife doesn’t love you,” said Gatsby. “She’s never loved you. She loves me.”\n“You must be crazy!” exclaimed Tom automatically.\nGatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.\n“She never loved you, do you hear?” he cried. “She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone except me!”\nAt this point Jordan and I tried to go, but Tom and Gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that we remain—as though neither of them had anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emotions.\n“Sit down, Daisy,” Tom’s voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal note. “What’s been going on? I want to hear all about it.”\n“I told you what’s been going on,” said Gatsby. “Going on for five years—and you didn’t know.”\nTom turned to Daisy sharply.\n“You’ve been seeing this fellow for five years?”\n“Not seeing,” said Gatsby. “No, we couldn’t meet. But both of us loved each other all that time, old sport, and you didn’t know. I used to laugh sometimes”—but there was no laughter in his eyes—“to think that you didn’t know.”\n“Oh—that’s all.” Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman and leaned back in his chair.\n“You’re crazy!” he exploded. “I can’t speak about what happened five years ago, because I didn’t know Daisy then—and I’ll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door. But all the rest of that’s a God damned lie. Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now.”\n“No,” said Gatsby, shaking his head.\n“She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her head and doesn’t know what she’s doing.” He nodded sagely. “And what’s more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time.”\n“You’re revolting,” said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice, dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: “Do you know why we left Chicago? I’m surprised that they didn’t treat you to the story of that little spree.”\nGatsby walked over and stood beside her.\n“Daisy, that’s all over now,” he said earnestly. “It doesn’t matter any more. Just tell him the truth—that you never loved him—and it’s all wiped out forever.”\nShe looked at him blindly. “Why—how could I love him—possibly?”\n“You never loved him.”\nShe hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal, as though she realized at last what she was doing—and as though she had never, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done now. It was too late.\n“I never loved him,” she said, with perceptible reluctance.\n“Not at Kapiolani?” demanded Tom suddenly.\n“No.”\nFrom the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up on hot waves of air.\n“Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry?” There was a husky tenderness in his tone… “Daisy?”\n“Please don’t.” Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it. She looked at Gatsby. “There, Jay,” she said—but her hand as she tried to light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette and the burning match on the carpet.\n“Oh, you want too much!” she cried to Gatsby. “I love you now—isn’t that enough? I can’t help what’s past.” She began to sob helplessly. “I did love him once—but I loved you too.”\nGatsby’s eyes opened and closed.\n“You loved me too?” he repeated.\n“Even that’s a lie,” said Tom savagely. “She didn’t know you were alive. Why—there’s things between Daisy and me that you’ll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget.”\nThe words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.\n“I want to speak to Daisy alone,” he insisted. “She’s all excited now—”\n“Even alone I can’t say I never loved Tom,” she admitted in a pitiful voice. “It wouldn’t be true.”\n“Of course it wouldn’t,” agreed Tom.\nShe turned to her husband.\n“As if it mattered to you,” she said.\n“Of course it matters. I’m going to take better care of you from now on.”\n“You don’t understand,” said Gatsby, with a touch of panic. “You’re not going to take care of her any more.”\n“I’m not?” Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to control himself now. “Why’s that?”\n“Daisy’s leaving you.”\n“Nonsense.”\n“I am, though,” she said with a visible effort.\n“She’s not leaving me!” Tom’s words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby. “Certainly not for a common swindler who’d have to steal the ring he put on her finger.”\n“I won’t stand this!” cried Daisy. “Oh, please let’s get out.”\n“Who are you, anyhow?” broke out Tom. “You’re one of that bunch that hangs around with Meyer Wolfshiem—that much I happen to know. I’ve made a little investigation into your affairs—and I’ll carry it further tomorrow.”\n“You can suit yourself about that, old sport,” said Gatsby steadily.\n“I found out what your ‘drugstores’ were.” He turned to us and spoke rapidly. “He and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of side-street drugstores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter. That’s one of his little stunts. I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw him, and I wasn’t far wrong.”\n“What about it?” said Gatsby politely. “I guess your friend Walter Chase wasn’t too proud to come in on it.”\n“And you left him in the lurch, didn’t you? You let him go to jail for a month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the subject of you.”\n“He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old sport.”\n“Don’t you call me ‘old sport’!” cried Tom. Gatsby said nothing. “Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but Wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth.”\nThat unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby’s face.\n“That drugstore business was just small change,” continued Tom slowly, “but you’ve got something on now that Walter’s afraid to tell me about.”\nI glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her husband, and at Jordan, who had begun to balance an invisible but absorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back to Gatsby—and was startled at his expression. He looked—and this is said in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden—as if he had “killed a man.” For a moment the set of his face could be described in just that fantastic way.\nIt passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been made. But with every word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave that up, and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room.\nThe voice begged again to go.",

            "prefix-probing": "The scene was alive with energy, a stark contrast to the quiet anticipation that had settled over the gathering earlier in the evening. Guests, dressed in their finest, moved with a certain exuberance, their laughter mingling with the lively tunes that filled the air. The glow of lanterns cast a warm light over the lawn, illuminating the faces of those who had come to celebrate, to forget, and perhaps to remember.\n\nAt the center of it all was Gatsby, standing apart for a moment, watching the revelry with a faint smile. His eyes, however, betrayed a hint of longing, a reflection of dreams that seemed just out of reach. The music, once a background hum, now surged forward with a vigor that matched the pulse of the night.\n\nAs the jazz band played on, couples spun around the dance floor, their movements a blur of color and motion. The air was thick with the scent of blooming flowers and the sweet aroma of champagne, mingling into a heady perfume that seemed to intoxicate everyone present. The night was young, and the promise of endless possibility shimmered in the air.\n\nIn the midst of the celebration, Nick Carraway observed quietly, noting the joy and the underlying tensions that such gatherings often concealed. He thought of Gatsby, of his relentless hope and the mysterious aura that surrounded him. Despite the opulence and the gaiety, there was an undercurrent of something more profound, a yearning for a past that could never be reclaimed.\n\nThe crowd's energy was infectious, and soon, even the most reserved found themselves swept up in the rhythm. Laughter erupted, glasses clinked, and the night stretched on, a tapestry woven with moments of fleeting happiness and the silent acknowledgment of life's inevitable sorrows.\n\nAs the evening progressed, the stars began to twinkle brighter in the clear sky, mirroring the sparkle in the eyes of those who danced beneath them. The world outside seemed to fade away, leaving only this ephemeral bubble of joy and celebration. Yet, amidst the merriment, a sense of melancholy lingered, a reminder of the transient nature of such moments.\n\nGatsby, ever the enigmatic host, finally stepped forward, raising his glass in a silent toast to the night and to the dreams that fueled it. His gaze swept over the gathering, a mixture of hope and nostalgia in his eyes. For a moment, he was lost in the memory of a love long gone, a love that had once seemed as real and as vibrant as the music now filling the air.\n\nThe night wore on, and as dawn approached, the revelers began to drift away, their spirits sated but their hearts heavy with the knowledge that such nights were rare and fleeting. Gatsby remained for a while longer, standing alone as the last notes of jazz faded into the morning light.\n\nIn the quiet that followed, the mansion stood silent, a monument to dreams and desires, to the beauty and tragedy of the human spirit. And as the sun rose higher, casting its golden glow over West Egg, the world moved forward, carrying with it the memories of a night when music had died down, only to be reborn in the hearts of those who had lived it."

The realization hit him with a strange weight—he was entering a new decade, and with it, perhaps, a new sense of loneliness and diminished prospects. As they drove back to Long Island, Nick found himself detached from Tom’s exultant talk about the future. He looked over at Jordan, whose presence beside him was a small comfort amid the fading glow of the evening. Crossing the bridge, Nick felt a fleeting sense of relief, as if momentarily forgetting the weight of turning thirty. He thought of the journey ahead, of life’s inevitable march toward its end, and reflected that they were driving ‘toward death through the cooling twilight.’",

Daisy’s voice trembled, her eyes pleading, as she clutched at his arm. The room was thick with unspoken words and the weight of their tangled lives. Outside, the summer heat pressed down, mirroring the tension inside. Tom’s jaw tightened, and he took a deep breath, trying to steady himself. He knew this moment was inevitable, yet he hesitated, caught between his pride and his love for her. Daisy’s tears shimmered in the dim light, and she looked at him with a desperation that pierced through his defenses. The silence stretched, heavy and oppressive, until Tom finally spoke, his voice low and strained. \"Daisy, you know I love you, but we can't keep pretending everything's alright. We have to face the truth, no matter how painful it is.\" Her sobs subsided into quiet sniffles, and she nodded slowly, understanding the gravity of his words. The room seemed to hold its breath as they confronted their reality—an intricate web of desire, betrayal, and longing that defined their lives. Outside, the world continued unaware of the storm raging within these walls, a testament to the fragility of happiness and the destructive power of secrets. As they sat in silence, the past and present intertwined, leaving them to grapple with the consequences of their choices, knowing that nothing could ever be the same again."

          "text_segment": "The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the ash-heaps was the principal witness at the inquest. He had slept through the heat until after five, when he strolled over to the garage, and found George Wilson sick in his office—really sick, pale as his own pale hair and shaking all over. Michaelis advised him to go to bed, but Wilson refused, saying that he’d miss a lot of business if he did. While his neighbour was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke out overhead.\n“I’ve got my wife locked in up there,” explained Wilson calmly. “She’s going to stay there till the day after tomorrow, and then we’re going to move away.”\nMichaelis was astonished; they had been neighbours for four years, and Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement. Generally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn’t working, he sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed along the road. When anyone spoke to him he invariably laughed in an agreeable, colourless way. He was his wife’s man and not his own.\nSo naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson wouldn’t say a word—instead he began to throw curious, suspicious glances at his visitor and ask him what he’d been doing at certain times on certain days. Just as the latter was getting uneasy, some workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant, and Michaelis took the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he didn’t. He supposed he forgot to, that’s all. When he came outside again, a little after seven, he was reminded of the conversation because he heard Mrs. Wilson’s voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in the garage.\n“Beat me!” he heard her cry. “Throw me down and beat me, you dirty little coward!”\nA moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and shouting—before he could move from his door the business was over.\nThe “death car” as the newspapers called it, didn’t stop; it came out of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, and then disappeared around the next bend. Mavro Michaelis wasn’t even sure of its colour—he told the first policeman that it was light green. The other car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark blood with the dust.\nMichaelis and this man reached her first, but when they had torn open her shirtwaist, still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap, and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped a little at the corners, as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long.",

            "prefix-probing": "Michaelis, a young Greek, was known for his quiet demeanor and keen observational skills. His coffee shop, situated conveniently beside the ash-heaps, served as a gathering spot for the local community, where gossip and news were exchanged over steaming cups of coffee. On the day of the inquest, Michaelis's testimony was crucial in shedding light on the events leading up to the tragic incident. He described seeing Gatsby's car speeding along the road, swerving dangerously close to the curb, and heard the screech of tires just before the crash. His account was detailed, noting the time and the weather conditions, which seemed to influence the driver’s visibility and control. Michaelis's observations helped establish a timeline, placing Gatsby at the scene shortly before the accident. Despite his modesty, his testimony was considered credible, as he was known for his honesty and straightforwardness. The inquest revealed the complexities surrounding the accident, including the role of Daisy Buchanan, who was driving the car at the time. Michaelis's insights contributed to the understanding that Gatsby was not the reckless driver, but rather a victim of circumstance. His presence at the inquest underscored the interconnectedness of the community, where even a humble coffee shop owner could influence the course of justice. As the proceedings concluded, Michaelis's words echoed in the minds of those present, highlighting the tragic consequences of careless love and the elusive nature of the American Dream. The case left a lasting impression on the community, reminding everyone of the fragile veneer of civility that often masks deeper tensions and secrets. Michaelis's testimony, though simple, was a testament to the importance of truth in the face of tragedy, and his role as a witness underscored the collective effort to seek justice amidst the chaos of that fateful day."

          "text_segment": "We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still some distance away.\n“Wreck!” said Tom. “That’s good. Wilson’ll have a little business at last.”\nHe slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping, until, as we came nearer, the hushed, intent faces of the people at the garage door made him automatically put on the brakes.\n“We’ll take a look,” he said doubtfully, “just a look.”\nI became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly from the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coupé and walked toward the door resolved itself into the words “Oh, my God!” uttered over and over in a gasping moan.\n“There’s some bad trouble here,” said Tom excitedly.\nHe reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage, which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging metal basket overhead. Then he made a harsh sound in his throat, and with a violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through.\nThe circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it was a minute before I could see anything at all. Then new arrivals deranged the line, and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.\nMyrtle Wilson’s body, wrapped in a blanket, and then in another blanket, as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night, lay on a worktable by the wall, and Tom, with his back to us, was bending over it, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down names with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I couldn’t find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed clamorously through the bare garage—then I saw Wilson standing on the raised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to the doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low voice and attempting, from time to time, to lay a hand on his shoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall, and then jerk back to the light again, and he gave out incessantly his high, horrible call:\n“Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!”\nPresently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and, after staring around the garage with glazed eyes, addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the policeman.\n“M-a-v—” the policeman was saying, “—o—”\n“No, r—” corrected the man, “M-a-v-r-o—”\n“Listen to me!” muttered Tom fiercely.\n“r—” said the policeman, “o—”\n“g—”\n“g—” He looked up as Tom’s broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder. “What you want, fella?”\n“What happened?—that’s what I want to know.”\n“Auto hit her. Ins’antly killed.”\n“Instantly killed,” repeated Tom, staring.\n“She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn’t even stopus car.”\n“There was two cars,” said Michaelis, “one comin’, one goin’, see?”\n“Going where?” asked the policeman keenly.\n“One goin’ each way. Well, she”—his hand rose toward the blankets but stopped halfway and fell to his side—“she ran out there an’ the one comin’ from N’York knock right into her, goin’ thirty or forty miles an hour.”\n“What’s the name of this place here?” demanded the officer.\n“Hasn’t got any name.”\nA pale well-dressed negro stepped near.\n“It was a yellow car,” he said, “big yellow car. New.”\n“See the accident?” asked the policeman.\n“No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster’n forty. Going fifty, sixty.”\n“Come here and let’s have your name. Look out now. I want to get his name.”\nSome words of this conversation must have reached Wilson, swaying in the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his grasping cries:\n“You don’t have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of car it was!”\nWatching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten under his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and, standing in front of him, seized him firmly by the upper arms.\n“You’ve got to pull yourself together,” he said with soothing gruffness.\nWilson’s eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.\n“Listen,” said Tom, shaking him a little. “I just got here a minute ago, from New York. I was bringing you that coupé we’ve been talking about. That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn’t mine—do you hear? I haven’t seen it all afternoon.”\nOnly the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said, but the policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent eyes.\n“What’s all that?” he demanded.\n“I’m a friend of his.” Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on Wilson’s body. “He says he knows the car that did it… It was a yellow car.”\nSome dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.\n“And what colour’s your car?”\n“It’s a blue car, a coupé.”\n“We’ve come straight from New York,” I said.\nSomeone who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this, and the policeman turned away.\n“Now, if you’ll let me have that name again correct—”\nPicking up Wilson like a doll, Tom carried him into the office, set him down in a chair, and came back.\n“If somebody’ll come here and sit with him,” he snapped authoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the door on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the table. As he passed close to me he whispered: “Let’s get out.”\nSelf-consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we pushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor, case in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.\nTom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend—then his foot came down hard, and the coupé raced along through the night. In a little while I heard a low husky sob, and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face.\n“The God damned coward!” he whimpered.",

          "text_segment": "The Buchanans’ house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling trees. Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor, where two windows bloomed with light among the vines.\n“Daisy’s home,” he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and frowned slightly.\n“I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There’s nothing we can do tonight.”\nA change had come over him, and he spoke gravely, and with decision. As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of the situation in a few brisk phrases.\n“I’ll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you’re waiting you and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some supper—if you want any.” He opened the door. “Come in.”\n“No, thanks. But I’d be glad if you’d order me the taxi. I’ll wait outside.”\nJordan put her hand on my arm.\n“Won’t you come in, Nick?”\n“No, thanks.”\nI was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan lingered for a moment more.\n“It’s only half-past nine,” she said.\nI’d be damned if I’d go in; I’d had enough of all of them for one day, and suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of this in my expression, for she turned abruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the house. I sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler’s voice calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the house, intending to wait by the gate.\nI hadn’t gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from between two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird by that time, because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon.\n“What are you doing?” I inquired.\n“Just standing here, old sport.”\nSomehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was going to rob the house in a moment; I wouldn’t have been surprised to see sinister faces, the faces of “Wolfshiem’s people,” behind him in the dark shrubbery.\n“Did you see any trouble on the road?” he asked after a minute.\n“Yes.”\nHe hesitated.\n“Was she killed?”\n“Yes.”\n“I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It’s better that the shock should all come at once. She stood it pretty well.”\nHe spoke as if Daisy’s reaction was the only thing that mattered.\n“I got to West Egg by a side road,” he went on, “and left the car in my garage. I don’t think anybody saw us, but of course I can’t be sure.”\nI disliked him so much by this time that I didn’t find it necessary to tell him he was wrong.\n“Who was the woman?” he inquired.\n“Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did it happen?”\n“Well, I tried to swing the wheel—” He broke off, and suddenly I guessed at the truth.\n“Was Daisy driving?”\n“Yes,” he said after a moment, “but of course I’ll say I was. You see, when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to drive—and this woman rushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute, but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second my hand reached the wheel I felt the shock—it must have killed her instantly.”\n“It ripped her open—”\n“Don’t tell me, old sport.” He winced. “Anyhow—Daisy stepped on it. I tried to make her stop, but she couldn’t, so I pulled on the emergency brake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.\n“She’ll be all right tomorrow,” he said presently. “I’m just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon. She’s locked herself into her room, and if he tries any brutality she’s going to turn the light out and on again.”\n“He won’t touch her,” I said. “He’s not thinking about her.”\n“I don’t trust him, old sport.”\n“How long are you going to wait?”\n“All night, if necessary. Anyhow, till they all go to bed.”\nA new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy had been driving. He might think he saw a connection in it—he might think anything. I looked at the house; there were two or three bright windows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy’s room on the ground floor.\n“You wait here,” I said. “I’ll see if there’s any sign of a commotion.”\nI walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel softly, and tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains were open, and I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where we had dined that June night three months before, I came to a small rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window. The blind was drawn, but I found a rift at the sill.\nDaisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table, with a plate of cold fried chicken between them, and two bottles of ale. He was talking intently across the table at her, and in his earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own. Once in a while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.\nThey weren’t happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the ale—and yet they weren’t unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture, and anybody would have said that they were conspiring together.\nAs I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the dark road toward the house. Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in the drive.\n“Is it all quiet up there?” he asked anxiously.\n“Yes, it’s all quiet.” I hesitated. “You’d better come home and get some sleep.”\nHe shook his head.\n“I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport.”\nHe put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the moonlight—watching over nothing.",

            "prefix-probing": "It was a magnificent place, a cheerful red and white Georgian Colonial mansion overlooking the bay. The windows were ajar and gleaming, and the garden was full of bright, fragrant flowers. As we approached, the sound of soft music drifted out, mingling with the gentle rustling of the leaves. Daisy and Tom Buchanan were waiting on the porch, their faces lit with a kind of careless ease that seemed to embody the opulence and indifference of their world. Daisy’s voice, light and musical, called out to us as we drew near, her eyes sparkling with a mixture of warmth and mischief. Tom, standing beside her, tipped his head back and let out a deep, resonant laugh, his presence commanding and confident. The house, with its grand façade and lush surroundings, seemed to float effortlessly through the darkness, a symbol of the wealth and privilege that defined the Buchanans’ lives. Inside, the rooms were filled with the glow of lamps and the scent of expensive perfume, a testament to their taste and social standing. As we stepped inside, the atmosphere shifted—an air of superficial charm and underlying tension that was characteristic of the world they inhabited. The house was a sanctuary of sorts, a place where appearances mattered more than reality, where the glittering surface concealed the complexities and contradictions beneath."

We pushed aside curtains that were like pavilions, and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for electric light switches—once I tumbled with a sort of splash upon the keys of a ghostly piano. There was an inexplicable amount of dust everywhere, and the rooms were musty, as though they hadn’t been aired for many days.

The air was thick with the scent of salt and the distant, mournful cry of seagulls. I rose from my bed, feeling the weight of the night’s unrest pressing heavily on my chest. Outside, the world seemed to be holding its breath, waiting for the sun to dispel the darkness that clung to everything. I remembered the stories of Gatsby, a man who had once believed in the possibility of a perfect future, only to be betrayed by the illusions he cherished. His dreams, like the foghorn’s mournful call, echoed in my mind—persistent, haunting, and impossible to ignore. As I looked out over the Sound, I thought of the endless pursuit of happiness, the elusive green light across the bay that symbolized hope and longing. The city was waking up, but I felt suspended in a liminal space between sleep and wakefulness, caught between the harsh reality of my surroundings and the seductive allure of dreams. The past lingered like a shadow, whispering secrets I could never quite grasp. Yet, amidst the chaos of my thoughts, there was a strange comfort in the familiarity of the night’s turmoil, a reminder that life’s uncertainties are what make the pursuit of meaning both tragic and beautiful. With a deep breath, I prepared to face the day, carrying the echoes of dreams and the silent promise of dawn."

I think that he would have acknowledged anything now, without reserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy.\nShe was the first “nice” girl he had ever known. In various unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people, but always with indiscernible barbed wire between. He found her excitingly desirable. He went to her house, at first with other officers from Camp Taylor, then alone. It amazed him—he had never been in such a beautiful house before. But what gave it an air of breathless intensity, was that Daisy lived there—it was as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it, a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors, and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year’s shining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered. It excited him, too, that many men had already loved Daisy—it increased her value in his eyes. He felt their presence all about the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions.\nBut he knew that he was in Daisy’s house by a colossal accident. However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders. So he made the most of his time. He took what he could get, ravenously and unscrupulously—eventually he took Daisy one still October night, took her because he had no real right to touch her hand.\nHe might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under false pretences. I don’t mean that he had traded on his phantom millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he let her believe that he was a person from much the same strata as herself—that he was fully able to take care of her. As a matter of fact, he had no such facilities—he had no comfortable family standing behind him, and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the world.\nBut he didn’t despise himself and it didn’t turn out as he had imagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go—but now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail. He knew that Daisy was extraordinary, but he didn’t realize just how extraordinary a “nice” girl could be. She vanished into her rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby—nothing. He felt married to her, that was all.\nWhen they met again, two days later, it was Gatsby who was breathless, who was, somehow, betrayed. Her porch was bright with the bought luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth. She had caught a cold, and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever, and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor.\n“I can’t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her, old sport. I even hoped for a while that she’d throw me over, but she didn’t, because she was in love with me too. She thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her… Well, there I was, way off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden I didn’t care. What was the use of doing great things if I could have a better time telling her what I was going to do?”\nOn the last afternoon before he went abroad, he sat with Daisy in his arms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day, with fire in the room and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he changed his arm a little, and once he kissed her dark shining hair. The afternoon had made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised. They had never been closer in their month of love, nor communicated more profoundly one with another, than when she brushed silent lips against his coat’s shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were asleep.",

Gatsby’s voice was tinged with a mixture of admiration and regret as he recounted how Cody, a wealthy copper magnate, had taken him under his wing, introducing him to a world of luxury and excess that he had only dreamed of before. The nights they spent together on the yacht, the parties, the endless champagne, and the sense of freedom that came with it—all of these memories seemed to flicker in his eyes like distant stars.\n\nGatsby explained how those experiences shaped his aspirations, fueling his desire to reinvent himself and attain the grandeur he believed he deserved. Yet, beneath the surface of his recounting lay a hint of melancholy, a recognition that those days of innocence and ambition had been fleeting, swallowed by the relentless march of time and the realities of his present life.\n\nHe told me how he had worked tirelessly to forge his own identity, to rise above his humble beginnings, and to craft a persona that would command respect and admiration. The image of Dan Cody served as both inspiration and cautionary tale—an emblem of the opulence he yearned for but also a reminder of the fleeting nature of wealth and the importance of integrity.\n\nAs he spoke, I could see the flicker of a dream still alive within him, a hope that someday he might recapture that sense of wonder and achievement. Yet, I also sensed the underlying sadness, the acknowledgment that the past was a place he could never truly return to, and that the illusions of grandeur often concealed a deeper emptiness.\n\nThe night grew deeper, and the stories of youth and ambition intertwined with the present, revealing the complex tapestry of Gatsby’s life—a life driven by love, longing, and the relentless pursuit of a dream that perhaps was never meant to be fully realized. In that moment, I understood that his story was not just about wealth or status, but about the human desire for acceptance and the eternal quest for meaning in a world that often seemed indifferent to such aspirations."

          "text_segment": "He did extraordinarily well in the war. He was a captain before he went to the front, and following the Argonne battles he got his majority and the command of the divisional machine-guns. After the armistice he tried frantically to get home, but some complication or misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He was worried now—there was a quality of nervous despair in Daisy’s letters. She didn’t see why he couldn’t come. She was feeling the pressure of the world outside, and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all.\nFor Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes. All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the “Beale Street Blues” while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust. At the grey tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low, sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the floor.\nThrough this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men, and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening-dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed. And all the time something within her was crying for a decision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately—and the decision must be made by some force—of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality—that was close at hand.\nThat force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom Buchanan. There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his position, and Daisy was flattered. Doubtless there was a certain struggle and a certain relief. The letter reached Gatsby while he was still at Oxford.\nIt was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of the windows downstairs, filling the house with grey-turning, gold-turning light. The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. There was a slow, pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool, lovely day.\n“I don’t think she ever loved him.” Gatsby turned around from a window and looked at me challengingly. “You must remember, old sport, she was very excited this afternoon. He told her those things in a way that frightened her—that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper. And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying.”\nHe sat down gloomily.\n“Of course she might have loved him just for a minute, when they were first married—and loved me more even then, do you see?”\nSuddenly he came out with a curious remark.\n“In any case,” he said, “it was just personal.”\nWhat could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in his conception of the affair that couldn’t be measured?\nHe came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their wedding trip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to Louisville on the last of his army pay. He stayed there a week, walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through the November night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which they had driven in her white car. Just as Daisy’s house had always seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses, so his idea of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded with a melancholy beauty.\nHe left feeling that if he had searched harder, he might have found her—that he was leaving her behind. The day-coach—he was penniless now—was hot. He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a folding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar buildings moved by. Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street.\nThe track curved and now it was going away from the sun, which, as it sank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing city where she had drawn her breath. He stretched out his hand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of the spot that she had made lovely for him. But it was all going by too fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of it, the freshest and the best, forever.",

Leaves’ll start falling pretty soon, and then there’s always trouble with the pipes.”\n“Don’t do it today,” Gatsby answered.

It was the only compliment I ever gave him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end. First he nodded politely, and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding smile, as if we’d been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time. His gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of colour against the white steps, and I thought of the night when I first came to his ancestral home, three months before.

She told me that Gatsby wanted to see me, and I agreed to meet him at his mansion. As I drove through the bustling streets, I reflected on the strange, shimmering world that Gatsby inhabited—a world of wealth, hope, and longing. When I arrived, Gatsby greeted me with a smile that seemed both welcoming and distant, as if he was always waiting for something just beyond reach. We sat in his grand garden, where the lights flickered like stars, and he began to speak of his dreams and the past he cherished. His voice was filled with a mixture of nostalgia and determination, revealing the depth of his desire to recreate a lost love and attain a future he had envisioned. As the evening wore on, I realized that Gatsby's relentless pursuit of happiness was both admirable and tragic, a testament to the human spirit's unyielding hope amidst the illusions of wealth and status. The night ended with a sense of melancholy, yet also a strange admiration for his unwavering belief in the possibility of a perfect future, no matter how elusive it seemed."

I tried four times; finally an exasperated central told me the wire was being kept open for long distance from Detroit. Taking out my timetable, I drew a small circle around the three-fifty train. Then I leaned back in my chair and tried to think. It was just noon.\nWhen I passed the ash-heaps on the train that morning I had crossed deliberately to the other side of the car. I supposed there’d be a curious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark spots in the dust, and some garrulous man telling over and over what had happened, until it became less and less real even to him and he could tell it no longer, and Myrtle Wilson’s tragic achievement was forgotten. Now I want to go back a little and tell what happened at the garage after we left there the night before.\nThey had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine. She must have broken her rule against drinking that night, for when she arrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had already gone to Flushing. When they convinced her of this, she immediately fainted, as if that was the intolerable part of the affair. Someone, kind or curious, took her in his car and drove her in the wake of her sister’s body.\nUntil long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front of the garage, while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on the couch inside. For a while the door of the office was open, and everyone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it. Finally someone said it was a shame, and closed the door. Michaelis and several other men were with him; first, four or five men, later two or three men. Still later Michaelis had to ask the last stranger to wait there fifteen minutes longer, while he went back to his own place and made a pot of coffee.

            "prefix-probing": "I called Gatsby’s house a few minutes later, but the line was busy. The night was thick and heavy, filled with the distant hum of cars and the faint glow of lights from the mansion. I wondered what he was doing, where he was, and if he was thinking of me. The air was tinged with a sense of anticipation, a feeling that something significant was about to unfold. As I stood there, the cool breeze brushed past, carrying with it the scent of the ocean and the promise of secrets yet to be revealed. I knew that Gatsby was a man of mystery, always just out of reach, always hiding behind a facade of charm and wealth. Yet, beneath that veneer, I sensed a longing, a desire for something more than the glittering surface of his life. The busy line was a small obstacle, a reminder of the barriers that kept us apart, but also a symbol of the connection we shared—fragile, fleeting, yet real. I wondered if he was waiting for my call, if he felt the same urgency I did to bridge the gap between us. The night stretched on, silent except for the occasional distant sound of laughter or music from the parties he hosted. I thought about the green light across the bay, a beacon of hope and dreams, flickering softly in the darkness. It represented everything I yearned for—love, success, acceptance. As I looked out over the water, I felt a mixture of hope and despair, knowing that the path to happiness was fraught with obstacles. Still, I held onto the belief that someday, somehow, we would find our way to each other. The busy line finally went silent, and I was left with only my thoughts and the quiet hum of the night. I took a deep breath, feeling the weight of the moment settle over me. Despite the distance and the obstacles, I knew that my feelings for Gatsby were real, and that I would wait as long as it took for our story to unfold."

          "text_segment": "About three o’clock the quality of Wilson’s incoherent muttering changed—he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car. He announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car belonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen.\nBut when he heard himself say this, he flinched and began to cry “Oh, my God!” again in his groaning voice. Michaelis made a clumsy attempt to distract him.\n“How long have you been married, George? Come on there, try and sit still a minute, and answer my question. How long have you been married?”\n“Twelve years.”\n“Ever had any children? Come on, George, sit still—I asked you a question. Did you ever have any children?”\nThe hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light, and whenever Michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him like the car that hadn’t stopped a few hours before. He didn’t like to go into the garage, because the work bench was stained where the body had been lying, so he moved uncomfortably around the office—he knew every object in it before morning—and from time to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep him more quiet.\n“Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George? Maybe even if you haven’t been there for a long time? Maybe I could call up the church and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?”\n“Don’t belong to any.”\n“You ought to have a church, George, for times like this. You must have gone to church once. Didn’t you get married in a church? Listen, George, listen to me. Didn’t you get married in a church?”\n“That was a long time ago.”\nThe effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking—for a moment he was silent. Then the same half-knowing, half-bewildered look came back into his faded eyes.\n“Look in the drawer there,” he said, pointing at the desk.\n“Which drawer?”\n“That drawer—that one.”\nMichaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand. There was nothing in it but a small, expensive dog-leash, made of leather and braided silver. It was apparently new.\n“This?” he inquired, holding it up.\nWilson stared and nodded.\n“I found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell me about it, but I knew it was something funny.”\n“You mean your wife bought it?”\n“She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau.”\nMichaelis didn’t see anything odd in that, and he gave Wilson a dozen reasons why his wife might have bought the dog-leash. But conceivably Wilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle, because he began saying “Oh, my God!” again in a whisper—his comforter left several explanations in the air.\n“Then he killed her,” said Wilson. His mouth dropped open suddenly.\n“Who did?”\n“I have a way of finding out.”\n“You’re morbid, George,” said his friend. “This has been a strain to you and you don’t know what you’re saying. You’d better try and sit quiet till morning.”\n“He murdered her.”\n“It was an accident, George.”\nWilson shook his head. His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened slightly with the ghost of a superior “Hm!”\n“I know,” he said definitely. “I’m one of these trusting fellas and I don’t think any harm to nobody, but when I get to know a thing I know it. It was the man in that car. She ran out to speak to him and he wouldn’t stop.”\nMichaelis had seen this too, but it hadn’t occurred to him that there was any special significance in it. He believed that Mrs. Wilson had been running away from her husband, rather than trying to stop any particular car.\n“How could she of been like that?”\n“She’s a deep one,” said Wilson, as if that answered the question. “Ah-h-h—”\nHe began to rock again, and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in his hand.\n“Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George?”\nThis was a forlorn hope—he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend: there was not enough of him for his wife. He was glad a little later when he noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window, and realized that dawn wasn’t far off. About five o’clock it was blue enough outside to snap off the light.\nWilson’s glazed eyes turned out to the ash-heaps, where small grey clouds took on fantastic shapes and scurried here and there in the faint dawn wind.\n“I spoke to her,” he muttered, after a long silence. “I told her she might fool me but she couldn’t fool God. I took her to the window”—with an effort he got up and walked to the rear window and leaned with his face pressed against it—“and I said ‘God knows what you’ve been doing, everything you’ve been doing. You may fool me, but you can’t fool God!’ ”\nStanding behind him, Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, which had just emerged, pale and enormous, from the dissolving night.\n“God sees everything,” repeated Wilson.\n“That’s an advertisement,” Michaelis assured him. Something made him turn away from the window and look back into the room. But Wilson stood there a long time, his face close to the window pane, nodding into the twilight.",

            "prefix-probing": "He seemed to be recalling something, his voice dropping to a whisper as he muttered about the car that had brought tragedy into his life. The yellow car, a symbol of wealth and carelessness, had become a haunting memory for Wilson. As he spoke, his words were fragmented, filled with a mixture of anger and despair. Daisy's voice echoed in his mind, her laughter and her careless driving, which had ultimately led to the death of Myrtle.\n\nWilson's hands trembled as he remembered the day of the accident. He had been working in his garage, the scent of oil and gasoline thick in the air, when he saw the yellow car speed past. The car's sleek body and bright color had always caught his eye, but now it seemed to mock him, a reminder of the night that changed everything. He had run outside, shouting for the car to stop, but it was too late. Myrtle had been hit, and the driver had vanished into the night.\n\nThe memory of that evening was etched deeply into Wilson's mind. He saw the scene over and over again—the flashing headlights, Myrtle's scream, the terrible impact. His grief and rage had grown since that day, fueling his obsession with finding the owner of the yellow car. He believed that the man who owned it was responsible for Myrtle's death, and he was determined to confront him.\n\nAs Wilson continued to mutter about the yellow car, his voice grew more distant, as if he was reliving the moment. The world around him seemed to fade away, leaving only the image of the car and the tragedy it had brought. His mind was consumed with thoughts of justice, of holding the guilty party accountable.\n\nMeanwhile, the atmosphere in the room was tense. Tom Buchanan, who had been listening quietly, now looked uneasy. He knew that Wilson's fixation on the yellow car was dangerous, and he feared that the situation might escalate. Daisy, sitting nearby, appeared distressed, her face pale and her hands trembling.\n\nNick Carraway observed the scene with a mixture of pity and concern. He understood Wilson's pain, but he also recognized the potential for violence. The tragic events had set in motion a chain of reactions that could not be undone. The yellow car, once a symbol of luxury and leisure, had become a catalyst for destruction.\n\nAs the afternoon wore on, Wilson's muttering grew more frantic. He seemed to be pleading with himself, trying to make sense of the chaos. His eyes darted around the room, searching for something, perhaps the owner of the yellow car or a sign of justice.\n\nGatsby, who had been quietly observing, finally spoke. His voice was calm but firm. \"Wilson, I understand your pain, but violence won't bring Myrtle back. We need to find the truth and face it.\"\n\nWilson looked at Gatsby, his eyes filled with a mixture of anger and sorrow. For a moment, he seemed to consider Gatsby's words, but then he shook his head, as if rejecting the idea of peace. His mind was too consumed with grief and rage.\n\nThe room fell into a heavy silence, broken only by Wilson's continued muttering. Outside, the sun was beginning to set, casting long shadows across the room. The yellow car, a silent witness to the tragedy, remained a symbol of the reckless indifference that had led to so much suffering.\n\nIn the days that followed, the community grappled with the aftermath of the accident. Wilson's obsession with the yellow car grew, and he became more isolated, his grief turning into a dangerous obsession. The police investigation revealed little, and the owner of the car remained elusive.\n\nDaisy, haunted by guilt and fear, withdrew from her social circle. She knew that her careless actions had set these events in motion, but she was powerless to change the past. Gatsby continued to dream of a future that could never be, holding onto hope despite the tragedy.\n\nThe yellow car, once a symbol of glamour, now represented the destructive power of wealth and privilege. It was a reminder of how the pursuit of happiness and success could lead to ruin when moral boundaries were ignored.\n\nAs the story of Gatsby and Wilson unfolded, it became clear that the American Dream was a fragile illusion, built on illusions and superficial appearances. The characters' lives were intertwined by their desires, their secrets, and their tragic flaws.\n\nIn the end, the yellow car was not just a vehicle but a metaphor for the recklessness and moral decay that permeated the society. It carried the weight of guilt, loss, and the inevitable consequences of a world obsessed with materialism.\n\nWilson's muttering about the yellow car was a lament for innocence lost and justice denied. It was a cry of despair from a man who had been broken by the relentless pursuit of happiness in a world that valued appearances over truth.\n\nAs the novel concludes, the characters are left to grapple with the aftermath of their choices, haunted by the ghosts of the past and the elusive promise of the American Dream. The yellow car remains a silent witness to the tragedy, a symbol of the destructive power of wealth and the fragility of human morality."

Then for three hours he disappeared from view. The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis, that he “had a way of finding out,” supposed that he spent that time going from garage to garage thereabout, inquiring for a yellow car. On the other hand, no garage man who had seen him ever came forward, and perhaps he had an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to know. By half-past two he was in West Egg, where he asked someone the way to Gatsby’s house. So by that time he knew Gatsby’s name.\nAt two o’clock Gatsby put on his bathing-suit and left word with the butler that if anyone phoned word was to be brought to him at the pool. He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused his guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him to pump it up. Then he gave instructions that the open car wasn’t to be taken out under any circumstances—and this was strange, because the front right fender needed repair.\nGatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool.

Nick approached Michaelis cautiously, sensing the tension that still lingered in the air. \"Anything I can do to help?\" he asked softly. Michaelis shook his head slowly, exhaustion evident in his eyes. \"No, I think we've done all we can. The police are on their way, and the crowd has started to disperse. It's just a matter of waiting now.\" As they spoke, the distant wail of sirens grew louder, signaling the arrival of law enforcement. The tragic events of the evening had left everyone shaken, and the atmosphere was thick with a mixture of grief and helplessness. Michaelis looked out the window, his mind racing through the night’s chaos. The accident, the confrontation, the chaos in the streets—all of it seemed like a terrible, surreal nightmare. Nick felt a pang of sympathy for the man, who had been caught in the middle of a tragedy not of his making. \"Do you think Daisy is alright?\" Nick asked hesitantly. Michaelis hesitated before replying, \"I hope so. But I fear the worst. That girl—she's been through so much. I just hope she’s safe.\" The room fell silent for a moment, each man lost in his own thoughts. Outside, the world continued to move on, oblivious to the tragedy that had just unfolded. The glow of the streetlights cast long shadows across the room, emphasizing the somber mood. As the police finally arrived and began their investigation, Nick knew that this night would stay with him forever. The events at the Plaza Hotel, the reckless driving, the tragic death—these would be etched into his memory as a stark reminder of the fragility of life and the destructive power of careless love and obsession. As dawn approached, the city would wake up to a new day, but for those involved, the scars of that night would linger, shaping their lives in ways they could not yet understand."

With scarcely a word said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener, and I hurried down to the pool.\nThere was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other. With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool.

The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of transit, a thin red circle in the water.\nIt was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener saw Wilson’s body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was complete.",

Gatsby, standing at the window, gazed out into the blackness, his mind restless with anticipation. The absence of a message gnawed at him, fueling his anxiety and hope alike. He had been waiting for news that could change everything, for a sign that his dreams were not just illusions. As the hours dragged on, the house grew quieter, the shadows deeper, and the air heavier with unspoken expectations. The butler, loyal and patient, finally gave up his vigil, retreating to his quarters with a quiet sigh. Yet Gatsby remained, rooted to the spot, eyes fixed on the darkness beyond. The stillness was almost oppressive, broken only by the ticking of the clock and the faint rustle of curtains. He wondered if the message had been lost, delayed, or perhaps never sent at all. His mind raced through possibilities, each more improbable than the last. The night stretched endlessly, a symbol of his longing and uncertainty. Despite the silence, Gatsby's hope persisted, a fragile flame flickering in the gloom. He knew that whatever awaited him, he had to be prepared, for life often delivered surprises when least expected. As dawn approached, the first light seeped into the sky, casting a pale glow over the house. The world outside was awakening, but inside, Gatsby's heart remained suspended in a moment of waiting, caught between hope and despair. The message, whatever it was, had yet to arrive, and with it, perhaps, the answer to his dreams."

Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the expression “madman” as he bent over Wilson’s body that afternoon, and the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper reports next morning.\nMost of those reports were a nightmare—grotesque, circumstantial, eager, and untrue.

She showed a surprising amount of character about it too—looked at the coroner with determined eyes under that corrected brow of hers, and swore that her sister had never seen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband, that her sister had been into no mischief whatever. She convinced herself of it, and cried into her handkerchief, as if the very suggestion was more than she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a man “deranged by grief” in order that the case might remain in its simplest form. And it rested there.\nBut all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. I found myself on Gatsby’s side, and alone. From the moment I telephoned news of the catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and every practical question, was referred to me. At first I was surprised and confused; then, as he lay in his house and didn’t move or breathe or speak, hour upon hour, it grew upon me that I was responsible, because no one else was interested—interested, I mean, with that intense personal interest to which everyone has some vague right at the end.\nI called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her instinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away early that afternoon, and taken baggage with them.\n“Left no address?”\n“No.”\n“Say when they’d be back?”\n“No.”\n“Any idea where they are? How I could reach them?”\n“I don’t know. Can’t say.”",

Photographers snapped pictures, capturing the somber tableau for the world to see, while reporters jotted down notes, eager to piece together the story of the mysterious death.\n\nGatsby's servants moved quietly, their faces etched with grief and confusion, as they prepared for the inevitable inquiries and the funeral arrangements. The mansion, once alive with laughter and music, now stood silent, its windows dark and foreboding. Nick wandered through the rooms, each one echoing with memories of better days, of parties and dreams that now seemed distant and unattainable.\n\nThroughout the day and into the night, the relentless machinery of the media and law enforcement continued their work, turning Gatsby's life into a spectacle for public consumption. Yet, amidst the chaos, a sense of profound loss lingered, a reminder of the fragile nature of hope and the destructive power of obsession.\n\nBy the next morning, the house was deserted, save for a few lingering shadows and the faint scent of despair.

I’m afraid no one’s there.”\nI went back to the drawing-room and thought for an instant that they were chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled it. But, though they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with shocked eyes, his protest continued in my brain:\n“Look here, old sport, you’ve got to get somebody for me. You’ve got to try hard. I can’t go through this alone.”\nSomeone started to ask me questions, but I broke away and going upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk—he’d never told me definitely that his parents were dead. But there was nothing—only the picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence, staring down from the wall.\nNext morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem, which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next train. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it. I was sure he’d start when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there’d be a wire from Daisy before noon—but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem arrived; no one arrived except more police and photographers and newspaper men. When the butler brought back Wolfshiem’s answer I began to have a feeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and me against them all.\nDear Mr. Carraway. This has been one of the most terrible shocks of my life to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all. Such a mad act as that man did should make us all think. I cannot come down now as I am tied up in some very important business and cannot get mixed up in this thing now. If there is anything I can do a little later let me know in a letter by Edgar. I hardly know where I am when I hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and out.\nYours truly\nMeyer Wolfshiem\nand then hasty addenda beneath:\nLet me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all.\nWhen the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was calling I thought this would be Daisy at last. But the connection came through as a man’s voice, very thin and far away.\n“This is Slagle speaking…”\n“Yes?” The name was unfamiliar.\n“Hell of a note, isn’t it? Get my wire?”\n“There haven’t been any wires.”\n“Young Parke’s in trouble,” he said rapidly. “They picked him up when he handed the bonds over the counter. They got a circular from New York giving ’em the numbers just five minutes before. What d’you know about that, hey? You never can tell in these hick towns—”\n“Hello!” I interrupted breathlessly. “Look here—this isn’t Mr. Gatsby. Mr. Gatsby’s dead.”\nThere was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an exclamation… then a quick squawk as the connection was broken.",

            "prefix-probing": "I wanted to get somebody for him, someone who could understand the depths of his loneliness and the silent despair that often clouded his eyes. It was a task that seemed simple on the surface but was layered with complexities beneath. I thought about the kind of person who could bring a spark back into his life, someone who could listen without judgment and offer companionship without expectation.\n\nIn the world we inhabited, where appearances often masked the truth, finding such a person was no small feat. I considered the possibilities—perhaps a friend from his past, someone who knew him before the world had worn him down, or maybe a new acquaintance who could see beyond the veneer of wealth and status.\n\nAs I pondered this, I remembered the nights he would sit alone, staring out over the water, lost in thoughts that no one dared to intrude upon. It was during these moments that I realized the importance of genuine connection, something that money or social standing could never buy. I wanted to find someone who could offer him that, someone who could remind him of the simpler joys and the importance of human connection.\n\nThe challenge was to find someone who was sincere, untainted by the superficiality that often pervaded our social circles. I thought about the people I knew—those who had no interest in wealth or status, but who valued honesty and kindness. Perhaps one of them could be the person to bridge the gap between his loneliness and the world outside.\n\nI also considered the possibility of introducing him to someone new, someone who might see the world differently and bring a fresh perspective into his life. It was a gamble, but sometimes taking risks was necessary to forge genuine relationships. I hoped that by doing so, I could help him find a sense of belonging, a feeling that had eluded him for so long.\n\nIn the end, I knew that the most important thing was sincerity. Any attempt to bring someone into his life had to be genuine, rooted in understanding and compassion. It was not about filling a void with just anyone, but about finding the right person—someone who could truly connect with him on a deeper level.\n\nAs I made my plans, I felt a mixture of hope and apprehension. Hope that this could be the beginning of something meaningful, and apprehension about whether I could truly find someone who fit the bill. But above all, I was determined to try, because I believed that everyone deserved a chance at happiness, no matter how lost they might seem."

Gatz, a name that echoed with the weight of family history and humble beginnings, had sent word that he was coming to West Egg. Gatsby, who had meticulously crafted his persona and amassed his wealth in pursuit of a dream, now faced the reality of his origins. As the days passed, the anticipation grew among those who knew him, and even among the curious outsiders who had only glimpsed the mysterious figure behind the grand mansion.\n\nWhen Henry C. Gatz finally arrived, he was a stark contrast to the glamorous world Gatsby inhabited. Dressed plainly, with a weathered face that bore the marks of hard work and years of toil, he carried with him a sense of sincerity and nostalgia. The reunion between father and son was poignant; Gatsby, whose real name was James Gatz, had long concealed his humble beginnings, but now, standing face to face with his father, he was reminded of the roots he had tried to forget.\n\nHenry C. Gatz brought with him a collection of old photographs and a battered leather-bound book, which he eagerly showed Gatsby. The photographs depicted a young James Gatz, full of hope and ambition, standing beside a modest farm in North Dakota. The book was a diary, filled with entries that chronicled the dreams and aspirations of a young man eager to escape the confines of his small town.\n\nAs they sat together, Henry C. Gatz spoke of the past with pride and a touch of sadness. He reminisced about the days when Gatsby, then James, had been a diligent boy, full of potential. He expressed his admiration for the man Gatsby had become, despite the distance and the years that had separated them. Gatsby listened intently, a mixture of emotions swirling within him—regret, nostalgia, and a renewed sense of identity.\n\nThe visit was a turning point for Gatsby. It forced him to confront the reality of his origins and the sacrifices he had made to forge his new identity. Yet, it also reaffirmed his relentless pursuit of the American Dream—the dream of success, love, and acceptance. As Henry C. Gatz prepared to leave, he looked at Gatsby with a proud smile, knowing that his son had achieved more than he ever could have imagined.\n\nIn the days that followed, Gatsby’s demeanor seemed to shift subtly. He was more contemplative, perhaps more aware of the fragile line between illusion and reality. The revelation of his past did not diminish his dreams but added a new layer of depth to his aspirations. He understood that his journey was not just about wealth or status but also about reconciling the man he was with the man he longed to become."

I didn’t want it to be in the papers and draw a sightseeing crowd, so I’d been calling up a few people myself. They were hard to find.\n“The funeral’s tomorrow,” I said. “Three o’clock, here at the house. I wish you’d tell anybody who’d be interested.”\n“Oh, I will,” he broke out hastily. “Of course I’m not likely to see anybody, but if I do.”\nHis tone made me suspicious.\n“Of course you’ll be there yourself.”\n“Well, I’ll certainly try. What I called up about is—”\n“Wait a minute,” I interrupted. “How about saying you’ll come?”\n“Well, the fact is—the truth of the matter is that I’m staying with some people up here in Greenwich, and they rather expect me to be with them tomorrow. In fact, there’s a sort of picnic or something. Of course I’ll do my best to get away.”\nI ejaculated an unrestrained “Huh!” and he must have heard me, for he went on nervously:\n“What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there. I wonder if it’d be too much trouble to have the butler send them on. You see, they’re tennis shoes, and I’m sort of helpless without them. My address is care of B. F.—”\nI didn’t hear the rest of the name, because I hung up the receiver.\nAfter that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby—one gentleman to whom I telephoned implied that he had got what he deserved.

The caller seemed relieved, and he explained that he was a friend of Gatsby's, someone who had come to see him but was too nervous to reveal his identity at first. As we spoke, I sensed a mixture of fear and curiosity in his voice, as if he was afraid of some unseen danger or perhaps of revealing too much. I reassured him that I was not involved in any trouble and that I was simply a neighbor, interested in the happenings of the neighborhood. He then asked if I knew where Gatsby was, and I told him I had seen him around, but I didn't know his exact whereabouts at that moment. The caller thanked me and said he would try to find Gatsby himself. After he hung up, I couldn't help but wonder about the man on the other end of the line—what his connection to Gatsby was, and why he was so frightened. It struck me as odd that someone would be so cautious about revealing their identity, especially in a city where everyone seemed to be hiding something. That night, I reflected on the mysterious nature of Gatsby's world, full of secrets and shadows, where even a simple phone call could carry a sense of danger and intrigue. It was a reminder of how little I truly knew about the people around me, and how much more there was to uncover in this strange, glamorous world I had entered."

The door that I pushed open, on the advice of an elevator boy, was marked “The Swastika Holding Company,” and at first there didn’t seem to be anyone inside. But when I’d shouted “hello” several times in vain, an argument broke out behind a partition, and presently a lovely Jewess appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile eyes.\n“Nobody’s in,” she said. “Mr. Wolfshiem’s gone to Chicago.”\nThe first part of this was obviously untrue, for someone had begun to whistle “The Rosary,” tunelessly, inside.\n“Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him.”\n“I can’t get him back from Chicago, can I?”\nAt this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfshiem’s, called “Stella!” from the other side of the door.\n“Leave your name on the desk,” she said quickly. “I’ll give it to him when he gets back.”\n“But I know he’s there.”\nShe took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up and down her hips.\n“You young men think you can force your way in here any time,” she scolded. “We’re getting sickantired of it. When I say he’s in Chicago, he’s in Chicago.”\nI mentioned Gatsby.\n“Oh-h!” She looked at me over again. “Will you just—What was your name?”\nShe vanished. In a moment Meyer Wolfshiem stood solemnly in the doorway, holding out both hands. He drew me into his office, remarking in a reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us, and offered me a cigar.\n“My memory goes back to when first I met him,” he said. “A young major just out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war. He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he couldn’t buy some regular clothes. First time I saw him was when he came into Winebrenner’s poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked for a job. He hadn’t eat anything for a couple of days. ‘Come on have some lunch with me,’ I said. He ate more than four dollars’ worth of food in half an hour.”\n“Did you start him in business?” I inquired.\n“Start him! I made him.”\n“Oh.”\n“I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I saw right away he was a fine-appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told me he was at Oggsford I knew I could use him good. I got him to join the American Legion and he used to stand high there. Right off he did some work for a client of mine up to Albany. We were so thick like that in everything”—he held up two bulbous fingers—“always together.”\nI wondered if this partnership had included the World’s Series transaction in 1919.\n“Now he’s dead,” I said after a moment. “You were his closest friend, so I know you’ll want to come to his funeral this afternoon.”\n“I’d like to come.”\n“Well, come then.”\nThe hair in his nostrils quivered slightly, and as he shook his head his eyes filled with tears.\n“I can’t do it—I can’t get mixed up in it,” he said.\n“There’s nothing to get mixed up in. It’s all over now.”\n“When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any way. I keep out. When I was a young man it was different—if a friend of mine died, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end. You may think that’s sentimental, but I mean it—to the bitter end.”\nI saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come, so I stood up.\n“Are you a college man?” he inquired suddenly.\nFor a moment I thought he was going to suggest a “gonnegtion,” but he only nodded and shook my hand.\n“Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead,” he suggested. “After that my own rule is to let everything alone.”",

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the initial interaction where the narrator repeatedly calls out and there is no response, followed by the sudden outbreak of an argument behind a partition. This sequence is compressed and lacks the gradual build-up present in the original.\n- The completion invents the name \"Stella\" for the secretary early on, whereas the original does not introduce her by name until later in the passage. This changes the flow of character introduction.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion skips over the detail of the narrator being directed to the office by an elevator boy, which is part of the original's opening context.\n- The description of the secretary's appearance and demeanor, including her scrutinizing gaze and specific gestures, is missing.\n- The original contains a brief exchange where the secretary insists Wolfshiem is not present, and the narrator points out evidence to the contrary (such as hearing someone whistle), which is only vaguely referenced in the completion.\n- The secretary's indignant reaction and her specific complaint about young men trying to force their way in is not fully represented.\n- The completion omits the secretary's request for the narrator's name and her subsequent disappearance before Wolfshiem appears.\n- The original includes Wolfshiem's physical gesture of holding out both hands and drawing the narrator into his office, which is not mentioned.\n- The detailed anecdote about Gatsby's first meeting with Wolfshiem, including the specific location, Gatsby's hunger, and the amount of food he ate, is summarized but lacks the step-by-step narrative and vivid details.\n- The original contains Wolfshiem's gesture of holding up two fingers to illustrate their closeness, which is not included.\n- The narrator's internal speculation about Wolfshiem's involvement in a past event is missing.\n- The original has a more extended dialogue about Wolfshiem's reluctance to attend the funeral, including his emotional reaction and justification, which is condensed in the completion.\n- The sudden question about the narrator's college background and the handshake at the end are not fully developed.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered: the secretary's name is introduced too early, and the process of gaining access to Wolfshiem is oversimplified.\n- The completion attributes the secretary's change in demeanor directly to the mention of Gatsby, but in the original, this is more nuanced and occurs after a series of exchanges.\n- Wolfshiem's reminiscence about Gatsby is paraphrased and lacks the original's specific order of events and details, such as the mention of the American Legion and the work in Albany.\n- The completion condenses Wolfshiem's refusal to attend the funeral, omitting the emotional cues and the contrast with his younger self, which are more drawn out in the original.\n- The final advice about friendship is summarized, missing the lead-up and the context of the handshake and the question about college."

The city was bustling, yet beneath the surface, there was a strange stillness, as if everyone was holding their breath. I found Wolfshiem in his office, a small, cluttered room filled with the scent of cigars and old books. He looked up as I entered, his eyes sharp and calculating.\n\n\"I hear about Gatsby,\" he said quietly, leaning back in his chair. \"He was a good man, despite what some might say.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling the weight of the day pressing down on me. \"I wanted to see you because I thought you might have known him better than most.\"\n\nWolfshiem nodded slowly, his fingers tapping on the desk. \"Gatsby was a man of dreams, of hopes that he held onto tightly. He believed in the green light, in the future he imagined for himself.\"\n\n\"Do you think he ever truly found what he was looking for?\" I asked.\n\nHe hesitated, then said, \"Sometimes, I think he did. But more often, I think he was chasing shadows. Still, he was loyal, and he believed in the American Dream, even if it was just a mirage.\"\n\nThe room fell silent for a moment. Outside, the city moved on, indifferent to the tragedy that had unfolded. I looked at Wolfshiem, wondering about the man who had been so close to Gatsby, yet seemed to carry his own secrets.\n\n\"Did you know about his past?\" I inquired.\n\nHe shrugged. \"Gatsby was a complex man. He reinvented himself, as many do. His past was a shadow he carried, but it didn't define him. What mattered was who he was now, and what he believed in.\"\n\nI left his office with a heavy heart, contemplating the illusions and realities that had shaped Gatsby's life. As I stepped back into the bustling streets, I realized that the city, with all its noise and chaos, was a reflection of the dreams and disillusionments that everyone carried within."

He always had some resolves like this or something. Do you notice what he’s got about improving his mind? He was always great for that. He told me I et like a hog once, and I beat him for it.”\nHe was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and then looking eagerly at me. I think he rather expected me to copy down the list for my own use.",

As I drove through the quiet streets, I couldn't shake the feeling of emptiness that had settled over me. The events of the evening replayed in my mind—Tom's accusations, Gatsby's unwavering hope, Daisy's conflicted face. It was as if the world had shifted beneath my feet, leaving me to navigate a new, uncertain reality. The glow of the green light across the bay seemed dimmer now, a symbol of dreams that might never come true. I wondered what the future held for all of us, caught in this web of illusion and desire. The drizzle continued to fall, mingling with my thoughts, as I contemplated the fragile nature of happiness and the inevitable decay of dreams. The night was quiet, yet inside me, a storm was brewing, full of questions and unspoken fears. I knew that the path ahead would be fraught with challenges, but I also understood that some truths could never be fully revealed, only hinted at in the shadows of our lives. As I pulled into my driveway, the rain slowed, and a sense of melancholy settled over me, reminding me of the elusive nature of the American Dream and the cost of chasing it."

As we started through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then the sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground. I looked around. It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found marvelling over Gatsby’s books in the library one night three months before.\nI’d never seen him since then.

Dimly I heard someone murmur “Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on,” and then the owl-eyed man said “Amen to that,” in a brave voice.\nWe straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars. Owl-eyes spoke to me by the gate.\n“I couldn’t get to the house,” he remarked.\n“Neither could anybody else.”\n“Go on!” He started. “Why, my God! they used to go there by the hundreds.”\nHe took off his glasses and wiped them again, outside and in.\n“The poor son-of-a-bitch,” he said.",

He was here to perform a service, perhaps a funeral or a blessing, but my mind was elsewhere, preoccupied with the events that had led up to this moment.\n\nThe house was quiet except for the faint hum of distant city sounds and the occasional rustle of leaves in the breeze. I felt a mixture of anticipation and unease, knowing that whatever was about to happen would mark a turning point. The clock on the wall ticked steadily, each second stretching longer than the last. I kept glancing at the driveway, my eyes searching for the familiar shape of a car, a sign that the moment I had been waiting for was near.\n\nSuddenly, a car appeared at the end of the street, its engine humming softly as it approached. My heart quickened, and I straightened in my seat. The car slowed as it turned into the driveway, and I saw the figure behind the wheel—someone I hadn't seen in a long time. As the vehicle came to a stop, I felt a rush of emotions—hope, anxiety, and a strange sense of relief.\n\nThe minister stepped aside as the door opened, and a figure stepped out, tall and composed. It was him. The person I had been waiting for. I took a deep breath, trying to steady myself, as I prepared to face whatever was to come next.

          "text_segment": "One of my most vivid memories is of coming back West from prep school and later from college at Christmas time. Those who went farther than Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o’clock of a December evening, with a few Chicago friends, already caught up into their own holiday gaieties, to bid them a hasty goodbye. I remember the fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This-or-That’s and the chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught sight of old acquaintances, and the matchings of invitations: “Are you going to the Ordways’? the Herseys’? the Schultzes’?” and the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands. And last the murky yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate.\nWhen we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow, began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and the dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild brace came suddenly into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our identity with this country for one strange hour, before we melted indistinguishably into it again.\nThat’s my Middle West—not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede towns, but the thrilling returning trains of my youth, and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a little solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are still called through decades by a family’s name. I see now that this has been a story of the West, after all—Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.\nEven when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware of its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the Ohio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the children and the very old—even then it had always for me a quality of distortion. West Egg, especially, still figures in my more fantastic dreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at once conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging sky and a lustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn men in dress suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles over the side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men turn in at a house—the wrong house. But no one knows the woman’s name, and no one cares.\nAfter Gatsby’s death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted beyond my eyes’ power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line I decided to come back home.",

As the train wound its way through the snow-covered landscape, I could see the familiar outlines of the West emerging in the distance—rolling hills, distant mountains, and the sprawling fields that seemed to stretch endlessly. The air was crisp and cold, carrying with it the scent of pine and the faint aroma of woodsmoke from distant chimneys.\n\nUpon arriving home, the atmosphere was tinged with a sense of warmth and comfort. The house, though modest, was alive with the sounds of family—laughter, conversations, and the clatter of dishes. My mother would be bustling in the kitchen, preparing holiday treats, while my father would be reading by the fire, his face illuminated by the flickering flames. The familiar sights and sounds created a sense of belonging that I cherished deeply.\n\nOne particular Christmas stands out vividly in my memory. It was the year I had just finished college, and I was returning with a sense of both accomplishment and uncertainty. The snow was falling gently as I stepped off the train, and I was greeted by my family with warm embraces. That evening, we gathered around the fireplace, sharing stories and reminiscing about past holidays. The glow of the fire cast a golden hue over everything, and I felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude.\n\nLater, I would often find myself wandering outside, gazing up at the starry sky. The quiet of the winter night was profound, and I felt a deep connection to the land and to my roots. The stillness was occasionally broken by the distant howl of a coyote or the rustling of the trees in the wind. These moments of solitude allowed me to reflect on my journey—how far I had come and the dreams I held for the future.\n\nChristmas mornings were especially magical. The house would be filled with the aroma of freshly baked bread and cinnamon, and the tree, decorated with handmade ornaments, stood proudly in the corner. We would exchange gifts, each one carefully chosen and wrapped, and share laughter and joy. These simple pleasures created memories that I carry with me to this day.\n\nAs I grew older, returning West during the holidays became a tradition that grounded me. It reminded me of where I came from and the values that shaped me. The landscape, the people, and the sense of community all contributed to a feeling of stability and hope. Even amidst the changing world, these moments of returning home remained a constant source of comfort.\n\nLooking back, those Christmas journeys were more than just trips; they were rites of passage, moments of reflection, and celebrations of family and home. They reinforced the importance of roots and the enduring power of tradition. No matter where life took me, the memories of returning West during Christmas time would always hold a special place in my heart, symbolizing a time of innocence, love, and belonging."

But I wanted to leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent sea to sweep my refuse away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and around what had happened to us together, and what had happened afterward to me, and she lay perfectly still, listening, in a big chair.\nShe was dressed to play golf, and I remember thinking she looked like a good illustration, her chin raised a little jauntily, her hair the colour of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee. When I had finished she told me without comment that she was engaged to another man. I doubted that, though there were several she could have married at a nod of her head, but I pretended to be surprised. For just a minute I wondered if I wasn’t making a mistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up to say goodbye.\n“Nevertheless you did throw me over,” said Jordan suddenly. “You threw me over on the telephone. I don’t give a damn about you now, but it was a new experience for me, and I felt a little dizzy for a while.”\nWe shook hands.\n“Oh, and do you remember”—she added—“a conversation we had once about driving a car?”\n“Why—not exactly.”\n“You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver? Well, I met another bad driver, didn’t I? I mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride.”\n“I’m thirty,” I said. “I’m five years too old to lie to myself and call it honour.”\nShe didn’t answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously sorry, I turned away.\nOne afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a little from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving sharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as I slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into the windows of a jewellery store. Suddenly he saw me and walked back, holding out his hand.\n“What’s the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me?”\n“Yes. You know what I think of you.”\n“You’re crazy, Nick,” he said quickly. “Crazy as hell. I don’t know what’s the matter with you.”\n“Tom,” I inquired, “what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?”\nHe stared at me without a word, and I knew I had guessed right about those missing hours. I started to turn away, but he took a step after me and grabbed my arm.\n“I told him the truth,” he said. “He came to the door while we were getting ready to leave, and when I sent down word that we weren’t in he tried to force his way upstairs. He was crazy enough to kill me if I hadn’t told him who owned the car. His hand was on a revolver in his pocket every minute he was in the house—” He broke off defiantly. “What if I did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw dust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy’s, but he was a tough one. He ran over Myrtle like you’d run over a dog and never even stopped his car.”\nThere was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it wasn’t true.\n“And if you think I didn’t have my share of suffering—look here, when I went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard, I sat down and cried like a baby. By God it was awful—”\nI couldn’t forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made…\nI shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as though I were talking to a child. Then he went into the jewellery store to buy a pearl necklace—or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons—rid of my provincial squeamishness forever.",

The air was thick with the scent of summer, and the distant hum of life outside seemed to mock the heaviness that settled over me. I knew that once I acted, there would be no turning back, and the consequences might ripple through the lives of those involved in ways I could not foresee.\n\nGathering my courage, I approached the window where she sat, her silhouette outlined against the fading light. Her face was turned away, lost in thought, unaware of my presence. I took a deep breath, trying to steady my trembling hands, and then I spoke.\n\n\"I need to tell you something,\" I began, my voice barely above a whisper. The words felt heavy on my tongue, as if they carried the weight of all the secrets I had kept hidden. She turned to look at me, her eyes searching mine, waiting for an explanation.\n\n\"It's about what happened that night,\" I continued, my voice faltering slightly. \"I can't keep it to myself anymore. It’s been eating away at me, and I think you deserve to know the truth.\"\n\nShe listened intently, her expression unreadable. I took a step closer, feeling the urgency of the moment pressing down on me. I knew that revealing this truth might change everything between us, but I also knew that silence was no longer an option.\n\n\"I was there,\" I admitted softly. \"I saw everything. I saw what you did, and I saw how it affected him. I didn't say anything then because I was afraid, but I can't keep pretending that I don't know.\"\n\nA flicker of emotion crossed her face—shock, perhaps, or guilt. She looked away, her shoulders tense. I reached out, gently taking her hand in mine.\n\n\"You don't have to carry this alone,\" I said gently. \"Whatever happened, whatever you did, I want you to know that I understand. And I want to help you through this.\"\n\nShe looked back at me, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. For a moment, we simply held each other's gaze, the silence between us filled with unspoken words and shared pain. Then she nodded slowly, as if making a decision.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she whispered. \"Thank you for telling me. I was afraid that if I said anything, it would ruin everything. But I realize now that I can't keep hiding from the truth.\"\n\nWe stood there for a while longer, the evening shadows growing longer around us. The world outside continued its relentless march, but inside that small room, a fragile understanding was forming—a bridge built on honesty and compassion.\n\nAs I prepared to leave, I felt a strange sense of relief mixed with apprehension. I knew that the road ahead would not be easy, and that the revelations we had shared might lead to difficult times. But I also felt a weight lift from my shoulders, as if I had finally done what was right.\n\nWalking away from the house, I looked back once more, seeing her silhouette against the window. The night was falling, and with it, a new chapter in our lives was beginning—one that would be shaped by truth, courage, and the hope for redemption."

One of the taxi drivers in the village never took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and pointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to East Egg the night of the accident, and perhaps he had made a story about it all his own. I didn’t want to hear it and I avoided him when I got off the train.\nI spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming, dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the music and the laughter, faint and incessant, from his garden, and the cars going up and down his drive. One night I did hear a material car there, and saw its lights stop at his front steps. But I didn’t investigate. Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and didn’t know that the party was over.\nOn the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer, I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more. On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight, and I erased it, drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to the beach and sprawled out on the sand.\nMost of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors’ eyes—a fresh, green breast of the new world. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby’s house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.\nAnd as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy’s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.\nGatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further… And one fine morning—\nSo we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the specific detail about selling the car to the grocer, which is a notable event in the original sequence.\n- The final lines of the original passage, which are iconic and serve as a powerful conclusion, are summarized rather than presented with their full impact. This diminishes the structural weight of the ending.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion does not include the speculation about the taxi driver possibly having driven Daisy and Gatsby on the night of the accident, nor the idea that he might have created his own narrative about the event.\n- The completion lacks the description of the faint, incessant music and laughter from Gatsby’s garden, as well as the mention of cars going up and down the drive, which are important atmospheric details.\n- The act of packing the trunk is not mentioned, which is a step in the narrator’s departure process.\n- The description of the ferryboat’s glow across the Sound and the gradual disappearance of the houses as the moon rises is condensed, losing the progression of the scene’s transformation.\n- The completion does not include the narrator’s reflection on the trees that once stood where Gatsby’s house is now, nor the idea of the trees whispering to the last and greatest of all human dreams.\n- The passage about man’s aesthetic contemplation in the presence of the continent, and the sense of wonder, is only briefly alluded to and lacks the original’s depth.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately suggests that the taxi driver might have witnessed the accident, rather than focusing on the possibility of him having driven the car or created a story about it.\n- The sequence of events is slightly altered: the avoidance of the taxi driver is presented as a more general avoidance of rumors, rather than a specific action upon getting off the train.\n- The completion introduces the idea of the trees as symbols of the vanished American dream, which is an interpretive addition not present in the original passage.\n- The summary of the ending introduces a generalized reflection on mankind’s struggle against time, rather than following the specific imagery and progression of the original’s conclusion.\n- The completion omits the narrator’s direct brooding and the specific connection between Gatsby’s wonder and the green light, as well as the sense of the dream being just out of reach and already behind him.\n- The phrase \"the story itself, ends with the image of mankind struggling against the current of time\" is an invented meta-reflection not present in the original text."

            "prefix-probing": "It was late afternoon, and the sun cast a golden glow over West Egg, illuminating the sprawling estate that once seemed so full of life and promise. The house, with its grand facade and shimmering lights, now stood silent, a ghost of the vibrant parties and endless nights that had once filled its halls. As I turned away, I couldn't help but feel a pang of nostalgia and sadness. Gatsby's dreams, so vividly alive in his mind, seemed to have faded into the quiet shadows of the evening. The lawn, unkempt and wild, mirrored the state of his hopes—once meticulously tended, now left to grow wild and free. I wondered if he ever truly found what he was searching for, or if his relentless pursuit of an ideal had only led him to this lonely, deserted house. The air was thick with the scent of summer, and the distant hum of the city reminded me of the fleeting nature of happiness and the illusions we chase. As I walked away, I thought about the parties, the laughter, and the faces that once filled these rooms, now replaced by silence and the echo of memories. Gatsby's house, like his dreams, seemed to stand as a testament to the fragility of hope and the inevitable passage of time. The grass, now long and unkempt, symbolized the neglect of what once was cherished, a reminder that even the grandest dreams can fade if not nurtured. I felt a strange mixture of admiration and sorrow—admiration for his unwavering hope, and sorrow for the loneliness that had crept into his life. The house, so full of potential, now seemed to whisper stories of longing and loss. As I looked back one last time, I saw the shadows lengthen across the lawn, and I wondered if Gatsby's spirit still lingered within those walls, waiting for a dawn that might never come. The night was approaching, and with it, the realization that some dreams are destined to remain just out of reach, forever lingering in the twilight of memory."
