            "Nick confesses that his tolerance for human behavior is not limitless, particularly after a disillusioning experience back East.",
            "He states that Jay Gatsby, the book's namesake, was uniquely exempt from his general post-East disillusionment, despite representing things Nick naturally scorns.",
            "Nick describes Gatsby as possessing a 'gorgeous' quality, an exceptional sensitivity to life's possibilities, comparing it to a seismograph.",
            "This quality wasn't mere impressionability but an unparalleled capacity for hope and romantic readiness.",
            "Nick concludes that Gatsby himself was fundamentally decent; it was the corrupting influences surrounding his aspirations ('what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams') that temporarily soured Nick's view of humanity."

Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.\nAnd, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again.

Our home, a modest but comfortable house on the outskirts of town, has witnessed countless gatherings and celebrations, reflecting the warmth and unity that define our family.\n\nGrowing up, I was surrounded by stories of our ancestors' achievements and the legacy they left behind.

Despite the changing times and the rapid growth of the city, the Carraways have managed to maintain their standing, adapting to new challenges while preserving our core principles.\n\nEducation was highly valued in our household. I attended the local university, where I studied literature and history, subjects that deepened my appreciation for the past and its influence on the present. My parents encouraged me to pursue my passions, believing that knowledge and culture were essential to a fulfilling life.\n\nIn recent years, the city has transformed dramatically, with new industries and a diverse population reshaping its character.

It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York—and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals—like the egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual wonder to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.\nI lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsby’s mansion. Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbour’s lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a month.\nAcross the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I’d known Tom in college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.\nHer husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven—a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savours of anticlimax. His family were enormously wealthy—even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he’d left Chicago and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for instance, he’d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest. It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.\nWhy they came East I don’t know. They had spent a year in France for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn’t believe it—I had no sight into Daisy’s heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.\nAnd so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.",

This community was West Egg, a place where the newly rich congregated, their mansions sprawling and ostentatious, a stark contrast to the old money of East Egg just across the bay. I, Nick Carraway, had come from the Midwest, seeking a fresh start in the bond business, and found myself drawn into the glittering, yet hollow world of the wealthy elite.\n\nMy house was modest compared to the grandiose estates surrounding it, but it afforded me a vantage point to observe the lives of those who inhabited this peculiar enclave. Among them was my mysterious neighbor, Jay Gatsby, whose mansion was a colossal affair, glowing with light and music every night, as if to defy the darkness that seemed to lurk beneath the surface of his lavish parties.\n\nGatsby was a man of great charm and enigma, known for his extravagant gatherings that attracted the city's most fashionable and influential figures. Yet, despite the constant buzz of activity, he remained a solitary figure, his eyes often searching the horizon, as if waiting for something—or someone—to arrive.\n\nIt was through Gatsby that I was introduced to a world of dreams and illusions, where wealth was both a means and an end, and where the past held a powerful grip on the present. Gatsby's story was one of ambition and longing, a testament to the American Dream's promise and its ultimate elusiveness.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the lives of those around me, I encountered Daisy Buchanan, a woman of captivating beauty and charm, whose voice was described as being \"full of money.\" She was married to Tom Buchanan, a man of imposing presence and old money arrogance, whose infidelities and prejudices revealed the moral decay beneath the polished surface of their social class.\n\nThe interactions between Gatsby, Daisy, and Tom unfolded like a tragic drama, revealing the complexities of love, desire, and betrayal. Gatsby's unwavering devotion to Daisy, rooted in a shared past, clashed with the realities of their present lives, leading to a series of events that would culminate in heartbreak and loss.\n\nThroughout this narrative, I found myself both an observer and a participant, grappling with my own values and judgments amidst the extravagance and moral ambiguity that defined this world. The glittering parties, the whispered secrets, and the relentless pursuit of happiness painted a portrait of a society caught between illusion and reality.\n\nIn the end, the story of West Egg and its inhabitants served as a poignant reflection on the nature of identity, the pursuit of dreams, and the often harsh truths that lie beneath the surface of wealth and glamour. It was a tale that left an indelible mark on my understanding of the world and the people who inhabit it."

It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.\nHis speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts.\n“Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he seemed to say, “just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are.” We were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.\nWe talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.\n“I’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly.\nTurning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped the tide offshore.\n“It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.” He turned me around again, politely and abruptly. “We’ll go inside.”\nWe walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.\nThe only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.\nThe younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.\nThe other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the room.\n“I’m p-paralysed with happiness.”\nShe laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she had. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker. (I’ve heard it said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)\nAt any rate, Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.\nI looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered “Listen,” a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.",

            "prefix-probing": "He had changed since his New Haven years. The once bright-eyed and hopeful young man had grown into a figure marked by a certain restless intensity, a man whose dreams seemed both grander and more elusive than before. Gatsby, as he was known to the world, carried with him an air of mystery that intrigued and confounded those around him. His transformation was not merely in appearance but in the very essence of his being—a metamorphosis shaped by ambition, love, and the relentless pursuit of an ideal.\n\nIn the early days at New Haven, Gatsby was James Gatz, a boy from North Dakota with a vision that stretched far beyond the boundaries of his humble origins. He was determined to reinvent himself, to escape the limitations imposed by his birth and to carve out a new identity that would command respect and admiration. This desire for self-reinvention was the seed from which Gatsby's later persona would grow, a persona meticulously crafted to embody the American Dream in its most dazzling form.\n\nThe years that followed saw Gatsby navigating the complex social landscapes of the East Coast, accumulating wealth and connections with a single-minded focus. His lavish parties, held at his opulent mansion in West Egg, were legendary—gatherings that attracted the glittering elite and the curious alike. Yet beneath the surface of these grand festivities lay a profound loneliness, a yearning for something more authentic and enduring.\n\nCentral to Gatsby's transformation was his love for Daisy Buchanan, a woman whose charm and grace captivated him from the moment they met. Daisy represented not just a romantic ideal but the very embodiment of the life Gatsby aspired to—a life of elegance, privilege, and acceptance. His pursuit of Daisy was intertwined with his quest for identity, each step toward her a step toward the realization of his dreams.\n\nHowever, the world Gatsby sought to enter was fraught with barriers—social divisions, entrenched wealth, and the rigid codes of the old aristocracy. Despite his riches, Gatsby remained an outsider, his origins a shadow that clung to him despite his efforts to conceal it. This tension between appearance and reality, between aspiration and acceptance, defined much of Gatsby's existence.\n\nThe narrative of \"The Great Gatsby\" unfolds against this backdrop of ambition and desire, exploring themes of identity, love, and the elusive nature of the American Dream. Gatsby's story is a poignant reflection on the costs of reinvention and the complexities of human longing, a tale that resonates with the universal quest for meaning and belonging.\n\nAs the story progresses, the layers of Gatsby's character are peeled back, revealing the vulnerabilities beneath the glittering facade. His unwavering hope, his capacity for idealism, and his tragic flaws come into sharp relief, painting a portrait of a man both extraordinary and deeply human. Through Gatsby, Fitzgerald invites readers to contemplate the dreams that drive us and the realities that often confound them.\n\nIn the end, Gatsby's transformation since his New Haven years is a testament to the power of dreams and the enduring human spirit, even in the face of insurmountable odds. His journey is a mirror reflecting the complexities of identity and the eternal struggle to define oneself in a world that is often indifferent or hostile. It is a story that continues to captivate and inspire, reminding us of the fragile beauty of hope and the profound impact of the past on the present."

Tomorrow!” Then she added irrelevantly: “You ought to see the baby.”\n“I’d like to.”\n“She’s asleep. She’s three years old. Haven’t you ever seen her?”\n“Never.”\n“Well, you ought to see her. She’s—”\nTom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder.\n“What you doing, Nick?”\n“I’m a bond man.”\n“Who with?”\nI told him.\n“Never heard of them,” he remarked decisively.\nThis annoyed me.\n“You will,” I answered shortly. “You will if you stay in the East.”\n“Oh, I’ll stay in the East, don’t you worry,” he said, glancing at Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more. “I’d be a God damned fool to live anywhere else.”\nAt this point Miss Baker said: “Absolutely!” with such suddenness that I started—it was the first word she had uttered since I came into the room. Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.\n“I’m stiff,” she complained, “I’ve been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember.”\n“Don’t look at me,” Daisy retorted, “I’ve been trying to get you to New York all afternoon.”\n“No, thanks,” said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry. “I’m absolutely in training.”\nHer host looked at her incredulously.\n“You are!” He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass. “How you ever get anything done is beyond me.”\nI looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she “got done.” I enjoyed looking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming, discontented face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before.\n“You live in West Egg,” she remarked contemptuously. “I know somebody there.”\n“I don’t know a single—”\n“You must know Gatsby.”\n“Gatsby?” demanded Daisy. “What Gatsby?”\nBefore I could reply that he was my neighbour dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.",

Her face, turned toward me, showed no sign of understanding; it was a curious thing, this unspoken communication between us, as if the past and present were mingling in the air around us. She smiled faintly, a smile that seemed to hold a secret, a memory that was both distant and immediate.\n\nWe sat there for a moment, the silence stretching between us like a fragile thread. The room was filled with the soft glow of the evening light, casting long shadows that danced on the walls. Outside, the city hummed with life, but inside, time seemed to stand still.\n\n\"You must know,\" I began, \"that I never meant to hurt you. Everything that happened was beyond my control, a series of events that spiraled out of reach.\"\n\nShe looked at me then, her eyes reflecting a mixture of pain and understanding. \"I know,\" she whispered. \"But sometimes, knowing isn't enough.\"\n\nThe words hung in the air, heavy with unspoken regrets and lost opportunities. I reached out, taking her hand gently in mine. The warmth of her touch was a balm to the wounds that had festered in my heart for so long.\n\n\"Do you remember the summer we spent by the lake?\" I asked, a faint smile tugging at the corners of my mouth. \"The endless days, the laughter, the dreams we shared.\"\n\nShe nodded, a tear slipping down her cheek. \"How could I forget? Those were the days when everything seemed possible.\"\n\nI squeezed her hand, feeling a surge of hope. \"Maybe it's not too late to find that again. To start anew, to build something real.\"\n\nHer eyes searched mine, searching for the truth in my words. After a moment, she nodded slowly. \"Perhaps. But it will take time.\"\n\nI agreed, knowing that the road ahead would be fraught with challenges. Yet, in that moment, surrounded by the fading light and the quiet hum of the city, I felt a glimmer of something I hadn't felt in years—hope.\n\nAs the evening deepened into night, we sat together, two souls bound by a shared past and the possibility of a future. The world outside continued its relentless pace, but within the walls of that room, time was ours to reclaim."

They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the West, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself.\n“You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,” I confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret. “Can’t you talk about crops or something?”\nI meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in an unexpected way.\n“Civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out Tom violently. “I’ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read The Rise of the Coloured Empires by this man Goddard?”\n“Why, no,” I answered, rather surprised by his tone.\n“Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly submerged. It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.”\n“Tom’s getting very profound,” said Daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness. “He reads deep books with long words in them. What was that word we—”\n“Well, these books are all scientific,” insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently. “This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It’s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things.”\n“We’ve got to beat them down,” whispered Daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun.\n“You ought to live in California—” began Miss Baker, but Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.\n“This idea is that we’re Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are, and—” After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again. “—And we’ve produced all the things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all that. Do you see?”\nThere was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more.

I felt a little uncivilized, and to break the tension I asked about the crops and the weather.\n\nTom's face darkened. \"Civilization's going to pieces,\" he declared. \"I've gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read 'The Rise of the Colored Empires' by this man Goddard?\"\n\n\"Why, no,\" I answered, rather surprised by his vehemence.\n\n\"Well, it's a scientific book,\" he insisted, \"and it proves that the white race is—well, that we have to keep the other races down.\"\n\nDaisy laughed lightly. \"You always look so cool,\" she said, \"but I think you're just a little afraid.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" Tom said quickly, \"it's scientific stuff; it's been proven. We're Nordics, the dominant race.\"\n\nHe looked at Daisy, who hesitated, then nodded. \"We're Nordics,\" he repeated, \"and we've produced all the civilization you see around you.\"\n\nI could see a desperate edge beneath his confident assertions, as if he were trying to convince himself as much as anyone else.\n\nSuddenly the telephone rang inside, and the butler went to answer it.",

            "prefix-probing": "Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two young women preceded us out on to a rosy-coloured porch, open toward the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind. The air was warm and heavy with the scent of blooming jasmine, mingling with the faint aroma of freshly brewed coffee from the kitchen behind us. The sky was a canvas of soft pinks and purples, the last light of day casting long shadows across the manicured lawn.\n\nWe settled into the wicker chairs, the cushions cool against our skin, and the gentle hum of cicadas filled the silence between us. The women exchanged glances, their eyes sparkling with a mixture of mischief and melancholy, as if they were privy to some secret that the fading daylight could not reveal.\n\n\"It's a perfect evening,\" one of them murmured, her voice as smooth as the silk of her dress. \"Almost makes you forget the world outside this porch.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling the weight of the day's events lift slightly in the presence of such serene beauty. The other woman smiled softly, her fingers tracing the rim of her glass absentmindedly. \"Sometimes,\" she said, \"we all need a moment like this—a pause to breathe, to remember who we are beneath the noise and haste.\"\n\nThe candles flickered again, their flames dancing in the gentle breeze, casting playful shadows on the wooden floorboards. The table was set simply but elegantly, with delicate china and crystal glasses that caught the light in a thousand tiny prisms.\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, the sky deepened to a rich indigo, and the first stars began to twinkle overhead. The women rose gracefully, their movements fluid and effortless, and beckoned us to follow them inside. The house was a sanctuary of warmth and light, filled with the soft murmur of conversation and the clinking of glasses.\n\nInside, the atmosphere was intimate and inviting. The walls were adorned with paintings that seemed to capture the very essence of the evening—moments frozen in time, bathed in golden hues and shadowed mystery. A grand piano stood in the corner, its polished surface gleaming under the chandelier's glow.\n\nOne of the women approached the piano and began to play a haunting melody, the notes weaving through the room like a gentle breeze. The music stirred something deep within me, a longing that was both sweet and sorrowful. The other guests listened in rapt silence, their faces illuminated by the soft light and the emotion carried in each chord.\n\nAs the last note faded into the night, a hush settled over the room. Then, slowly, the conversation resumed, lighter now, filled with laughter and shared stories. The evening stretched on, a tapestry of moments woven together by the threads of friendship and fleeting joy.\n\nOutside, the candles on the porch continued to flicker, their flames steadfast against the encroaching darkness. The world beyond the house seemed distant and unreal, as if this place existed in a bubble of time, untouched by the troubles that lay beyond its walls.\n\nIn that moment, surrounded by beauty and warmth, I understood the true meaning of sanctuary—not just a place, but a feeling, a refuge found in the company of others and the simple pleasures of life. And as the night deepened, I felt a quiet hope take root within me, a promise that even in the darkest times, there is light to be found."

Do you want to hear about the butler’s nose?”\n“That’s why I came over tonight.”\n“Well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people. He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it began to affect his nose—”\n“Things went from bad to worse,” suggested Miss Baker.\n“Yes. Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up his position.”\nFor a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.\nThe butler came back and murmured something close to Tom’s ear, whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went inside. As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and singing.\n“I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a—of a rose, an absolute rose. Doesn’t he?” She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation: “An absolute rose?”\nThis was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house.\nMiss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said “Sh!” in a warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond, and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to hear. The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.\n“This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbour—” I began.\n“Don’t talk. I want to hear what happens.”\n“Is something happening?” I inquired innocently.\n“You mean to say you don’t know?” said Miss Baker, honestly surprised. “I thought everybody knew.”\n“I don’t.”\n“Why—” she said hesitantly. “Tom’s got some woman in New York.”\n“Got some woman?” I repeated blankly.\nMiss Baker nodded.\n“She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time. Don’t you think?”\nAlmost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at the table.\n“It couldn’t be helped!” cried Daisy with tense gaiety.\nShe sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and continued: “I looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very romantic outdoors. There’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He’s singing away—” Her voice sang: “It’s romantic, isn’t it, Tom?”\n“Very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to me: “If it’s light enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables.”\nThe telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone, and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldn’t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police.",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the detailed anecdote about the butler’s previous occupation and the progression of his condition, which is a significant early section of the original passage.\n- The completion condenses or skips over the atmospheric description of Daisy’s emotional state and the shifting light, which is a key transitional moment in the middle of the passage.\n- The sequence involving Daisy’s sudden departure, the exchange between the narrator and Miss Baker, and the overheard conversation is compressed, losing the step-by-step progression of events.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The initial conversation about the butler’s nose lacks the background story and the escalation of his problem, as well as the interjection from Miss Baker.\n- The completion does not include the narrator’s internal reaction to Daisy’s compliment, nor the metaphorical description of her warmth and the effect of her words.\n- The detailed description of the atmosphere at the table, including the lighting and the narrator’s conflicted feelings, is missing.\n- The original’s depiction of the overheard conversation’s emotional dynamics and the narrator’s attempt to start a new topic is not present.\n- The completion omits the narrator’s reflection on the impact of the phone call and the sense of an intrusive, disruptive presence.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The butler’s nose is described inaccurately, with invented details about its shape rather than the cause and progression of the issue.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the butler’s return, Tom’s departure, and Daisy’s compliment are not in the correct order.\n- The emotional tone and reactions of the characters are generalized or altered, such as Daisy’s compliment being described as distant rather than extemporaneous.\n- The completion invents or exaggerates the narrator’s emotional response at the end, shifting from intrigue to alarm, which is not consistent with the original’s more nuanced reflection."

            "prefix-probing": "“I’ll tell you a family secret,” she whispered enthusiastically. Her eyes sparkled with a mixture of mischief and nostalgia as she leaned closer, the dim light casting shadows that danced across her face. \"It’s something that’s been passed down through generations, something only the closest of kin are privy to.\"\n\nI leaned in, captivated by the promise of revelation. The room around us seemed to fade, the hum of the party in the background becoming a distant murmur. She took a deep breath, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial tone.\n\n\"You see, our family has always been intertwined with the very fabric of this city’s history. Not just the grand mansions or the glittering soirées, but the secrets that lie beneath the surface—the whispered deals, the hidden alliances, the dreams that never quite materialized.\"\n\nHer words painted vivid images in my mind: opulent ballrooms filled with laughter and music, shadowy figures exchanging furtive glances, and the relentless pursuit of the elusive American Dream. It was a tapestry woven with both triumph and tragedy.\n\n\"My great-grandfather,\" she continued, \"was a man of vision and ambition. He arrived here with nothing but a suitcase and a head full of dreams. Through sheer determination, he built an empire, brick by brick. But with every success came sacrifices—relationships strained, trust broken, and a legacy that’s as much a burden as it is a blessing.\"\n\nI could sense the weight of her words, the pride mingled with a hint of sorrow. It was a reminder that beneath the glittering surface of wealth and status lay complex human stories, fraught with challenges and contradictions.\n\n\"And now,\" she said, her voice softening, \"it’s up to us to carry that legacy forward, to navigate the delicate balance between honoring the past and forging our own paths. It’s not always easy, but it’s what defines us.\"\n\nAs she finished, a silence settled between us, filled with unspoken understanding. The secret she shared was more than just a tale; it was a testament to resilience, identity, and the enduring power of family bonds. In that moment, I felt a profound connection—not just to her, but to the intricate web of stories that shape who we are."

Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while, trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.\nDaisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl.\n“We don’t know each other very well, Nick,” she said suddenly. “Even if we are cousins. You didn’t come to my wedding.”\n“I wasn’t back from the war.”\n“That’s true.” She hesitated. “Well, I’ve had a very bad time, Nick, and I’m pretty cynical about everything.”\nEvidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn’t say any more, and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter.\n“I suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything.”\n“Oh, yes.” She looked at me absently. “Listen, Nick; let me tell you what I said when she was born. Would you like to hear?”\n“Very much.”\n“It’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel about—things. Well, she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and wept. ‘All right,’ I said, ‘I’m glad it’s a girl. And I hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.’\n“You see I think everything’s terrible anyhow,” she went on in a convinced way. “Everybody thinks so—the most advanced people. And I know. I’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.” Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom’s, and she laughed with thrilling scorn. “Sophisticated—God, I’m sophisticated!”\nThe instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited, and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged.\nInside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the Saturday Evening Post—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running together in a soothing tune. The lamplight, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.\nWhen we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.\n“To be continued,” she said, tossing the magazine on the table, “in our very next issue.”\nHer body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she stood up.\n“Ten o’clock,” she remarked, apparently finding the time on the ceiling. “Time for this good girl to go to bed.”\n“Jordan’s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,” explained Daisy, “over at Westchester.”\n“Oh—you’re Jordan Baker.”\nI knew now why her face was familiar—its pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I had forgotten long ago.\n“Good night,” she said softly. “Wake me at eight, won’t you.”\n“If you’ll get up.”\n“I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.”\n“Of course you will,” confirmed Daisy.",

            "prefix-probing": "The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Their brief appearance in the narrative seemed almost like a fleeting mirage, a symbol of the fleeting nature of the dreams and illusions that permeated the lives of the characters in The Great Gatsby. The story, set in the roaring twenties, unfolds against a backdrop of opulence and decay, where the pursuit of wealth and status often overshadows genuine human connection.\n\nJay Gatsby, the enigmatic protagonist, is a man driven by an unrelenting desire to reclaim a past love and to reinvent himself in the eyes of society. His lavish parties, filled with music, laughter, and an endless flow of champagne, are a testament to his yearning for acceptance and his hope that Daisy Buchanan, the woman he loves, might one day walk through his doors. Yet beneath the glittering surface lies a profound loneliness and a sense of disillusionment.\n\nDaisy, with her voice described as \"full of money,\" embodies the allure and the emptiness of the American Dream. She is both the object of Gatsby's affection and a symbol of the social barriers that separate the old money elite from those who aspire to join their ranks. Her marriage to Tom Buchanan, a man of inherited wealth and brute force, represents the entrenched power structures that Gatsby seeks to challenge but ultimately cannot overcome.\n\nNick Carraway, the novel's narrator, offers a reflective and often critical perspective on the events that unfold. As a Midwesterner who moves to West Egg to learn the bond business, Nick is both an insider and an outsider, observing the extravagance and moral decay of the East Coast elite with a mixture of fascination and disapproval. His relationship with Gatsby is complex, marked by admiration for Gatsby's idealism and a recognition of the futility of his dreams.\n\nThe narrative explores themes of identity, love, and the corrupting influence of wealth. Gatsby's tragic end serves as a poignant commentary on the American Dream's promise and its limitations. Despite his wealth and determination, Gatsby cannot escape his past or the rigid social hierarchies that define his world.\n\nThe setting of the novel, with its contrasting locales of West Egg and East Egg, symbolizes the divide between new money and old money, between aspiration and tradition. The Valley of Ashes, a desolate industrial wasteland, represents the moral and social decay hidden beneath the glittering surface of the Jazz Age.\n\nThroughout the novel, Fitzgerald employs rich symbolism and lyrical prose to capture the spirit of an era marked by both exuberance and despair. The green light at the end of Daisy's dock, for instance, stands as a beacon of hope and longing, a reminder of the distance between dreams and reality.\n\nIn the end, The Great Gatsby is a meditation on the complexities of human desire and the elusive nature of happiness. The horses, briefly mentioned and then forgotten, serve as a subtle metaphor for the untamed forces that drive the characters and the inevitable consequences of their pursuits. Their silence in the narrative echoes the unspoken truths and the hidden sorrows that lie beneath the surface of the Jazz Age's glittering facade."

You know—lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing—”\n“Good night,” called Miss Baker from the stairs. “I haven’t heard a word.”\n“She’s a nice girl,” said Tom after a moment. “They oughtn’t to let her run around the country this way.”\n“Who oughtn’t to?” inquired Daisy coldly.\n“Her family.”\n“Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick’s going to look after her, aren’t you, Nick? She’s going to spend lots of weekends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be very good for her.”\nDaisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.\n“Is she from New York?” I asked quickly.\n“From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our beautiful white—”\n“Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?” demanded Tom suddenly.\n“Did I?” She looked at me. “I can’t seem to remember, but I think we talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I’m sure we did. It sort of crept up on us and first thing you know—”\n“Don’t believe everything you hear, Nick,” he advised me.\nI said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes later I got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor Daisy peremptorily called: “Wait!\n“I forgot to ask you something, and it’s important. We heard you were engaged to a girl out West.”\n“That’s right,” corroborated Tom kindly. “We heard that you were engaged.”\n“It’s a libel. I’m too poor.”\n“But we heard it,” insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again in a flower-like way. “We heard it from three people, so it must be true.”\nOf course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn’t even vaguely engaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the reasons I had come East. You can’t stop going with an old friend on account of rumours, and on the other hand I had no intention of being rumoured into marriage.\nTheir interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in arms—but apparently there were no such intentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he “had some woman in New York” was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.\nAlready it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages, where new red petrol-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight, and, turning my head to watch it, I saw that I was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbour’s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens.\nI decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and that would do for an introduction. But I didn’t call to him, for he gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone—he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was from him, I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.",

Jordan Baker, standing on the stairs, called out, “Good night, Nick.”\n\n“Good night, Jordan,” I replied.\n\nTom Buchanan looked up from his drink and said, “She’s a nice girl, but her family ought to be more careful about letting her out on the town.”\n\nDaisy waved him off. “Oh, Tom, she’s got an elderly aunt who keeps a close eye on her.

            "prefix-probing": "“In fact I think I’ll arrange a marriage. It seems the only way to secure a future that’s both stable and respectable,” Nick said thoughtfully, his gaze drifting toward the shimmering lights of the city beyond the window. The idea had been lingering in his mind ever since the last party at Gatsby’s mansion, where the glittering facades and whispered secrets had left him both enchanted and disillusioned.\n\nDaisy, with her ethereal charm and elusive smile, had always been the embodiment of the world Nick found himself drawn to yet wary of. Her voice, a melody that seemed to promise everything and nothing, haunted his thoughts. But beneath the surface, he knew the fragility of such dreams. The past, with its tangled webs of love and betrayal, was not so easily escaped.\n\nGatsby’s relentless pursuit of a dream, his lavish displays of wealth and grandeur, had been both inspiring and tragic. Nick admired the man’s unwavering hope, yet he could not ignore the hollowness that lay beneath the glittering exterior. The green light across the bay, a symbol of Gatsby’s yearning, flickered in Nick’s mind as a reminder of the elusive nature of happiness.\n\nAs he contemplated the prospect of marriage, Nick weighed the possibilities. Could a union forged not just in love but in mutual understanding and respect offer a sanctuary from the chaos of their world? Or would it merely be another illusion, a fragile construct destined to crumble under the weight of reality?\n\nThe city outside pulsed with life, a ceaseless dance of ambition and desire. In its shadows, stories unfolded—some of triumph, others of despair. Nick felt caught between these worlds, a witness to the dreams and disillusionments that defined his generation.\n\nHe thought of Jordan Baker, with her cool detachment and enigmatic smile. Their relationship had been a dance of proximity and distance, a reflection of the complexities that defined human connection in their time. Perhaps, he mused, a marriage arranged with intention and clarity could offer a different path.\n\nYet, the memory of Gatsby’s tragic end lingered—a stark reminder of the dangers of chasing illusions. The opulence and excess, the parties and the laughter, had masked a profound loneliness. Nick resolved to seek a future grounded in reality, where love was tempered by honesty and commitment.\n\nIn the quiet moments that followed, Nick felt a sense of resolve. The world was changing, and with it, the possibilities for those willing to embrace both the light and the shadows. An arranged marriage, once a notion steeped in tradition, now seemed a pragmatic step toward building a life of meaning and stability.\n\nHe imagined a partnership where two souls could navigate the complexities of their era together, supporting and challenging one another. It was a vision both hopeful and cautious, acknowledging the imperfections of human nature while striving for something enduring.\n\nAs dawn approached, casting a pale glow over the city, Nick felt a renewed sense of purpose. The past would always be a part of him, but the future was unwritten—a canvas awaiting the brushstrokes of choice and chance. With that thought, he embraced the possibility of a new beginning, one shaped not by the illusions of the past but by the promise of genuine connection and shared dreams.”"

The air was thick with the scent of coal and despair, a stark contrast to the glittering world of West Egg and East Egg. I glanced at Gatsby, whose face was set with a determined expression, as if he were preparing to confront the past or seize a fleeting dream. The road stretched ahead, leading us away from the city’s bright lights and into the shadowy realm of forgotten hopes.

Then I heard footsteps on a stairs, and in a moment the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door. She was in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her flesh sensuously as some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue crêpe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty, but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering. She smiled slowly and, walking through her husband as if he were a ghost, shook hands with Tom, looking him flush in the eye. Then she wet her lips, and without turning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice:\n“Get some chairs, why don’t you, so somebody can sit down.”\n“Oh, sure,” agreed Wilson hurriedly, and went toward the little office, mingling immediately with the cement colour of the walls. A white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinity—except his wife, who moved close to Tom.\n“I want to see you,” said Tom intently. “Get on the next train.”\n“All right.”\n“I’ll meet you by the newsstand on the lower level.”\nShe nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson emerged with two chairs from his office door.",

            "prefix-probing": "“Hello, Wilson, old man,” said Tom, slapping him jovially on the shoulder. Wilson looked up from his work, his face pale and drawn, the exhaustion of his daily toil etched deeply into his features. The garage was dimly lit, the air thick with the smell of oil and gasoline, a stark contrast to the opulence that Tom Buchanan was accustomed to. \n\n“Good morning, Tom,” Wilson replied, his voice weary but polite. He wiped his hands on a rag, trying to maintain a semblance of dignity despite the weariness that clung to him like a second skin. \n\nTom’s laughter echoed through the small space, a sound that seemed out of place amidst the quiet desperation that surrounded Wilson. “You’re working hard, old sport,” Tom said, his tone dripping with condescension. “Maybe one day you’ll be able to afford a car like mine.” \n\nWilson forced a smile, but it didn’t reach his eyes. He knew the gulf between their worlds was vast and unbridgeable. The green light across the bay, shimmering faintly in the distance, seemed to mock his dreams of escape and better days. \n\nAs Tom turned to leave, Wilson’s gaze lingered on the door, a silent plea for something more, something beyond the endless cycle of labor and disappointment. The weight of his existence pressed down on him, but beneath it all, a flicker of hope remained, fragile yet persistent. \n\nOutside, the summer sun beat down mercilessly, casting long shadows that stretched across the valley of ashes, a bleak reminder of the decay hidden beneath the glittering surface of the American Dream."

It was a few days before the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.\n“Terrible place, isn’t it,” said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor Eckleburg.\n“Awful.”\n“It does her good to get away.”\n“Doesn’t her husband object?”\n“Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He’s so dumb he doesn’t know he’s alive.”\nSo Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York—or not quite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom deferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be on the train.\nShe had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin, which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in New York. At the newsstand she bought a copy of Town Tattle and a moving-picture magazine, and in the station drugstore some cold cream and a small flask of perfume. Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one, lavender-coloured with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately she turned sharply from the window and, leaning forward, tapped on the front glass.\n“I want to get one of those dogs,” she said earnestly. “I want to get one for the apartment. They’re nice to have—a dog.”\nWe backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John D. Rockefeller. In a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an indeterminate breed.\n“What kind are they?” asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly, as he came to the taxi-window.\n“All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?”\n“I’d like to get one of those police dogs; I don’t suppose you got that kind?”\nThe man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and drew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.\n“That’s no police dog,” said Tom.\n“No, it’s not exactly a police dog,” said the man with disappointment in his voice. “It’s more of an Airedale.” He passed his hand over the brown washrag of a back. “Look at that coat. Some coat. That’s a dog that’ll never bother you with catching cold.”\n“I think it’s cute,” said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. “How much is it?”\n“That dog?” He looked at it admiringly. “That dog will cost you ten dollars.”\nThe Airedale—undoubtedly there was an Airedale concerned in it somewhere, though its feet were startlingly white—changed hands and settled down into Mrs. Wilson’s lap, where she fondled the weatherproof coat with rapture.\n“Is it a boy or a girl?” she asked delicately.\n“That dog? That dog’s a boy.”\n“It’s a bitch,” said Tom decisively. “Here’s your money. Go and buy ten more dogs with it.”",

The sun had just dipped below the horizon, casting a golden hue over the sprawling lawns and the distant city lights that twinkled like stars come to rest on earth. The sound of a car approaching made our hearts quicken, and as it slowed near the bend, we caught a glimpse of her silhouette framed by the headlights.\n\nShe stepped out, her dress shimmering softly in the fading light, a delicate contrast to the ruggedness of the road beneath her feet. Her eyes scanned the darkness, searching, perhaps for a sign or a face she hoped to find. The night was silent except for the rustling of leaves and the distant hum of the city, a quiet that seemed to hold its breath along with us.\n\nAs she moved closer, the tension in the air became palpable. We exchanged glances, each of us wondering what this meeting would bring. The past had a way of creeping back into the present, uninvited yet impossible to ignore. Memories, like ghosts, hovered just beyond reach, threatening to unravel the carefully woven fabric of our lives.\n\nShe stopped a few feet away, her gaze steady and unwavering. \"I didn't know if you'd come,\" she said softly, her voice carrying the weight of unspoken words. The vulnerability in her tone was a stark contrast to the strength she usually exuded, revealing a side of her few had ever seen.\n\nWe nodded, understanding that this moment was a crossroads, a chance to confront the truths we'd long avoided. The night stretched before us, vast and uncertain, but within it lay the possibility of redemption, of healing the wounds time had inflicted.\n\nSlowly, she reached out, her hand trembling slightly as it found ours. The warmth of her touch was a balm to the coldness that had settled in our hearts. Together, we stood there, united by the shared history that bound us, ready to face whatever the future held.\n\nThe road behind us was dark and winding, but ahead, the promise of dawn beckoned. In that quiet moment, beneath the canopy of stars, we found hope—a fragile, flickering light that would guide us through the night."

I wouldn’t have been surprised to see a great flock of white sheep turn the corner.\n“Hold on,” I said, “I have to leave you here.”\n“No you don’t,” interposed Tom quickly. “Myrtle’ll be hurt if you don’t come up to the apartment. Won’t you, Myrtle?”\n“Come on,” she urged. “I’ll telephone my sister Catherine. She’s said to be very beautiful by people who ought to know.”\n“Well, I’d like to, but—”\nWe went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds. At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses. Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the neighbourhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases, and went haughtily in.\n“I’m going to have the McKees come up,” she announced as we rose in the elevator. “And, of course, I got to call up my sister, too.”\nThe apartment was on the top floor—a small living-room, a small dining-room, a small bedroom, and a bath. The living-room was crowded to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it, so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was an over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock. Looked at from a distance, however, the hen resolved itself into a bonnet, and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room. Several old copies of Town Tattle lay on the table together with a copy of Simon Called Peter, and some of the small scandal magazines of Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with the dog. A reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk, to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large, hard dog biscuits—one of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whisky from a locked bureau door.",

A breeze blew through the room, carrying the scent of lilacs and freshly cut grass. The sunlight filtered through the leaves, casting dappled shadows on the polished wooden floor. We sat on the porch, the wicker chairs creaking softly beneath us, and watched the world go by. Children played in the distance, their laughter mingling with the chirping of birds. The air was thick with the promise of endless summer days, unhurried and full of possibility. Nearby, a fountain bubbled gently, its water sparkling in the golden light. The city seemed to pause, holding its breath in a moment of perfect tranquility. We spoke in hushed tones, our voices blending with the soft rustle of leaves and the distant hum of traffic. Time felt suspended, as if the afternoon would stretch on forever, unbroken and serene. The scent of freshly baked bread wafted from a nearby bakery, mingling with the aroma of blooming roses. A cat lazily stretched on the windowsill, basking in the warmth. The world outside was alive yet peaceful, a delicate balance of motion and stillness. As the sun began its slow descent, the sky transformed into a canvas of pinks and oranges, painting the horizon with hues of fire and gold. Shadows lengthened, and the air cooled, carrying with it the faint promise of evening. We lingered, reluctant to leave this idyllic moment behind, savoring the gentle embrace of a summer Sunday afternoon on Fifth Avenue."

Sitting on Tom’s lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the telephone; then there were no cigarettes, and I went out to buy some at the drugstore on the corner. When I came back they had both disappeared, so I sat down discreetly in the living-room and read a chapter of Simon Called Peter—either it was terrible stuff or the whisky distorted things, because it didn’t make any sense to me.\nJust as Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called each other by our first names) reappeared, company commenced to arrive at the apartment door.\nThe sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty, with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky white. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle, but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved about there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary haste, and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I wondered if she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed immoderately, repeated my question aloud, and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel.\nMr. McKee was a pale, feminine man from the flat below. He had just shaved, for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone, and he was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room. He informed me that he was in the “artistic game,” and I gathered later that he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs. Wilson’s mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall. His wife was shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible. She told me with pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven times since they had been married.\nMrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before, and was now attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream-coloured chiffon, which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room. With the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a change. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage was converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her assertions became more violently affected moment by moment, and as she expanded the room grew smaller around her, until she seemed to be revolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.",

They were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.\n\n\"Don’t look at me,\" Daisy told Jordan, with an impersonal expression, \"I’m not thinking about myself today. I’m thinking about you.\"\n\nJordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now she was standing with her chin raised a little, looking at me with an expression of amused contempt.\n\n\"You’re a rotten driver,\" I protested. \"Either you ought to be more careful, or you oughtn’t to drive at all.\"\n\n\"I’m not a very good driver,\" she admitted. \"I drive too fast. And I’m not a very good driver.\"\n\n\"You’re quite a character around here,\" I said. \"You’re a nice girl.\"\n\n\"I’m not a very good driver,\" she repeated. \"I drive too fast. And I’m not a very good driver.\"\n\nThe room was large and stifling, and the windows were open to the warm afternoon air. The sun was shining brightly, but the atmosphere was heavy with the scent of flowers and the faint smell of alcohol. The two young women on the couch were laughing and talking animatedly, their voices mingling with the distant sound of jazz music coming from the next room.\n\nTom Buchanan was standing near the window, his broad shoulders silhouetted against the light. He looked at me with a mixture of amusement and suspicion, his eyes narrowing slightly.\n\n\"You’re not from around here, are you?\" he asked.\n\nI shook my head. \"No, I’m just visiting.\"\n\nHe smiled, a slow, deliberate smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes. \"Well, you’ll find that things are a little different here.\"\n\nDaisy glanced at Tom, then back at me, her eyes sparkling with a mixture of sadness and hope. \"We’re all different here,\" she said softly. \"But sometimes, that’s what makes life interesting.\"\n\nThe afternoon wore on, and the light outside began to fade. The cheerful sun gave way to a golden glow, casting long shadows across the room. The music grew louder, and the laughter more raucous. The haze of alcohol and the warmth of the room combined to create a dreamlike atmosphere, blurring the edges of reality.\n\nAs the evening deepened, I found myself drawn into the swirling world of wealth, desire, and illusion that surrounded me. The faces around me were masks, hiding secrets and lies beneath their polished surfaces. And yet, beneath it all, there was a yearning for something real, something true.\n\nIn that moment, I understood that the afternoon’s events, though clouded and indistinct, were a glimpse into a world that was both dazzling and dangerous—a world where dreams could be shattered as easily as they were made."

She goes around looking at people’s feet in their own homes.”\n“I like your dress,” remarked Mrs. McKee, “I think it’s adorable.”\nMrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain.\n“It’s just a crazy old thing,” she said. “I just slip it on sometimes when I don’t care what I look like.”\n“But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,” pursued Mrs. McKee. “If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could make something of it.”\nWe all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side, and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face.\n“I should change the light,” he said after a moment. “I’d like to bring out the modelling of the features. And I’d try to get hold of all the back hair.”\n“I wouldn’t think of changing the light,” cried Mrs. McKee. “I think it’s—”\nHer husband said “Sh!” and we all looked at the subject again, whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.\n“You McKees have something to drink,” he said. “Get some more ice and mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.”\n“I told that boy about the ice.” Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness of the lower orders. “These people! You have to keep after them all the time.”\nShe looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.\n“I’ve done some nice things out on Long Island,” asserted Mr. McKee.\nTom looked at him blankly.\n“Two of them we have framed downstairs.”\n“Two what?” demanded Tom.\n“Two studies. One of them I call Montauk Point—The Gulls, and the other I call Montauk Point—The Sea.”\nThe sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch.\n“Do you live down on Long Island, too?” she inquired.\n“I live at West Egg.”\n“Really? I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man named Gatsby’s. Do you know him?”\n“I live next door to him.”\n“Well, they say he’s a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm’s. That’s where all his money comes from.”\n“Really?”\nShe nodded.\n“I’m scared of him. I’d hate to have him get anything on me.”\nThis absorbing information about my neighbour was interrupted by Mrs. McKee’s pointing suddenly at Catherine:\n“Chester, I think you could do something with her,” she broke out, but Mr. McKee only nodded in a bored way, and turned his attention to Tom.\n“I’d like to do more work on Long Island, if I could get the entry. All I ask is that they should give me a start.”\n“Ask Myrtle,” said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as Mrs. Wilson entered with a tray. “She’ll give you a letter of introduction, won’t you, Myrtle?”\n“Do what?” she asked, startled.\n“You’ll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can do some studies of him.” His lips moved silently for a moment as he invented, “ ‘George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,’ or something like that.”\nCatherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear:\n“Neither of them can stand the person they’re married to.”\n“Can’t they?”\n“Can’t stand them.” She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom. “What I say is, why go on living with them if they can’t stand them? If I was them I’d get a divorce and get married to each other right away.”\n“Doesn’t she like Wilson either?”\nThe answer to this was unexpected. It came from Myrtle, who had overheard the question, and it was violent and obscene.\n“You see,” cried Catherine triumphantly. She lowered her voice again. “It’s really his wife that’s keeping them apart. She’s a Catholic, and they don’t believe in divorce.”\nDaisy was not a Catholic, and I was a little shocked at the elaborateness of the lie.\n“When they do get married,” continued Catherine, “they’re going West to live for a while until it blows over.”\n“It’d be more discreet to go to Europe.”\n“Oh, do you like Europe?” she exclaimed surprisingly. “I just got back from Monte Carlo.”\n“Really.”\n“Just last year. I went over there with another girl.”\n“Stay long?”\n“No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back. We went by way of Marseilles. We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started, but we got gyped out of it all in two days in the private rooms. We had an awful time getting back, I can tell you. God, how I hated that town!”\nThe late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue honey of the Mediterranean—then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called me back into the room.\n“I almost made a mistake, too,” she declared vigorously. “I almost married a little kike who’d been after me for years. I knew he was below me. Everybody kept saying to me: ‘Lucille, that man’s way below you!’ But if I hadn’t met Chester, he’d of got me sure.”\n“Yes, but listen,” said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down, “at least you didn’t marry him.”\n“I know I didn’t.”\n“Well, I married him,” said Myrtle, ambiguously. “And that’s the difference between your case and mine.”\n“Why did you, Myrtle?” demanded Catherine. “Nobody forced you to.”\nMyrtle considered.\n“I married him because I thought he was a gentleman,” she said finally. “I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn’t fit to lick my shoe.”\n“You were crazy about him for a while,” said Catherine.\n“Crazy about him!” cried Myrtle incredulously. “Who said I was crazy about him? I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that man there.”\nShe pointed suddenly at me, and everyone looked at me accusingly. I tried to show by my expression that I expected no affection.\n“The only crazy I was was when I married him. I knew right away I made a mistake. He borrowed somebody’s best suit to get married in, and never even told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he was out: ‘Oh, is that your suit?’ I said. ‘This is the first I ever heard about it.’ But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to beat the band all afternoon.”",

I just threw it on.”\n\nMrs. McKee nodded. “You know, Chester could take a picture of you in that pose.

You’ve got to look out for yourself in this world.” \n\nDaisy’s voice was sharp, but there was a hint of sadness beneath the surface, a weariness that came from years of disappointment and disillusionment. She glanced around the room, her eyes settling on the glittering chandeliers and the throng of guests who laughed and danced without a care. \n\n“It’s all a game,” she continued, “and the players don’t always play fair. You have to learn the rules quickly, or you’ll be left behind.” \n\nHer sister nodded, absorbing the advice with a mixture of apprehension and determination. The summer evening stretched out before them, filled with the promise of endless possibilities and the shadow of inevitable heartbreak. \n\nAs the music swelled and the guests moved in a swirling dance of light and shadow, Daisy’s thoughts drifted to the past — to the days when hope was still alive and the future seemed bright. But those days were gone now, replaced by a world where dreams were fragile and love was often a fleeting illusion. \n\nShe sighed softly, the sound lost amidst the clamor of the party. Yet beneath her composed exterior, a storm of emotions raged, a longing for something more than the glittering facade that surrounded her. \n\nIn that moment, she realized that the advice she had given was not just for her sister, but for herself as well. To survive in this world, one had to be strong, cautious, and above all, resilient. \n\nThe night wore on, and the guests began to drift away, their laughter fading into the quiet hum of the city. Daisy stood by the window, watching the stars twinkle in the velvet sky, and wondered if there was still a chance for happiness — or if it was just another illusion, destined to slip through her fingers like sand."

And Tom’s the first sweetie she ever had.”\nThe bottle of whisky—a second one—was now in constant demand by all present, excepting Catherine, who “felt just as good on nothing at all.” Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches, which were a complete supper in themselves. I wanted to get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight, but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild, strident argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I saw him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.\nMyrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.\n“It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the last ones left on the train. I was going up to New York to see my sister and spend the night. He had on a dress suit and patent leather shoes, and I couldn’t keep my eyes off him, but every time he looked at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head. When we came into the station he was next to me, and his white shirtfront pressed against my arm, and so I told him I’d have to call a policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into a taxi with him I didn’t hardly know I wasn’t getting into a subway train. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was ‘You can’t live forever; you can’t live forever.’ ”\nShe turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial laughter.\n“My dear,” she cried, “I’m going to give you this dress as soon as I’m through with it. I’ve got to get another one tomorrow. I’m going to make a list of all the things I’ve got to get. A massage and a wave, and a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ashtrays where you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother’s grave that’ll last all summer. I got to write down a list so I won’t forget all the things I got to do.”\nIt was nine o’clock—almost immediately afterward I looked at my watch and found it was ten. Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists clenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action. Taking out my handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the spot of dried lather that had worried me all the afternoon.\nThe little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through the smoke, and from time to time groaning faintly. People disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost each other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet away. Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood face to face discussing, in impassioned voices, whether Mrs. Wilson had any right to mention Daisy’s name.",

INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion attributes thoughts and dialogue to the narrator and Catherine that do not occur in the original, such as the narrator's self-description and Catherine's direct compliment.\n- Myrtle's account of her first meeting with Tom is generalized and omits the sequence and physical details, leading to a loss of narrative progression.\n- The timing of events is not accurately represented; the transition from nine to ten o'clock and the subsequent events are not clearly delineated.\n- The final argument between Tom and Myrtle is described as being about Myrtle's right to say Daisy's name, but the original specifies a different character and a more nuanced discussion.\n\nOverall, the completion should avoid inventing new dialogue or perspectives, restore the missing step-by-step recounting of events and atmosphere, and ensure the sequence and timing of events match the original passage."

He’s so dumb he doesn’t know he’s alive.”\n\n“Eleven years,” she went on, “and you’re still living over the garage.”\n\n“Tom’s the first sweetie she ever had,” she added.\n\nThe bottle of whiskey—a second one—was in constant demand by all except Catherine, who declared that she didn’t care for whiskey.\n\nI was standing beside a table on which four or five bottles were ranged, and I was trying to go, but each time I opened the door I was pulled back into the room by the noise and the arguments. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.\n\nOutside, the dusk was beginning to fall, and the city lights were starting to glow. I imagined a watcher in the street, looking up at the lighted windows, and wondered what he would think of the scene within.\n\nMyrtle came close to me and began to tell the story of the first time she met Tom. She said it was on the train, and she was sitting in the seat with a man who was reading a newspaper. Tom came in and sat beside her. She tried to avoid his gaze, but he looked at her and smiled. She told him she was going to call a policeman, but he laughed and said, “You can’t live forever.” They shared a taxi ride, and she felt a thrill at the illicitness of it all.\n\nAfter the story, Myrtle laughed artificially and told Mrs. McKee she planned to give her the dress she was wearing. She began to list the things she needed to buy: a massage, a hair appointment, a dog collar, an ashtray, and a wreath for her mother’s grave.\n\nTime passed quickly. I looked at my watch; it was nearly ten o’clock. Mr. McKee was asleep in a chair, his head tilted back like a photograph. I wiped a spot of dried shaving lather from his cheek with my handkerchief.\n\nThe little dog groaned and rolled over on the floor. The room was filled with smoke and confusion. People disappeared and reappeared, searching for each other in the dim light.\n\nToward midnight, Tom and Myrtle began to argue about whether Myrtle had the right to say Daisy’s name. Their voices grew louder, and the tension in the room increased.",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The beginning of the completion introduces invented dialogue and characterization about Tom that is not present in the original, altering the tone and content of Catherine's remarks.\n- The completion omits the detailed description of the narrator's internal struggle to leave and the specific imagery of being pulled back into the room, which is a significant structural element in the original.\n- The completion condenses Myrtle's story about meeting Tom, omitting the step-by-step recounting and the sensory details that build the scene.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early on, the completion lacks the specific context about the bottle of whisky being in constant demand by all except Catherine, and her unique reason for abstaining.\n- The completion does not include the narrator's desire to walk eastward toward the park or the description of the twilight, which sets the mood and time of day.\n- The completion omits the narrator's observation of the city from above and the imagined watcher in the street, which provides an important perspective shift.\n- Myrtle's story is missing the sequence of events on the train, including the details of the seats, her actions to avoid Tom's gaze, and the physical proximity that led to her fabricated threat about calling a policeman.\n- The list Myrtle makes is less detailed in the completion, missing some specific items and the reasoning behind making the list.\n- The passage of time is not clearly marked; the original specifies the time at two points, which is condensed in the completion.\n- The description of Mr. McKee's posture and the narrator's action with the handkerchief is less vivid and omits the comparison to a photograph.\n- The little dog's behavior and the atmosphere of the room, including the smoke and the dog's groaning, are not fully described.\n- The chaotic movement of the guests—disappearing, reappearing, searching, and finding each other—is summarized but lacks the sense of confusion and repetition present in the original.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- Catherine's dialogue at the start is altered, introducing opinions and insults about Tom that are not in the original.\n- The sequence of Myrtle's story is compressed, and some actions are attributed to her that are not specified in the original (such as her describing Tom's speech).\n- The time progression is inaccurate; the original marks the time at two distinct points, while the completion jumps directly to ten o'clock.\n- The argument at the end is described as \"heatedly\" about Myrtle's right to say Daisy's name, which simplifies and slightly misrepresents the nature of the discussion in the original.\n- The completion omits the narrator's dual perspective of being both inside and outside the scene, which is a key reflective element in the original passage."

            "prefix-probing": "“She really ought to get away from him,” resumed Catherine to me. “They’re such beautiful shirts,” she went on, throwing her arms wide, “it makes me sad because I’ve never seen such — such beautiful shirts before.”\n\nI glanced down at the shirts, at the pale, shifting, shimmering, under the moonlight, and then back at Catherine’s eager face. “You don’t understand,” she said. “He’s a very careful man.”\n\nI nodded, not quite sure what she meant, but I was drawn into the conversation nonetheless.\n\n“Tom’s got some woman in New York,” she continued, lowering her voice. “She might have been a great deal of trouble, but she’s not the kind of girl to let herself be taken advantage of. She’s got a lot of friends, and she’s very smart.”\n\nI looked at her, surprised by the sudden shift in her tone. “You mean Myrtle Wilson?” I asked.\n\nCatherine nodded. “Yes, Myrtle. She’s got a way of making people listen to her. She’s not like Daisy, you know. Daisy’s all about money and appearances, but Myrtle’s got a kind of fire.”\n\nI thought about the contrast between the two women, the delicate, ethereal Daisy and the vibrant, earthy Myrtle. It was as if they belonged to different worlds, yet both were caught in the same web of Tom’s desires.\n\n“Do you think Daisy knows about Myrtle?” I asked.\n\nCatherine shrugged. “Who knows? Tom’s very careful. He’s got a way of keeping things separate. But you can tell by the way he looks at Myrtle that he’s not just fooling around.”\n\nI felt a pang of sympathy for Daisy, imagining her in her elegant home, unaware or perhaps willfully ignorant of her husband’s infidelities.\n\n“Sometimes I think Tom’s not a bad man,” Catherine said suddenly. “He’s just got a lot of trouble inside him. You can see it in his eyes.”\n\nI looked at Tom, who was standing across the room, his face set in a hard, determined expression. There was something about him that was both commanding and cruel.\n\n“Do you think he loves Daisy?” I asked.\n\nCatherine laughed softly. “Love? I don’t know. Maybe he loves the idea of her. But he’s not the kind of man to be tied down.”\n\nThe room fell silent for a moment, the only sound the soft rustling of the curtains in the evening breeze.\n\n“Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to live in their world,” I said. “All that wealth and glamour.”\n\nCatherine smiled wistfully. “It’s not all it’s cracked up to be. There’s a lot of loneliness beneath the surface.”\n\nI nodded, understanding more than I wanted to admit.\n\nAs the night wore on, the conversation drifted to other topics, but the image of Tom, Daisy, and Myrtle lingered in my mind. The tangled relationships, the secrets, and the lies painted a picture of a world that was both dazzling and tragic.\n\nI realized that beneath the glittering facade of wealth and privilege, there were wounds that money could not heal, and hearts that were forever restless."

All major sections are present and in the correct order.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- In the early part of the passage, all key activities and descriptions are included.\n- In the middle, the details about the arrival and disposal of fruit are present, but the transition between these events could be more fluid, as the original links the days and actions more seamlessly.\n- In the later part, the description of the kitchen machine and the caterers is included, but the completion could benefit from more explicit mention of the frequency and scale of the catering events, as well as the visual impact of the decorations and food displays.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- There are minor inconsistencies in the use of hyphenation and spelling (e.g., \"motor-boats\" vs. \"motorboats,\" \"week-ends\" vs. \"weekends,\" \"colored\" vs. \"coloured\"), but these do not affect the major content or structure.\n- The sequence of events and timing details are accurate, with no significant errors in order or attribution.\n- No invented reflections or perspectives are present.\n\nOverall, the completion is highly faithful to the original, with only minor issues in the fluidity of transitions and the vividness of certain descriptions.

In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft, or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam. On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city, between nine in the morning and long past midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains. And on Mondays, eight servants, including an extra gardener, toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.\n\nEvery Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New York—every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler’s thumb.\n\nAt least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough colored lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsby’s enormous garden.

A momentary hush; the orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her, and there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda Gray’s understudy from the Follies.

The lights grow brighter as the guests begin to pour in, their laughter and chatter filling the air with a vibrant energy. The garden is transformed into a shimmering wonderland, with lanterns hanging from the trees and the scent of blooming flowers mingling with the crisp night air. People in elegant gowns and sharp tuxedos move gracefully across the lawn, their faces glowing with excitement and anticipation.\n\nNick Carraway, standing near the edge of the crowd, observes the scene with a mixture of fascination and detachment. He notes the extravagance of Gatsby’s parties, the endless flow of champagne, and the seemingly endless stream of guests, many of whom he does not recognize. Yet, despite the opulence and gaiety, there is an undercurrent of restlessness, a sense that something is missing beneath the surface.\n\nAs the music swells, couples take to the dance floor, their movements synchronized with the lively rhythms. Gatsby himself appears, a figure of calm amidst the revelry, greeting guests with a warm smile and a gracious nod. His eyes, however, betray a deeper longing, a hope that tonight might bring him closer to the dream he has been chasing.\n\nThe night unfolds with a dazzling display of joy and excess, but as dawn approaches, the revelers begin to fade away, leaving behind only the echoes of laughter and the faint glow of the fading lights. In the quiet aftermath, the true nature of Gatsby’s world becomes clearer—a world built on illusion, desire, and the relentless pursuit of an unattainable ideal."

I was immediately struck by the number of young Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little hungry, and all talking in low, earnest voices to solid and prosperous Americans.

At least, that’s what I told myself as I navigated through the throng of people milling about the grand estate, the air thick with the hum of jazz and laughter. Gatsby’s parties were legendary, a kaleidoscope of opulence and extravagance, where the rich and the restless mingled beneath the shimmering lights. Yet, despite the spectacle, there was an air of mystery about the host himself. I had heard whispers and rumors, but none could quite capture the essence of Jay Gatsby.\n\nAs I stepped onto the manicured lawn, I caught sight of Gatsby standing apart from the crowd, his gaze distant yet inviting. He was a man of paradoxes—charming yet reserved, generous yet guarded. Our conversation that evening revealed a depth beneath the glittering surface, a yearning for something more profound than the fleeting pleasures of his lavish gatherings.\n\nThe guests came and went like waves, their faces a blur of excitement and indulgence. Yet, Gatsby remained a constant, a beacon amidst the chaos. His smile was genuine, his hospitality boundless, but there was a sadness in his eyes that spoke of dreams deferred and desires unfulfilled.\n\nIn the days that followed, I found myself drawn deeper into Gatsby’s world, uncovering layers of ambition, love, and loss. His story was intertwined with the shimmering promise of the American Dream, a testament to the relentless pursuit of happiness and the inevitable shadows that accompany it.\n\nReflecting on that first night, I realized that being invited to Gatsby’s house was more than a social courtesy—it was an entry into a narrative of hope and tragedy, a glimpse into the heart of a man who dared to dream beyond the confines of his reality."

My voice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden.\n“I thought you might be here,” she responded absently as I came up. “I remembered you lived next door to—”\nShe held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she’d take care of me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses, who stopped at the foot of the steps.\n“Hello!” they cried together. “Sorry you didn’t win.”\nThat was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week before.\n“You don’t know who we are,” said one of the girls in yellow, “but we met you here about a month ago.”\n“You’ve dyed your hair since then,” remarked Jordan, and I started, but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer’s basket. With Jordan’s slender golden arm resting in mine, we descended the steps and sauntered about the garden. A tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight, and we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble.\n“Do you come to these parties often?” inquired Jordan of the girl beside her.\n“The last one was the one I met you at,” answered the girl, in an alert confident voice. She turned to her companion: “Wasn’t it for you, Lucille?”\nIt was for Lucille, too.\n“I like to come,” Lucille said. “I never care what I do, so I always have a good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked me my name and address—inside of a week I got a package from Croirier’s with a new evening gown in it.”\n“Did you keep it?” asked Jordan.\n“Sure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the bust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two hundred and sixty-five dollars.”\n“There’s something funny about a fellow that’ll do a thing like that,” said the other girl eagerly. “He doesn’t want any trouble with anybody.”\n“Who doesn’t?” I inquired.\n“Gatsby. Somebody told me—”\nThe two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.\n“Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.”\nA thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward and listened eagerly.\n“I don’t think it’s so much that,” argued Lucille sceptically; “It’s more that he was a German spy during the war.”\nOne of the men nodded in confirmation.\n“I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in Germany,” he assured us positively.\n“Oh, no,” said the first girl, “it couldn’t be that, because he was in the American army during the war.” As our credulity switched back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm. “You look at him sometimes when he thinks nobody’s looking at him. I’ll bet he killed a man.”\nShe narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned and looked around for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who had found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this world.",

The party was a blur of laughter and music, but beneath it all was a tension I couldn't quite place. Gatsby was nowhere to be seen, and the guests seemed to be waiting for something, or someone.\n\nJordan led me to the edge of the garden, where the lights from the house cast long shadows across the lawn. \"He's not here yet,\" she said, glancing back toward the house. \"But he'll come. He always does.\"\n\nI nodded, trying to steady my nerves. The evening had taken a strange turn, and I wasn't sure what to expect next. As we stood there, a figure appeared at the end of the driveway, silhouetted against the night sky.

There was something magnetic about him, an aura of mystery that drew people in despite the rumors that swirled around his name. I found myself wanting to know more, to understand the man behind the legend.\n\nAs the night wore on, Gatsby and I talked about his past, his dreams, and the future he envisioned. He spoke with a passion that was both inspiring and unsettling, revealing a vulnerability beneath his polished exterior. It was clear that he was chasing something elusive, a dream that seemed just out of reach.\n\nThe party continued around us, but I was lost in Gatsby's world, captivated by his story and the intensity of his gaze. For a moment, I forgot my own troubles and the complicated web of relationships that bound us all together.\n\nBut as the first light of dawn began to creep over the horizon, reality intruded once more. Gatsby's smile faded, and a shadow crossed his face. \"I have to go,\" he said quietly. \"There are things I need to take care of.\"\n\nJordan and I watched as he disappeared into the early morning mist, leaving behind a sense of longing and unanswered questions. The garden was silent now, the echoes of the night's revelry fading into memory.\n\nI realized then that Gatsby was a man defined by his dreams, a dreamer who refused to let go, no matter the cost. And in that moment, I understood that his story was far from over."

There were three married couples and Jordan’s escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo, and obviously under the impression that sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling, this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the countryside—East Egg condescending to West Egg and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gaiety.\n“Let’s get out,” whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate half-hour; “this is much too polite for me.”\nWe got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host: I had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. The undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.\nThe bar, where we glanced first, was crowded, but Gatsby was not there. She couldn’t find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn’t on the veranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas.\nA stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.\n“What do you think?” he demanded impetuously.\n“About what?”\nHe waved his hand toward the bookshelves.\n“About that. As a matter of fact you needn’t bother to ascertain. I ascertained. They’re real.”\n“The books?”\nHe nodded.\n“Absolutely real—have pages and everything. I thought they’d be a nice durable cardboard. Matter of fact, they’re absolutely real. Pages and—Here! Lemme show you.”\nTaking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and returned with Volume One of the Stoddard Lectures.\n“See!” he cried triumphantly. “It’s a bona-fide piece of printed matter. It fooled me. This fella’s a regular Belasco. It’s a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop, too—didn’t cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?”\nHe snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf, muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse.\n“Who brought you?” he demanded. “Or did you just come? I was brought. Most people were brought.”\nJordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without answering.\n“I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,” he continued. “Mrs. Claud Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I’ve been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.”\n“Has it?”\n“A little bit, I think. I can’t tell yet. I’ve only been here an hour. Did I tell you about the books? They’re real. They’re—”\n“You told us.”\nWe shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the direct dialogue exchanges between the characters, especially the back-and-forth about the books and the authenticity of the library. Instead, it summarizes these interactions, which reduces the immediacy and character dynamics present in the original.\n- The completion invents a minor internal reaction from the narrator regarding the undergraduate's behavior, which is not present in the original passage.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the specific description of the party's function as representing a particular social group and their attitude toward the other guests, which is a key element in the original's depiction of social dynamics.\n- The sense of the party's \"dignified homogeneity\" and their self-assigned role is not fully conveyed.\n- The completion lacks the detail about the undergraduate's demeanor and the narrator's observation of his expectations regarding Jordan.\n- The original's description of the library's architectural style and the suggestion that it was transported from overseas is only partially captured.\n- The completion omits the muttered comment about the library collapsing if a book is removed, which adds to the characterization of the man in the library.\n- The original's subtle humor and the awkwardness of the encounter, especially in the dialogue, are not fully present.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes a sense of boredom to the narrator regarding the undergraduate, which is not explicitly stated in the original.\n- The sequence of searching for Gatsby is generally correct, but the completion does not clearly indicate the narrator's unease as being the reason for seeking Gatsby, as stated by Jordan in the original.\n- The completion paraphrases the man's comments about the books and the library, but does not maintain the original's structure of repeated assertions and the demonstration with the book, which are important for the pacing and tone.\n- The completion summarizes the handshake and departure rather than presenting it as a formal, grave gesture, which alters the tone of the ending."

The air was thick with the scent of lilacs and the soft murmur of laughter and conversation. The garden was illuminated by strings of fairy lights that twinkled like stars, casting a warm glow over the guests. As I approached, I noticed the table was laden with an array of delicacies—platters of cold meats, bowls of fresh fruit, and glasses filled with sparkling champagne.\n\nJordan greeted me with a smile, her eyes sparkling with the same mischievous light that had first drawn me to her. \"Come, sit with us,\" she said, patting the seat beside her. I took my place among the group, a mix of familiar faces and strangers, all caught up in the revelry of the evening.\n\nThe conversation flowed easily, punctuated by bursts of laughter and the clinking of glasses. Stories were exchanged, some true, others exaggerated for effect, but all contributing to the vibrant tapestry of the night. I found myself drawn into the warmth of the gathering, momentarily forgetting the complexities and uncertainties that had brought me here.\n\nAs the supper progressed, the music from the band grew louder, and some guests began to dance on the lawn, their movements graceful and carefree. The moon hung low in the sky, casting a silver light over the scene, adding to the dreamlike quality of the evening. I watched as Jordan moved among the guests, her presence commanding yet effortless, a queen in her domain.\n\nAt one point, Gatsby himself appeared, stepping out from the shadows with a smile that seemed both genuine and enigmatic. He approached our table, his eyes searching mine briefly before settling on Jordan. They exchanged a few words, their conversation hushed but charged with an unspoken understanding. Gatsby then turned to me, extending his hand in greeting. His grip was firm, his demeanor composed, yet there was an intensity beneath the surface that hinted at deeper emotions.\n\nThe night wore on, and the guests continued to revel, their spirits buoyed by the music, the wine, and the promise of endless possibilities. Yet beneath the surface, I sensed a tension, a fragile balance that could be disrupted at any moment. The grandeur of the party, the opulence of the setting, and the charm of the host all seemed to mask a deeper yearning, a longing for something just out of reach.\n\nAs the clock neared midnight, the first supper concluded, and the guests began to drift away from the tables, some heading towards the dance floor, others seeking quieter corners for more intimate conversations. Jordan leaned towards me, her voice low and conspiratorial. \"There's always another supper,\" she whispered, \"and with it, another chance to uncover the secrets that lie beneath the surface.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling the weight of her words and the promise they held. The night was far from over, and the story of Gatsby's world was still unfolding, layer by intricate layer. In that moment, I realized that I was not merely a spectator but a participant in a drama that was as captivating as it was elusive, a tale of dreams and desires, of hope and heartbreak, set against the glittering backdrop of a world that was both dazzling and dangerous."

By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian, and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz, and between the numbers people were doing “stunts” all over the garden, while happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A pair of stage twins, who turned out to be the girls in yellow, did a baby act in costume, and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger-bowls. The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn.\nI was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl, who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying myself now. I had taken two finger-bowls of champagne, and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental, and profound.\nAt a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.\n“Your face is familiar,” he said politely. “Weren’t you in the First Division during the war?”\n“Why yes. I was in the Twenty-eighth Infantry.”\n“I was in the Sixteenth until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I’d seen you somewhere before.”\nWe talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France. Evidently he lived in this vicinity, for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane, and was going to try it out in the morning.\n“Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound.”\n“What time?”\n“Any time that suits you best.”\nIt was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around and smiled.\n“Having a gay time now?” she inquired.\n“Much better.” I turned again to my new acquaintance. “This is an unusual party for me. I haven’t even seen the host. I live over there—” I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, “and this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation.”\nFor a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.\n“I’m Gatsby,” he said suddenly.\n“What!” I exclaimed. “Oh, I beg your pardon.”\n“I thought you knew, old sport. I’m afraid I’m not a very good host.”\nHe smiled understandingly—much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced—or seemed to face—the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey. Precisely at that point it vanished—and I was looking at an elegant young roughneck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced himself I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care.",

            "prefix-probing": "The lights grow brighter as the night deepens, casting a golden glow over the revelers. Laughter and music mingle in the warm air, creating a symphony of joy and abandon. The air is thick with the scent of jasmine and the faint hint of champagne, mingling with the soft rustle of silk and the crisp snap of tuxedos. In the midst of the swirling crowd, Gatsby stands apart, his eyes scanning the throng with a mixture of hope and melancholy. His smile is practiced, yet there is a distant look in his gaze, as if he is searching for something just beyond reach.\n\nNick Carraway, the narrator, observes the scene with a mixture of fascination and skepticism. He notes the extravagance and the carelessness of the guests, many of whom have come without invitation, drawn by the allure of Gatsby's wealth and the promise of a night to remember. Yet beneath the surface, there is an undercurrent of loneliness and longing, a sense that the glittering facade masks deeper truths.\n\nAs the music swells, a figure emerges from the crowd—Daisy Buchanan, radiant and ethereal, her laughter like the tinkling of crystal. She moves with a grace that captivates all who see her, yet there is a fragility in her smile, a hint of sadness that only Gatsby seems to perceive. Their eyes meet across the room, and for a moment, the world narrows to just the two of them, suspended in a fragile bubble of possibility.\n\nThe party continues into the early hours, the revelers lost in a haze of music, dance, and fleeting connections. Conversations drift from trivial gossip to whispered confessions, and the boundaries between reality and illusion blur. Gatsby's dream, embodied in the figure of Daisy, seems both within reach and impossibly distant, a shimmering mirage on the horizon of his desires.\n\nAs dawn approaches, the guests begin to depart, their laughter fading into the quiet of the morning. The garden, once alive with movement and sound, falls silent, bathed in the soft light of the rising sun. Gatsby remains, standing alone amidst the remnants of the night's festivities, his gaze fixed on the horizon where the green light flickers faintly across the water—a symbol of hope, yearning, and the elusive nature of the American Dream.\n\nIn this moment, the grandeur of the party gives way to a profound sense of solitude and reflection. The characters, each caught in their own web of dreams and disappointments, are left to confront the realities that lie beneath the surface of their glittering lives. The dance, the music, and the laughter are but fleeting distractions from the deeper truths that define their existence.\n\nThrough Nick's eyes, the reader is invited to contemplate the complexities of human desire, the illusions we create, and the inevitable passage of time that renders all things transient. The Great Gatsby, with its vivid portrayal of a world both dazzling and tragic, offers a timeless meditation on the pursuit of happiness and the cost of chasing dreams that may never be fulfilled."

He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn.\n“If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,” he urged me. “Excuse me. I will rejoin you later.”\nWhen he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan—constrained to assure her of my surprise. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in his middle years.\n“Who is he?” I demanded. “Do you know?”\n“He’s just a man named Gatsby.”\n“Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?”\n“Now you’re started on the subject,” she answered with a wan smile. “Well, he told me once he was an Oxford man.”\nA dim background started to take shape behind him, but at her next remark it faded away.\n“However, I don’t believe it.”\n“Why not?”\n“I don’t know,” she insisted, “I just don’t think he went there.”\nSomething in her tone reminded me of the other girl’s “I think he killed a man,” and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I would have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York. That was comprehensible. But young men didn’t—at least in my provincial inexperience I believed they didn’t—drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island Sound.\n“Anyhow, he gives large parties,” said Jordan, changing the subject with an urban distaste for the concrete. “And I like large parties. They’re so intimate. At small parties there isn’t any privacy.”\nThere was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.\n“Ladies and gentlemen,” he cried. “At the request of Mr. Gatsby we are going to play for you Mr. Vladmir Tostoff’s latest work, which attracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the papers you know there was a big sensation.” He smiled with jovial condescension, and added: “Some sensation!” Whereupon everybody laughed.\n“The piece is known,” he concluded lustily, “as ‘Vladmir Tostoff’s Jazz History of the World!’ ”\nThe nature of Mr. Tostoff’s composition eluded me, because just as it began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and looking from one group to another with approving eyes. His tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister about him. I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased. When the “Jazz History of the World” was over, girls were putting their heads on men’s shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into men’s arms, even into groups, knowing that someone would arrest their falls—but no one swooned backward on Gatsby, and no French bob touched Gatsby’s shoulder, and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby’s head for one link.",

Gatsby excused himself and went into the house, leaving me alone on the porch. The evening was warm and the air was filled with the scent of blooming flowers and freshly cut grass. I sat back in my chair, watching the lights flicker in the distance and listening to the faint hum of the city beyond the bay.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Gatsby returned, his face composed but his eyes betraying a hint of tension. He apologized for the interruption and explained that the call was urgent, but he was eager to continue our conversation. We moved inside to the spacious living room, where the soft glow of the lamps cast long shadows on the walls. Gatsby poured us each a drink, and we settled into the plush armchairs facing the fireplace.\n\nHe began to speak of his past, revealing fragments of a life shrouded in mystery and ambition. He told me about his humble beginnings, the hardships he endured, and the relentless pursuit of a dream that seemed just out of reach. His voice was steady, but there was an undercurrent of longing that resonated deeply.\n\nAs the night wore on, Gatsby's stories painted a vivid picture of a man driven by hope and the desire to reinvent himself. He spoke of a woman named Daisy, whose memory haunted him and fueled his every endeavor. The intensity of his feelings was palpable, and I found myself drawn into the world he had created, a world where the past and present intertwined in a delicate dance.\n\nSuddenly, the sound of a car approaching interrupted our conversation. Gatsby's expression shifted, a mixture of anticipation and apprehension crossing his features. He excused himself once more and stepped outside to greet the visitor. I followed at a distance, curious to see who had come to call at such a late hour.\n\nThe car pulled up to the grand entrance, and a young woman stepped out, her elegant attire and confident demeanor marking her as someone of significance. Gatsby greeted her warmly, and they exchanged a few words before entering the house together. I watched as they disappeared into the shadows, the mystery of their relationship adding another layer to the enigma that was Gatsby.\n\nReturning to the living room, I pondered the complexities of the man before me. He was a paradox, a figure of both grandeur and vulnerability, whose life was a tapestry woven with threads of hope, desire, and the relentless pursuit of an ideal. The night stretched on, and as the first light of dawn began to creep through the windows, I realized that my understanding of Gatsby was only beginning to unfold."

I noticed that she wore her evening-dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes—there was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.\nI was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and intriguing sounds had issued from a long, many-windowed room which overhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan’s undergraduate, who was now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who implored me to join him, I went inside.\nThe large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was playing the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of champagne, and during the course of her song she had decided, ineptly, that everything was very, very sad—she was not only singing, she was weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks—not freely, however, for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky colour, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face, whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair, and went off into a deep vinous sleep.\n“She had a fight with a man who says he’s her husband,” explained a girl at my elbow.\nI looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan’s party, the quartet from East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of the men was talking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife, after attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent way, broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks—at intervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed: “You promised!” into his ear.\nThe reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant wives. The wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices.\n“Whenever he sees I’m having a good time he wants to go home.”\n“Never heard anything so selfish in my life.”\n“We’re always the first ones to leave.”\n“So are we.”\n“Well, we’re almost the last tonight,” said one of the men sheepishly. “The orchestra left half an hour ago.”\nIn spite of the wives’ agreement that such malevolence was beyond credibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives were lifted, kicking, into the night.",

            "prefix-probing": "“I beg your pardon.” I turned around and saw a man approaching, his face familiar yet shadowed by the dim light of the evening. It was Gatsby himself, his smile as enigmatic as ever, his eyes gleaming with a mixture of hope and melancholy. The garden around us was alive with the soft murmur of distant conversations and the gentle rustling of leaves stirred by a cool breeze.\n\n“I didn’t mean to startle you,” he said, his voice smooth and reassuring. “I just wanted to make sure you were enjoying the party.”\n\nI nodded, still a bit taken aback by his sudden appearance. “Yes, it’s quite something. The way you’ve transformed this place—it’s like stepping into another world.”\n\nGatsby’s smile widened, but there was a hint of sadness beneath it. “That’s the idea. To create a world where anything is possible, where the past can be rewritten.”\n\nI looked at him closely, trying to decipher the layers beneath his charm. There was a restlessness in his gaze, a yearning that seemed to transcend the glittering facade of his lavish lifestyle.\n\n“Do you ever get tired of it all?” I asked. “The parties, the guests who barely know you, the endless pursuit of something just out of reach?”\n\nHe sighed, a sound almost lost amidst the distant music. “Sometimes. But then I remember why I do it. For her.”\n\nI understood immediately. Daisy. The name hung in the air between us, unspoken but palpable. Gatsby’s entire existence seemed to revolve around the hope of rekindling a love that time had tried to erode.\n\n“Do you think she’ll come tonight?” I ventured.\n\nHe looked toward the house, where the lights shone brightly against the night sky. “I hope so. I’ve been waiting for this moment for years.”\n\nAs we stood there, the party continued unabated, a symphony of laughter, music, and clinking glasses. Yet, amidst the revelry, there was an undercurrent of tension, a fragile hope that something extraordinary might happen.\n\nSuddenly, a figure appeared at the edge of the garden, her silhouette illuminated by the moonlight. Daisy. She moved gracefully toward us, her eyes sparkling with a mixture of surprise and affection.\n\n“Gatsby,” she whispered, her voice trembling slightly.\n\nHe took her hand gently, his expression softening. “Daisy, I’ve waited so long.”\n\nShe smiled, a radiant smile that seemed to light up the night. “I know.”\n\nIn that moment, the world around us seemed to pause, the past and present converging in a delicate dance of hope and longing. The dream that Gatsby had nurtured for so long was finally within reach, yet the shadows of reality loomed just beyond the horizon.\n\nAs the night deepened, I realized that beneath the glittering surface of wealth and glamour lay a profound truth about the human heart—the relentless pursuit of love, the desire to reclaim lost time, and the fragile nature of dreams.\n\nAnd so, the story of Gatsby and Daisy unfolded, a tale of passion and tragedy, set against the backdrop of a world forever changed by ambition and desire."

INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion alters the sequence of dialogue between Jordan and the narrator, particularly regarding the timing and content of her whispered comments and invitation.\n- There is a misattribution of who was in the library and for how long, as the completion changes the question and answer dynamic.\n- The completion introduces a slight inaccuracy in the way Gatsby dismisses the narrator’s apology, making it sound more casual and less nuanced than in the original.\n- The timing for the hydroplane outing is mentioned, but the context and phrasing differ from the original, losing some of the specificity and tone.\n- The completion summarizes the final moments rather than presenting the stepwise exchange of goodbyes, which affects the pacing and emotional resonance at the end."

They were both laughing softly, their faces illuminated by the warm glow of the chandelier above. Gatsby looked more relaxed than I had ever seen him, his usual intensity softened by the presence of Jordan. She seemed to have a calming effect on him, and for a moment, I caught a glimpse of the man behind the myth.\n\nJordan's eyes sparkled with mischief as she glanced at Gatsby, who returned her gaze with a mixture of admiration and affection. It was clear that their friendship was more than casual; there was an unspoken understanding between them, a shared secret that bound them together in this glittering world of wealth and illusion.\n\nAs they approached, Gatsby extended his hand to me, his grip firm yet gentle. \"I'm glad you could make it,\" he said, his voice carrying the charm that had captivated so many. \"Jordan and I were just discussing the upcoming polo match. You must come; it promises to be quite the event.\"\n\nI nodded, intrigued by the invitation and the promise of further glimpses into Gatsby's enigmatic life. Jordan smiled knowingly, her eyes flickering with a hint of challenge. \"It's not just about the sport,\" she said. \"It's about the people you meet and the stories you hear.\"\n\nThe evening stretched on, filled with laughter, music, and the clinking of glasses. Yet beneath the surface, I sensed the undercurrents of longing and regret that defined Gatsby's existence. In that moment, I understood that his grand parties were not merely displays of wealth but desperate attempts to recapture a past that had slipped through his fingers."

          "text_segment": "But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite over. Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene. In the ditch beside the road, right side up, but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupé which had left Gatsby’s drive not two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However, as they had left their cars blocking the road, a harsh, discordant din from those in the rear had been audible for some time, and added to the already violent confusion of the scene.\nA man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in the middle of the road, looking from the car to the tyre and from the tyre to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.\n“See!” he explained. “It went in the ditch.”\nThe fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and I recognized first the unusual quality of wonder, and then the man—it was the late patron of Gatsby’s library.\n“How’d it happen?”\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\n“I know nothing whatever about mechanics,” he said decisively.\n“But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?”\n“Don’t ask me,” said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole matter. “I know very little about driving—next to nothing. It happened, and that’s all I know.”\n“Well, if you’re a poor driver you oughtn’t to try driving at night.”\n“But I wasn’t even trying,” he explained indignantly, “I wasn’t even trying.”\nAn awed hush fell upon the bystanders.\n“Do you want to commit suicide?”\n“You’re lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even trying!”\n“You don’t understand,” explained the criminal. “I wasn’t driving. There’s another man in the car.”\nThe shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained “Ah-h-h!” as the door of the coupé swung slowly open. The crowd—it was now a crowd—stepped back involuntarily, and when the door had opened wide there was a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale, dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.\nBlinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant groaning of the horns, the apparition stood swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the duster.\n“Wha’s matter?” he inquired calmly. “Did we run outa gas?”\n“Look!”\nHalf a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel—he stared at it for a moment, and then looked upward as though he suspected that it had dropped from the sky.\n“It came off,” someone explained.\nHe nodded.\n“At first I din’ notice we’d stopped.”\nA pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders, he remarked in a determined voice:\n“Wonder’ff tell me where there’s a gas’line station?”\nAt least a dozen men, some of them a little better off than he was, explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond.\n“Back out,” he suggested after a moment. “Put her in reverse.”\n“But the wheel’s off!”\nHe hesitated.\n“No harm in trying,” he said.\nThe caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and cut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsby’s house, making the night fine as before, and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden. A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host, who stood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.",

            "prefix-probing": "But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite over. The sky was still painted with the soft hues of twilight, a gentle reminder that the day was slowly giving way to night. The air was thick with the scent of blooming flowers and the distant hum of the city, a symphony of life that never truly ceased. I paused for a moment, taking in the scene before me—the shimmering lights of the mansion, the laughter echoing from the garden, and the silhouettes of guests mingling under the stars.\n\nIt was in that moment that I realized the true essence of Gatsby's world—a world filled with dreams, illusions, and the relentless pursuit of something just out of reach. The grandeur of the party, the opulence of the surroundings, and the enigmatic figure of Gatsby himself all seemed to converge into a single, poignant tableau. Yet beneath the surface, there was an undercurrent of melancholy, a sense that this dazzling display was but a fleeting respite from the harsh realities that lay beyond.\n\nAs I continued down the steps, my thoughts drifted to the man who had orchestrated this entire spectacle. Gatsby, with his unwavering hope and boundless ambition, was a figure both admirable and tragic. His parties were legendary, drawing the elite and the curious alike, but they were also a means to an end—a way to capture the attention of a woman who had long since slipped through his grasp.\n\nThe night air grew cooler, and the stars began to twinkle more brightly overhead. I found myself drawn to the garden, where the soft glow of lanterns illuminated the paths and the gentle rustling of leaves provided a soothing backdrop. It was here, amidst the quiet beauty of the night, that the true nature of Gatsby's dream seemed most palpable. The garden was a sanctuary, a place where reality and fantasy intertwined, and where the past and present coexisted in delicate balance.\n\nI wandered along the winding paths, my footsteps muffled by the lush grass beneath me. The distant sound of a piano drifted through the air, its melody both haunting and hopeful. It was a reminder that, despite the extravagance and the spectacle, there was a deep yearning at the heart of it all—a longing for connection, for meaning, for something enduring.\n\nIn that moment, I understood that Gatsby's story was not just about wealth or status, but about the human desire to transcend one's circumstances and to grasp hold of a dream, no matter how elusive. His parties were more than mere celebrations; they were manifestations of hope, of the belief that the past could be reclaimed and the future rewritten.\n\nAs the night wore on, the guests began to depart, their laughter fading into the distance. The mansion grew quieter, the lights dimmed, and the garden returned to its serene state. I stood alone for a while, contemplating the complexities of the man and the world he had created. It was a world of contradictions—of beauty and sorrow, of illusion and reality, of dreams both fulfilled and shattered.\n\nEventually, I made my way back to the house, the echoes of the evening lingering in my mind. The night was far from over, but the magic of the moment had passed, leaving behind a sense of bittersweet reflection. Gatsby's dream, like the fading twilight, was a reminder of the delicate balance between hope and despair, and the enduring power of the human spirit to strive for something greater.\n\nAs I ascended the steps once more, I carried with me the memory of that evening—the laughter, the music, the shimmering lights, and the quiet moments of introspection. It was a night that encapsulated the essence of Gatsby's world, a world where dreams danced on the edge of reality, and where the pursuit of happiness was both a blessing and a curse.\n\nIn the end, I realized that the true story of Gatsby was not just about the man himself, but about the universal human experience—the desire to reach beyond oneself, to connect with others, and to find meaning in a world that often seemed indifferent. It was a story of hope and loss, of ambition and regret, and of the enduring quest for a better tomorrow.\n\nAnd so, as the stars continued to shine overhead and the night embraced the world in its quiet embrace, I walked away from the mansion with a heart full of contemplation and a mind filled with the echoes of a dream that would never truly fade."

          "text_segment": "Reading over what I have written so far, I see I have given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me. On the contrary, they were merely casual events in a crowded summer, and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs.\nMost of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their first names, and lunched with them in dark, crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction, so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow quietly away.\nI took dinner usually at the Yale Club—for some reason it was the gloomiest event of my day—and then I went upstairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour. There were generally a few rioters around, but they never came into the library, so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night was mellow, I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel, and over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station.\nI began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night, and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever know or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness. At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others—poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner—young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.\nAgain at eight o’clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were lined five deep with throbbing taxicabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside. Imagining that I, too, was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate excitement, I wished them well.\nFor a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I found her again. At first I was flattered to go places with her, because she was a golf champion, and everyone knew her name. Then it was something more. I wasn’t actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed something—most affectations conceal something eventually, even though they don’t in the beginning—and one day I found what it was. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about it—and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at Daisy’s. At her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapers—a suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round. The thing approached the proportions of a scandal—then died away. A caddy retracted his statement, and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.\nJordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest. She wasn’t able to endure being at a disadvantage and, given this unwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body.\nIt made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeply—I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on that same house-party that we had a curious conversation about driving a car. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one man’s coat.\n“You’re a rotten driver,” I protested. “Either you ought to be more careful, or you oughtn’t to drive at all.”\n“I am careful.”\n“No, you’re not.”\n“Well, other people are,” she said lightly.\n“What’s that got to do with it?”\n“They’ll keep out of my way,” she insisted. “It takes two to make an accident.”\n“Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.”\n“I hope I never will,” she answered. “I hate careless people. That’s why I like you.”\nHer grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved her. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home. I’d been writing letters once a week and signing them: “Love, Nick,” and all I could think of was how, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint moustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.\nEveryone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.",

But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home.\n\nI am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.",

            "prefix-probing": "Reading over what I have written so far, I see I have given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me. On the contrary, they were merely casual events in a crowded summer, and the rest of the time I was restless and unsatisfied, longing for something to happen. I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler, and I was looking for something, but I did not know what. I was part of that restless, searching generation, and I was caught up in the endless pursuit of pleasure and excitement that defined the Jazz Age.\n\nThe summer of 1922 was a time of change and upheaval, a time when the old values were being challenged and new ones were being forged. The world was recovering from the Great War, and people were eager to forget the horrors and embrace the new freedoms. The city was alive with music, laughter, and the clinking of glasses, and the nights were filled with the promise of adventure.\n\nIn the midst of this vibrant scene, I found myself drawn to the enigmatic figure of Jay Gatsby. He was a man of mystery and charm, a man who seemed to embody the spirit of the age. His parties were legendary, filled with the rich and famous, and his smile was as dazzling as the lights that illuminated his mansion. Yet beneath the surface, there was a sadness, a longing that no amount of wealth or glamour could satisfy.\n\nGatsby's story was one of hope and tragedy, a testament to the American Dream and its limitations. He had risen from humble beginnings to achieve great wealth, but his heart belonged to a woman from his past, a woman he could never truly have. His obsession with Daisy Buchanan was both his strength and his weakness, driving him to create a world of illusion and fantasy.\n\nAs I observed Gatsby and the people around him, I became acutely aware of the emptiness that lay beneath the glittering facade. The parties were extravagant, but the guests were often strangers to one another, connected only by their desire for pleasure. The relationships were shallow, and the pursuit of wealth and status overshadowed genuine human connection.\n\nDaisy herself was a symbol of this emptiness. Beautiful and charming, she was the object of Gatsby's dreams, but she was also trapped by her own desires and fears. Her voice was described as \"full of money,\" a haunting reminder of the materialism that defined her world. She was torn between the security of her marriage to Tom Buchanan and the passion that Gatsby represented.\n\nTom was a man of privilege and arrogance, embodying the old money class that looked down upon those like Gatsby who had earned their wealth. His infidelities and aggressive behavior revealed a deep insecurity masked by bravado. The clash between Tom and Gatsby was not just a personal rivalry but a reflection of the social tensions of the time.\n\nThe tragic culmination of these intertwined lives was inevitable. The confrontation between Tom and Gatsby over Daisy's affections exposed the fragility of their illusions. The accident that resulted in Myrtle Wilson's death was a turning point, shattering the veneer of glamour and revealing the consequences of reckless behavior.\n\nIn the aftermath, Gatsby's dream crumbled. His death was a lonely affair, attended by few, a stark contrast to the lavish parties he once hosted. It was a poignant reminder of the isolation that can accompany the pursuit of an unattainable ideal.\n\nReflecting on these events, I am struck by the complexity of human desires and the ways in which we construct narratives to make sense of our lives. The Great Gatsby is not just a story of love and loss but a critique of a society obsessed with wealth and status, a meditation on the elusive nature of the American Dream.\n\nAs I close this account, I am reminded of the green light at the end of Daisy's dock, a symbol of hope and longing that continues to beckon across the waters. It represents the future, the possibility of something better, even as it remains forever out of reach. In the end, we are all drawn to that light, chasing dreams that define us and shape our destinies."

          "text_segment": "On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages alongshore, the world and its mistress returned to Gatsby’s house and twinkled hilariously on his lawn.\n“He’s a bootlegger,” said the young ladies, moving somewhere between his cocktails and his flowers. “One time he killed a man who had found out that he was nephew to Von Hindenburg and second cousin to the devil. Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there crystal glass.”\nOnce I wrote down on the empty spaces of a timetable the names of those who came to Gatsby’s house that summer. It is an old timetable now, disintegrating at its folds, and headed “This schedule in effect July 5th, 1922.” But I can still read the grey names, and they will give you a better impression than my generalities of those who accepted Gatsby’s hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing whatever about him.\nFrom East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches, and a man named Bunsen, whom I knew at Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet, who was drowned last summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and the Willie Voltaires, and a whole clan named Blackbuck, who always gathered in a corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near. And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and Mr. Chrystie’s wife), and Edgar Beaver, whose hair, they say, turned cotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.\nClarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He came only once, in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the garden. From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O. R. P. Schraeders, and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia, and the Fishguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there three days before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive that Mrs. Ulysses Swett’s automobile ran over his right hand. The Dancies came, too, and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over sixty, and Maurice A. Flink, and the Hammerheads, and Beluga the tobacco importer, and Beluga’s girls.\nFrom West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Schoen and Gulick the State senator and Newton Orchid, who controlled Films Par Excellence, and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don S. Schwartz (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the movies in one way or another. And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G. Earl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his wife. Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B. (“Rot-Gut”) Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly—they came to gamble, and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was cleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably next day.\nA man named Klipspringer was there so often that he became known as “the boarder”—I doubt if he had any other home. Of theatrical people there were Gus Waize and Horace O’Donavan and Lester Myer and George Duckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New York were the Chromes and the Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry L. Palmetto, who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train in Times Square.\nBenny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite the same ones in physical person, but they were so identical one with another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before. I have forgotten their names—Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela, or Gloria or Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American capitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves to be.\nIn addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O’Brien came there at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer, who had his nose shot off in the war, and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag, his fiancée, and Ardita Fitz-Peters and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of the American Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip, with a man reputed to be her chauffeur, and a prince of something, whom we called Duke, and whose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten.\nAll these people came to Gatsby’s house in the summer.",

The bar, where the lights were brightest and the music loudest, was crowded with a wild and careless throng. The guests came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars. At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough colored lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsby’s enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors-d’oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another.\n\nBy seven o’clock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair, but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos, and low and high drums. The last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors and hair shorn in strange new ways and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The bar is in full swing and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other’s names.\n\nThe groups change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp, joyous moment the center of a group and then, excited with triumph, glide on through the sea of faces and voices and color under the constantly changing light.\n\nSuddenly one of these gypsies in trembling opal, the golden girl who had been with Jordan Baker and who had that strange quality of complete self-sufficiency, began to ask me questions in a low, thrilling voice. “Who is this Gatsby anyhow?” demanded a stout, middle-aged woman who had been talking with a man at the table. “Some big bootlegger?”\n\n“Where’d you hear that?” I inquired.\n\n“Didn’t you know? I’m told he’s a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm’s. That’s where all his money comes from.”\n\n“Really?” I said, and I tried to look interested.\n\n“Do you know he’s killed a man?”\n\n“Why, no.”\n\n“Did you hear about the German spy?”\n\n“Who told you that?”\n\n“Somebody said he was a nephew or a cousin of the devil.”\n\nI didn’t know what to say, except that it was a very polite way of saying that he was a bootlegger. I was looking at an elegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced himself I'd got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care.\n\nThis is an unusual party for me. I haven’t been to many, but I’ve never seen such a collection of people before. I remember that I had made a list of the names of the people who came to Gatsby’s parties that summer, and I still have it.

At high tide in the afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam. On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants, including an extra gardener, toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.\n\nEvery Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New York—every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves.\n\nThere was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler’s thumb.\n\nAt least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough colored lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsby’s enormous garden.\n\nOn buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors-d’oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another.\n\nBy seven o’clock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair, but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos, and low and high drums.\n\nThe last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors and hair shorn in strange new ways and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside until the air is alive with chatter and laughter and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other’s names.\n\nThe lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera voices of a dozen girls are singing along with the horns.\n\nLaughter is easier, minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word.\n\nThe groups change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp, joyous moment the center of a group and then, excited with triumph, glide on through the sea of faces and voices and color under the constantly changing light.\n\nSuddenly one of these gypsies, in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail out of the air, dumps it down for courage and moving her hands like Frisco dances out alone on the canvas platform.\n\nA momentary hush; the orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her and there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda Gray’s understudy from the Follies.\n\nThe party has begun.\n\nI believe that on Sunday afternoon, when I came back from a ride, I was one of the few guests who had actually been invited. People were not invited—they went there.\n\nThey got into automobiles which bore them out to Long Island, and somehow they ended up at Gatsby’s door.\n\nOnce there they were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby, and after that they conducted themselves according to the rules of behavior associated with amusement parks.\n\nSometimes they came and went without having met Gatsby at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket of admission.\n\nI was looking at an elegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced himself as Jay Gatsby, I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care.\n\nAlmost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler hurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him on the wire.\n\nThe young man turned away with a small nod, as if he had expected that, and we were alone.\n\nI was looking at an elegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd.

          "text_segment": "At nine o’clock, one morning late in July, Gatsby’s gorgeous car lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody from its three-noted horn.\nIt was the first time he had called on me, though I had gone to two of his parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation, made frequent use of his beach.\n“Good morning, old sport. You’re having lunch with me today and I thought we’d ride up together.”\nHe was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American—that comes, I suppose, with the absence of lifting work in youth and, even more, with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games. This quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.\nHe saw me looking with admiration at his car.\n“It’s pretty, isn’t it, old sport?” He jumped off to give me a better view. “Haven’t you ever seen it before?”\nI’d seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream colour, bright with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and toolboxes, and terraced with a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory, we started to town.\nI had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and found, to my disappointment, that he had little to say. So my first impression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate roadhouse next door.\nAnd then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn’t reached West Egg village before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-coloured suit.\n“Look here, old sport,” he broke out surprisingly, “what’s your opinion of me, anyhow?”\nA little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that question deserves.\n“Well, I’m going to tell you something about my life,” he interrupted. “I don’t want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear.”\nSo he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavoured conversation in his halls.\n“I’ll tell you God’s truth.” His right hand suddenly ordered divine retribution to stand by. “I am the son of some wealthy people in the Middle West—all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford, because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It is a family tradition.”\nHe looked at me sideways—and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was lying. He hurried the phrase “educated at Oxford,” or swallowed it, or choked on it, as though it had bothered him before. And with this doubt, his whole statement fell to pieces, and I wondered if there wasn’t something a little sinister about him, after all.\n“What part of the Middle West?” I inquired casually.\n“San Francisco.”\n“I see.”\n“My family all died and I came into a good deal of money.”\nHis voice was solemn, as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan still haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg, but a glance at him convinced me otherwise.\n“After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of Europe—Paris, Venice, Rome—collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago.”\nWith an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The very phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a turbaned “character” leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne.\n“Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief, and I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a commission as first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest I took the remains of my machine-gun battalion so far forward that there was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn’t advance. We stayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty men with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of dead. I was promoted to be a major, and every Allied government gave me a decoration—even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea!”\nLittle Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded at them—with his smile. The smile comprehended Montenegro’s troubled history and sympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people. It appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had elicited this tribute from Montenegro’s warm little heart. My incredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming hastily through a dozen magazines.\nHe reached in his pocket, and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon, fell into my palm.\n“That’s the one from Montenegro.”\nTo my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look. “Orderi di Danilo,” ran the circular legend, “Montenegro, Nicolas Rex.”\n“Turn it.”\n“Major Jay Gatsby,” I read, “For Valour Extraordinary.”\n“Here’s another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Oxford days. It was taken in Trinity Quad—the man on my left is now the Earl of Doncaster.”\nIt was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an archway through which were visible a host of spires. There was Gatsby, looking a little, not much, younger—with a cricket bat in his hand.",

The motor was running high and warm. The front door opened nervously, and Gatsby, in a white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold-colored tie, hurried in. He was pale, and there was a hint of panic in his eyes. \"It's about time you got here,\" he said, glancing at his watch. \"I’ve been waiting for you.\" I followed him into the house, where the air was thick with the scent of summer flowers and the faint hum of jazz music from the garden. The windows were open, and the curtains fluttered in the breeze. Outside, the party was already in full swing, with guests laughing and dancing under strings of lights. Gatsby led me to the veranda, where a group of people were gathered, their faces glowing in the soft light. \"This is my friend, Nick Carraway,\" Gatsby said, introducing me to the crowd. I nodded and smiled, feeling both out of place and intrigued by the opulence surrounding me. As the evening wore on, I found myself drawn into conversations about wealth, ambition, and the elusive nature of happiness. Gatsby spoke with a quiet intensity, his eyes always searching, as if looking for something just beyond reach. Later, as the party began to wind down, Gatsby and I sat on the steps, watching the stars emerge in the night sky. \"You know,\" he said softly, \"I’ve been waiting for this moment for a long time. For the chance to start over, to make things right.\" I looked at him, sensing the weight of his words. \"What is it you want, Gatsby?\" He smiled wistfully. \"I want to be with her again. To recapture the past.\" The night was still, and the world seemed to hold its breath. In that moment, I understood the depth of Gatsby’s longing, and the tragedy that lay beneath his dazzling facade."

I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace on the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with their crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart.\n“I’m going to make a big request of you today,” he said, pocketing his souvenirs with satisfaction, “so I thought you ought to know something about me. I didn’t want you to think I was just some nobody. You see, I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad things that happened to me.” He hesitated. “You’ll hear about it this afternoon.”\n“At lunch?”\n“No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you’re taking Miss Baker to tea.”\n“Do you mean you’re in love with Miss Baker?”\n“No, old sport, I’m not. But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak to you about this matter.”\nI hadn’t the faintest idea what “this matter” was, but I was more annoyed than interested. I hadn’t asked Jordan to tea in order to discuss Mr. Jay Gatsby. I was sure the request would be something utterly fantastic, and for a moment I was sorry I’d ever set foot upon his overpopulated lawn.\nHe wouldn’t say another word. His correctness grew on him as we neared the city. We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of red-belted oceangoing ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark, undeserted saloons of the faded-gilt nineteen-hundreds. Then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a glimpse of Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting vitality as we went by.\nWith fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half Astoria—only half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevated I heard the familiar “jug-jug-spat!” of a motorcycle, and a frantic policeman rode alongside.\n“All right, old sport,” called Gatsby. We slowed down. Taking a white card from his wallet, he waved it before the man’s eyes.\n“Right you are,” agreed the policeman, tipping his cap. “Know you next time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse me!”\n“What was that?” I inquired. “The picture of Oxford?”\n“I was able to do the commissioner a favour once, and he sends me a Christmas card every year.”\nOver the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of nonolfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.\nA dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two carriages with drawn blinds, and by more cheerful carriages for friends. The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short upper lips of southeastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of Gatsby’s splendid car was included in their sombre holiday. As we crossed Blackwell’s Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white chauffeur, in which sat three modish negroes, two bucks and a girl. I laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in haughty rivalry.\n“Anything can happen now that we’ve slid over this bridge,” I thought; “anything at all…”\nEven Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.",

            "prefix-probing": "Then it was all true. I had suspected as much before, but now the reality of it struck me with a force that was almost unbearable. The stories, the rumors, the whispered conversations—they all converged into a single, undeniable truth. Gatsby's world, with its glittering parties and endless charm, was not just a façade; it was a carefully constructed illusion, a desperate attempt to recapture a past that had long since slipped away.\n\nI remembered the first time I met Gatsby, standing on the lawn of his magnificent mansion, watching the green light across the bay. It seemed so distant, so unattainable, yet it was the beacon that guided his every action. His relentless pursuit of Daisy, the woman who embodied his dreams and desires, was both tragic and beautiful. He believed in the possibility of recreating the past, of bending time to his will, but the world was not so forgiving.\n\nAs I delved deeper into Gatsby's life, I saw the cracks beneath the surface. The lavish parties, the endless stream of guests, the opulence—they were all part of a grand performance. Gatsby was a man caught between two worlds: the one he came from and the one he aspired to join. His wealth was new, his manners sometimes awkward, but his heart was genuine. He was not the villain that some painted him to be, nor was he the flawless hero others imagined. He was simply a man, flawed and hopeful.\n\nThe tragedy of Gatsby's story lay in his unwavering faith in the American Dream, a dream that promised happiness and success to anyone willing to chase it. But the dream was elusive, often cruel, and sometimes impossible to attain. Gatsby's downfall was not just the result of his own mistakes but also the harsh realities of a society that valued status and appearance over sincerity and love.\n\nIn the end, Gatsby's death was a poignant reminder of the cost of dreams. He died alone, misunderstood, and betrayed by those he trusted. The world moved on, indifferent to his fate, and the green light across the bay continued to shine, a symbol of hope and longing for generations to come.\n\nReflecting on all this, I realized that Gatsby's story was not just about one man but about the human condition itself. We all chase dreams, cling to memories, and hope for a better tomorrow. Sometimes, the pursuit is noble; other times, it leads to heartbreak. But in the end, it is our dreams that define us, that give our lives meaning and purpose.\n\nAs I left Gatsby's mansion for the last time, I felt a profound sense of loss but also a renewed understanding of the complexities of life. The world was not black and white but filled with shades of gray, where truth and illusion intertwined. Gatsby's legacy was a testament to the enduring power of hope, the fragility of dreams, and the eternal quest for love and acceptance."

Blinking away the brightness of the street outside, my eyes picked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.\n“Mr. Carraway, this is my friend Mr. Wolfshiem.”\nA small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half-darkness.\n“—So I took one look at him,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, shaking my hand earnestly, “and what do you think I did?”\n“What?” I inquired politely.\nBut evidently he was not addressing me, for he dropped my hand and covered Gatsby with his expressive nose.\n“I handed the money to Katspaugh and I said: ‘All right, Katspaugh, don’t pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.’ He shut it then and there.”\nGatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the restaurant, whereupon Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was starting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction.\n“Highballs?” asked the head waiter.\n“This is a nice restaurant here,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, looking at the presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. “But I like across the street better!”\n“Yes, highballs,” agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfshiem: “It’s too hot over there.”\n“Hot and small—yes,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “but full of memories.”\n“What place is that?” I asked.\n“The old Metropole.”\n“The old Metropole,” brooded Mr. Wolfshiem gloomily. “Filled with faces dead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I can’t forget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. It was six of us at the table, and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening. When it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a funny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside. ‘All right,’ says Rosy, and begins to get up, and I pulled him down in his chair.\n“ ‘Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don’t you, so help me, move outside this room.’\n“It was four o’clock in the morning then, and if we’d of raised the blinds we’d of seen daylight.”\n“Did he go?” I asked innocently.\n“Sure he went.” Mr. Wolfshiem’s nose flashed at me indignantly. “He turned around in the door and says: ‘Don’t let that waiter take away my coffee!’ Then he went out on the sidewalk, and they shot him three times in his full belly and drove away.”\n“Four of them were electrocuted,” I said, remembering.\n“Five, with Becker.” His nostrils turned to me in an interested way. “I understand you’re looking for a business gonnegtion.”\nThe juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered for me:\n“Oh, no,” he exclaimed, “this isn’t the man.”\n“No?” Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed.\n“This is just a friend. I told you we’d talk about that some other time.”\n“I beg your pardon,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “I had a wrong man.”\nA succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting the more sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with ferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around the room—he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly behind. I think that, except for my presence, he would have taken one short glance beneath our own table.",

            "prefix-probing": "Roaring noon. The sun blazed down upon the sprawling lawns of Gatsby's mansion, casting sharp shadows that danced with the gentle sway of the summer breeze. The air was thick with the scent of blooming gardenias and freshly cut grass, mingling with the faint aroma of champagne and cigars that lingered from the previous night's revelry. Guests lounged by the shimmering pool, their laughter and chatter weaving a tapestry of carefree indulgence that seemed to suspend time itself.\n\nJay Gatsby stood at the edge of the terrace, his gaze fixed on the distant green light across the bay. It flickered faintly, a beacon of hope and longing that had become the symbol of his relentless pursuit. His eyes, though bright with anticipation, held a trace of melancholy—a silent acknowledgment of the past that clung to him like a shadow.\n\nDaisy Buchanan, radiant in a flowing white dress that caught the sunlight, approached him with a smile that was both inviting and elusive. Their reunion was a delicate dance of words and glances, each moment charged with the weight of unspoken dreams and the fragile promise of what might be. The world around them seemed to fade, leaving only the two figures suspended in a bubble of possibility.\n\nThe afternoon unfolded with a languid grace, punctuated by the soft melodies of a jazz band tucked away beneath the sprawling oaks. The music wove through the air, a soundtrack to the unfolding drama of love, ambition, and the relentless passage of time. Guests drifted in and out of conversations, their faces masks of pleasure and pretense, each harboring their own secrets beneath the glittering surface.\n\nTom Buchanan, with his imposing presence and sharp gaze, observed the scene with a mixture of suspicion and disdain. His world was one of inherited privilege and rigid expectations, a stark contrast to Gatsby's self-made grandeur and the intoxicating allure of reinvention. The tension between them was palpable, a silent battle waged beneath the veneer of polite society.\n\nAs the sun dipped lower, casting a golden glow over the estate, the evening promised a crescendo of revelations and reckonings. The delicate balance of dreams and reality teetered on the edge, poised to shatter or transform under the weight of truth. In the heart of it all, Gatsby held fast to his vision, the green light a constant reminder of the future he yearned to claim.\n\nThe night would bring with it the unraveling of facades and the stark illumination of desires long buried. Yet, amidst the turmoil, there remained a flicker of hope—a testament to the enduring human spirit and the eternal quest for meaning beyond the confines of circumstance. In the world of \"The Great Gatsby,\" the roaring noon was but a prelude to the symphony of passion, loss, and the elusive promise of the American Dream."

Why has it all got to come through Miss Baker?”\n“Oh, it’s nothing underhand,” he assured me. “Miss Baker’s a great sportswoman, you know, and she’d never do anything that wasn’t all right.”\nSuddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up, and hurried from the room, leaving me with Mr. Wolfshiem at the table.\n“He has to telephone,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, following him with his eyes. “Fine fellow, isn’t he? Handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman.”\n“Yes.”\n“He’s an Oggsford man.”\n“Oh!”\n“He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?”\n“I’ve heard of it.”\n“It’s one of the most famous colleges in the world.”\n“Have you known Gatsby for a long time?” I inquired.\n“Several years,” he answered in a gratified way. “I made the pleasure of his acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a man of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to myself: ‘There’s the kind of man you’d like to take home and introduce to your mother and sister.’ ” He paused. “I see you’re looking at my cuff buttons.”\nI hadn’t been looking at them, but I did now. They were composed of oddly familiar pieces of ivory.\n“Finest specimens of human molars,” he informed me.\n“Well!” I inspected them. “That’s a very interesting idea.”\n“Yeah.” He flipped his sleeves up under his coat. “Yeah, Gatsby’s very careful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend’s wife.”\nWhen the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat down Mr. Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet.\n“I have enjoyed my lunch,” he said, “and I’m going to run off from you two young men before I outstay my welcome.”\n“Don’t hurry Meyer,” said Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfshiem raised his hand in a sort of benediction.\n“You’re very polite, but I belong to another generation,” he announced solemnly. “You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and your—” He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his hand. “As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won’t impose myself on you any longer.”\nAs he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling. I wondered if I had said anything to offend him.\n“He becomes very sentimental sometimes,” explained Gatsby. “This is one of his sentimental days. He’s quite a character around New York—a denizen of Broadway.”\n“Who is he, anyhow, an actor?”\n“No.”\n“A dentist?”\n“Meyer Wolfshiem? No, he’s a gambler.” Gatsby hesitated, then added, coolly: “He’s the man who fixed the World’s Series back in 1919.”\n“Fixed the World’s Series?” I repeated.\nThe idea staggered me. I remembered, of course, that the World’s Series had been fixed in 1919, but if I had thought of it at all I would have thought of it as a thing that merely happened, the end of some inevitable chain.

            "prefix-probing": "“Not at all,” I assured him quickly, though I was still a bit unsettled by his intensity. Gatsby’s smile was reassuring, and I found myself relaxing under his gaze. We were sitting in his lavishly decorated living room, the afternoon sun casting a golden glow over the opulent furnishings. The air was thick with the scent of fresh flowers and the faint aroma of expensive cigars.\n\nHe continued, “You see, I’ve been looking forward to our meeting all week. I wanted everything to be perfect, and I suppose I got a little carried away.”\n\nI nodded, understanding that Gatsby’s eagerness stemmed from something deeper than mere social pleasantries. There was a yearning in his eyes, a hope that seemed almost palpable.\n\n“Tell me,” he said, leaning back into his plush armchair, “have you ever known a love so profound that it shapes every decision you make?”\n\nI considered his question carefully. “I can’t say I have,” I replied honestly. “But I imagine it must be both exhilarating and terrifying.”\n\nGatsby smiled wistfully. “It is. And sometimes, it makes a man do things he never thought possible.”\n\nOur conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a butler, who announced that dinner was served. Gatsby rose gracefully and led me to the dining room, where a table was set with fine china and crystal glasses. The meal was exquisite, each course more delightful than the last.\n\nAs we ate, Gatsby spoke of his past, weaving tales of adventure and ambition. He spoke of his humble beginnings and the relentless pursuit of a dream that seemed just out of reach. His voice was filled with passion, and I found myself drawn into his narrative.\n\nAfter dinner, we moved to the terrace, where the night sky was dotted with stars. The city lights shimmered in the distance, casting a magical glow over the scene.\n\n“Do you believe in destiny, old sport?” Gatsby asked, his eyes reflecting the starlight.\n\n“I suppose I do,” I answered. “There are moments in life that feel predestined, as if the universe is guiding us.”\n\nGatsby nodded thoughtfully. “I’ve always believed that. That some things are meant to be, no matter the obstacles.”\n\nWe sat in comfortable silence for a while, the sounds of the city mingling with the gentle rustling of the leaves. It was a moment of peace, a brief respite from the complexities of our lives.\n\nAs the evening wore on, Gatsby’s demeanor shifted. He became more introspective, his gaze distant.\n\n“Tell me, Nick,” he said softly, “have you ever lost something so precious that it changed you forever?”\n\nI hesitated before answering. “Yes, I have. And I imagine you have too.”\n\nHe smiled sadly. “Indeed. But it’s the hope of reclaiming what was lost that keeps us moving forward.”\n\nOur conversation lingered in my mind long after I left Gatsby’s mansion that night. There was something profoundly human in his vulnerability, a reminder that beneath the glittering facade was a man driven by love, loss, and an unyielding hope for the future."

          "text_segment": "One October day in nineteen-seventeen—\n(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)\n—I was walking along from one place to another, half on the sidewalks and half on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on shoes from England with rubber knobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground. I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind, and whenever this happened the red, white, and blue banners in front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tut-tut-tut-tut, in a disapproving way.\nThe largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to Daisy Fay’s house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She dressed in white, and had a little white roadster, and all day long the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night. “Anyways, for an hour!”\nWhen I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside the kerb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen before. They were so engrossed in each other that she didn’t see me until I was five feet away.\n“Hello, Jordan,” she called unexpectedly. “Please come here.”\nI was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older girls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross to make bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she couldn’t come that day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since. His name was Jay Gatsby, and I didn’t lay eyes on him again for over four years—even after I’d met him on Long Island I didn’t realize it was the same man.\nThat was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a few beaux myself, and I began to play in tournaments, so I didn’t see Daisy very often. She went with a slightly older crowd—when she went with anyone at all. Wild rumours were circulating about her—how her mother had found her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas. She was effectually prevented, but she wasn’t on speaking terms with her family for several weeks. After that she didn’t play around with the soldiers any more, but only with a few flat-footed, shortsighted young men in town, who couldn’t get into the army at all.\nBy the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a début after the armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a man from New Orleans. In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago, with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He came down with a hundred people in four private cars, and hired a whole floor of the Muhlbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\nI was a bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in her flowered dress—and as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottle of Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.\n“ ’Gratulate me,” she muttered. “Never had a drink before, but oh how I do enjoy it.”\n“What’s the matter, Daisy?”\nI was scared, I can tell you; I’d never seen a girl like that before.\n“Here, dearies.” She groped around in a wastebasket she had with her on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls. “Take ’em downstairs and give ’em back to whoever they belong to. Tell ’em all Daisy’s change’ her mine. Say: ‘Daisy’s change’ her mine!’ ”\nShe began to cry—she cried and cried. I rushed out and found her mother’s maid, and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath. She wouldn’t let go of the letter. She took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up in a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the soap-dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.\nBut she didn’t say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress, and half an hour later, when we walked out of the room, the pearls were around her neck and the incident was over. Next day at five o’clock she married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver, and started off on a three months’ trip to the South Seas.",

            "prefix-probing": "One October day in nineteen-seventeen—when the war was over and the world was just beginning to forget the horrors it had endured—Nick Carraway arrived in New York to make his fortune in the bond business. The city was alive with a restless energy, a feverish pulse that seemed to quicken with every passing moment. The air was thick with the scent of ambition and the promise of new beginnings, yet beneath the glittering surface lay a world of secrets and shadows.\n\nNick, a young man from the Midwest, had come East with a sense of purpose and a desire to find his place among the glittering elite. He rented a modest house in West Egg, a less fashionable but rapidly developing area on Long Island, where the newly rich built their sprawling mansions. Across the bay lay East Egg, home to the old money aristocracy, whose stately homes and refined manners set them apart from the nouveau riche.\n\nOne evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the water, Nick found himself invited to a lavish party at the mansion of his mysterious neighbor, Jay Gatsby. Gatsby was a man of great wealth and even greater mystery, known for his extravagant soirées that drew the city's most glamorous and influential figures. The parties were legendary, filled with music, laughter, and the clinking of champagne glasses, yet Gatsby himself remained an enigma, rarely seen amidst the revelry.\n\nAt the party, Nick was introduced to a dazzling array of characters: the charming and cynical Jordan Baker, a professional golfer with a reputation for bending the rules; Tom Buchanan, a wealthy and imposing man whose arrogance was matched only by his sense of entitlement; and Daisy Buchanan, Tom's wife, whose beauty and charm captivated all who met her. Daisy's voice was like music, a melody that lingered long after she had spoken.\n\nAs the night wore on, Nick learned more about Gatsby's past and his unyielding love for Daisy. Gatsby had built his fortune and his lavish lifestyle in the hope of winning her back, believing that wealth and status could bridge the chasm of time and circumstance that separated them. Yet, beneath Gatsby's polished exterior lay a man haunted by his dreams and the impossibility of recapturing the past.\n\nThe summer unfolded with a series of encounters and revelations that exposed the fragility of the American Dream and the moral decay lurking beneath the glittering surface of wealth and privilege. Nick witnessed the reckless abandon of the rich, their careless disregard for the consequences of their actions, and the tragic consequences that ensued.\n\nIn the end, Gatsby's dream was shattered, and the illusions that had sustained him crumbled into dust. Nick, disillusioned by the world he had glimpsed, returned to the Midwest, carrying with him the memories of a summer that had changed him forever—a summer of hope, heartbreak, and the relentless pursuit of a dream that could never be realized."

She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour, rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable delight. It was touching to see them together—it made you laugh in a hushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A week after I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night, and ripped a front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got into the papers, too, because her arm was broken—she was one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.\nThe next April Daisy had her little girl, and they went to France for a year. I saw them one spring in Cannes, and later in Deauville, and then they came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in Chicago, as you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation. Perhaps because she doesn’t drink. It’s a great advantage not to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue and, moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they don’t see or care. Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour at all—and yet there’s something in that voice of hers…\nWell, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first time in years. It was when I asked you—do you remember?—if you knew Gatsby in West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me up, and said: “What Gatsby?” and when I described him—I was half asleep—she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know.

They were sitting on the porch of the hotel, and she was leaning toward him, her eyes bright and full of excitement. Tom was talking, but she hardly seemed to hear him; she was too busy watching him, as if he were the only thing in the world that mattered. It was a strange sight, considering all the stories I’d heard about their marriage. But in that moment, they looked like the perfect couple, wrapped up in their own little world.\n\nAs the days passed, I noticed the tension beneath the surface. There were moments when Tom’s voice would harden, and Daisy’s smile would falter. The glamour and charm couldn’t completely mask the cracks in their relationship. I remembered the rumors about Tom’s affairs, and the way Daisy’s laughter sometimes seemed forced. Yet, despite it all, they clung to each other, as if afraid to let go.\n\nOne evening, we all went to a party at Gatsby’s mansion. The place was alive with music and laughter, a dazzling display of wealth and extravagance. Daisy seemed enchanted by the spectacle, her eyes shining with wonder. Gatsby was there too, watching her with a look that was both hopeful and desperate. It was clear that his feelings for her ran deep, and that the past they shared was not so easily forgotten.\n\nThroughout the night, I observed the complex dance between these three people—Tom, Daisy, and Gatsby. Each was caught in their own web of desire, jealousy, and regret. The glittering facade of their lives concealed a profound sadness, a yearning for something that could never be fully attained. It was a poignant reminder of the illusions we create, and the cost of chasing dreams that may never come true."

Then he began asking people casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found. It was that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heard the elaborate way he worked up to it. Of course, I immediately suggested a luncheon in New York—and I thought he’d go mad:\n“ ‘I don’t want to do anything out of the way!’ he kept saying. ‘I want to see her right next door.’\n“When I said you were a particular friend of Tom’s, he started to abandon the whole idea.

Nick glanced over at Jordan, who sat poised and elegant, her eyes reflecting the fading light. The conversation had lulled, leaving a comfortable silence between them as the carriage rolled along the winding paths of the park.\n\nThe trees arched overhead, their leaves whispering secrets in the gentle wind. The city skyline loomed beyond the park's edge, a jagged silhouette against the twilight sky. It was a moment suspended in time, a brief respite from the chaos and glitter of the day.\n\nJordan broke the silence, her voice soft and contemplative. \"It's strange,\" she mused, \"how people can live so close yet remain worlds apart.\"\n\nNick nodded, understanding the sentiment. The world they inhabited was one of facades and hidden truths, where appearances often masked deeper realities. He thought of Gatsby, with his enigmatic smile and relentless hope, and wondered what lay beneath the surface of his carefully constructed life.\n\nAs the carriage continued its leisurely pace, the city lights began to twinkle, casting a golden glow over the park's pathways. Couples strolled hand in hand, their laughter mingling with the distant strains of music from a nearby hotel. The night was alive with possibility, yet tinged with an undercurrent of melancholy.\n\nJordan leaned back, her gaze distant. \"Sometimes,\" she said, \"I feel like we're all just actors on a stage, playing parts written by others.\"\n\nNick considered her words, reflecting on the roles they each played in this grand performance. The pursuit of wealth, status, and love often led to deception and disillusionment. Yet, amidst the artifice, there remained a yearning for authenticity and connection.\n\nThe carriage slowed as they approached the edge of the park, the city's pulse growing stronger with each passing moment. Nick felt a mixture of anticipation and apprehension, aware that the night held secrets yet to be revealed. As they stepped out into the bustling streets, the world of The Great Gatsby unfolded anew, shimmering with both promise and peril."

          "text_segment": "When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that my house was on fire. Two o’clock and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light, which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a corner, I saw that it was Gatsby’s house, lit from tower to cellar.\nAt first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved itself into “hide-and-go-seek” or “sardines-in-the-box” with all the house thrown open to the game. But there wasn’t a sound. Only wind in the trees, which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned away I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.\n“Your place looks like the World’s Fair,” I said.\n“Does it?” He turned his eyes toward it absently. “I have been glancing into some of the rooms. Let’s go to Coney Island, old sport. In my car.”\n“It’s too late.”\n“Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven’t made use of it all summer.”\n“I’ve got to go to bed.”\n“All right.”\nHe waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.\n“I talked with Miss Baker,” I said after a moment. “I’m going to call up Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea.”\n“Oh, that’s all right,” he said carelessly. “I don’t want to put you to any trouble.”\n“What day would suit you?”\n“What day would suit you?” he corrected me quickly. “I don’t want to put you to any trouble, you see.”\n“How about the day after tomorrow?”\nHe considered for a moment. Then, with reluctance: “I want to get the grass cut,” he said.\nWe both looked down at the grass—there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began. I suspected that he meant my grass.\n“There’s another little thing,” he said uncertainly, and hesitated.\n“Would you rather put it off for a few days?” I asked.\n“Oh, it isn’t about that. At least—” He fumbled with a series of beginnings. “Why, I thought—why, look here, old sport, you don’t make much money, do you?”\n“Not very much.”\nThis seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently.\n“I thought you didn’t, if you’ll pardon my—you see, I carry on a little business on the side, a sort of side line, you understand. And I thought that if you don’t make very much—You’re selling bonds, aren’t you, old sport?”\n“Trying to.”\n“Well, this would interest you. It wouldn’t take up much of your time and you might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing.”\nI realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might have been one of the crises of my life. But, because the offer was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no choice except to cut him off there.\n“I’ve got my hands full,” I said. “I’m much obliged but I couldn’t take on any more work.”\n“You wouldn’t have to do any business with Wolfshiem.” Evidently he thought that I was shying away from the “gonnegtion” mentioned at lunch, but I assured him he was wrong. He waited a moment longer, hoping I’d begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he went unwillingly home.\nThe evening had made me lightheaded and happy; I think I walked into a deep sleep as I entered my front door. So I don’t know whether or not Gatsby went to Coney Island, or for how many hours he “glanced into rooms” while his house blazed gaudily on.",

The whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light, glowing like a furnace, and the air was alive with the sound of music and laughter. I could see the flicker of flames from the bonfire Gatsby had built on the lawn, and the crowd of guests moving like shadows in the golden glow. It was one of those rare nights when the world seemed to hold its breath, and the usual humdrum of life was replaced by something electric and alive.\n\nI stepped out of my car and made my way up the path, the gravel crunching underfoot. The house was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a mansion of white palaces, with a tower on one side, and a marble swimming pool that gleamed under the moonlight. The windows were lit up, and I could hear the strains of a jazz band playing somewhere inside. The air was thick with the scent of flowers and the faint tang of champagne.\n\nAs I entered the grand hall, I was greeted by a sea of faces—some familiar, many not. There were men in tuxedos and women in shimmering gowns, their laughter ringing out over the music. The atmosphere was one of carefree indulgence, a world apart from the quiet, orderly life I was used to. Gatsby himself was there, standing near the center of the room, his smile radiant and his eyes shining with a kind of feverish excitement.\n\nHe caught sight of me and beckoned me over. \"Nick! I'm glad you came,\" he said, his voice warm and inviting. \"I was hoping you'd make it tonight.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling a mixture of curiosity and unease. \"It's quite a party,\" I said, glancing around.\n\nGatsby laughed. \"Yes, I like to keep things lively. It's the only way to forget, sometimes.\"\n\nWe moved through the crowd, and I noticed the way people gravitated toward Gatsby, drawn by his charisma and the aura of mystery that surrounded him. There was a sense that he was both the host and the star of the show, a man who had built this world from nothing and now ruled it with a gentle but unyielding hand.\n\nAs the night wore on, I found myself wandering out onto the terrace, where the cool night air was a welcome relief from the heat inside. The stars were bright overhead, and the sound of the waves crashing against the shore was a soothing counterpoint to the music. I spotted Jordan Baker nearby, leaning against the railing and looking out at the water.\n\n\"Enjoying the party?\" I asked.\n\nShe smiled, a hint of mischief in her eyes. \"It's always an adventure here. You never know who you'll meet or what will happen.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling the truth of her words. There was something intoxicating about the place, a sense that anything was possible, but also a lurking danger beneath the surface.\n\nSuddenly, Gatsby appeared beside us, his expression serious. \"Nick, I want you to meet someone,\" he said, taking my arm and leading me back inside.\n\nWe made our way through the crowd to a quiet corner, where a woman stood waiting. She was beautiful, with dark hair and eyes that sparkled with intelligence and warmth. Gatsby introduced her as Daisy Buchanan.\n\nI shook her hand, feeling a strange mixture of admiration and sadness. There was something fragile about her, as if she were caught between the glittering world of the party and a deeper, more complicated reality.\n\nAs the night deepened, I found myself reflecting on the contradictions of Gatsby's world—the glamour and the loneliness, the hope and the despair. It was a world built on dreams, but also on illusions, and I wondered how long it could last before it all came crashing down.\n\nWhen I finally left the party and drove back to my own house, the streets were quiet and empty. The glow of the mansion faded behind me, and I was left alone with my thoughts, haunted by the image of Gatsby standing there, reaching out toward something just beyond his grasp."

At eleven o’clock a man in a raincoat, dragging a lawn-mower, tapped at my front door and said that Mr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass. This reminded me that I had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back, so I drove into West Egg Village to search for her among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buy some cups and lemons and flowers.\nThe flowers were unnecessary, for at two o’clock a greenhouse arrived from Gatsby’s, with innumerable receptacles to contain it. An hour later the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold-coloured tie, hurried in. He was pale, and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes.\n“Is everything all right?” he asked immediately.\n“The grass looks fine, if that’s what you mean.”\n“What grass?” he inquired blankly. “Oh, the grass in the yard.” He looked out the window at it, but, judging from his expression, I don’t believe he saw a thing.\n“Looks very good,” he remarked vaguely. “One of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four. I think it was The Journal. Have you got everything you need in the shape of—of tea?”\nI took him into the pantry, where he looked a little reproachfully at the Finn. Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen shop.\n“Will they do?” I asked.\n“Of course, of course! They’re fine!” and he added hollowly, “… old sport.”\nThe rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist, through which occasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyes through a copy of Clay’s Economics, starting at the Finnish tread that shook the kitchen floor, and peering towards the bleared windows from time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking place outside. Finally he got up and informed me, in an uncertain voice, that he was going home.\n“Why’s that?”\n“Nobody’s coming to tea. It’s too late!” He looked at his watch as if there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere. “I can’t wait all day.”\n“Don’t be silly; it’s just two minutes to four.”",

She accepted with a voice that was both eager and hesitant, as if she were stepping into a world she had long left behind but never quite forgotten. The afternoon sun filtered softly through the curtains when she arrived, her presence filling the room with a delicate warmth that seemed to momentarily dispel the shadows of the past.\n\nWe sat in the parlor, the air thick with unspoken memories and the faint scent of gardenias. Daisy's eyes, bright yet tinged with a melancholy I had never seen before, met mine across the table. The conversation began cautiously, touching on trivialities—the weather, mutual acquaintances, the latest social events—but beneath the surface, a current of deeper emotion pulsed steadily.\n\nAs the tea cooled in our cups, the barriers between us slowly dissolved. Daisy spoke of her life, her hopes, and the choices that had led her away from the dreams we once shared. Her voice wavered as she confessed the loneliness that often accompanied her gilded existence, the emptiness that no amount of wealth or status could fill.\n\nI listened intently, my heart aching with a mixture of regret and longing. The years had changed us both, yet the connection remained, fragile but undeniable. We reminisced about the past, the laughter and the promises, the nights under the stars when the world seemed full of possibility.\n\nThe afternoon waned, and as the light faded, so did the illusion that we could reclaim what was lost. Yet, in that fleeting moment, there was a glimmer of hope—a chance to understand, to forgive, and perhaps, to begin anew. Daisy rose to leave, her smile bittersweet, and as she stepped into the fading light, I realized that some dreams, though altered by time, never truly die."

We both jumped up, and, a little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard.\nUnder the dripping bare lilac-trees a large open car was coming up the drive. It stopped. Daisy’s face, tipped sideways beneath a three-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic smile.\n“Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?”\nThe exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I had to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone, before any words came through. A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek, and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car.\n“Are you in love with me,” she said low in my ear, “or why did I have to come alone?”\n“That’s the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go far away and spend an hour.”\n“Come back in an hour, Ferdie.” Then in a grave murmur: “His name is Ferdie.”\n“Does the gasoline affect his nose?”\n“I don’t think so,” she said innocently. “Why?”\nWe went in. To my overwhelming surprise the living-room was deserted.\n“Well, that’s funny,” I exclaimed.\n“What’s funny?”\nShe turned her head as there was a light dignified knocking at the front door. I went out and opened it. Gatsby, pale as death, with his hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a puddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes.\nWith his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the hall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire, and disappeared into the living-room. It wasn’t a bit funny. Aware of the loud beating of my own heart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain.\nFor half a minute there wasn’t a sound. Then from the living-room I heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh, followed by Daisy’s voice on a clear artificial note:\n“I certainly am awfully glad to see you again.”\nA pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing to do in the hall, so I went into the room.\nGatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of boredom. His head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a defunct mantelpiece clock, and from this position his distraught eyes stared down at Daisy, who was sitting, frightened but graceful, on the edge of a stiff chair.\n“We’ve met before,” muttered Gatsby. His eyes glanced momentarily at me, and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh. Luckily the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his head, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers, and set it back in place. Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of the sofa and his chin in his hand.\n“I’m sorry about the clock,” he said.\nMy own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn. I couldn’t muster up a single commonplace out of the thousand in my head.\n“It’s an old clock,” I told them idiotically.\nI think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on the floor.\n“We haven’t met for many years,” said Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact as it could ever be.\n“Five years next November.”\nThe automatic quality of Gatsby’s answer set us all back at least another minute.",

I looked up and saw Gatsby's car, a rich cream color, bright with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and terraced with a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. It was a rich cream color, bright with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and terraced with a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. The car came to a stop beside us, and Gatsby himself leaned out the window, his smile as radiant as ever.\n\n\"Hello, old sport,\" he called, his voice warm and inviting. \"I thought I'd find you here.\"\n\nI nodded, still feeling the weight of the afternoon's revelations pressing down on me. Gatsby's presence was a balm, yet it also reminded me of the complexities that lay beneath his polished exterior.\n\n\"Come on, let's get out of this heat,\" Gatsby suggested, opening the door for me. We climbed into the car, the leather seats cool against the summer warmth. As we drove away from the desolate stretch of road, the city skyline began to emerge, its lights flickering like distant stars.\n\n\"You know,\" Gatsby began, \"I've been thinking a lot about the past lately. About what could have been, and what might still be.\"\n\nI glanced at him, intrigued. \"Do you really believe the past can be recaptured?\"\n\nHe smiled wistfully. \"Can't repeat the past? Why of course you can.\"\n\nHis conviction was both inspiring and tragic. It was clear that Gatsby's dreams were anchored in a time that had long since slipped away, yet he clung to them with a fervor that was almost childlike.\n\nAs we drove through the city, the streets alive with the hum of nightlife, I couldn't help but reflect on the illusions we all chase. Gatsby's dream was grander than most, but in the end, it was just as fragile.\n\nWe stopped at a small café, the kind with flickering neon signs and the scent of fresh coffee mingling with the night air. Over cups of steaming brew, Gatsby spoke of Daisy, his voice softening with each mention of her name.\n\n\"She's the reason for everything,\" he confessed. \"All this, the parties, the money, the show—it's all for her.\"\n\nI nodded, understanding more than I wanted to admit. Love, or the idea of it, can drive men to extraordinary lengths.\n\nThe night wore on, and as we parted ways, I felt a mixture of admiration and sorrow for Gatsby. He was a man caught between dreams and reality, forever reaching for a star that might never be within his grasp.\n\nWalking back to my apartment, the city lights casting long shadows, I realized that in Gatsby's world, hope was both a blessing and a curse. And perhaps, in all our lives, we are just chasing after the green light at the end of the dock, forever yearning for something just out of reach."

          "text_segment": "I had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in on a tray.\nAmid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical decency established itself. Gatsby got himself into a shadow and, while Daisy and I talked, looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with tense, unhappy eyes. However, as calmness wasn’t an end in itself, I made an excuse at the first possible moment, and got to my feet.\n“Where are you going?” demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm.\n“I’ll be back.”\n“I’ve got to speak to you about something before you go.”\nHe followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door, and whispered: “Oh, God!” in a miserable way.\n“What’s the matter?”\n“This is a terrible mistake,” he said, shaking his head from side to side, “a terrible, terrible mistake.”\n“You’re just embarrassed, that’s all,” and luckily I added: “Daisy’s embarrassed too.”\n“She’s embarrassed?” he repeated incredulously.\n“Just as much as you are.”\n“Don’t talk so loud.”\n“You’re acting like a little boy,” I broke out impatiently. “Not only that, but you’re rude. Daisy’s sitting in there all alone.”\nHe raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable reproach, and, opening the door cautiously, went back into the other room.\nI walked out the back way—just as Gatsby had when he had made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour before—and ran for a huge black knotted tree, whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain. Once more it was pouring, and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by Gatsby’s gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric marshes. There was nothing to look at from under the tree except Gatsby’s enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church steeple, for half an hour. A brewer had built it early in the “period” craze, a decade before, and there was a story that he’d agreed to pay five years’ taxes on all the neighbouring cottages if the owners would have their roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their refusal took the heart out of his plan to Found a Family—he went into an immediate decline. His children sold his house with the black wreath still on the door. Americans, while willing, even eager, to be serfs, have always been obstinate about being peasantry.\nAfter half an hour, the sun shone again, and the grocer’s automobile rounded Gatsby’s drive with the raw material for his servants’ dinner—I felt sure he wouldn’t eat a spoonful. A maid began opening the upper windows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and, leaning from the large central bay, spat meditatively into the garden. It was time I went back. While the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and swelling a little now and then with gusts of emotion. But in the new silence I felt that silence had fallen within the house too.\nI went in—after making every possible noise in the kitchen, short of pushing over the stove—but I don’t believe they heard a sound. They were sitting at either end of the couch, looking at each other as if some question had been asked, or was in the air, and every vestige of embarrassment was gone. Daisy’s face was smeared with tears, and when I came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before a mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply confounding. He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little room.\n“Oh, hello, old sport,” he said, as if he hadn’t seen me for years. I thought for a moment he was going to shake hands.\n“It’s stopped raining.”\n“Has it?” When he realized what I was talking about, that there were twinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man, like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to Daisy. “What do you think of that? It’s stopped raining.”\n“I’m glad, Jay.” Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told only of her unexpected joy.\n“I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,” he said, “I’d like to show her around.”\n“You’re sure you want me to come?”\n“Absolutely, old sport.”",

                "text": "I had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in on a tray. The room was large and stifling, and the sudden activity of preparing tea seemed to break the tension a little. Gatsby, who had been standing near the window, slipped quietly into the shadows, leaving Daisy and me alone. I felt that my presence was unnecessary and that I might be in the way, so I made an excuse and started toward the door. But Gatsby caught me by the arm and asked in a low voice where I was going. I told him I was going out for a little air. He followed me into the kitchen, his voice trembling as he whispered that the whole thing was a terrible mistake. I told him I was only embarrassed and that Daisy was embarrassed too, but he found this hard to believe. Growing impatient, I called him childish and rude for leaving Daisy alone. Gatsby looked at me with a kind of reproach, then cautiously returned to the living room. I slipped out the back door and stood under a huge oak tree in the rain, watching the house. The lawn was a wet green carpet, and the rain dripped from the leaves. The garden was a swamp, a prehistoric marsh, with mud and water pooling in the low places. I thought about the history of the house: how it had once belonged to a man who had let it fall into decay, and how the neighboring cottages had been arranged to keep the place private. The old man, a brewer, had built the house with the idea of turning the surrounding land into a series of thatched-roof cottages, but the plan failed. He had made a peculiar arrangement with the neighbors, paying them a small tax to keep the road closed and the house secluded. A black wreath hung on the door, a symbol of mourning or neglect. The maid opened the windows and spat into the garden, her movements sharp and deliberate. As I stood there, I felt like a philosopher contemplating the ruins of a once-great civilization. After about half an hour, the sun came out, and the rain stopped. I noticed the maid at the window, wiping the glass and looking out. The house seemed to come alive with small, mundane movements—the opening and closing of doors, the rustling of curtains. The voices inside had fallen to a murmur, then to silence. Feeling it was time to return, I made a deliberate noise in the kitchen to announce my presence before stepping back into the room. Gatsby and Daisy were sitting at opposite ends of the couch, staring at each other, all trace of embarrassment gone. Daisy's face was streaked with tears, and she jumped up to brush her hair and adjust her dress. Gatsby was transformed, radiating a profound, quiet joy. He greeted me warmly, as if I had been away for a long time. When I remarked that the rain had stopped, he beamed and repeated the news to Daisy, who responded with a joyful laugh. Gatsby then invited both Daisy and me to come over to his house.",

            "prefix-probing": "I had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in on a tray. The room was still thick with the haze of cigarette smoke and the faint scent of spilled liquor, a testament to the night's earlier revelry. Daisy's eyes, usually so bright and full of life, now seemed clouded with a mixture of fatigue and something deeper—perhaps regret or longing. Tom, ever the imposing figure, stood rigid, his jaw clenched as if holding back a torrent of unspoken words.\n\nAs we gathered around the small kitchen table, the clinking of cups and the soft bubbling of the kettle filled the silence. The warmth of the tea was a stark contrast to the cold tension that lingered in the air. I watched as Daisy stirred her cup absentmindedly, her fingers trembling slightly. It was in that moment I realized how fragile everything was—how the veneer of wealth and happiness could so easily crack to reveal the raw, aching truths beneath.\n\n\"You know,\" I began cautiously, \"sometimes I wonder if any of this is real. The parties, the glamour, the endless chase for something just out of reach.\"\n\nDaisy looked up, her eyes meeting mine with a flicker of understanding. \"It's all a dream,\" she whispered, \"a beautiful, terrible dream.\"\n\nTom scoffed, breaking the fragile moment. \"Dreams don't pay the bills, Nick. Reality is what you make of it.\"\n\nI nodded, acknowledging the harshness of his words. Yet, deep down, I couldn't shake the feeling that we were all trapped in a cycle of illusions, each of us playing our parts in a grand, tragic play.\n\nThe night wore on, and the conversation drifted to memories of the past—of youth, love, and the choices that had led us here. Gatsby's name was mentioned, of course, with a mixture of reverence and skepticism. To Daisy, he was a symbol of hope and possibility; to Tom, a threat to his carefully constructed world.\n\nAs the first light of dawn crept through the curtains, I found myself alone on the porch, the cool morning air a balm to my restless mind. The events of the evening replayed in my head, each moment etched with clarity and sorrow. I realized then that the story of Gatsby, of Daisy and Tom, was not just a tale of love and loss but a reflection of the American dream itself—beautiful, elusive, and ultimately unattainable.\n\nIn the days that followed, I tried to make sense of it all, to find meaning in the chaos. But some things, I learned, are meant to remain mysteries, shadows that dance just beyond our grasp. And so, I carried their stories with me, a silent witness to the triumphs and tragedies of a world forever changed by desire and ambition."

But I’m not in either one now.” He looked at me with more attention. “Do you mean you’ve been thinking over what I proposed the other night?”\nBefore I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight.\n“That huge place there?” she cried pointing.\n“Do you like it?”\n“I love it, but I don’t see how you live there all alone.”\n“I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People who do interesting things. Celebrated people.”\nInstead of taking the shortcut along the Sound we went down to the road and entered by the big postern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the gardens, the sparkling odour of jonquils and the frothy odour of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odour of kiss-me-at-the-gate. It was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but bird voices in the trees.\nAnd inside, as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music-rooms and Restoration Salons, I felt that there were guests concealed behind every couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through. As Gatsby closed the door of “the Merton College Library” I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into ghostly laughter.\nWe went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing-rooms and poolrooms, and bathrooms with sunken baths—intruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pyjamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. It was Mr. Klipspringer, the “boarder.” I had seen him wandering hungrily about the beach that morning. Finally we came to Gatsby’s own apartment, a bedroom and a bath, and an Adam’s study, where we sat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall.\nHe hadn’t once ceased looking at Daisy, and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes. Sometimes too, he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way, as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer real. Once he nearly toppled down a flight of stairs.\nHis bedroom was the simplest room of all—except where the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush with delight, and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and began to laugh.\n“It’s the funniest thing, old sport,” he said hilariously. “I can’t—When I try to—”\nHe had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third. After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder at her presence. He had been full of the idea so long, dreamed it right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to speak, at an inconceivable pitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction, he was running down like an over-wound clock.\nRecovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and his shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high.\n“I’ve got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.”\nHe took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one, before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel, which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in many-coloured disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher—shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange, with monograms of indian blue. Suddenly, with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily.\n“They’re such beautiful shirts,” she sobbed, her voice muffled in the thick folds. “It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such—such beautiful shirts before.”",

            "prefix-probing": "The evening was warm and the air was thick with the scent of blooming flowers. Gatsby stood beside me, his eyes fixed on the house as if expecting something extraordinary to happen. The lights inside flickered softly, casting a golden glow through the windows. I could see Daisy's silhouette moving gracefully, her figure illuminated by the soft light.\n\n\"She's nervous,\" Gatsby said quietly, his voice tinged with anticipation. \"I hope she likes the house.\"\n\nI nodded, understanding the weight of the moment. Gatsby had built this mansion, this entire world, to impress her—to recreate a past that perhaps never truly existed. The grandeur of the place was meant to dazzle, to convince Daisy that he was the man she once dreamed of.\n\nAs Daisy reappeared, her cheeks flushed and eyes sparkling, she smiled hesitantly. \"It's beautiful,\" she whispered, almost to herself. \"I can't believe all this is yours.\"\n\nGatsby's face lit up with a mixture of pride and relief. \"It's all for you,\" he said earnestly. \"I wanted to show you that I've made something of myself.\"\n\nWe moved to the veranda, where the night air was cooler and the stars twinkled overhead. The sound of a distant jazz band floated through the gardens, mingling with the soft murmur of the city beyond. For a moment, the three of us stood in silence, caught in the fragile magic of the evening.\n\n\"Do you remember the last time we were all together?\" Gatsby asked, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\nI glanced at Daisy, who nodded slowly. \"I do,\" she said. \"It feels like a lifetime ago.\"\n\nGatsby's eyes searched hers, filled with longing and hope. \"I want to make things right,\" he said. \"I want to turn back the clock.\"\n\nBut the past is a stubborn thing, resistant to change. I could see the conflict in Daisy's eyes—the pull of old memories and the reality of the present. The world we inhabited was shifting beneath our feet, and no amount of wealth or charm could alter that.\n\nAs the night deepened, we found ourselves drawn into conversation, reminiscing about days gone by and dreams yet to be fulfilled. The laughter was genuine, but beneath it lay an undercurrent of sadness, a recognition that some things could never be reclaimed.\n\nGatsby's gaze lingered on Daisy, his expression a mixture of hope and desperation. \"I want to believe that we can have it all,\" he said. \"That the past can be our future.\"\n\nDaisy looked away, her voice soft. \"I don't know if that's possible.\"\n\nThe tension between them was palpable, a delicate dance of emotions that neither dared to fully express. I felt like an intruder in their private world, caught between loyalty and the harsh truths that lay beneath.\n\nAs the night wore on, the party inside the house began to wind down. Guests drifted away, leaving behind a quiet stillness that seemed to settle over the estate. Gatsby and Daisy stood together, their hands almost touching, separated by the invisible barriers of time and circumstance.\n\nI realized then that Gatsby's dream was as fragile as the evening air—beautiful, intoxicating, but ultimately unattainable. The green light across the bay, which had once symbolized hope and possibility, now seemed distant and unreachable.\n\nIn that moment, I understood the tragedy of Gatsby's life—a man who had built his world on illusions, chasing a dream that could never be his. And yet, there was a nobility in his pursuit, a testament to the enduring power of hope.\n\nAs I watched them, I felt a profound sadness, tempered by a glimmer of admiration. Gatsby's dream was flawed, but it was also deeply human—a reflection of our own desires and the lengths we go to in search of happiness.\n\nThe night faded into dawn, and with it, the fragile spell was broken. The world resumed its relentless march forward, indifferent to the dreams and heartbreaks of those who inhabited it.\n\nBut for a brief moment, under the stars and the soft glow of the mansion, Gatsby, Daisy, and I had glimpsed a possibility—a fleeting glimpse of a world where the past and present could coexist, and where dreams might just come true."

Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star to the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one.\nI began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects in the half darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.\n“Who’s this?”\n“That? That’s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.”\nThe name sounded faintly familiar.\n“He’s dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.”\nThere was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the bureau—Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly—taken apparently when he was about eighteen.\n“I adore it,” exclaimed Daisy. “The pompadour! You never told me you had a pompadour—or a yacht.”\n“Look at this,” said Gatsby quickly. “Here’s a lot of clippings—about you.”\nThey stood side by side examining it. I was going to ask to see the rubies when the phone rang, and Gatsby took up the receiver.\n“Yes… Well, I can’t talk now… I can’t talk now, old sport… I said a small town… He must know what a small town is… Well, he’s no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small town…”\nHe rang off.\n“Come here quick!” cried Daisy at the window.\nThe rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west, and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.\n“Look at that,” she whispered, and then after a moment: “I’d like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around.”\nI tried to go then, but they wouldn’t hear of it; perhaps my presence made them feel more satisfactorily alone.\n“I know what we’ll do,” said Gatsby, “we’ll have Klipspringer play the piano.”\nHe went out of the room calling “Ewing!” and returned in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man, with shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blond hair. He was now decently clothed in a “sport shirt,” open at the neck, sneakers, and duck trousers of a nebulous hue.\n“Did we interrupt your exercise?” inquired Daisy politely.\n“I was asleep,” cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment. “That is, I’d been asleep. Then I got up…”\n“Klipspringer plays the piano,” said Gatsby, cutting him off. “Don’t you, Ewing, old sport?”\n“I don’t play well. I don’t—hardly play at all. I’m all out of prac—”\n“We’ll go downstairs,” interrupted Gatsby. He flipped a switch. The grey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light.\nIn the music-room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano. He lit Daisy’s cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her on a couch far across the room, where there was no light save what the gleaming floor bounced in from the hall.\nWhen Klipspringer had played “The Love Nest” he turned around on the bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.\n“I’m all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldn’t play. I’m all out of prac—”\n“Don’t talk so much, old sport,” commanded Gatsby. “Play!”\n“In the morning,\nIn the evening,\nAin’t we got fun—”\nOutside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the Sound. All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric trains, men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New York. It was the hour of a profound human change, and excitement was generating on the air.\n“One thing’s sure and nothing’s surer\nThe rich get richer and the poor get—children.\nIn the meantime,\nIn between time—”\nAs I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of bewilderment had come back into Gatsby’s face, as though a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness. Almost five years! There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams—not through her own fault, but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man can store up in his ghostly heart.\nAs I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand took hold of hers, and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion. I think that voice held him most, with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because it couldn’t be over-dreamed—that voice was a deathless song.\nThey had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand; Gatsby didn’t know me now at all. I looked once more at them and they looked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life. Then I went out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them there together.",

            "prefix-probing": "The rain was coming down in sheets now, blurring the lights of the distant shore and turning the garden paths into slick ribbons of mud. Gatsby seemed unperturbed, his smile as radiant as ever, though a hint of wistfulness flickered in his eyes. \"It's a pity about the weather,\" he said, glancing toward the darkened sky. \"But the party must go on, rain or shine.\"\n\nWe moved back inside, where the warmth and music enveloped us like a comforting embrace. The grand hall was alive with laughter and the clinking of glasses, the air thick with the scent of jasmine and the faint tang of champagne. Gatsby's guests, a motley collection of the city's elite and the curious, mingled effortlessly, their conversations weaving a tapestry of ambition, desire, and fleeting joy.\n\nNick observed the scene with a mixture of fascination and detachment. He had never seen anything quite like it—the sheer opulence, the careless extravagance, the way Gatsby seemed to command the room without ever truly belonging to it. There was a melancholy beneath the glitter, a sense that all this splendor was but a fragile facade.\n\nAs the evening wore on, the rain softened to a gentle drizzle, and some of the guests ventured back outside. The garden, illuminated by strings of fairy lights, took on an ethereal quality. The midsummer flowers, their petals glistening with raindrops, released a heady fragrance that mingled with the cool night air.\n\nGatsby led Nick to the edge of the pool, where the water shimmered under the soft glow of submerged lights. \"I always loved swimming here,\" Gatsby confessed, his voice tinged with nostalgia. \"It's like a little piece of paradise, right in the middle of all this madness.\"\n\nThey stood in companionable silence for a moment, watching the ripples dance across the surface. Then Gatsby's expression grew serious. \"You know, Nick, I've been thinking a lot about the past lately. About what could have been, and what might still be.\"\n\nNick nodded, sensing the weight behind Gatsby's words. \"Sometimes, the past is all we have to hold onto. But it can also be a prison.\"\n\nGatsby smiled wistfully. \"Maybe. But I believe in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning—\"\n\nHe paused, his gaze fixed on the distant horizon where the rain had finally ceased, revealing a sky studded with stars. \"—So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\"\n\nNick felt a profound sense of understanding wash over him. Gatsby's dream, as elusive and shimmering as the green light across the bay, was both his greatest strength and his deepest tragedy. In that moment, amidst the fading echoes of the party and the quiet beauty of the night, Nick realized that Gatsby was not just a man chasing a dream—he was the embodiment of the American spirit itself, forever striving, forever hopeful, and forever haunted by the past."

He had heard Gatsby’s name mentioned in the office and wanted to know in what connection. Gatsby smiled with a pleasant expression and said he didn’t think he had anything to say. The reporter hesitated, then said it was just a random shot, and he was trying to get a story. The reporter’s visit was a sign of Gatsby’s growing notoriety, which had been built up all summer through the endless gossip of the hundreds who had accepted his hospitality. There were rumors that he owned an underground pipeline to Canada, or that he lived in a mobile house like a boat. These fantastic stories had become so widespread that they almost seemed newsworthy. And yet, for all this, it was curious to wonder why James Gatz of North Dakota should have found it so satisfying to invent these elaborate fictions about himself.",

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the detail about the reporter’s confusion and inability or unwillingness to specify the connection in which Gatsby’s name was mentioned.\n- The passage lacks the explanation that the reporter’s visit was a “random shot,” and the narrative reflection on the accuracy of the reporter’s instinct.\n- The completion omits the specific mention of the “hundreds who had accepted his hospitality” and how they contributed to Gatsby’s notoriety.\n- The reflection on why these rumors were satisfying to Gatsby (James Gatz of North Dakota) is missing from the end of the completion.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes certain rumors to the guests that are not present in the original passage, such as the claim about Gatsby being a German spy.\n- The sequence of the reporter’s actions and the nature of his inquiry are not clearly aligned with the original; the confusion and the five-minute exchange are condensed and not distinctly represented.\n- The completion suggests that newspapers were beginning to take notice, which is not a focus in the original passage.\n- The order of the rumors and the details about Gatsby’s supposed living arrangements are altered or expanded beyond what is present in the original."

            "prefix-probing": "Gatsby, with a charming smile, invited the reporter inside and began to recount the story of his life, carefully crafting an image of wealth and success. He spoke of his humble beginnings, his time at Oxford, and his inherited fortune, all designed to impress and mystify. The reporter, eager for a scoop, scribbled notes furiously, sensing a story that would captivate the city. Gatsby’s mansion, with its lavish parties and opulent decor, was a symbol of the American Dream, yet beneath the glittering surface lay a man driven by a singular obsession: Daisy Buchanan. As the interview progressed, it became clear that Gatsby’s wealth was not merely for show but a means to an end, a way to win back the love he had lost. The reporter left with a story that would soon make headlines, revealing the enigmatic figure behind the grand facade and the tragic yearning that defined his existence."

His brown, hardening body lived naturally through the half-fierce, half-lazy work of the bracing days. He knew women early, and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous of them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of the others because they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming self-absorption he took for granted.\nBut his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy’s wing.\nAn instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before, to the small Lutheran College of St. Olaf’s in southern Minnesota. He stayed there two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor’s work with which he was to pay his way through. Then he drifted back to Lake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the day that Dan Cody’s yacht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore.\nCody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields, of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since seventy-five. The transactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire found him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and, suspecting this, an infinite number of women tried to separate him from his money. The none too savoury ramifications by which Ella Kaye, the newspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in a yacht, were common property of the turgid journalism in 1902.

His body grew strong through the hard work, but there were moments when he was idle, and the work was not always steady. He had had a few early experiences with women, but they had left him with a contempt for them, a contempt born of being spoiled and of their ignorance and their hysterical nature.\n\nAt night he would lie awake and conjure up a universe of ineffable gaudiness, a universe of fantastic and extravagant daydreams. The clock ticked on the mantelpiece and the moonlight flooded the room, but he was lost in a world of his own making. The night was alive with the sound of the water and the faint rustle of the wind, and in this environment his imagination built a world more real to him than the one he inhabited by day. These fantasies were a kind of temporary outlet, a hint at the unreality of reality itself, as if the world rested on a foundation of shifting sand.\n\nDriven by an instinct toward his future glory, he went to St. Olaf's College in Minnesota, but after two weeks he left, disillusioned by the indifference of the college to his ambitions and by the necessity of working as a janitor to pay his way. He returned to the shores of Lake Superior, still searching.\n\nThen Dan Cody's yacht appeared on the shore of Lake Superior. Cody was a man of fifty, wealthy from mining in the copper regions of the North, physically strong but showing signs of mental frailty. He was pursued by women who sought his fortune, notably Ella Kaye, a newspaper woman whose influence had led him to take to the sea.

This was his life before he met Gatsby, before the glittering parties and the endless summer nights filled with music and laughter. He was a man of humble beginnings, shaped by the rugged wilderness and the harsh realities of survival. Yet, beneath the rough exterior, there was a yearning for something more, a dream that seemed just out of reach.\n\nWhen he first arrived in West Egg, he was struck by the contrast between the opulence of Gatsby's mansion and the modest homes that lined the shore. Gatsby himself was an enigma, a man who seemed to have risen from nothing to become the embodiment of the American Dream. His parties were legendary, drawing the rich and famous from all corners of New York, but there was always an air of mystery about him.\n\nAs the summer progressed, he found himself drawn into Gatsby's world, captivated by the charm and charisma that the man exuded. Gatsby spoke of his past with a wistful nostalgia, hinting at a love lost and a future yet to be claimed. It was a story that resonated deeply, reminding him of his own hopes and regrets.\n\nDespite the glamour, there was an undercurrent of sadness that permeated the gatherings. The guests were often superficial, their conversations shallow and fleeting. Yet, Gatsby remained steadfast in his pursuit of a dream, a vision of a life that transcended the ordinary.\n\nIn the end, it was this relentless hope that defined Gatsby, setting him apart from the rest. His story was a testament to the enduring power of dreams, even in the face of inevitable disappointment. And for those who knew him, it was a reminder that beneath the glittering facade, there was a man who dared to believe in the impossible."

Gatsby's mansion, with its sprawling gardens and shimmering pools, was a beacon for the curious and the ambitious alike. Yet beneath the glittering surface lay a profound loneliness, a yearning for a past that could never be reclaimed. His obsession with Daisy Buchanan, the golden girl of East Egg, drove him to reinvent himself, to build an empire of illusion and hope. The green light across the bay symbolized his dreams, always just out of reach, a beacon of possibility and despair. Gatsby's story is a poignant reflection of the American Dream's fragility, the pursuit of happiness shadowed by loss and disillusionment. In the end, his tragic fate serves as a cautionary tale about the cost of ambition and the elusive nature of identity in a world defined by wealth and status."

For several weeks I didn’t see him or hear his voice on the phone—mostly I was in New York, trotting around with Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile aunt—but finally I went over to his house one Sunday afternoon. I hadn’t been there two minutes when somebody brought Tom Buchanan in for a drink. I was startled, naturally, but the really surprising thing was that it hadn’t happened before.\nThey were a party of three on horseback—Tom and a man named Sloane and a pretty woman in a brown riding-habit, who had been there previously.\n“I’m delighted to see you,” said Gatsby, standing on his porch. “I’m delighted that you dropped in.”\nAs though they cared!\n“Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar.” He walked around the room quickly, ringing bells. “I’ll have something to drink for you in just a minute.”\nHe was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there. But he would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in a vague way that that was all they came for. Mr. Sloane wanted nothing. A lemonade? No, thanks. A little champagne? Nothing at all, thanks… I’m sorry—\n“Did you have a nice ride?”\n“Very good roads around here.”\n“I suppose the automobiles—”\n“Yeah.”\nMoved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom, who had accepted the introduction as a stranger.\n“I believe we’ve met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan.”\n“Oh, yes,” said Tom, gruffly polite, but obviously not remembering. “So we did. I remember very well.”\n“About two weeks ago.”\n“That’s right. You were with Nick here.”\n“I know your wife,” continued Gatsby, almost aggressively.\n“That so?”\nTom turned to me.\n“You live near here, Nick?”\n“Next door.”\n“That so?”\nMr. Sloane didn’t enter into the conversation, but lounged back haughtily in his chair; the woman said nothing either—until unexpectedly, after two highballs, she became cordial.\n“We’ll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby,” she suggested. “What do you say?”\n“Certainly; I’d be delighted to have you.”\n“Be ver’ nice,” said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. “Well—think ought to be starting home.”\n“Please don’t hurry,” Gatsby urged them. He had control of himself now, and he wanted to see more of Tom. “Why don’t you—why don’t you stay for supper? I wouldn’t be surprised if some other people dropped in from New York.”\n“You come to supper with me,” said the lady enthusiastically. “Both of you.”\nThis included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.\n“Come along,” he said—but to her only.\n“I mean it,” she insisted. “I’d love to have you. Lots of room.”\nGatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go and he didn’t see that Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn’t.\n“I’m afraid I won’t be able to,” I said.\n“Well, you come,” she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.\nMr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear.\n“We won’t be late if we start now,” she insisted aloud.\n“I haven’t got a horse,” said Gatsby. “I used to ride in the army, but I’ve never bought a horse. I’ll have to follow you in my car. Excuse me for just a minute.”\nThe rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady began an impassioned conversation aside.\n“My God, I believe the man’s coming,” said Tom. “Doesn’t he know she doesn’t want him?”\n“She says she does want him.”\n“She has a big dinner party and he won’t know a soul there.” He frowned. “I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may be old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to suit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish.”\nSuddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted their horses.\n“Come on,” said Mr. Sloane to Tom, “we’re late. We’ve got to go.” And then to me: “Tell him we couldn’t wait, will you?”\nTom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod, and they trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August foliage just as Gatsby, with hat and light overcoat in hand, came out the front door.",

            "prefix-probing": "It was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs. For a while, I found myself adrift, caught between the glittering world Gatsby inhabited and the more grounded reality I had always known. The parties, the lavish displays, the endless stream of guests—all seemed to fade into a distant hum, replaced by a quiet contemplation of what it all meant.\n\nGatsby himself remained an enigma, a figure both larger than life and deeply vulnerable. His relentless pursuit of a dream, embodied in the green light across the bay, was both inspiring and tragic. I often wondered if he truly believed in the possibility of recapturing the past, or if he was merely chasing a phantom that would forever elude him.\n\nIn the days that followed, I found myself reflecting on the nature of the American Dream, the illusions we chase, and the realities we must face. Gatsby's story was a cautionary tale, a reminder that wealth and status could not buy happiness or fulfillment. Yet, there was something undeniably noble in his unwavering hope, his refusal to accept the limitations imposed by society or circumstance.\n\nAs the summer waned, the parties ceased, and the mansion grew quiet. The guests disappeared as swiftly as they had arrived, leaving behind only memories and the faint scent of extravagance. Gatsby's world, once so vibrant and alive, seemed to dissolve into the twilight, a fleeting moment of brilliance in the vast expanse of time.\n\nIn the end, it was not the glittering facade that defined Gatsby, but the man beneath—the dreamer who dared to believe in the impossible. And though his story ended in tragedy, it left an indelible mark on those who knew him, a testament to the enduring power of hope and the complexities of the human heart."

Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness—it stands out in my memory from Gatsby’s other parties that summer. There were the same people, or at least the same sort of people, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-coloured, many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that hadn’t been there before. Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world complete in itself, with its own standards and its own great figures, second to nothing because it had no consciousness of being so, and now I was looking at it again, through Daisy’s eyes. It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment.\nThey arrived at twilight, and, as we strolled out among the sparkling hundreds, Daisy’s voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat.\n“These things excite me so,” she whispered. “If you want to kiss me any time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I’ll be glad to arrange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green card. I’m giving out green—”\n“Look around,” suggested Gatsby.\n“I’m looking around. I’m having a marvellous—”\n“You must see the faces of many people you’ve heard about.”\nTom’s arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.\n“We don’t go around very much,” he said; “in fact, I was just thinking I don’t know a soul here.”\n“Perhaps you know that lady.” Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white-plum tree. Tom and Daisy stared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies.\n“She’s lovely,” said Daisy.\n“The man bending over her is her director.”\nHe took them ceremoniously from group to group:\n“Mrs. Buchanan… and Mr. Buchanan—” After an instant’s hesitation he added: “the polo player.”\n“Oh no,” objected Tom quickly, “not me.”\nBut evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained “the polo player” for the rest of the evening.\n“I’ve never met so many celebrities,” Daisy exclaimed. “I liked that man—what was his name?—with the sort of blue nose.”\nGatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer.\n“Well, I liked him anyhow.”\n“I’d a little rather not be the polo player,” said Tom pleasantly, “I’d rather look at all these famous people in—in oblivion.”\nDaisy and Gatsby danced. I remember being surprised by his graceful, conservative foxtrot—I had never seen him dance before. Then they sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour, while at her request I remained watchfully in the garden. “In case there’s a fire or a flood,” she explained, “or any act of God.”\nTom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together. “Do you mind if I eat with some people over here?” he said. “A fellow’s getting off some funny stuff.”\n“Go ahead,” answered Daisy genially, “and if you want to take down any addresses here’s my little gold pencil.”… She looked around after a moment and told me the girl was “common but pretty,” and I knew that except for the half-hour she’d been alone with Gatsby she wasn’t having a good time.",

He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy, straw-haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.\n\nThe party had begun to fall off a little in the past week or so. The lights in the house failed to go on one Saturday night, and, when I came over to the window to see what was happening, I saw that the whole front of the house was blazing with light, and the garden was crowded with a whole pitiful swarm of faces. But the lights were on now, and the music was playing, and the whole scene had a certain harshness that I had not noticed before. I wondered if it was because of Tom’s presence or because I was seeing the familiar West Egg scene through Daisy’s eyes. It was sad to realize how much the world had changed, and how the things you had always known could look so different when seen through new eyes.\n\nDaisy arrived, radiant and excited, and whispered to me, “You must come and see the house sometime.” She leaned close and said, “I’m glad it’s a girl. And I hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.” She smiled mischievously and added, “You must know Gatsby.”\n\nGatsby came over and began to show off, pointing out the famous people who had come to the party. “That’s a movie star,” he said, indicating a woman in a shimmering dress. “And that’s her director.”\n\nTom looked around with a bored expression. “I don’t know anybody here,” he said.\n\nGatsby smiled and said, “That’s Mr. Sloane, the polo player.”\n\nTom frowned. “I’m the polo player,” he said.\n\n“No,” Gatsby insisted, “you’re the polo player.”\n\nDaisy laughed and said, “I like to see you at a party, Tom.

INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately suggests that Tom had been to Gatsby's party before, which is not indicated in the original.\n- The sequence of events is slightly altered: the supper scene and Tom's request to join another group are not clearly placed after Daisy and Gatsby's time on the steps.\n- The completion attributes a general air of critical observation to Daisy, which is more the narrator's reflection in the original.\n- The ending overstates Nick's conclusion about Daisy's enjoyment, making it more explicit than in the original, which is more subtly implied."

            "prefix-probing": "Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy’s running around alone, for on the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby’s party. The evening was charged with a peculiar tension, a silent battle waged beneath the glittering surface of laughter and music. Gatsby, ever the gracious host, welcomed them with a smile that seemed to hold a secret, a hope that perhaps this night would bring him closer to the dream he had so carefully constructed.\n\nThe mansion was alive with the hum of conversation and the clinking of glasses, the air thick with the scent of expensive perfume and the faint trace of cigar smoke. Guests moved like shadows through the rooms, their faces illuminated by the soft glow of chandeliers, their voices rising and falling in a symphony of idle chatter and whispered gossip.\n\nDaisy, radiant in a gown that shimmered like moonlight, seemed both enchanted and uneasy. Her eyes flickered with a mixture of curiosity and apprehension as she took in the opulence around her. Tom, his jaw set and his gaze sharp, watched her closely, his discomfort growing with each passing moment.\n\nGatsby approached them with a confidence that belied the nervous flutter in his chest. He introduced them to a few of his acquaintances, his voice steady but his hands betraying a slight tremor. As the evening wore on, Gatsby found moments to speak with Daisy alone, their conversations laced with nostalgia and unspoken longing.\n\nTom, sensing the undercurrent between them, grew increasingly agitated. His laughter became forced, his remarks edged with sarcasm. At one point, he pulled Daisy aside, his voice low and urgent, warning her of the dangers of indulging in Gatsby’s world.\n\nBut Daisy, caught between the past and the present, between the security of her marriage and the allure of a rekindled romance, seemed torn. Her heart fluttered with memories of a time when life was simpler, when love was untainted by the complexities of wealth and status.\n\nAs the night deepened, the party reached its crescendo. The music swelled, the dancers twirled beneath the stars, and the champagne flowed freely. Yet, amidst the revelry, an undercurrent of unease persisted, a silent acknowledgment that the night’s enchantment was fragile, that the illusions it fostered could shatter with the dawn.\n\nIn a quiet moment, Gatsby and Daisy stood together on the terrace, the city lights sparkling below like a sea of fireflies. Gatsby’s voice was soft, filled with hope and desperation as he spoke of the future he dreamed of, a future where they could be together, unburdened by the past.\n\nDaisy’s eyes glistened with tears, her voice barely a whisper as she confessed her own desires and fears. The world around them seemed to fade, leaving only the two of them suspended in a fragile bubble of possibility.\n\nBut reality intruded with the arrival of Tom, his presence a stark reminder of the barriers that separated them. The moment dissolved, replaced by a tense silence that spoke volumes.\n\nAs the guests began to depart, the night’s magic waned. Tom and Daisy left together, their faces masks of composure, concealing the turmoil beneath. Gatsby watched them go, his heart heavy with the weight of unfulfilled dreams.\n\nThe party, once a beacon of hope and celebration, now seemed a hollow echo of what might have been. Gatsby retreated into the shadows of his mansion, the silence a stark contrast to the night’s earlier exuberance.\n\nIn the days that followed, the fragile equilibrium between the characters shifted, setting in motion a chain of events that would unravel the carefully woven tapestry of their lives. The Saturday night at Gatsby’s party became a turning point, a moment where illusions collided with reality, and the true nature of love, ambition, and betrayal was laid bare."

          "text_segment": "We were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my fault—Gatsby had been called to the phone, and I’d enjoyed these same people only two weeks before. But what had amused me then turned septic on the air now.\n“How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?”\nThe girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my shoulder. At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes.\n“Wha’?”\nA massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf with her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker’s defence:\n“Oh, she’s all right now. When she’s had five or six cocktails she always starts screaming like that. I tell her she ought to leave it alone.”\n“I do leave it alone,” affirmed the accused hollowly.\n“We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: ‘There’s somebody that needs your help, Doc.’ ”\n“She’s much obliged, I’m sure,” said another friend, without gratitude, “but you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool.”\n“Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,” mumbled Miss Baedeker. “They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey.”\n“Then you ought to leave it alone,” countered Doctor Civet.\n“Speak for yourself!” cried Miss Baedeker violently. “Your hand shakes. I wouldn’t let you operate on me!”\nIt was like that. Almost the last thing I remember was standing with Daisy and watching the moving-picture director and his Star. They were still under the white-plum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale, thin ray of moonlight between. It occurred to me that he had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this proximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate degree and kiss at her cheek.\n“I like her,” said Daisy, “I think she’s lovely.”\nBut the rest offended her—and inarguably because it wasn’t a gesture but an emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented “place” that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village—appalled by its raw vigour that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a shortcut from nothing to nothing. She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand.\nI sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car. It was dark here in front; only the bright door sent ten square feet of light volleying out into the soft black morning. Sometimes a shadow moved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow, an indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an invisible glass.\n“Who is this Gatsby anyhow?” demanded Tom suddenly. “Some big bootlegger?”\n“Where’d you hear that?” I inquired.\n“I didn’t hear it. I imagined it. A lot of these newly rich people are just big bootleggers, you know.”\n“Not Gatsby,” I said shortly.\nHe was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the drive crunched under his feet.\n“Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie together.”\nA breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy’s fur collar.\n“At least they are more interesting than the people we know,” she said with an effort.\n“You didn’t look so interested.”\n“Well, I was.”\nTom laughed and turned to me.\n“Did you notice Daisy’s face when that girl asked her to put her under a cold shower?”\nDaisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper, bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again. When the melody rose her voice broke up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.\n“Lots of people come who haven’t been invited,” she said suddenly. “That girl hadn’t been invited. They simply force their way in and he’s too polite to object.”\n“I’d like to know who he is and what he does,” insisted Tom. “And I think I’ll make a point of finding out.”\n“I can tell you right now,” she answered. “He owned some drugstores, a lot of drugstores. He built them up himself.”\nThe dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive.\n“Good night, Nick,” said Daisy.\nHer glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps, where “Three O’Clock in the Morning,” a neat, sad little waltz of that year, was drifting out the open door. After all, in the very casualness of Gatsby’s party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from her world. What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside? What would happen now in the dim, incalculable hours? Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare and to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with one fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would blot out those five years of unwavering devotion.",

The atmosphere was thick with the smell of cheap perfume and stale liquor, and the conversation was a jumble of insults and laughter.\n\nLater, Daisy and I stepped away from the table and wandered toward the edge of the garden. Under a large tree, we saw the movie director passionately kissing his star companion. Daisy watched them with a soft smile and said, \"She's lovely.\"\n\nBut as we looked around at the crowd, the raw vigor and lack of refinement in West Egg struck Daisy deeply.

            "prefix-probing": "We were at a particularly tipsy table, the kind where laughter bubbled up like champagne and the clinking of glasses was a constant melody. The night was young, and the air was thick with the scent of jasmine and the promise of something extraordinary. Gatsby's mansion was alive with the hum of jazz, the flicker of candlelight, and the shimmer of silk and sequins. \n\nNick Carraway, our narrator, found himself both an observer and a participant in this dazzling world. He had come to West Egg seeking a fresh start, but what he found was a labyrinth of dreams and illusions, where the past was never truly gone and the future was always just out of reach. \n\nAt the table, the conversation flowed as freely as the liquor. Tom Buchanan, with his imposing presence and booming voice, dominated the discussion, his opinions as forceful as his physique. Daisy, radiant and ethereal, laughed with a voice that seemed to float above the rest, her charm both captivating and elusive. \n\nJordan Baker, the professional golfer with a cool demeanor and a hint of cynicism, exchanged knowing glances with Nick, their shared understanding of the world's superficiality creating a subtle bond. \n\nGatsby himself was a figure of mystery and magnetism. His smile was one of those rare smiles that could make you feel like you were the only person in the world. Yet, beneath the surface, there was an air of longing, a yearning for something just beyond his grasp. \n\nAs the night deepened, the party swirled around us like a living, breathing entity. The music soared, the dancers twirled, and the stars above seemed to pulse in time with the rhythm of the revelry. But amidst the gaiety, there was an undercurrent of tension, a sense that the glittering facade was fragile and could shatter at any moment. \n\nNick reflected on the nature of the American Dream, the idea that anyone could rise from humble beginnings to achieve greatness. Gatsby embodied this dream, his wealth and status a testament to his determination and ambition. Yet, Nick also saw the hollowness beneath the surface, the moral decay and emptiness that often accompanied such pursuits. \n\nThe night wore on, and the guests began to drift away, their laughter fading into the early morning light. Gatsby stood apart, gazing out across the bay toward the green light at the end of Daisy's dock, a symbol of hope and desire. \n\nIn that moment, Nick understood the tragedy of Gatsby's dream—a dream that was beautiful and inspiring, yet ultimately unattainable. The past could not be recaptured, and the future was uncertain. But still, Gatsby reached for it, driven by a love that transcended time and reason. \n\nAs dawn broke, the party ended, and the mansion grew silent. Nick left the tipsy table behind, carrying with him the memories of a night that encapsulated the glittering allure and profound sadness of the Jazz Age. The Great Gatsby was a story of dreams and disillusionment, of love and loss, and of the enduring human spirit that strives for something greater, even in the face of inevitable disappointment."

Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free, and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run up, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights were extinguished in the guestrooms overhead. When he came down the steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes were bright and tired.\n“She didn’t like it,” he said immediately.\n“Of course she did.”\n“She didn’t like it,” he insisted. “She didn’t have a good time.”\nHe was silent, and I guessed at his unutterable depression.\n“I feel far away from her,” he said. “It’s hard to make her understand.”\n“You mean about the dance?”\n“The dance?” He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of his fingers. “Old sport, the dance is unimportant.”\nHe wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say: “I never loved you.” After she had obliterated four years with that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken. One of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back to Louisville and be married from her house—just as if it were five years ago.\n“And she doesn’t understand,” he said. “She used to be able to understand. We’d sit for hours—”\nHe broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds and discarded favours and crushed flowers.\n“I wouldn’t ask too much of her,” I ventured. “You can’t repeat the past.”\n“Can’t repeat the past?” he cried incredulously. “Why of course you can!”\nHe looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.\n“I’m going to fix everything just the way it was before,” he said, nodding determinedly. “She’ll see.”\nHe talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy. His life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he could find out what that thing was…\n… One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight. They stopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of the year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees—he could climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.\nHis heart beat faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning-fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips’ touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.\nThrough all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was reminded of something—an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man’s, as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air. But they made no sound, and what I had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever.",

The moonlight filtered through the tall windows, casting long shadows across the polished floors and the faded, ornate wallpaper. I found myself wandering from room to room, each one holding its own memories and secrets.\n\nIn the library, the shelves were lined with leather-bound volumes, their spines cracked and worn from years of handling. I ran my fingers along the titles, feeling the weight of history and knowledge. It was in this room that Gatsby had often retreated, seeking solace among the pages of his favorite books. The scent of old paper and dust mingled with the faint aroma of his cologne, a reminder of his presence even in absence.\n\nI moved to the drawing room, where the grand piano stood silent, its keys gleaming under the moonlight. I remembered the nights when music had filled this space, the melodies weaving through the air like threads of gold. Gatsby's parties had been legendary, a kaleidoscope of laughter, jazz, and champagne. Yet, beneath the glamour, there was always a sense of longing, a yearning that no amount of revelry could satisfy.\n\nAs I gazed out the window, the green light across the bay shimmered faintly, a beacon of hope and desire. It was a symbol of Gatsby's dreams, his relentless pursuit of a future that seemed just within reach yet forever elusive. The light flickered, mirroring the fragile nature of his aspirations.\n\nI found myself drawn to the garden, where the roses bloomed under the starlit sky. The fragrance was intoxicating, a blend of sweetness and melancholy. Here, Gatsby had often stood, lost in thought, contemplating the path that had led him to this moment. The garden was a sanctuary, a place where reality and dreams intertwined.\n\nThe night deepened, and the world outside the estate seemed to fade away. In the stillness, I felt the weight of the past pressing upon me, the echoes of laughter and sorrow mingling in the air. Gatsby's story was one of hope and tragedy, a testament to the human spirit's capacity for both resilience and despair.\n\nAs dawn approached, the first light of morning painted the sky in hues of pink and gold. The house, once vibrant with life, now stood silent and somber. I knew that the days ahead would bring change, that the illusions of the past would give way to the realities of the present.\n\nYet, in that quiet moment, I held onto the memory of Gatsby—the man who dared to dream, who reached for the stars despite the odds. His story was a reminder that even in the face of loss, the human heart continues to hope, to strive, and to believe in the possibility of a better tomorrow."

Tell him Mr. Carraway came over.”\n“Who?” he demanded rudely.\n“Carraway.”\n“Carraway. All right, I’ll tell him.”\nAbruptly he slammed the door.\nMy Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never went into West Egg village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered moderate supplies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that the kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the village was that the new people weren’t servants at all.\nNext day Gatsby called me on the phone.\n“Going away?” I inquired.\n“No, old sport.”\n“I hear you fired all your servants.”\n“I wanted somebody who wouldn’t gossip. Daisy comes over quite often—in the afternoons.”\nSo the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in her eyes.\n“They’re some people Wolfshiem wanted to do something for.

The front door was locked and the lawns were dark. A few cars, driven by his neighbors, crawled slowly past his place, and the occasional taxi stopped at the curb, but the lights in Gatsby’s mansion were out. The silence was unbroken except for the faint sound of a piano playing somewhere in the distance, a melancholy tune that seemed to echo the emptiness of the night.\n\nGatsby himself was nowhere to be seen. Rumors swirled among the townspeople—some said he had fled, others whispered of a sudden tragedy. But Nick Carraway, who had come to know Gatsby better than most, understood that the man’s dream had quietly slipped away, leaving behind only the shell of a once-glittering life.\n\nIn the days that followed, the house remained dark and deserted. The parties ceased, the guests vanished, and the neighborhood returned to its usual calm. Gatsby’s name, once spoken with awe and envy, faded into obscurity. Yet, for Nick, the memory of Gatsby’s unwavering hope and the tragic beauty of his dream lingered on, a poignant reminder of the elusive nature of the American Dream and the cost of chasing illusions."

The invitation was unexpected, yet it stirred a familiar warmth within me. Daisy’s voice, soft and inviting, lingered in my mind as I accepted. The next day, I found myself standing before the grand façade of her mansion, the sun casting a golden glow over the manicured lawns. Inside, the air was filled with the scent of blooming flowers and the faint melody of a piano playing somewhere in the distance.\n\nDaisy greeted me with a radiant smile, her eyes sparkling with a hint of mischief. The luncheon was a lavish affair, attended by a select few of their affluent friends. The conversation flowed effortlessly, punctuated by laughter and the clinking of crystal glasses. Yet beneath the surface, I sensed an undercurrent of tension, a fragile veneer masking deeper emotions.\n\nAs the afternoon wore on, Gatsby appeared, his presence commanding yet tinged with vulnerability. The reunion between him and Daisy was charged with unspoken words and lingering memories. I watched as they exchanged glances, their past entwined with the present in a delicate dance of hope and regret.\n\nThe day left me contemplative, pondering the complexities of love, ambition, and the elusive nature of the American Dream. In that moment, the world of East Egg shimmered with both promise and peril, a testament to the enduring allure of Gatsby’s dream."

In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the common store of life.\nThe room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols weighing down their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.\n“We can’t move,” they said together.\nJordan’s fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment in mine.\n“And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?” I inquired.\nSimultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall telephone.\nGatsby stood in the centre of the crimson carpet and gazed around with fascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting laugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.\n“The rumour is,” whispered Jordan, “that that’s Tom’s girl on the telephone.”\nWe were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance: “Very well, then, I won’t sell you the car at all… I’m under no obligations to you at all… and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time, I won’t stand that at all!”\n“Holding down the receiver,” said Daisy cynically.\n“No, he’s not,” I assured her. “It’s a bona-fide deal. I happen to know about it.”\nTom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his thick body, and hurried into the room.\n“Mr. Gatsby!” He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed dislike. “I’m glad to see you, sir… Nick…”\n“Make us a cold drink,” cried Daisy.\nAs he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and pulled his face down, kissing him on the mouth.\n“You know I love you,” she murmured.\n“You forget there’s a lady present,” said Jordan.\nDaisy looked around doubtfully.\n“You kiss Nick too.”\n“What a low, vulgar girl!”\n“I don’t care!” cried Daisy, and began to clog on the brick fireplace. Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.\n“Bles-sed pre-cious,” she crooned, holding out her arms. “Come to your own mother that loves you.”\nThe child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and rooted shyly into her mother’s dress.\n“The bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy hair? Stand up now, and say—How-de-do.”\nGatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand. Afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise. I don’t think he had ever really believed in its existence before.\n“I got dressed before luncheon,” said the child, turning eagerly to Daisy.\n“That’s because your mother wanted to show you off.” Her face bent into the single wrinkle of the small white neck. “You dream, you. You absolute little dream.”\n“Yes,” admitted the child calmly. “Aunt Jordan’s got on a white dress too.”\n“How do you like mother’s friends?” Daisy turned her around so that she faced Gatsby. “Do you think they’re pretty?”\n“Where’s Daddy?”\n“She doesn’t look like her father,” explained Daisy. “She looks like me. She’s got my hair and shape of the face.”\nDaisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took a step forward and held out her hand.\n“Come, Pammy.”\n“Goodbye, sweetheart!”\nWith a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to her nurse’s hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back, preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.",

            "prefix-probing": "Through the hall of the Buchanans’ house blew a faint wind, carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at the door. The afternoon sun filtered through the tall windows, casting long shadows across the polished floor. Gatsby stood with an air of restless anticipation, his eyes fixed on the distant horizon beyond the manicured lawns. I could sense the tension in the room, a palpable energy that seemed to vibrate in the very air we breathed.\n\nThe telephone rang again, sharp and insistent, breaking the fragile silence. Tom Buchanan answered it with a curt nod, his voice low and clipped as he spoke. The conversation was brief, but the expression on his face darkened with each passing moment. He hung up and turned to us, his gaze piercing and unyielding.\n\n\"We need to talk,\" he said, his tone brooking no argument. \"There are things you don’t understand, Gatsby. Things about Daisy and me, about the past and what it means for the future.\"\n\nGatsby’s jaw tightened, but he said nothing. I could see the conflict raging behind his eyes, the struggle between hope and reality. Daisy, standing nearby, looked pale and fragile, as if the weight of the moment threatened to crush her.\n\nWe moved into the drawing room, the heavy curtains drawn to keep out the afternoon glare. The room was filled with the scent of fresh flowers and the faint trace of expensive cologne. Tom paced back and forth, his hands clenched into fists.\n\n\"You think you can just walk back into her life,\" he said, his voice rising. \"But you don’t know what you’re dealing with. Daisy is my wife, and I won’t let you take her away from me.\"\n\nGatsby stepped forward, his eyes blazing with determination. \"I love her,\" he said simply. \"I’ve loved her for years. I want to make her happy.\"\n\nDaisy looked between them, her eyes wide with fear and confusion. \"Please,\" she whispered. \"Stop this. I don’t want to hurt anyone.\"\n\nThe room fell into a heavy silence, broken only by the ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner. I felt as though we were all caught in a web of secrets and lies, each of us struggling to find a way out.\n\nSuddenly, the front door burst open, and Jordan Baker entered, her face flushed and breathless. \"There’s been an accident,\" she said urgently. \"You need to come quickly.\"\n\nWe followed her outside, the cool evening air a sharp contrast to the stifling atmosphere inside. The street was crowded with people, their faces etched with worry and fear. A car was parked at the curb, its headlights casting long beams of light into the darkness.\n\nTom pushed his way through the crowd, his expression grim. \"It’s Myrtle,\" he said. \"She’s been hit by a car.\"\n\nGatsby’s face went pale, and Daisy clutched my arm tightly. The world seemed to tilt on its axis, the fragile balance of our lives shattered in an instant.\n\nAs the night wore on, the truth began to unravel, revealing the tangled web of love, betrayal, and tragedy that bound us all together. In the end, it was not the grand parties or the glittering wealth that defined us, but the choices we made and the consequences we could not escape."

          "text_segment": "Gatsby took up his drink.\n“They certainly look cool,” he said, with visible tension.\nWe drank in long, greedy swallows.\n“I read somewhere that the sun’s getting hotter every year,” said Tom genially. “It seems that pretty soon the earth’s going to fall into the sun—or wait a minute—it’s just the opposite—the sun’s getting colder every year.\n“Come outside,” he suggested to Gatsby, “I’d like you to have a look at the place.”\nI went with them out to the veranda. On the green Sound, stagnant in the heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea. Gatsby’s eyes followed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed across the bay.\n“I’m right across from you.”\n“So you are.”\nOur eyes lifted over the rose-beds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse of the dog-days alongshore. Slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and the abounding blessed isles.\n“There’s sport for you,” said Tom, nodding. “I’d like to be out there with him for about an hour.”\nWe had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat, and drank down nervous gaiety with the cold ale.\n“What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon?” cried Daisy, “and the day after that, and the next thirty years?”\n“Don’t be morbid,” Jordan said. “Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.”\n“But it’s so hot,” insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, “and everything’s so confused. Let’s all go to town!”\nHer voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding its senselessness into forms.\n“I’ve heard of making a garage out of a stable,” Tom was saying to Gatsby, “but I’m the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage.”\n“Who wants to go to town?” demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby’s eyes floated toward her. “Ah,” she cried, “you look so cool.”\nTheir eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space. With an effort she glanced down at the table.\n“You always look so cool,” she repeated.\nShe had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was astounded. His mouth opened a little, and he looked at Gatsby, and then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as someone he knew a long time ago.\n“You resemble the advertisement of the man,” she went on innocently. “You know the advertisement of the man—”\n“All right,” broke in Tom quickly, “I’m perfectly willing to go to town. Come on—we’re all going to town.”\nHe got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife. No one moved.\n“Come on!” His temper cracked a little. “What’s the matter, anyhow? If we’re going to town, let’s start.”\nHis hand, trembling with his effort at self-control, bore to his lips the last of his glass of ale. Daisy’s voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive.\n“Are we just going to go?” she objected. “Like this? Aren’t we going to let anyone smoke a cigarette first?”\n“Everybody smoked all through lunch.”\n“Oh, let’s have fun,” she begged him. “It’s too hot to fuss.”\nHe didn’t answer.\n“Have it your own way,” she said. “Come on, Jordan.”\nThey went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky. Gatsby started to speak, changed his mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.\n“Have you got your stables here?” asked Gatsby with an effort.\n“About a quarter of a mile down the road.”\n“Oh.”\nA pause.\n“I don’t see the idea of going to town,” broke out Tom savagely. “Women get these notions in their heads—”\n“Shall we take anything to drink?” called Daisy from an upper window.\n“I’ll get some whisky,” answered Tom. He went inside.\nGatsby turned to me rigidly:\n“I can’t say anything in his house, old sport.”\n“She’s got an indiscreet voice,” I remarked. “It’s full of—” I hesitated.\n“Her voice is full of money,” he said suddenly.\nThat was it. I’d never understood before. It was full of money—that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals’ song of it… High in a white palace the king’s daughter, the golden girl…\nTom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and carrying light capes over their arms.\n“Shall we all go in my car?” suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, green leather of the seat. “I ought to have left it in the shade.”\n“Is it standard shift?” demanded Tom.\n“Yes.”\n“Well, you take my coupé and let me drive your car to town.”",

He had been standing there for a moment, his eyes fixed on the green light across the bay, the symbol of his unattainable dreams and the past he longed to reclaim. The room around him buzzed with the laughter and chatter of the party guests, but he seemed detached, lost in his own thoughts. Nick Carraway, observing from a distance, noticed the subtle tension in Gatsby's posture, the way his smile didn't quite reach his eyes.\n\nThe evening had unfolded with the usual extravagance—music, dancing, and the clinking of glasses—but beneath the surface, a quiet desperation lingered. Gatsby's wealth and charm had drawn a crowd, yet he remained an enigma, a man chasing a dream that seemed just out of reach. As the night deepened, the guests began to drift away, leaving Gatsby and Nick alone on the veranda, the cool night air carrying the scent of jasmine and the distant hum of the city.\n\n\"You always look so cool,\" Nick remarked, trying to break the silence.\n\nGatsby smiled faintly. \"I have to. It's the only way to keep going.\"\n\nThey spoke of the past, of memories that shimmered like fragile glass, beautiful yet easily shattered. Gatsby's voice held a mixture of hope and melancholy as he recounted his early days, the moment he first saw Daisy, and the life he envisioned with her. Nick listened, understanding that beneath the glittering facade was a man vulnerable and profoundly human.\n\nAs dawn approached, Gatsby's gaze returned to the green light, a beacon of his dreams and the promise of a future that might never be. The party was over, the guests gone, but Gatsby remained, a solitary figure standing at the edge of the world he had built, yearning for a love that time had changed but never diminished."

Daisy looked at Tom frowning, and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar and vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in words, passed over Gatsby’s face.\n“Come on, Daisy,” said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby’s car. “I’ll take you in this circus wagon.”\nHe opened the door, but she moved out from the circle of his arm.\n“You take Nick and Jordan.

            "prefix-probing": "The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby. He had always been a man of great hope and unwavering belief in the possibility of a better future, and the idea of compromising his dreams was something he could not entertain. Gatsby's entire life had been built around the pursuit of an ideal, a vision of success and love that seemed just within reach but always remained elusive. To him, the suggestion felt like a betrayal of everything he stood for.\n\nAs he stood there, the weight of his past and the uncertainty of his future pressed heavily upon him. The green light across the bay, a symbol of his aspirations and the life he longed to reclaim, flickered faintly in the distance. It was a reminder that despite the obstacles and the passage of time, his dream was still alive, still worth fighting for.\n\nGatsby's eyes, usually so full of determination and sparkle, momentarily clouded with doubt. Yet, deep within, a fire burned brighter than ever. He knew that to give up now would be to surrender not just his hopes but his very identity. The world around him, with its glittering parties and hollow promises, seemed to mock his sincerity, but he refused to be swayed.\n\nIn that moment, Gatsby resolved to hold fast to his vision, to continue striving against the odds. The suggestion, though distasteful, served as a catalyst, strengthening his resolve rather than diminishing it. He would not allow the cynicism of others to dictate the course of his life.\n\nAs the night deepened, Gatsby's silhouette stood firm against the backdrop of the city lights. The dream that had driven him from humble beginnings to the heights of wealth and influence was still alive, burning with an intensity that no suggestion could extinguish. For Gatsby, the pursuit of his ideal was not just a choice but a necessity, a testament to the enduring power of hope and the human spirit."

After a moment the proprietor emerged from the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.\n“Let’s have some gas!” cried Tom roughly. “What do you think we stopped for—to admire the view?”\n“I’m sick,” said Wilson without moving. “Been sick all day.”\n“What’s the matter?”\n“I’m all run down.”\n“Well, shall I help myself?” Tom demanded. “You sounded well enough on the phone.”\nWith an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and, breathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his face was green.\n“I didn’t mean to interrupt your lunch,” he said. “But I need money pretty bad, and I was wondering what you were going to do with your old car.”\n“How do you like this one?” inquired Tom. “I bought it last week.”\n“It’s a nice yellow one,” said Wilson, as he strained at the handle.\n“Like to buy it?”\n“Big chance,” Wilson smiled faintly. “No, but I could make some money on the other.”\n“What do you want money for, all of a sudden?”\n“I’ve been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and I want to go West.”\n“Your wife does,” exclaimed Tom, startled.\n“She’s been talking about it for ten years.” He rested for a moment against the pump, shading his eyes. “And now she’s going whether she wants to or not. I’m going to get her away.”\nThe coupé flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a waving hand.\n“What do I owe you?” demanded Tom harshly.\n“I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,” remarked Wilson. “That’s why I want to get away. That’s why I been bothering you about the car.”\n“What do I owe you?”\n“Dollar twenty.”\nThe relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had a bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadn’t alighted on Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world, and the shock had made him physically sick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour before—and it occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well. Wilson was so sick that he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty—as if he had just got some poor girl with child.\n“I’ll let you have that car,” said Tom.",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents a scene involving Myrtle looking down from an upper window and her face contorting with jealousy, which does not occur in the original passage. This is a significant addition that alters the focus and sequence of events.\n- The completion also adds a detail about the seating arrangement in the car, which is not specified in the original excerpt.\n- The ending introduces a promise from Tom to send the car the next day, which is not present in the original passage.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the specific dialogue exchanges between Tom and Wilson regarding the gas, the car, and Wilson’s illness, which are important for conveying the tension and character dynamics.\n- The moment when Tom twice asks what he owes for the gas is missing, as is Wilson’s specific response about the amount owed.\n- The completion does not include the narrator’s internal confusion due to the heat and the realization about Wilson’s suspicions not being directed at Tom.\n- The original’s reflection on the difference between the sick and the well, and the physical description of Wilson’s appearance, are only partially represented and lack the depth and detail of the original.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately describes the sequence of events by inserting Myrtle’s perspective and actions at the garage, which do not occur in this passage.\n- There is an inaccurate implication that Wilson directly states he knows about the affair, whereas the original only hints at his suspicions.\n- The completion misattributes a promise from Tom about the car, which is not part of the original excerpt.\n- The completion’s description of the passing coupé and the reactions of the characters does not align with the original sequence or content."

            "prefix-probing": "Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg’s faded eyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby’s caution about gasoline. The sun was setting, casting long shadows over the desolate stretch of highway that led away from the valley of ashes. The billboard, with its enormous, bespectacled eyes, seemed to watch over the moral decay that had seeped into the very fabric of the world around us. I thought about the careless extravagance of Gatsby’s parties, the reckless abandon of the wealthy, and the tragic consequences that inevitably followed.\n\nGatsby had always been a figure shrouded in mystery, a man who had reinvented himself in pursuit of a dream that was as elusive as the green light across the bay. His caution about gasoline was more than just a practical warning; it was a metaphor for the volatile nature of the world we inhabited. Just as gasoline could ignite and cause destruction, so too could the passions and desires that drove us all lead to ruin.\n\nAs I drove past the billboard, I couldn’t help but reflect on the events that had unfolded over the summer. The lavish parties, the whispered rumors, the tangled relationships—all culminating in a tragedy that left a permanent scar on the landscape of our lives. Gatsby’s dream, so carefully constructed and fiercely protected, had been shattered by the harsh realities of the world he sought to conquer.\n\nThe valley of ashes stretched out before me, a bleak reminder of the consequences of unchecked ambition and moral decay. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg seemed to judge us all, silent witnesses to the corruption and despair that had taken root. In that moment, I understood that Gatsby’s caution was not just about the dangers of gasoline, but about the fragility of dreams and the cost of chasing them without regard for the world around us.\n\nDriving away from the valley, I felt a profound sense of loss and disillusionment. The glittering facade of wealth and glamour had been stripped away, revealing the emptiness beneath. Gatsby’s story was a cautionary tale, a reminder that the pursuit of happiness could be as dangerous as it was alluring. And as the night closed in, I knew that the faded eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg would continue to watch over the valley, bearing silent witness to the dreams and tragedies of those who passed through."

          "text_segment": "That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of something behind. Over the ash-heaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil, but I perceived, after a moment, that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away.\nIn one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little, and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car. So engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed, and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture. Her expression was curiously familiar—it was an expression I had often seen on women’s faces, but on Myrtle Wilson’s face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on Jordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife.\nThere is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping precipitately from his control. Instinct made him step on the accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in sight of the easygoing blue coupé.\n“Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,” suggested Jordan. “I love New York on summer afternoons when everyone’s away. There’s something very sensuous about it—overripe, as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands.”\nThe word “sensuous” had the effect of further disquieting Tom, but before he could invent a protest the coupé came to a stop, and Daisy signalled us to draw up alongside.\n“Where are we going?” she cried.\n“How about the movies?”\n“It’s so hot,” she complained. “You go. We’ll ride around and meet you after.” With an effort her wit rose faintly. “We’ll meet you on some corner. I’ll be the man smoking two cigarettes.”\n“We can’t argue about it here,” Tom said impatiently, as a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind us. “You follow me to the south side of Central Park, in front of the Plaza.”\nSeveral times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight. I think he was afraid they would dart down a side-street and out of his life forever.\nBut they didn’t. And we all took the less explicable step of engaging the parlour of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.\nThe prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into that room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in the course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back. The notion originated with Daisy’s suggestion that we hire five bathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as “a place to have a mint julep.” Each of us said over and over that it was a “crazy idea”—we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought, or pretended to think, that we were being very funny…\nThe room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four o’clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from the Park. Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us, fixing her hair.\n“It’s a swell suite,” whispered Jordan respectfully, and everyone laughed.\n“Open another window,” commanded Daisy, without turning around.\n“There aren’t any more.”\n“Well, we’d better telephone for an axe—”\n“The thing to do is to forget about the heat,” said Tom impatiently. “You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it.”\nHe unrolled the bottle of whisky from the towel and put it on the table.\n“Why not let her alone, old sport?” remarked Gatsby. “You’re the one that wanted to come to town.”\nThere was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered, “Excuse me”—but this time no one laughed.\n“I’ll pick it up,” I offered.\n“I’ve got it.” Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered “Hum!” in an interested way, and tossed the book on a chair.\n“That’s a great expression of yours, isn’t it?” said Tom sharply.\n“What is?”\n“All this ‘old sport’ business. Where’d you pick that up?”\n“Now see here, Tom,” said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, “if you’re going to make personal remarks I won’t stay here a minute. Call up and order some ice for the mint julep.”\nAs Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn’s Wedding March from the ballroom below.\n“Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!” cried Jordan dismally.\n“Still—I was married in the middle of June,” Daisy remembered. “Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?”\n“Biloxi,” he answered shortly.\n“A man named Biloxi. ‘Blocks’ Biloxi, and he made boxes—that’s a fact—and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.”\n“They carried him into my house,” appended Jordan, “because we lived just two doors from the church. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy told him he had to get out. The day after he left Daddy died.” After a moment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent, “There wasn’t any connection.”\n“I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,” I remarked.\n“That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he left. He gave me an aluminium putter that I use today.”",

The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic—their retinas are one yard high.

I glanced seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock.\n\nBut there was a change in Gatsby that was simply confounding. He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little room.\n\nAs we crossed the long drive, I saw that the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg had been replaced by the watchful eyes of Myrtle Wilson, who was standing at the window of the garage, her face flushed and her eyes wide with a kind of desperate intensity. She was watching us, and as we passed, she gave a quick, startled glance at Jordan, mistaking her for someone else, and then turned away, her expression changing to one of bitter disappointment.\n\nTom was driving now with a certain frantic energy, as if he were trying to hold on to something slipping away. The city was hot and oppressive, and the car seemed to crawl through the traffic. Jordan suggested we see a movie in a cool theater, but Daisy complained about the heat and said she wanted to get out of the car.

At one point, a telephone book fell from the car, and Jordan laughed nervously as Gatsby picked it up.\n\nEventually, we impulsively decided to rent a suite at the Plaza Hotel. The suite was hot and stuffy, and Daisy tried to fix her hair while Tom urged everyone to stop complaining about the heat and prepared the whiskey. The hotel clerk was amused by our chaotic arrival, and the group joked about hiring bathrooms to cool off.\n\nGatsby told Tom to leave Daisy alone, reminding him that coming to town was Tom's idea. A tense silence followed. Tom aggressively questioned Gatsby about his use of the phrase 'old sport.' Daisy intervened, telling Tom to stop making personal remarks and to order ice. As Tom phoned for ice, Mendelssohn's Wedding March drifted up from a wedding reception downstairs.\n\nThe conversation turned to Daisy and Tom's wedding day, and a guest named Biloxi, who had stayed at their house for a week. The group exchanged fragmented memories and anecdotes, the atmosphere charged with a mixture of nostalgia and unease.",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the scene where Myrtle Wilson is seen watching from the window, including her emotional reactions and the mistaken identity involving Jordan. This is a significant omission from the early part of the passage.\n- The completion condenses and summarizes the transition to the Plaza Hotel, skipping the detailed sequence of events and dialogue that led to the decision to go there. The prolonged group argument and the physical discomfort described in the original are missing.\n- The completion summarizes the events in the Plaza suite, omitting the group’s interaction with the hotel clerk and the collective sense of confusion and humor.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The detailed description of Myrtle’s observation, her emotional changes, and the narrator’s interpretation of her expression are missing from the early section.\n- The specific dialogue exchanges during the car ride, including Jordan’s comments about New York and the movies, Daisy’s witty remarks, and Tom’s instructions about where to meet, are not present.\n- The original’s depiction of the group’s chaotic arrival at the hotel, their discussion about the heat, and the humorous suggestion about hiring bathrooms are absent.\n- The physical sensations and discomfort experienced by the narrator during the argument are not included.\n- The sequence of actions involving the telephone book falling, Jordan’s reaction, and Gatsby’s handling of the book are missing.\n- The detailed conversation about Biloxi, including the specifics of his stay and the family anecdotes, is only briefly referenced and lacks the layered dialogue of the original.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately states that Myrtle’s watchfulness was “gone,” whereas the original describes her active observation and emotional state.\n- The sequence of events is compressed, with the transition from the car ride to the Plaza Hotel happening too quickly and without the original’s step-by-step progression.\n- The completion attributes a sense of reminiscence to the group about Daisy and Tom’s wedding and Biloxi, but the original presents this as a more fragmented and interactive conversation, not a collective reminiscence.\n- The completion omits the specific time reference given in the original, as well as the order in which actions and dialogue occur in the hotel room.\n- Some invented narrative elements, such as Tom driving “frantically” and the implication that Myrtle’s watchfulness is no longer present, do not align with the original passage."

            "prefix-probing": "That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of something behind. The valley of ashes stretched out before me, a desolate wasteland where the gray dust seemed to settle on everything, dulling the colors of the world. It was a place where the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, painted on a faded billboard, loomed over the desolation like a silent, watchful god. The eyes, with their enormous blue spectacles, seemed to see through the very soul of the land, witnessing the decay and moral emptiness that pervaded the area.\n\nAs I stood there, the oppressive atmosphere weighed heavily upon me. The ash-covered ground crunched beneath my feet, and the air was thick with the acrid smell of burning coal and industrial waste. It was a stark contrast to the glittering opulence of East Egg and West Egg, where the wealthy flaunted their riches in lavish parties and extravagant mansions. Here, in the valley of ashes, the forgotten and the forsaken toiled endlessly, their lives consumed by the relentless machinery of industry.\n\nI thought of George Wilson, the weary mechanic who owned a run-down garage in this bleak landscape. His face was etched with lines of exhaustion and despair, a reflection of the hopelessness that clung to this place. George was a man trapped by circumstance, his dreams smothered beneath the weight of poverty and unfulfilled desires. His wife, Myrtle, was a restless spirit, yearning for escape and a taste of the glamour that seemed so close yet so unattainable.\n\nThe contrast between Myrtle and her surroundings was stark. She was vibrant and full of life, a woman who sought to transcend the limitations imposed upon her by birth and circumstance. Her affair with Tom Buchanan was a desperate attempt to grasp at the world of wealth and privilege that she admired from afar. Yet, even in her moments of passion and rebellion, the valley of ashes remained an inescapable backdrop, a reminder of the social chasms that divided them all.\n\nAs I continued my journey, the sun dipped lower in the sky, casting long shadows across the desolate landscape. The industrial skyline was silhouetted against the fading light, a jagged outline of smokestacks and factories that belched smoke into the air. The valley seemed to hold its breath, suspended between the fading day and the encroaching night.\n\nIn the distance, I saw a figure approaching—a man in a dust-covered suit, his face weary but determined. It was George Wilson, returning from a day of labor, his hands stained with grease and his eyes reflecting a quiet resilience. He paused briefly, glancing up at the billboard with the watchful eyes of Doctor Eckleburg, as if seeking some form of guidance or judgment.\n\nThe valley of ashes was more than just a physical place; it was a symbol of the moral decay and spiritual desolation that underpinned the glittering facade of the Jazz Age. Beneath the surface of wealth and glamour lay a world of broken dreams, shattered illusions, and the relentless pursuit of an unattainable ideal.\n\nAs I left the valley behind and returned to the world of East Egg and West Egg, the stark realities of the valley lingered in my mind. It was a reminder that beneath the dazzling lights and the endless parties, there existed a darker truth—a truth that few cared to acknowledge but that shaped the lives of all who inhabited this fractured society."

          "text_segment": "The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of “Yea—ea—ea!” and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began.\n“We’re getting old,” said Daisy. “If we were young we’d rise and dance.”\n“Remember Biloxi,” Jordan warned her. “Where’d you know him, Tom?”\n“Biloxi?” He concentrated with an effort. “I didn’t know him. He was a friend of Daisy’s.”\n“He was not,” she denied. “I’d never seen him before. He came down in the private car.”\n“Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville. Asa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room for him.”\nJordan smiled.\n“He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of your class at Yale.”\nTom and I looked at each other blankly.\n“Biloxi?”\n“First place, we didn’t have any president—”\nGatsby’s foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.\n“By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you’re an Oxford man.”\n“Not exactly.”\n“Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.”\n“Yes—I went there.”\nA pause. Then Tom’s voice, incredulous and insulting:\n“You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven.”\nAnother pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but the silence was unbroken by his “thank you” and the soft closing of the door. This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.\n“I told you I went there,” said Gatsby.\n“I heard you, but I’d like to know when.”\n“It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That’s why I can’t really call myself an Oxford man.”\nTom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. But we were all looking at Gatsby.\n“It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the armistice,” he continued. “We could go to any of the universities in England or France.”\nI wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one of those renewals of complete faith in him that I’d experienced before.\nDaisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.\n“Open the whisky, Tom,” she ordered, “and I’ll make you a mint julep. Then you won’t seem so stupid to yourself… Look at the mint!”\n“Wait a minute,” snapped Tom, “I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question.”\n“Go on,” Gatsby said politely.\n“What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?”\nThey were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.\n“He isn’t causing a row,” Daisy looked desperately from one to the other. “You’re causing a row. Please have a little self-control.”\n“Self-control!” repeated Tom incredulously. “I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife. Well, if that’s the idea you can count me out… Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next they’ll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white.”\nFlushed with his impassioned gibberish, he saw himself standing alone on the last barrier of civilization.\n“We’re all white here,” murmured Jordan.\n“I know I’m not very popular. I don’t give big parties. I suppose you’ve got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any friends—in the modern world.”\nAngry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened his mouth. The transition from libertine to prig was so complete.\n“I’ve got something to tell you, old sport—” began Gatsby. But Daisy guessed at his intention.\n“Please don’t!” she interrupted helplessly. “Please let’s all go home. Why don’t we all go home?”\n“That’s a good idea,” I got up. “Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.”\n“I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.”\n“Your wife doesn’t love you,” said Gatsby. “She’s never loved you. She loves me.”\n“You must be crazy!” exclaimed Tom automatically.\nGatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.\n“She never loved you, do you hear?” he cried. “She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone except me!”\nAt this point Jordan and I tried to go, but Tom and Gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that we remain—as though neither of them had anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emotions.\n“Sit down, Daisy,” Tom’s voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal note. “What’s been going on? I want to hear all about it.”\n“I told you what’s been going on,” said Gatsby. “Going on for five years—and you didn’t know.”\nTom turned to Daisy sharply.\n“You’ve been seeing this fellow for five years?”\n“Not seeing,” said Gatsby. “No, we couldn’t meet. But both of us loved each other all that time, old sport, and you didn’t know. I used to laugh sometimes”—but there was no laughter in his eyes—“to think that you didn’t know.”\n“Oh—that’s all.” Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman and leaned back in his chair.\n“You’re crazy!” he exploded. “I can’t speak about what happened five years ago, because I didn’t know Daisy then—and I’ll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door. But all the rest of that’s a God damned lie. Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now.”\n“No,” said Gatsby, shaking his head.\n“She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her head and doesn’t know what she’s doing.” He nodded sagely. “And what’s more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time.”\n“You’re revolting,” said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice, dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: “Do you know why we left Chicago? I’m surprised that they didn’t treat you to the story of that little spree.”\nGatsby walked over and stood beside her.\n“Daisy, that’s all over now,” he said earnestly. “It doesn’t matter any more. Just tell him the truth—that you never loved him—and it’s all wiped out forever.”\nShe looked at him blindly. “Why—how could I love him—possibly?”\n“You never loved him.”\nShe hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal, as though she realized at last what she was doing—and as though she had never, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done now. It was too late.\n“I never loved him,” she said, with perceptible reluctance.\n“Not at Kapiolani?” demanded Tom suddenly.\n“No.”\nFrom the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up on hot waves of air.\n“Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry?” There was a husky tenderness in his tone… “Daisy?”\n“Please don’t.” Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it. She looked at Gatsby. “There, Jay,” she said—but her hand as she tried to light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette and the burning match on the carpet.\n“Oh, you want too much!” she cried to Gatsby. “I love you now—isn’t that enough? I can’t help what’s past.” She began to sob helplessly. “I did love him once—but I loved you too.”\nGatsby’s eyes opened and closed.\n“You loved me too?” he repeated.\n“Even that’s a lie,” said Tom savagely. “She didn’t know you were alive. Why—there’s things between Daisy and me that you’ll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget.”\nThe words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.\n“I want to speak to Daisy alone,” he insisted. “She’s all excited now—”\n“Even alone I can’t say I never loved Tom,” she admitted in a pitiful voice. “It wouldn’t be true.”\n“Of course it wouldn’t,” agreed Tom.\nShe turned to her husband.\n“As if it mattered to you,” she said.\n“Of course it matters. I’m going to take better care of you from now on.”\n“You don’t understand,” said Gatsby, with a touch of panic. “You’re not going to take care of her any more.”\n“I’m not?” Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to control himself now. “Why’s that?”\n“Daisy’s leaving you.”\n“Nonsense.”\n“I am, though,” she said with a visible effort.\n“She’s not leaving me!” Tom’s words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby. “Certainly not for a common swindler who’d have to steal the ring he put on her finger.”\n“I won’t stand this!” cried Daisy. “Oh, please let’s get out.”\n“Who are you, anyhow?” broke out Tom. “You’re one of that bunch that hangs around with Meyer Wolfshiem—that much I happen to know. I’ve made a little investigation into your affairs—and I’ll carry it further tomorrow.”\n“You can suit yourself about that, old sport,” said Gatsby steadily.\n“I found out what your ‘drugstores’ were.” He turned to us and spoke rapidly. “He and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of side-street drugstores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter. That’s one of his little stunts. I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw him, and I wasn’t far wrong.”\n“What about it?” said Gatsby politely. “I guess your friend Walter Chase wasn’t too proud to come in on it.”\n“And you left him in the lurch, didn’t you? You let him go to jail for a month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the subject of you.”\n“He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old sport.”\n“Don’t you call me ‘old sport’!” cried Tom. Gatsby said nothing. “Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but Wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth.”\nThat unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby’s face.\n“That drugstore business was just small change,” continued Tom slowly, “but you’ve got something on now that Walter’s afraid to tell me about.”\nI glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her husband, and at Jordan, who had begun to balance an invisible but absorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back to Gatsby—and was startled at his expression. He looked—and this is said in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden—as if he had “killed a man.” For a moment the set of his face could be described in just that fantastic way.\nIt passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been made. But with every word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave that up, and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room.\nThe voice begged again to go.",

The tension between them was palpable, a thick fog of unspoken grievances and shattered dreams. Tom Buchanan, with his usual arrogance and disdain, looked down at her, his eyes cold and unyielding. “You don’t know what you’re talking about, Daisy,” he sneered, his voice dripping with condescension. “You think you can just walk away from everything we’ve built?” But Daisy shook her head, tears welling up in her eyes. “It’s not about what we’ve built, Tom. It’s about what we’ve destroyed. I can’t live like this anymore, pretending everything is fine when it’s not.” The room seemed to close in around them, the weight of their history pressing down like a suffocating shroud. Outside, the city lights flickered, indifferent to the turmoil within. Gatsby’s name lingered in the air, a ghost haunting their fractured lives. Tom’s jaw clenched, his pride wounded by her defiance. “You’re making a mistake,” he warned, but Daisy was resolute. “Maybe,” she whispered, “but it’s my mistake to make.” With that, she turned away, the sound of her footsteps echoing through the empty halls, leaving Tom alone with his bitterness and regret. The great facade of their lives was crumbling, and nothing would ever be the same again."

          "text_segment": "The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the ash-heaps was the principal witness at the inquest. He had slept through the heat until after five, when he strolled over to the garage, and found George Wilson sick in his office—really sick, pale as his own pale hair and shaking all over. Michaelis advised him to go to bed, but Wilson refused, saying that he’d miss a lot of business if he did. While his neighbour was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke out overhead.\n“I’ve got my wife locked in up there,” explained Wilson calmly. “She’s going to stay there till the day after tomorrow, and then we’re going to move away.”\nMichaelis was astonished; they had been neighbours for four years, and Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement. Generally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn’t working, he sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed along the road. When anyone spoke to him he invariably laughed in an agreeable, colourless way. He was his wife’s man and not his own.\nSo naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson wouldn’t say a word—instead he began to throw curious, suspicious glances at his visitor and ask him what he’d been doing at certain times on certain days. Just as the latter was getting uneasy, some workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant, and Michaelis took the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he didn’t. He supposed he forgot to, that’s all. When he came outside again, a little after seven, he was reminded of the conversation because he heard Mrs. Wilson’s voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in the garage.\n“Beat me!” he heard her cry. “Throw me down and beat me, you dirty little coward!”\nA moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and shouting—before he could move from his door the business was over.\nThe “death car” as the newspapers called it, didn’t stop; it came out of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, and then disappeared around the next bend. Mavro Michaelis wasn’t even sure of its colour—he told the first policeman that it was light green. The other car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark blood with the dust.\nMichaelis and this man reached her first, but when they had torn open her shirtwaist, still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap, and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped a little at the corners, as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long.",

            "prefix-probing": "The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the ash-heaps was the principal witness at the inquest. He gave a detailed account of the events leading up to the tragic accident that claimed Myrtle Wilson's life. Michaelis described how he had seen Myrtle and Tom Buchanan together earlier that day, their interaction tense and charged with an unspoken urgency. Later, he recounted hearing a loud crash and rushing outside to find Myrtle lying lifeless on the road, struck by a yellow car that sped away without stopping.\n\nThe inquest was held in a small, crowded room filled with curious onlookers and somber relatives. The coroner meticulously examined the evidence, questioning witnesses and piecing together the sequence of events. Michaelis's testimony was crucial in establishing the circumstances of the accident, painting a vivid picture of the chaotic scene and the immediate aftermath.\n\nAs the proceedings continued, the focus shifted to the identity of the driver. Suspicion quickly fell upon Jay Gatsby, whose yellow car was known to be in the vicinity at the time. Gatsby, however, maintained his innocence, insisting that he was not behind the wheel when Myrtle was struck. His calm demeanor and unwavering resolve in the face of mounting pressure only deepened the mystery surrounding the incident.\n\nNick Carraway, Gatsby's close friend and confidant, found himself torn between loyalty and the harsh realities unfolding before him. He observed the unraveling of Gatsby's carefully constructed world, witnessing the devastating consequences of secrets and lies. The inquest revealed the complex web of relationships and betrayals that had led to this moment, exposing the fragility of the American Dream and the moral decay lurking beneath the glittering surface of wealth and privilege.\n\nTom Buchanan, Myrtle's husband, was also called to testify. His testimony was marked by bitterness and resentment, as he grappled with the loss of his wife and the revelations of her infidelity. Tom's aggressive demeanor and accusatory tone added a layer of tension to the proceedings, highlighting the deep divisions and conflicts that permeated the lives of those involved.\n\nThroughout the inquest, the atmosphere was heavy with grief and anger. The community grappled with the shock of the tragedy, struggling to make sense of the senseless loss. The legal process sought to assign blame and deliver justice, but the emotional wounds ran deeper than any verdict could heal.\n\nIn the end, the inquest concluded with a verdict of accidental death, absolving Gatsby of direct responsibility. Yet, the shadow of the incident lingered, casting a pall over the lives of all connected to the event. Gatsby's dream, once vibrant and full of promise, was irrevocably shattered, leaving behind a legacy of sorrow and unfulfilled longing.\n\nThe young Greek, Michaelis, returned to his coffee joint, carrying the weight of what he had witnessed. The ash-heaps beside his establishment seemed to symbolize the remnants of a world consumed by ambition and desire, a world where innocence was lost and dreams were reduced to ashes. As the sun set over the valley of ashes, the characters in this tragic tale were left to confront the consequences of their choices, forever changed by the events that unfolded on that fateful day."

Wilson’ll have a little business at last.”\nHe slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping, until, as we came nearer, the hushed, intent faces of the people at the garage door made him automatically put on the brakes.\n“We’ll take a look,” he said doubtfully, “just a look.”\nI became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly from the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coupé and walked toward the door resolved itself into the words “Oh, my God!” uttered over and over in a gasping moan.\n“There’s some bad trouble here,” said Tom excitedly.\nHe reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage, which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging metal basket overhead. Then he made a harsh sound in his throat, and with a violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through.\nThe circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it was a minute before I could see anything at all. Then new arrivals deranged the line, and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.\nMyrtle Wilson’s body, wrapped in a blanket, and then in another blanket, as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night, lay on a worktable by the wall, and Tom, with his back to us, was bending over it, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down names with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I couldn’t find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed clamorously through the bare garage—then I saw Wilson standing on the raised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to the doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low voice and attempting, from time to time, to lay a hand on his shoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall, and then jerk back to the light again, and he gave out incessantly his high, horrible call:\n“Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!”\nPresently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and, after staring around the garage with glazed eyes, addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the policeman.\n“M-a-v—” the policeman was saying, “—o—”\n“No, r—” corrected the man, “M-a-v-r-o—”\n“Listen to me!” muttered Tom fiercely.\n“r—” said the policeman, “o—”\n“g—”\n“g—” He looked up as Tom’s broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder. “What you want, fella?”\n“What happened?—that’s what I want to know.”\n“Auto hit her. Ins’antly killed.”\n“Instantly killed,” repeated Tom, staring.\n“She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn’t even stopus car.”\n“There was two cars,” said Michaelis, “one comin’, one goin’, see?”\n“Going where?” asked the policeman keenly.\n“One goin’ each way. Well, she”—his hand rose toward the blankets but stopped halfway and fell to his side—“she ran out there an’ the one comin’ from N’York knock right into her, goin’ thirty or forty miles an hour.”\n“What’s the name of this place here?” demanded the officer.\n“Hasn’t got any name.”\nA pale well-dressed negro stepped near.\n“It was a yellow car,” he said, “big yellow car. New.”\n“See the accident?” asked the policeman.\n“No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster’n forty. Going fifty, sixty.”\n“Come here and let’s have your name. Look out now. I want to get his name.”\nSome words of this conversation must have reached Wilson, swaying in the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his grasping cries:\n“You don’t have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of car it was!”\nWatching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten under his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and, standing in front of him, seized him firmly by the upper arms.\n“You’ve got to pull yourself together,” he said with soothing gruffness.\nWilson’s eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.\n“Listen,” said Tom, shaking him a little. “I just got here a minute ago, from New York. I was bringing you that coupé we’ve been talking about. That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn’t mine—do you hear? I haven’t seen it all afternoon.”\nOnly the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said, but the policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent eyes.\n“What’s all that?” he demanded.\n“I’m a friend of his.” Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on Wilson’s body. “He says he knows the car that did it… It was a yellow car.”\nSome dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.\n“And what colour’s your car?”\n“It’s a blue car, a coupé.”\n“We’ve come straight from New York,” I said.\nSomeone who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this, and the policeman turned away.\n“Now, if you’ll let me have that name again correct—”\nPicking up Wilson like a doll, Tom carried him into the office, set him down in a chair, and came back.\n“If somebody’ll come here and sit with him,” he snapped authoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the door on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the table. As he passed close to me he whispered: “Let’s get out.”\nSelf-consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we pushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor, case in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.\nTom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend—then his foot came down hard, and the coupé raced along through the night. In a little while I heard a low husky sob, and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face.\n“The God damned coward!” he whimpered.",

The lawns were crowded with people, and the music from the orchestra floated over the grounds, mingling with the laughter and chatter of the guests. It was one of Gatsby's legendary parties, the kind that had become the talk of the town. As we approached, the grandeur of the mansion became more apparent—the sprawling estate, the glittering lights, and the endless stream of well-dressed men and women moving about like a living, breathing organism.\n\nInside, the rooms were filled with the clinking of glasses and the hum of conversation. The air was thick with the scent of flowers and expensive perfumes. Gatsby himself was a figure of mystery and charm, standing apart from the crowd yet commanding attention with his quiet confidence. He greeted us with a warm smile, his eyes shining with a mixture of hope and melancholy.\n\nThe evening unfolded with a series of encounters—old friends, new acquaintances, and the ever-present undercurrent of longing that seemed to permeate the atmosphere. As the night deepened, the revelry grew more intense, the music louder, and the laughter more uninhibited. Yet beneath the surface, there was a sense of something unspoken, a tension that hinted at the fragility of the world Gatsby had created.\n\nIn the midst of the celebration, I found myself drawn to the figure of Daisy Buchanan, whose presence seemed to illuminate the room. Her laughter was like a melody, and her eyes held a depth that spoke of dreams and disappointments. The connection between Gatsby and Daisy was palpable, a silent conversation that spoke volumes about the past and the possibilities of the future.\n\nAs the night wore on, the party began to wane, and the guests slowly dispersed into the early morning hours. The mansion, once alive with energy, grew quiet, and the first light of dawn cast a soft glow over the grounds. It was a moment of stillness, a brief respite before the inevitable return to reality.\n\nReflecting on the evening, I realized that Gatsby's parties were more than just social gatherings—they were a manifestation of his desire to recapture a lost time, to create a world where dreams could come true. Yet, like all dreams, they were fragile and fleeting, destined to fade with the morning light."

          "text_segment": "The Buchanans’ house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling trees. Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor, where two windows bloomed with light among the vines.\n“Daisy’s home,” he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and frowned slightly.\n“I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There’s nothing we can do tonight.”\nA change had come over him, and he spoke gravely, and with decision. As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of the situation in a few brisk phrases.\n“I’ll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you’re waiting you and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some supper—if you want any.” He opened the door. “Come in.”\n“No, thanks. But I’d be glad if you’d order me the taxi. I’ll wait outside.”\nJordan put her hand on my arm.\n“Won’t you come in, Nick?”\n“No, thanks.”\nI was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan lingered for a moment more.\n“It’s only half-past nine,” she said.\nI’d be damned if I’d go in; I’d had enough of all of them for one day, and suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of this in my expression, for she turned abruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the house. I sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler’s voice calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the house, intending to wait by the gate.\nI hadn’t gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from between two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird by that time, because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon.\n“What are you doing?” I inquired.\n“Just standing here, old sport.”\nSomehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was going to rob the house in a moment; I wouldn’t have been surprised to see sinister faces, the faces of “Wolfshiem’s people,” behind him in the dark shrubbery.\n“Did you see any trouble on the road?” he asked after a minute.\n“Yes.”\nHe hesitated.\n“Was she killed?”\n“Yes.”\n“I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It’s better that the shock should all come at once. She stood it pretty well.”\nHe spoke as if Daisy’s reaction was the only thing that mattered.\n“I got to West Egg by a side road,” he went on, “and left the car in my garage. I don’t think anybody saw us, but of course I can’t be sure.”\nI disliked him so much by this time that I didn’t find it necessary to tell him he was wrong.\n“Who was the woman?” he inquired.\n“Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did it happen?”\n“Well, I tried to swing the wheel—” He broke off, and suddenly I guessed at the truth.\n“Was Daisy driving?”\n“Yes,” he said after a moment, “but of course I’ll say I was. You see, when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to drive—and this woman rushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute, but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second my hand reached the wheel I felt the shock—it must have killed her instantly.”\n“It ripped her open—”\n“Don’t tell me, old sport.” He winced. “Anyhow—Daisy stepped on it. I tried to make her stop, but she couldn’t, so I pulled on the emergency brake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.\n“She’ll be all right tomorrow,” he said presently. “I’m just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon. She’s locked herself into her room, and if he tries any brutality she’s going to turn the light out and on again.”\n“He won’t touch her,” I said. “He’s not thinking about her.”\n“I don’t trust him, old sport.”\n“How long are you going to wait?”\n“All night, if necessary. Anyhow, till they all go to bed.”\nA new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy had been driving. He might think he saw a connection in it—he might think anything. I looked at the house; there were two or three bright windows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy’s room on the ground floor.\n“You wait here,” I said. “I’ll see if there’s any sign of a commotion.”\nI walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel softly, and tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains were open, and I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where we had dined that June night three months before, I came to a small rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window. The blind was drawn, but I found a rift at the sill.\nDaisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table, with a plate of cold fried chicken between them, and two bottles of ale. He was talking intently across the table at her, and in his earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own. Once in a while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.\nThey weren’t happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the ale—and yet they weren’t unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture, and anybody would have said that they were conspiring together.\nAs I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the dark road toward the house. Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in the drive.\n“Is it all quiet up there?” he asked anxiously.\n“Yes, it’s all quiet.” I hesitated. “You’d better come home and get some sleep.”\nHe shook his head.\n“I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport.”\nHe put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the moonlight—watching over nothing.",

            "prefix-probing": "The Buchanans’ house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling trees. The windows were bright with the warm glow of the evening, casting long shadows across the manicured lawn. As we approached, the sound of laughter and music drifted through the open doors, mingling with the soft clinking of glasses and the murmur of conversation. The grandeur of the mansion was undeniable, its white columns standing tall against the night sky, a symbol of old wealth and privilege.\n\nInside, the air was thick with the scent of expensive perfume and the faint aroma of cigars. Guests in elegant attire moved gracefully through the rooms, their faces illuminated by the flickering light of chandeliers. The atmosphere was one of effortless sophistication, yet beneath the surface, there was an undercurrent of tension that seemed to ripple through the crowd.\n\nTom Buchanan stood near the fireplace, his imposing figure commanding attention. His voice was loud and confident as he engaged in a heated discussion about politics, his opinions unwavering and forceful. Daisy, radiant and ethereal, floated through the room like a delicate butterfly, her laughter light and musical, yet tinged with a hint of melancholy. Nick Carraway, our narrator, observed the scene with a mixture of fascination and unease, his keen eyes noting the subtle interactions and unspoken emotions that filled the space.\n\nAs the evening progressed, the party grew livelier. Jazz music poured from the gramophone, and couples took to the dance floor, their movements fluid and carefree. Yet, amidst the revelry, there was a sense of impending doom, a feeling that the night’s gaiety was but a fragile veneer masking deeper troubles.\n\nGatsby, the enigmatic host, remained somewhat apart from the crowd. His smile was genuine but reserved, his eyes searching the room as if seeking something elusive. When he finally approached Daisy, their reunion was charged with a mixture of joy and tension, a moment suspended in time that spoke volumes about their complicated past and uncertain future.\n\nThe night wore on, and the guests began to drift away, leaving behind a silence that was both peaceful and unsettling. The grandeur of the Buchanans’ house seemed to fade into the darkness, a reminder of the transient nature of wealth and happiness. As we departed, the rustling trees whispered secrets of love, loss, and the relentless passage of time, echoing the themes that permeated the lives of those who inhabited this world of illusion and desire."

INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The timing of the narrator’s visit is inaccurately described as \"daybreak\" rather than the more ambiguous time suggested in the original.\n- The completion inaccurately describes Gatsby’s location and demeanor upon the narrator’s arrival, as well as his actions (holding a glass, looking at the water, smiling), which do not match the original.\n- The dialogue is altered, with the narrator asking if \"she came back,\" which is not the original exchange.\n- The description of the house as empty and desolate, with covered furniture and darkened windows except for one, is not consistent with the original details.\n- The sequence of searching for cigarettes in the kitchen is inaccurate, as is the omission of the piano incident and the description of dust and mustiness.\n- The final depiction of Gatsby’s gaze fixed on the horizon is an invented reflection not present in the original ending."

            "prefix-probing": "I couldn’t sleep all night; a foghorn was groaning incessantly on the Sound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage, frightening dreams. At dawn, I rose and went out to the veranda, where the air was cool and sharp, carrying the faint scent of the sea. The morning light revealed the vastness of the bay, shimmering under the pale sun, and the distant city skyline stood like a mirage against the horizon.\n\nAs I stood there, my thoughts drifted back to Gatsby, to the lavish parties and the enigmatic smile that never quite reached his eyes. The green light at the end of Daisy’s dock seemed to flicker in the morning mist, a beacon of hope and longing that had haunted him for years. I wondered if he was still out there, chasing that elusive dream, or if the night had finally claimed him.\n\nThe world felt heavy with unspoken truths and shattered illusions. The grandeur of the Jazz Age, with its glittering facades and hollow promises, lay bare in the quiet aftermath. I thought of the people I had met, their desires and disappointments intertwined like the threads of a complex tapestry.\n\nIn that moment, I realized that the past could never be recaptured, no matter how fervently one might wish it. The future remained uncertain, a vast expanse waiting to be shaped by choices yet to be made. And as the sun climbed higher, I resolved to face whatever came with open eyes and a steady heart."

          "text_segment": "It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with Dan Cody—told it to me because “Jay Gatsby” had broken up like glass against Tom’s hard malice, and the long secret extravaganza was played out. I think that he would have acknowledged anything now, without reserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy.\nShe was the first “nice” girl he had ever known. In various unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people, but always with indiscernible barbed wire between. He found her excitingly desirable. He went to her house, at first with other officers from Camp Taylor, then alone. It amazed him—he had never been in such a beautiful house before. But what gave it an air of breathless intensity, was that Daisy lived there—it was as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it, a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors, and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year’s shining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered. It excited him, too, that many men had already loved Daisy—it increased her value in his eyes. He felt their presence all about the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions.\nBut he knew that he was in Daisy’s house by a colossal accident. However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders. So he made the most of his time. He took what he could get, ravenously and unscrupulously—eventually he took Daisy one still October night, took her because he had no real right to touch her hand.\nHe might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under false pretences. I don’t mean that he had traded on his phantom millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he let her believe that he was a person from much the same strata as herself—that he was fully able to take care of her. As a matter of fact, he had no such facilities—he had no comfortable family standing behind him, and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the world.\nBut he didn’t despise himself and it didn’t turn out as he had imagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go—but now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail. He knew that Daisy was extraordinary, but he didn’t realize just how extraordinary a “nice” girl could be. She vanished into her rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby—nothing. He felt married to her, that was all.\nWhen they met again, two days later, it was Gatsby who was breathless, who was, somehow, betrayed. Her porch was bright with the bought luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth. She had caught a cold, and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever, and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor.\n“I can’t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her, old sport. I even hoped for a while that she’d throw me over, but she didn’t, because she was in love with me too. She thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her… Well, there I was, way off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden I didn’t care. What was the use of doing great things if I could have a better time telling her what I was going to do?”\nOn the last afternoon before he went abroad, he sat with Daisy in his arms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day, with fire in the room and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he changed his arm a little, and once he kissed her dark shining hair. The afternoon had made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised. They had never been closer in their month of love, nor communicated more profoundly one with another, than when she brushed silent lips against his coat’s shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were asleep.",

            "prefix-probing": "He spoke with a kind of wistful reverence, as if recalling a dream that had once seemed so vivid and real, yet now lay shattered beneath the weight of reality. \"Dan Cody was a man of wealth and adventure,\" Gatsby began, his eyes distant, \"a copper magnate who sailed the seas in his yacht, the Tuolomee. I was just a young man then, full of ambition and longing for a life beyond the confines of my humble beginnings.\"\n\nGatsby described how he had first encountered Cody, a chance meeting that would alter the course of his life. Working as a fisherman along the shores of Lake Superior, Gatsby had spotted the yacht anchored nearby and, driven by curiosity and a yearning for something greater, he had rowed out to it. Cody, impressed by the young man's determination and spirit, took him under his wing, offering him a position aboard the yacht.\n\nFor five years, Gatsby sailed with Cody, absorbing the manners and habits of the wealthy elite. He learned to navigate not only the seas but also the intricate social currents that governed the world of the rich. Yet, despite the proximity to wealth, Gatsby never inherited Cody's fortune; the old man’s mistress had intervened, and the inheritance was lost to Gatsby. Still, the experience left an indelible mark on him, fueling his desire to reinvent himself and claim a place among the privileged.\n\nAs Gatsby recounted this tale, I could see the layers of his character unfold—the relentless hope, the pain of lost opportunity, and the unyielding determination to forge a new identity. It was a story of transformation, of a man who had shed his past like a worn garment to become the enigmatic figure who now stood before me.\n\nThe night air was thick with the scent of jasmine and the distant hum of the city, a backdrop to Gatsby's confession. He spoke of his dreams with a fervor that was both inspiring and tragic, revealing the fragile humanity beneath his polished exterior. \"I wanted to be someone,\" he said softly, \"someone who could command respect and love, who could rewrite the story of his life.\"\n\nYet, as the tale concluded, the reality of his situation settled over us like a shadow. The glittering facade of Gatsby's world was built on illusions and unfulfilled desires. The past, with its secrets and scars, remained an ever-present specter, haunting the present and shaping the future.\n\nIn that moment, I understood the profound loneliness that accompanied Gatsby's grandeur—the isolation of a man caught between two worlds, belonging fully to neither. His story was a testament to the American Dream's promise and its peril, a narrative of hope entwined with despair.\n\nAs dawn approached, the city began to stir, and the first light cast a pale glow over the horizon. Gatsby's story lingered in the air, a poignant reminder of the complexities beneath the surface of wealth and glamour. It was a night that revealed the true essence of Jay Gatsby—a man defined not by his riches, but by his relentless pursuit of a dream that, like the green light across the bay, remained just out of reach."

He was a captain before he went to the front, and following the Argonne battles he got his majority and the command of the divisional machine-guns. After the armistice he tried frantically to get home, but some complication or misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He was worried now—there was a quality of nervous despair in Daisy’s letters. She didn’t see why he couldn’t come. She was feeling the pressure of the world outside, and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all.\nFor Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes. All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the “Beale Street Blues” while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust. At the grey tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low, sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the floor.\nThrough this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men, and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening-dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed. And all the time something within her was crying for a decision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately—and the decision must be made by some force—of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality—that was close at hand.\nThat force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom Buchanan. There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his position, and Daisy was flattered. Doubtless there was a certain struggle and a certain relief. The letter reached Gatsby while he was still at Oxford.\nIt was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of the windows downstairs, filling the house with grey-turning, gold-turning light. The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. There was a slow, pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool, lovely day.\n“I don’t think she ever loved him.” Gatsby turned around from a window and looked at me challengingly. “You must remember, old sport, she was very excited this afternoon. He told her those things in a way that frightened her—that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper. And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying.”\nHe sat down gloomily.\n“Of course she might have loved him just for a minute, when they were first married—and loved me more even then, do you see?”\nSuddenly he came out with a curious remark.\n“In any case,” he said, “it was just personal.”\nWhat could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in his conception of the affair that couldn’t be measured?\nHe came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their wedding trip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to Louisville on the last of his army pay. He stayed there a week, walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through the November night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which they had driven in her white car. Just as Daisy’s house had always seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses, so his idea of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded with a melancholy beauty.\nHe left feeling that if he had searched harder, he might have found her—that he was leaving her behind. The day-coach—he was penniless now—was hot. He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a folding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar buildings moved by. Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street.\nThe track curved and now it was going away from the sun, which, as it sank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing city where she had drawn her breath. He stretched out his hand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of the spot that she had made lovely for him. But it was all going by too fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of it, the freshest and the best, forever.",

            "prefix-probing": "He did extraordinarily well in the war. His courage and leadership earned him several commendations, and he returned home with a sense of pride and accomplishment. Yet, beneath the surface, the experiences he endured left an indelible mark on his soul. The war had changed him in ways that were not immediately visible to those around him. Upon his return, he found himself drawn to the glittering allure of the Roaring Twenties, a world of jazz, opulence, and endless possibility. It was in this vibrant milieu that he sought to reinvent himself, to escape the shadows of his past and embrace a new identity.\n\nHe moved to West Egg, a place teeming with the nouveau riche, where mansions rose like monuments to ambition and excess. Among these was his own grand estate, a sprawling mansion that overlooked the bay, its windows shimmering like jewels in the night. Here, he hosted lavish parties that became the talk of the town, gatherings filled with music, laughter, and the clinking of champagne glasses. Yet, despite the revelry, there was an undercurrent of loneliness that permeated his life, a yearning for something more profound than the fleeting pleasures of wealth and status.\n\nHis neighbor, a man named Nick Carraway, found himself both fascinated and perplexed by the enigmatic figure. Nick, a recent transplant from the Midwest, was drawn into the orbit of this mysterious host, eager to uncover the truths hidden behind the facade of glamour. Through their conversations, Nick learned of a past love, a woman whose memory haunted him and fueled his relentless pursuit of success. This love, Daisy Buchanan, was now married to Tom, a man of old money and unyielding pride.\n\nThe tension between these characters unfolded against the backdrop of a society grappling with change and disillusionment. The American Dream, once a beacon of hope and opportunity, revealed its darker facets—greed, corruption, and the hollow pursuit of pleasure. As the story progressed, the illusions shattered, exposing the fragility of human desires and the consequences of choices made in the name of love and ambition.\n\nIn the end, the war hero's quest for happiness proved elusive. The glittering parties and grand gestures could not fill the void left by lost time and unfulfilled dreams. His story became a poignant reflection on the complexities of identity, the passage of time, and the enduring impact of the past on the present. Through his journey, \"The Great Gatsby\" offers a timeless exploration of the human condition, inviting readers to contemplate the true meaning of success and the cost of chasing illusions."

First he nodded politely, and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding smile, as if we’d been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time. His gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of colour against the white steps, and I thought of the night when I first came to his ancestral home, three months before. The lawn and drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his corruption—and he had stood on those steps, concealing his incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye.\nI thanked him for his hospitality.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the specific sequence of train departures and the narrator's actions regarding missing them, condensing these events into a single statement rather than showing the progression.\n- The dialogue between the narrator and Gatsby is abbreviated, with some exchanges either missing or overly summarized, reducing the sense of back-and-forth present in the original.\n- The completion does not include the narrator's internal reflection about not wanting to leave Gatsby and his lack of motivation for work, which is a significant emotional element in the original.\n\n2.

The air was crisp, carrying the faint scent of dew and blooming flowers. We settled into the wicker chairs, the gentle creak of the porch swing accompanying the soft murmur of distant voices from the neighboring houses. Across the street, the garden was alive with the vibrant colors of tulips and daffodils, their petals glistening with droplets of morning moisture.\n\nAs we sipped our coffee, the tranquility of the moment was punctuated by the arrival of a sleek, black automobile that rolled up the driveway with a smooth purr. The driver, a tall man in a tailored suit, stepped out and approached the house with a confident stride. His presence seemed to command attention, and we exchanged curious glances, wondering about his purpose.\n\nHe introduced himself as Mr. Gatsby, a neighbor who had recently moved into the grand mansion at the end of the lane. His smile was warm, yet there was an air of mystery about him that intrigued us. He spoke of lavish parties and the allure of the city, painting vivid pictures of a world filled with glamour and excitement.\n\nAs the morning wore on, more guests arrived, each bringing their own stories and laughter to the gathering. The porch became a hub of conversation and camaraderie, the worries of the world momentarily forgotten. Children played nearby, their joyous shouts mingling with the melodies of a distant jazz band.\n\nThe day unfolded with a sense of possibility, the promise of new friendships and adventures shimmering in the sunlight. It was a moment suspended in time, a brief respite from the complexities of life, where hope and happiness seemed within reach. And as the sun climbed higher, casting golden rays upon the porch, we felt a renewed sense of optimism, ready to embrace whatever the future might hold."

Then:\n“However—I want to see you.”\n“I want to see you, too.”\n“Suppose I don’t go to Southampton, and come into town this afternoon?”\n“No—I don’t think this afternoon.”\n“Very well.”\n“It’s impossible this afternoon.

The noise of the bustling streets below filtered faintly into the room, a reminder of the relentless pace of life beyond these walls. I rubbed my eyes and glanced at the clock; it was nearly noon. The day had slipped away unnoticed, swallowed by the monotony of numbers and figures that meant little to me. I thought about Gatsby, about the parties and the laughter, the music that seemed to float endlessly through the summer nights. How different his world was from mine, yet how intertwined our fates had become. I wondered if he was still out there, chasing his elusive dream, or if the shadows of the past had finally caught up with him. The city held its secrets close, and I was just a spectator, caught between the glittering illusion and the harsh reality. As I stood and stretched, I resolved to find out more, to peel back the layers of mystery that surrounded Gatsby and his world. The afternoon stretched ahead, full of possibilities and unanswered questions, and I was determined to uncover the truth, no matter where it might lead."

She must have broken her rule against drinking that night, for when she arrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had already gone to Flushing. When they convinced her of this, she immediately fainted, as if that was the intolerable part of the affair. Someone, kind or curious, took her in his car and drove her in the wake of her sister’s body.\nUntil long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front of the garage, while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on the couch inside. For a while the door of the office was open, and everyone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it. Finally someone said it was a shame, and closed the door.

            "prefix-probing": "I called Gatsby’s house a few minutes later, but the line was busy. The evening was settling in, and the sky was a deepening shade of blue, the kind that made the lights of West Egg sparkle like distant stars. I stood on the porch, the cool breeze rustling the leaves of the garden, and wondered what had kept Gatsby so occupied. The house, with its grand façade and glowing windows, seemed alive with the promise of another lavish party, yet tonight it felt different—quieter, more intimate.\n\nI decided to walk around the grounds, hoping to catch a glimpse of Gatsby or perhaps one of his guests. The path was lined with blooming flowers, their fragrance mingling with the crisp night air. As I wandered, I thought about the stories I had heard about Gatsby—his mysterious past, his immense wealth, and the rumors that swirled like smoke around his name. But none of that mattered now. What mattered was the man himself, the enigma who had invited me into his world.\n\nSuddenly, I heard footsteps behind me. Turning, I saw Gatsby approaching, his expression unreadable but his eyes shining with a familiar warmth. \"I’m sorry I missed your call,\" he said, his voice calm and steady. \"There’s been a lot going on tonight.\"\n\nWe walked back toward the house together, the night enveloping us in its quiet embrace. As we entered the grand hall, the music swelled, and the guests welcomed us with smiles and laughter. For a moment, I felt as if I had stepped into a dream, a world where anything was possible and the past could be rewritten.\n\nBut beneath the glittering surface, I sensed a tension, a longing that lingered in Gatsby’s gaze. It was a reminder that even in the midst of celebration, some dreams remain just out of reach."

          "text_segment": "About three o’clock the quality of Wilson’s incoherent muttering changed—he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car. He announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car belonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen.\nBut when he heard himself say this, he flinched and began to cry “Oh, my God!” again in his groaning voice. Michaelis made a clumsy attempt to distract him.\n“How long have you been married, George? Come on there, try and sit still a minute, and answer my question. How long have you been married?”\n“Twelve years.”\n“Ever had any children? Come on, George, sit still—I asked you a question. Did you ever have any children?”\nThe hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light, and whenever Michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him like the car that hadn’t stopped a few hours before. He didn’t like to go into the garage, because the work bench was stained where the body had been lying, so he moved uncomfortably around the office—he knew every object in it before morning—and from time to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep him more quiet.\n“Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George? Maybe even if you haven’t been there for a long time? Maybe I could call up the church and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?”\n“Don’t belong to any.”\n“You ought to have a church, George, for times like this. You must have gone to church once. Didn’t you get married in a church? Listen, George, listen to me. Didn’t you get married in a church?”\n“That was a long time ago.”\nThe effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking—for a moment he was silent. Then the same half-knowing, half-bewildered look came back into his faded eyes.\n“Look in the drawer there,” he said, pointing at the desk.\n“Which drawer?”\n“That drawer—that one.”\nMichaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand. There was nothing in it but a small, expensive dog-leash, made of leather and braided silver. It was apparently new.\n“This?” he inquired, holding it up.\nWilson stared and nodded.\n“I found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell me about it, but I knew it was something funny.”\n“You mean your wife bought it?”\n“She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau.”\nMichaelis didn’t see anything odd in that, and he gave Wilson a dozen reasons why his wife might have bought the dog-leash. But conceivably Wilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle, because he began saying “Oh, my God!” again in a whisper—his comforter left several explanations in the air.\n“Then he killed her,” said Wilson. His mouth dropped open suddenly.\n“Who did?”\n“I have a way of finding out.”\n“You’re morbid, George,” said his friend. “This has been a strain to you and you don’t know what you’re saying. You’d better try and sit quiet till morning.”\n“He murdered her.”\n“It was an accident, George.”\nWilson shook his head. His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened slightly with the ghost of a superior “Hm!”\n“I know,” he said definitely. “I’m one of these trusting fellas and I don’t think any harm to nobody, but when I get to know a thing I know it. It was the man in that car. She ran out to speak to him and he wouldn’t stop.”\nMichaelis had seen this too, but it hadn’t occurred to him that there was any special significance in it. He believed that Mrs. Wilson had been running away from her husband, rather than trying to stop any particular car.\n“How could she of been like that?”\n“She’s a deep one,” said Wilson, as if that answered the question. “Ah-h-h—”\nHe began to rock again, and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in his hand.\n“Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George?”\nThis was a forlorn hope—he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend: there was not enough of him for his wife. He was glad a little later when he noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window, and realized that dawn wasn’t far off. About five o’clock it was blue enough outside to snap off the light.\nWilson’s glazed eyes turned out to the ash-heaps, where small grey clouds took on fantastic shapes and scurried here and there in the faint dawn wind.\n“I spoke to her,” he muttered, after a long silence. “I told her she might fool me but she couldn’t fool God. I took her to the window”—with an effort he got up and walked to the rear window and leaned with his face pressed against it—“and I said ‘God knows what you’ve been doing, everything you’ve been doing. You may fool me, but you can’t fool God!’ ”\nStanding behind him, Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, which had just emerged, pale and enormous, from the dissolving night.\n“God sees everything,” repeated Wilson.\n“That’s an advertisement,” Michaelis assured him. Something made him turn away from the window and look back into the room. But Wilson stood there a long time, his face close to the window pane, nodding into the twilight.",

            "prefix-probing": "About three o’clock the quality of Wilson’s incoherent muttering changed—he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car. His voice, once sharp and frantic, softened into a low, almost reverent tone as he recounted the details of the vehicle that had so tragically altered the course of his life. He spoke of its bright, almost garish color, the way it gleamed under the afternoon sun, and how it had seemed to mock him with its careless speed and reckless abandon.\n\nWilson’s eyes, once wild with grief and confusion, now held a distant, haunted look. He described the car as if it were a living entity, a symbol of the careless extravagance and moral decay that had infiltrated the world around him. The yellow car, he said, was more than just a vehicle; it was a manifestation of the reckless privilege that had destroyed his wife and shattered his own existence.\n\nAs he spoke, the room seemed to grow colder, the weight of his sorrow pressing down on everyone present. The once vibrant and bustling atmosphere of the house had given way to a somber silence, broken only by Wilson’s quiet, mournful voice. He recounted the moments leading up to the accident, the sudden screech of tires, the blinding flash of metal, and the heart-wrenching realization that Myrtle was gone.\n\nHis narrative was fragmented, punctuated by long pauses and moments of choking sobs. Yet, through the haze of his grief, a clear picture emerged of a man consumed by loss and driven to the brink of despair. The yellow car, in his mind, was not just a symbol of death but also of the indifference and cruelty of a society that valued wealth and status over human life.\n\nWilson’s muttering gradually slowed, his voice fading into a whisper as exhaustion overtook him. He sank back into his chair, his body trembling with the weight of his emotions. The room remained silent, the air thick with unspoken sorrow and the lingering presence of tragedy.\n\nIn the days that followed, the yellow car became a focal point of gossip and speculation among the residents of the neighborhood. Whispers circulated about the identity of the driver, the circumstances of the accident, and the implications for those involved. The car itself, once a symbol of luxury and freedom, was now tainted by its association with death and despair.\n\nTom Buchanan, upon hearing of the accident, displayed a mixture of anger and relief. He was furious at the recklessness that had led to Myrtle’s death but also relieved that the scandal would not directly implicate him. His thoughts turned to Daisy, his wife, and the precarious position she now found herself in. The yellow car, he mused, was a dangerous reminder of the fragile veneer of their privileged lives.\n\nDaisy, meanwhile, was consumed by guilt and fear. She had been driving the car at the time of the accident, though she had insisted that Gatsby take the blame to protect her. The weight of this secret pressed heavily on her conscience, and she withdrew into herself, haunted by the consequences of that fateful afternoon.\n\nGatsby, ever the romantic idealist, was determined to shield Daisy from the fallout. He took responsibility for the accident, hoping to preserve the illusion of their love and the possibility of a future together. Yet, beneath his calm exterior, he was tormented by the knowledge that their dreams were built on a foundation of lies and tragedy.\n\nThe yellow car, once a symbol of Gatsby’s wealth and success, had become a harbinger of doom. It represented the collision of dreams and reality, the destructive power of secrets, and the inevitable downfall of those who dared to defy the social order.\n\nAs the days turned into weeks, the aftermath of the accident rippled through the lives of all involved. Wilson’s grief transformed into a quiet, simmering rage. He became obsessed with finding the driver of the yellow car, convinced that justice must be served. His search led him to Gatsby’s mansion, where he confronted the man he believed responsible for Myrtle’s death.\n\nThe confrontation was tense and fraught with emotion. Wilson, broken and desperate, accused Gatsby of callousness and cruelty. Gatsby, in turn, tried to explain the circumstances, but his words fell on deaf ears. The yellow car, the symbol of their intertwined fates, stood silently in the driveway, a mute witness to the tragedy that had unfolded.\n\nIn the end, the yellow car was more than just a vehicle; it was a catalyst for the unraveling of lives and the exposure of hidden truths. It embodied the reckless pursuit of pleasure and the devastating consequences that often accompany it.\n\nThe story of the yellow car serves as a poignant reminder of the fragility of human existence and the perilous nature of dreams built on illusion. It is a testament to the enduring power of loss and the indelible mark that tragedy leaves on the human soul."

It was one of the watchers of the night before who had promised to come back, so he cooked breakfast for three, which he and the other man ate together. Wilson was quieter now, and Michaelis went home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the garage, Wilson was gone.\nHis movements—he was on foot all the time—were afterward traced to Port Roosevelt and then to Gad’s Hill, where he bought a sandwich that he didn’t eat, and a cup of coffee. He must have been tired and walking slowly, for he didn’t reach Gad’s Hill until noon. Thus far there was no difficulty in accounting for his time—there were boys who had seen a man “acting sort of crazy,” and motorists at whom he stared oddly from the side of the road. Then for three hours he disappeared from view. The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis, that he “had a way of finding out,” supposed that he spent that time going from garage to garage thereabout, inquiring for a yellow car. On the other hand, no garage man who had seen him ever came forward, and perhaps he had an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to know. By half-past two he was in West Egg, where he asked someone the way to Gatsby’s house. So by that time he knew Gatsby’s name.\nAt two o’clock Gatsby put on his bathing-suit and left word with the butler that if anyone phoned word was to be brought to him at the pool. He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused his guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him to pump it up. Then he gave instructions that the open car wasn’t to be taken out under any circumstances—and this was strange, because the front right fender needed repair.\nGatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool. Once he stopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he needed help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among the yellowing trees.",

However, the order of some actions, particularly regarding Gatsby's instructions about the car, is shifted from its original placement.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the detail that Michaelis cooked breakfast for three, but only he and the other man ate together, leaving out the explicit mention of Wilson's lack of participation in the meal.\n- The specific time when Wilson reached Gad’s Hill is not accurately reflected; the completion gives an approximate time that does not match the progression in the original.\n- The completion does not mention the detail about the boys who saw a man “acting sort of crazy,” nor does it specify the motorists at whom Wilson stared from the side of the road, instead summarizing these as \"several boys and motorists reported seeing a man acting strangely.\"\n- The completion omits the explicit statement that, up to a certain point, there was no difficulty in accounting for Wilson’s time.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of Gatsby’s actions is altered: in the original, Gatsby gives instructions about the car after retrieving the mattress, but in the completion, this instruction is mentioned at the end, after Gatsby has already left for the pool.\n- The completion provides an inaccurate time for Wilson’s purchase at Gad’s Hill, which does not align with the timeline in the original passage.\n- The completion suggests that Wilson was already in West Egg by half-past two, but the original passage’s sequence of events and timing is more precise and should be maintained.\n- The completion implies that Gatsby told the butler not to let the car be taken out before leaving the house, whereas in the original, this instruction is given after the mattress is pumped up.\n\nOverall, the completion should more closely follow the original sequence of events, maintain accurate timing, and include all relevant details about the characters’ actions and observations."

The night had been long and filled with the kind of tension that clings to the air like a thick fog. He stepped outside, the cool evening breeze brushing against his face, offering a brief respite from the stifling atmosphere inside. The car door opened, and a familiar figure emerged, his face etched with worry and exhaustion. It was Gatsby, his eyes searching the darkness as if looking for something lost.\n\nMichaelis watched silently as Gatsby approached, his movements deliberate yet heavy with an unspoken burden. The two men exchanged a few words, their voices low and urgent, carrying the weight of secrets and regrets. Gatsby’s usual charm was absent, replaced by a somber resolve that unsettled Michaelis.\n\nAs the conversation ended, Gatsby turned back to the car, his silhouette framed by the dim glow of the streetlamp. He paused for a moment, glancing back towards the house where the evening’s events had unfolded. The memories of the day—the laughter, the tension, the heartbreak—seemed to press down on him, a silent reminder of the fragile dreams that had brought him here.\n\nMichaelis remained on the porch, his thoughts swirling with the complexities of the night. The city around them was alive with its usual hum, indifferent to the personal dramas playing out in its shadows. Yet, in this small corner of the world, the lives of a few were intertwined in a delicate dance of hope and despair.\n\nAs the car pulled away, disappearing into the night, Michaelis felt a pang of melancholy. The story unfolding before him was one of ambition and loss, of love and betrayal—a narrative as old as time, yet as fresh as the evening air. He knew that the night was far from over, and that the consequences of the day’s events would ripple through the lives of those involved, shaping their futures in ways none could yet foresee."

I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn’t believe it would come, and perhaps he no longer cared. If that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream. He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about… like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward him through the amorphous trees.\nThe chauffeur—he was one of Wolfshiem’s protégés—heard the shots—afterwards he could only say that he hadn’t thought anything much about them. I drove from the station directly to Gatsby’s house and my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that alarmed anyone. But they knew then, I firmly believe. With scarcely a word said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener, and I hurried down to the pool.\nThere was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other. With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of transit, a thin red circle in the water.\nIt was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener saw Wilson’s body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was complete.",

The morning was gray and overcast, the kind of day that seemed to hold its breath, as if the world itself were waiting for something to happen. Gatsby’s mansion, usually so alive with the hum of music and laughter, was silent except for the occasional creak of the old house settling. Nick Carraway, standing by the window, watched the rain begin to fall in soft, steady drops, blurring the edges of the garden and the distant city skyline.\n\nInside, Daisy Buchanan sat quietly, her eyes distant and unfocused, as if she were somewhere far away, lost in a memory or a dream. Tom, restless and irritable, paced the room, his anger simmering beneath a veneer of control. The tension between them was palpable, a fragile thread stretched taut by secrets and unspoken truths.\n\nGatsby himself was nowhere to be seen. Rumors swirled among the few remaining guests—had he left town? Was he hiding from something? Nick felt a pang of concern; despite Gatsby’s flaws and mysteries, there was something undeniably tragic about the man’s relentless hope.\n\nAs the day wore on, the rain ceased, and a pale sun broke through the clouds, casting a muted light over the estate. The world seemed to exhale, releasing the weight of the night’s anxieties. Yet, beneath the surface, the currents of desire, betrayal, and longing continued to churn, promising that the story was far from over."

A rope stretched across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard, and there were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the pool. Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the expression “madman” as he bent over Wilson’s body that afternoon, and the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper reports next morning.\nMost of those reports were a nightmare—grotesque, circumstantial, eager, and untrue. When Michaelis’s testimony at the inquest brought to light Wilson’s suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade—but Catherine, who might have said anything, didn’t say a word. She showed a surprising amount of character about it too—looked at the coroner with determined eyes under that corrected brow of hers, and swore that her sister had never seen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband, that her sister had been into no mischief whatever. She convinced herself of it, and cried into her handkerchief, as if the very suggestion was more than she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a man “deranged by grief” in order that the case might remain in its simplest form. And it rested there.\nBut all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. I found myself on Gatsby’s side, and alone. From the moment I telephoned news of the catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and every practical question, was referred to me. At first I was surprised and confused; then, as he lay in his house and didn’t move or breathe or speak, hour upon hour, it grew upon me that I was responsible, because no one else was interested—interested, I mean, with that intense personal interest to which everyone has some vague right at the end.\nI called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her instinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away early that afternoon, and taken baggage with them.\n“Left no address?”\n“No.”\n“Say when they’d be back?”\n“No.”\n“Any idea where they are? How I could reach them?”\n“I don’t know. Can’t say.”",

This addition shifts the focus and tone away from the original's emphasis on the repetitive presence of officials and the emotional detachment.\n- The completion introduces a characterization of Catherine as having a 'proud, scornful sweetness' and as a 'devoted sister,' which is not part of the original passage.

INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes the 'madman' comment directly to a detective from East Egg, rather than presenting it as a less certain attribution.\n- The sequence of events is slightly altered, with the inquest and Catherine's testimony presented before the narrator's sense of isolation and responsibility, rather than interwoven as in the original.\n- The completion inaccurately describes Catherine's testimony as being accepted 'without question' and adds invented emotional descriptions not present in the original.\n- The completion simplifies the process of trying to contact Daisy and Tom, omitting the step-by-step questioning and responses that are present in the original passage."

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the detail about little boys discovering they could enter through the narrator's yard, and their specific behavior around the pool.\n- The original includes a reference to someone, possibly a detective, using a particular term over Wilson's body, which sets the tone for the newspaper reports; this nuance is not fully captured.\n- The passage about Catherine's internal conviction and her emotional reaction (crying into her handkerchief) is only partially represented, missing the depth of her self-persuasion and distress.\n- The sense of the narrator's growing feeling of responsibility for Gatsby, and the explanation of why he feels alone in this, is not fully developed.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion places Michaelis's testimony and Catherine's appearance at the inquest in a different order and context than in the original.\n- The completion inaccurately attributes certain actions and dialogue to characters, such as the extended phone conversation and the invented responses from the person answering the phone.\n- The completion misrepresents the narrator's emotional progression, simplifying his realization of responsibility and omitting the gradual development described in the original.\n- The summary of the case as a murder-suicide is an inaccurate simplification of how the original presents the resolution of the case.\n\nOverall, the completion would benefit from removing invented details, restoring omitted emotional and procedural elements, and more closely following the original sequence and focus of events."

But the little boys from the drugstore were there too, and they found that they could come in through the side yard, and they went and stood beside the pool and looked at it.

The whole town was there, clamoring for a glimpse of the man who had thrown such a lavish party and met such a tragic end. But Gatsby’s house, once so full of life and laughter, now stood silent and somber, a stark contrast to the vibrant gatherings it had hosted. The servants had disappeared, and the gardens were overgrown, the fountains dry and cracked. Nick found himself wandering through the empty rooms, feeling the weight of the emptiness that had settled over the place.\n\nHe thought about Gatsby’s life, the mystery that had surrounded him, and the dreams he had chased so relentlessly. Despite the rumors and the gossip, Nick knew there was something genuine about Gatsby’s hope, his belief in the green light and the future that might have been. It was a hope that had ultimately led to his downfall, but also one that made him a tragic figure, caught between reality and illusion.\n\nAs the days passed, the visitors dwindled, and the house grew quieter still. Nick tried to arrange a funeral, but few people came forward to claim Gatsby’s body or pay their respects. The only ones who remained were Nick, Gatsby’s father, and a few loyal friends. The emptiness of the mansion mirrored the emptiness in Nick’s heart as he realized how fleeting and fragile the American Dream could be.\n\nIn the end, Gatsby’s story was a cautionary tale about the pursuit of wealth and status, and the cost of living in a world of illusions. Nick left West Egg with a heavy heart, carrying with him the memories of a man who had dared to dream, and the lessons learned from a summer that had changed everything."

Just trust me and I’ll get somebody for you—”\nMeyer Wolfshiem’s name wasn’t in the phone book. The butler gave me his office address on Broadway, and I called Information, but by the time I had the number it was long after five, and no one answered the phone.\n“Will you ring again?”\n“I’ve rung three times.”\n“It’s very important.”\n“Sorry. I’m afraid no one’s there.”\nI went back to the drawing-room and thought for an instant that they were chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled it. But, though they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with shocked eyes, his protest continued in my brain:\n“Look here, old sport, you’ve got to get somebody for me. You’ve got to try hard. I can’t go through this alone.”\nSomeone started to ask me questions, but I broke away and going upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk—he’d never told me definitely that his parents were dead. But there was nothing—only the picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence, staring down from the wall.\nNext morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem, which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next train. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it. I was sure he’d start when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there’d be a wire from Daisy before noon—but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem arrived; no one arrived except more police and photographers and newspaper men. When the butler brought back Wolfshiem’s answer I began to have a feeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and me against them all.\nDear Mr. Carraway. This has been one of the most terrible shocks of my life to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all. Such a mad act as that man did should make us all think. I cannot come down now as I am tied up in some very important business and cannot get mixed up in this thing now. If there is anything I can do a little later let me know in a letter by Edgar. I hardly know where I am when I hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and out.\nYours truly\nMeyer Wolfshiem\nand then hasty addenda beneath:\nLet me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all.\nWhen the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was calling I thought this would be Daisy at last. But the connection came through as a man’s voice, very thin and far away.\n“This is Slagle speaking…”\n“Yes?” The name was unfamiliar.\n“Hell of a note, isn’t it? Get my wire?”\n“There haven’t been any wires.”\n“Young Parke’s in trouble,” he said rapidly. “They picked him up when he handed the bonds over the counter. They got a circular from New York giving ’em the numbers just five minutes before. What d’you know about that, hey? You never can tell in these hick towns—”\n“Hello!” I interrupted breathlessly. “Look here—this isn’t Mr. Gatsby. Mr. Gatsby’s dead.”\nThere was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an exclamation… then a quick squawk as the connection was broken.",

                "text": "I wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to go into the room where he lay and reassure him, tell him over and over that he needn't be afraid. But I couldn't find a single person to come. I tried to get Meyer Wolfshiem's number. The butler said it was unlisted, but he gave me the address of his office. I called Information and got the number. I called the office after five, but no one answered. I called again and again, and the operator said, \"I'm sorry, sir, but the number is not in service.\" I said, \"But I know it is. It's Meyer Wolfshiem's office.\" She said, \"I'm sorry, sir, but I can't help you.\" I kept thinking, \"Can't you get somebody for me?\" as if Gatsby himself were asking.\n\nI went back to the drawing-room. Presently the butler came in and said he was going to New York with a letter for Wolfshiem, urging him to come. I was sure I would get a wire from Daisy before noon. But neither she nor Wolfshiem came. Instead, more officials arrived—police officers, photographers, newspaper men. They looked at me as if I were a stranger, and I felt their eyes on the empty room where Gatsby had been.\n\nI broke away from them and went to Gatsby's desk. I searched for some clue to his family or friends. All I found was a photograph of Dan Cody, a reminder of Gatsby's past and the man who had shaped his dreams. There was no address, no name, nothing to guide me.\n\nThe butler returned with a note from Wolfshiem. It read:\n\n\"Dear Mr. Carraway:\n\nI was shocked and grieved to hear of Mr. Gatsby's death. I regret that I cannot come to the funeral, as I am engaged in important business. Please keep me informed by letter. I know nothing of his family.\"\n\nBeneath this was a hastily added postscript:\n\n\"Please send any letters to me through Edgar.\"\n\nI felt a fierce loyalty to Gatsby, a defiant stand against the indifference of the world.\n\nThen the telephone rang. I thought it might be Daisy, but it was a man named Slagle from Chicago. He spoke rapidly about a \"Young Parke\" being arrested in a bond scheme, unaware that Gatsby was dead. When I told him the news, there was a stunned silence before the line went dead.",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant portion of the original passage that details the interaction with the telephone operator and the repeated attempts to reach Wolfshiem, including the dialogue exchange about the importance of the call and the operator's responses.\n- The sequence in which the narrator returns to the drawing-room and observes the official visitors is condensed and lacks the original's depiction of their reactions and the narrator's internal response to their presence.\n- The completion rearranges the order of events, placing the butler's trip to New York and the search of Gatsby's desk out of sequence compared to the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the specific internal monologue and imagined protest from Gatsby that is present in the original, which adds emotional depth and urgency to the narrator's actions.\n- The detailed description of the photograph of Dan Cody and its significance is minimized, omitting the sense of history and symbolism attached to it in the original.\n- The original's depiction of the narrator's growing sense of defiance and solidarity with Gatsby is only briefly mentioned and lacks the nuanced build-up found in the source.\n- The completion omits the full content and emotional tone of Wolfshiem's letter, including the expressions of shock, confusion, and the specific instructions about future contact.\n- The original's account of the phone call from Chicago includes more dialogue and a more gradual realization by the caller, which is abbreviated in the completion.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately describes the process of obtaining Wolfshiem's contact information, including the butler's role and the timing of the calls, which does not align with the sequence in the original.\n- The order of events is altered, with the search of Gatsby's desk and the butler's trip to New York occurring at different points than in the original passage.\n- The completion attributes certain actions and feelings to the narrator that are not present in the original, such as the sense of being watched by officials in the drawing-room.\n- The summary of Wolfshiem's letter is less detailed and omits the emotional and confused tone present in the original, as well as the specific addenda written beneath the main letter.\n- The depiction of the phone call from Slagle is simplified, missing the original's pacing, dialogue, and the caller's reaction to the news of Gatsby's death."

            "prefix-probing": "I wanted to get somebody for him. But it was no use. The day was warm and bright, and the air was filled with the scent of freshly cut grass and blooming flowers. Gatsby stood by the window, his eyes fixed on the horizon, as if waiting for something—or someone—that might never come. I could see the tension in his jaw, the way his hands clenched and unclenched at his sides. It was as if the weight of the world rested solely on his shoulders.\n\n\"You don't have to do this alone,\" I said softly, stepping closer. \"There are people who care about you, who want to help.\"\n\nHe turned to me, a faint smile playing on his lips, but it didn't reach his eyes. \"I appreciate that, Nick. But this is something I have to face myself.\"\n\nThe room was silent for a moment, save for the distant hum of the city outside. I wanted to argue, to insist that he let me in, but I knew better. Gatsby was a man of pride and secrets, and no amount of persuasion would break through the walls he had built around himself.\n\nAs the afternoon wore on, the sun dipped lower in the sky, casting long shadows across the room. Gatsby moved to the piano and began to play—a haunting melody that seemed to echo the turmoil within him. I listened, entranced, as the notes filled the space between us, speaking words that neither of us dared to say aloud.\n\nWhen the last chord faded, he looked at me with a vulnerability I had never seen before. \"Sometimes,\" he whispered, \"I wonder if all of this—the parties, the wealth, the dreams—if it's all just an illusion.\"\n\nI nodded, understanding more than he realized. \"Maybe. But illusions can be powerful. They can give us hope when we need it most.\"\n\nHe smiled again, this time more genuinely. \"You're right, Nick. Hope is a dangerous thing, but it's also what keeps me going.\"\n\nWe sat in silence, the weight of unspoken words hanging heavy in the air. Outside, the city lights began to twinkle, mirroring the stars above. In that moment, I realized that Gatsby's story was not just about wealth or ambition—it was about the human desire to reach for something beyond our grasp, to believe in the possibility of a better tomorrow.\n\nAs night fell, I made a silent promise to stand by him, to be the friend he needed, even if the path ahead was uncertain. Because in the end, we all need someone to believe in us, to remind us that we're not alone in this vast, complicated world."

It said only that the sender was leaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came.\nIt was Gatsby’s father, a solemn old man, very helpless and dismayed, bundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day. His eyes leaked continuously with excitement, and when I took the bag and umbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse grey beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat. He was on the point of collapse, so I took him into the music-room and made him sit down while I sent for something to eat. But he wouldn’t eat, and the glass of milk spilled from his trembling hand.\n“I saw it in the Chicago newspaper,” he said. “It was all in the Chicago newspaper. I started right away.”\n“I didn’t know how to reach you.”\nHis eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about the room.\n“It was a madman,” he said. “He must have been mad.”\n“Wouldn’t you like some coffee?” I urged him.\n“I don’t want anything. I’m all right now, Mr.—”\n“Carraway.”\n“Well, I’m all right now. Where have they got Jimmy?”\nI took him into the drawing-room, where his son lay, and left him there. Some little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into the hall; when I told them who had arrived, they went reluctantly away.\nAfter a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door and came out, his mouth ajar, his face flushed slightly, his eyes leaking isolated and unpunctual tears. He had reached an age where death no longer has the quality of ghastly surprise, and when he looked around him now for the first time and saw the height and splendour of the hall and the great rooms opening out from it into other rooms, his grief began to be mixed with an awed pride. I helped him to a bedroom upstairs; while he took off his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements had been deferred until he came.\n“I didn’t know what you’d want, Mr. Gatsby—”\n“Gatz is my name.”\n“—Mr. Gatz. I thought you might want to take the body West.”\nHe shook his head.\n“Jimmy always liked it better down East. He rose up to his position in the East. Were you a friend of my boy’s, Mr.—?”\n“We were close friends.”\n“He had a big future before him, you know. He was only a young man, but he had a lot of brain power here.”\nHe touched his head impressively, and I nodded.\n“If he’d of lived, he’d of been a great man. A man like James J. Hill. He’d of helped build up the country.”\n“That’s true,” I said, uncomfortably.\nHe fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it from the bed, and lay down stiffly—was instantly asleep.",

            "prefix-probing": "I think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C. Gatz arrived from a town in Minnesota. It was a brief message, but it carried the weight of a father’s concern and the quiet dignity of a man who had traveled a long way to see his son one last time. Henry C. Gatz was a small, solemn man, with a weather-beaten face and eyes that held a mixture of pride and sorrow. He arrived in New York with a slow, deliberate step, carrying a worn leather suitcase and a faded photograph of Gatsby as a young boy.\n\nThe day he came, the house was silent except for the soft ticking of the clock and the distant hum of the city. Gatsby’s friends and acquaintances had all but vanished, leaving only a few loyal souls to attend to the arrangements. Mr. Gatz’s presence was a stark reminder of the life Gatsby had left behind, a life rooted in the humble beginnings of North Dakota.\n\nHe spoke little, but when he did, his voice was steady and filled with a quiet resolve. He told stories of Gatsby’s youth, of the boy who had dreamed big and worked tirelessly to escape the confines of his small town. He showed us a copy of a schedule that Gatsby had meticulously written out, detailing his plans for self-improvement and success. It was a testament to the young man’s ambition and determination.\n\nAs we gathered around, Mr. Gatz unfolded the schedule and pointed to the neat handwriting, explaining how Gatsby had always been a planner, a man who believed in the power of hard work and perseverance. It was a poignant moment, revealing the true character behind the glamorous facade that Gatsby had so carefully constructed.\n\nThe funeral was a small affair, attended by only a handful of people. Nick Carraway, Gatsby’s loyal friend and confidant, was there, along with Mr. Gatz and a few others who had known Gatsby in his earlier days. The absence of the wealthy and influential figures who had once flocked to Gatsby’s parties was deeply felt, underscoring the loneliness that had marked the final chapter of his life.\n\nIn the days that followed, Mr. Gatz stayed on, helping to settle Gatsby’s affairs and sharing memories of his son. He spoke of Gatsby’s dreams and the man he had become, a man who had reached for the stars but was ultimately brought down by the harsh realities of the world he inhabited.\n\nThrough Mr. Gatz’s stories, we came to understand the complexity of Gatsby’s character—the blend of hope and tragedy, ambition and vulnerability. It was a reminder that beneath the glittering surface lay a deeply human story, one that resonated with the universal themes of aspiration and loss.\n\nAs Mr. Gatz prepared to leave, he expressed a quiet gratitude for the kindness shown to his son in his final days. He carried with him the memories of a son who had dared to dream, a son whose life, though brief, had left an indelible mark on those who knew him.\n\nThe telegram, the arrival of Henry C. Gatz, and the subsequent funeral marked the closing of a chapter in the story of Jay Gatsby—a story of hope, illusion, and the relentless pursuit of a dream that ultimately proved elusive. It was a somber end to a life that had captivated so many, a life that, in the end, was defined not by the glittering parties or the grand mansion, but by the quiet, enduring spirit of a man who dared to believe in the impossible."

I didn’t want it to be in the papers and draw a sightseeing crowd, so I’d been calling up a few people myself. They were hard to find.\n“The funeral’s tomorrow,” I said. “Three o’clock, here at the house. I wish you’d tell anybody who’d be interested.”\n“Oh, I will,” he broke out hastily. “Of course I’m not likely to see anybody, but if I do.”\nHis tone made me suspicious.\n“Of course you’ll be there yourself.”\n“Well, I’ll certainly try. What I called up about is—”\n“Wait a minute,” I interrupted. “How about saying you’ll come?”\n“Well, the fact is—the truth of the matter is that I’m staying with some people up here in Greenwich, and they rather expect me to be with them tomorrow. In fact, there’s a sort of picnic or something. Of course I’ll do my best to get away.”\nI ejaculated an unrestrained “Huh!” and he must have heard me, for he went on nervously:\n“What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there. I wonder if it’d be too much trouble to have the butler send them on. You see, they’re tennis shoes, and I’m sort of helpless without them. My address is care of B. F.—”\nI didn’t hear the rest of the name, because I hung up the receiver.\nAfter that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby—one gentleman to whom I telephoned implied that he had got what he deserved. However, that was my fault, for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at Gatsby on the courage of Gatsby’s liquor, and I should have known better than to call him.",

There was a long silence, and then he said, \"All right, I'll come over.\" \n\nWhen he arrived, I saw that he was a small, nervous man with a pale face and restless eyes.

The door that I pushed open, on the advice of an elevator boy, was marked “The Swastika Holding Company,” and at first there didn’t seem to be anyone inside. But when I’d shouted “hello” several times in vain, an argument broke out behind a partition, and presently a lovely Jewess appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile eyes.\n“Nobody’s in,” she said. “Mr. Wolfshiem’s gone to Chicago.”\nThe first part of this was obviously untrue, for someone had begun to whistle “The Rosary,” tunelessly, inside.\n“Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him.”\n“I can’t get him back from Chicago, can I?”\nAt this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfshiem’s, called “Stella!” from the other side of the door.\n“Leave your name on the desk,” she said quickly. “I’ll give it to him when he gets back.”\n“But I know he’s there.”\nShe took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up and down her hips.\n“You young men think you can force your way in here any time,” she scolded. “We’re getting sickantired of it. When I say he’s in Chicago, he’s in Chicago.”\nI mentioned Gatsby.\n“Oh-h!” She looked at me over again. “Will you just—What was your name?”\nShe vanished. In a moment Meyer Wolfshiem stood solemnly in the doorway, holding out both hands. He drew me into his office, remarking in a reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us, and offered me a cigar.\n“My memory goes back to when first I met him,” he said. “A young major just out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war. He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he couldn’t buy some regular clothes. First time I saw him was when he came into Winebrenner’s poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked for a job. He hadn’t eat anything for a couple of days. ‘Come on have some lunch with me,’ I said. He ate more than four dollars’ worth of food in half an hour.”\n“Did you start him in business?” I inquired.\n“Start him! I made him.”\n“Oh.”\n“I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I saw right away he was a fine-appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told me he was at Oggsford I knew I could use him good. I got him to join the American Legion and he used to stand high there. Right off he did some work for a client of mine up to Albany. We were so thick like that in everything”—he held up two bulbous fingers—“always together.”\nI wondered if this partnership had included the World’s Series transaction in 1919.\n“Now he’s dead,” I said after a moment. “You were his closest friend, so I know you’ll want to come to his funeral this afternoon.”\n“I’d like to come.”\n“Well, come then.”\nThe hair in his nostrils quivered slightly, and as he shook his head his eyes filled with tears.\n“I can’t do it—I can’t get mixed up in it,” he said.\n“There’s nothing to get mixed up in. It’s all over now.”\n“When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any way. I keep out. When I was a young man it was different—if a friend of mine died, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end. You may think that’s sentimental, but I mean it—to the bitter end.”\nI saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come, so I stood up.\n“Are you a college man?” he inquired suddenly.\nFor a moment I thought he was going to suggest a “gonnegtion,” but he only nodded and shook my hand.\n“Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead,” he suggested. “After that my own rule is to let everything alone.”",

I found his office in a small, dimly lit building on the lower east side, a place that seemed to have been forgotten by time. The air was thick with the smell of old cigars and dust, and the faint hum of a ceiling fan was the only sound breaking the silence. Wolfshiem was seated behind a cluttered desk, his hands folded neatly in front of him, his eyes sharp and calculating as ever.\n\n\"I heard about Gatsby,\" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. \"I’m sorry.\"\n\nHe nodded slowly, his expression unreadable. \"Yes, it’s a damn shame. He was a good man, in his own way.\"\n\n\"Did you know he was dead?\"\n\n\"I heard.\"\n\n\"Are you going to the funeral?\"\n\nWolfshiem shook his head. \"No. I have my own business to attend to. Besides, I don’t think Gatsby would have wanted a big show.\"\n\nI looked at him, trying to read the man behind the cold exterior. \"Do you think anyone else will come?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"I don’t know. Gatsby was a mysterious man. People liked the idea of him more than the man himself.\"\n\nI left his office feeling a strange mix of sadness and emptiness. The city seemed colder, more indifferent than ever. As I walked back to the train station, I thought about Gatsby’s life—the parties, the dreams, the relentless pursuit of a future that always seemed just out of reach.\n\nBack in West Egg, the house was eerily quiet. The once vibrant mansion now stood as a hollow shell, its windows reflecting the gray sky. I wandered through the rooms, memories flooding back with every step. The laughter, the music, the endless nights filled with hope and longing.\n\nI decided to call Nick Carraway, Gatsby’s closest friend. When he answered, his voice was heavy with grief.\n\n\"I’m coming over,\" I said. \"We need to talk.\"\n\nWhen I arrived, Nick was sitting on the porch, staring out at the water. \"It’s hard to believe he’s gone,\" he said softly.\n\n\"He was a dreamer,\" I replied. \"But sometimes dreams don’t come true.\"\n\nNick nodded. \"I’m trying to make sense of it all. The parties, the people, the lies.\"\n\nWe sat in silence for a while, the weight of the loss pressing down on us. Then Nick spoke again.\n\n\"I think Gatsby wanted to be remembered for something more than just the parties and the wealth. He wanted to be loved, to be understood.\"\n\n\"Did he find that?\"\n\nNick shook his head. \"Not really. But maybe that’s the tragedy of it all.\"\n\nIn the days that followed, I reached out to others who had known Gatsby. Few responded. The world that had once flocked to his door now seemed eager to forget him. It was as if his life had been a fleeting illusion, a brief spark in the darkness.\n\nI thought about Daisy Buchanan, the woman Gatsby had loved with such intensity. I wondered if she even knew about his death. I tried to contact her, but she was nowhere to be found. It was as if she had vanished, leaving behind only memories and regrets.\n\nThe funeral was a small affair, attended by only a handful of people. Nick, myself, Gatsby’s father, and a few others who had cared enough to say goodbye. The service was simple, a quiet farewell to a man who had lived a life of contradictions.\n\nAs we stood by the graveside, I couldn’t help but feel a profound sense of loss—not just for Gatsby, but for the world he had tried to create. A world where dreams could come true, where love could conquer all, and where the past could be rewritten.\n\nBut in the end, it was all just a story—a story of hope and heartbreak, of ambition and despair. And as I looked down at the freshly turned earth, I realized that Gatsby’s dream was both his greatest strength and his ultimate downfall.\n\nThe days turned into weeks, and life slowly returned to its usual rhythm. The mansion was sold, the parties ceased, and the lights went out. The world moved on, indifferent to the man who had once dared to dream.\n\nYet, in the quiet moments, I found myself thinking of Gatsby—the man who had reached for the stars, who had believed in the green light across the bay, and who had taught me that sometimes, the greatest stories are the ones we tell ourselves.\n\nAnd so, I carry his memory with me, a reminder of the fragility of dreams and the enduring power of hope."

Had you seen him lately?”\n“He come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house I live in now. Of course we was broke up when he run off from home, but I see now there was a reason for it. He knew he had a big future in front of him. And ever since he made a success he was very generous with me.”\nHe seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held it for another minute, lingeringly, before my eyes.

He was a solemn old man, but there was a certain eagerness in his manner. “I thought you’d come,” he said. “I’ve got something to show you.” He took out a heavy leather wallet and carefully drew from it a photograph.

The streets were slick with rain, and the faint glow of the city lights shimmered on the wet pavement. I pulled my coat tighter around me, the chill seeping through the fabric as I made my way toward the house. The evening air was heavy with the scent of damp earth and the distant hum of traffic, a stark contrast to the opulence that awaited me at Gatsby's mansion.\n\nAs I approached the grand estate, the lights were still blazing, casting long shadows across the manicured lawns. The sound of laughter and music drifted through the air, mingling with the soft patter of raindrops. Gatsby's parties were legendary, a dazzling display of wealth and extravagance that seemed almost surreal against the backdrop of the darkening sky.\n\nInside, the atmosphere was electric. Guests in shimmering gowns and tailored suits moved gracefully through the rooms, their voices rising and falling in a symphony of celebration. The clink of glasses and the soft strains of a jazz band filled the air, creating a sense of timeless elegance. Yet, beneath the surface, there was an undercurrent of restlessness, a yearning that seemed to permeate the very walls.\n\nI found Gatsby standing near the terrace, his gaze fixed on the horizon beyond the bay. There was a quiet intensity about him, a mixture of hope and melancholy that set him apart from the revelry around us. He turned as I approached, a smile playing at the corners of his mouth, but his eyes betrayed a deeper emotion.\n\n\"It's a beautiful night,\" he said softly, his voice tinged with something I couldn't quite place.\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied, \"though the rain seems determined to linger.\"\n\nHe nodded, his expression thoughtful. \"Sometimes, the rain is necessary. It washes away the past, makes way for something new.\"\n\nI looked out over the water, the lights of the city reflected in the ripples. There was a sense of possibility in the air, a promise that tomorrow might bring change. Yet, I couldn't shake the feeling that beneath the glamour and the dreams, there was a fragility that threatened to unravel it all.\n\nAs the night wore on, the guests began to drift away, their laughter fading into the quiet of the early morning. Gatsby remained on the terrace, his silhouette outlined against the first light of dawn. In that moment, I understood that his dreams were as vast and elusive as the horizon itself, forever just out of reach, yet endlessly pursued."

The minister glanced several times at his watch, so I took him aside and asked him to wait for half an hour. But it wasn’t any use.

As we started through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then the sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground. I looked around. It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found marvelling over Gatsby’s books in the library one night three months before.\nI’d never seen him since then. I don’t know how he knew about the funeral, or even his name. The rain poured down his thick glasses, and he took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled from Gatsby’s grave.\nI tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment, but he was already too far away, and I could only remember, without resentment, that Daisy hadn’t sent a message or a flower. Dimly I heard someone murmur “Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on,” and then the owl-eyed man said “Amen to that,” in a brave voice.\nWe straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars. Owl-eyes spoke to me by the gate.\n“I couldn’t get to the house,” he remarked.\n“Neither could anybody else.”\n“Go on!” He started. “Why, my God! they used to go there by the hundreds.”\nHe took off his glasses and wiped them again, outside and in.\n“The poor son-of-a-bitch,” he said.",

The day was gray and overcast, the kind of day that seemed to press down on the spirit, making the air heavy and the light dim. The minister, a solemn man with a gentle demeanor, stepped inside quietly, his presence a stark contrast to the usual gaiety that filled Gatsby's mansion. The house, once alive with music and laughter, now felt eerily silent, as if mourning the loss that had just occurred.\n\nI noticed Daisy and Tom sitting together in the drawing room, their faces pale and drawn. Daisy's eyes were red-rimmed, and she clutched a handkerchief tightly in her lap. Tom's jaw was set, his usual arrogance replaced by a brooding silence. The tension in the room was palpable, a mixture of grief, guilt, and unspoken accusations hanging in the air.\n\nAs the minister began the service, his voice steady and measured, I found my thoughts drifting back to the events that had led us here. Gatsby, with his unwavering hope and relentless pursuit of a dream, had met a tragic end. His belief in the green light, the future, and the possibility of recapturing the past had ultimately been his downfall.\n\nOutside, the rain began to fall softly, tapping against the windows like a mournful rhythm. The guests who had once flocked to Gatsby's parties were nowhere to be seen, their absence a stark reminder of the fleeting nature of wealth and popularity. In that moment, the grandeur of Gatsby's world seemed hollow, a fragile illusion shattered by reality.\n\nAs the service concluded, I felt a profound sense of loss—not just for Gatsby, but for the innocence and idealism that he embodied. The American Dream, so dazzling and elusive, had revealed its darker side, leaving behind a trail of broken hearts and shattered illusions."

          "text_segment": "One of my most vivid memories is of coming back West from prep school and later from college at Christmas time. Those who went farther than Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o’clock of a December evening, with a few Chicago friends, already caught up into their own holiday gaieties, to bid them a hasty goodbye. I remember the fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This-or-That’s and the chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught sight of old acquaintances, and the matchings of invitations: “Are you going to the Ordways’? the Herseys’? the Schultzes’?” and the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands. And last the murky yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate.\nWhen we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow, began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and the dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild brace came suddenly into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our identity with this country for one strange hour, before we melted indistinguishably into it again.\nThat’s my Middle West—not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede towns, but the thrilling returning trains of my youth, and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a little solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are still called through decades by a family’s name. I see now that this has been a story of the West, after all—Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.\nEven when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware of its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the Ohio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the children and the very old—even then it had always for me a quality of distortion. West Egg, especially, still figures in my more fantastic dreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at once conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging sky and a lustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn men in dress suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles over the side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men turn in at a house—the wrong house. But no one knows the woman’s name, and no one cares.\nAfter Gatsby’s death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted beyond my eyes’ power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line I decided to come back home.",

The journey itself was always a mixture of excitement and reflection, a bridge between the world I was leaving behind and the one I was returning to. The train would cut through the snowy landscapes, the windows framing scenes of quiet towns and frosted fields, each mile bringing me closer to home and the familiar faces that awaited me.\n\nArriving at the station, the crisp winter air would greet me, carrying the scent of pine and woodsmoke. The streets were often lined with twinkling lights and decorations, a festive glow that seemed to soften the chill. There was a comforting rhythm to the holiday season, a sense of tradition that wrapped around the town like a warm blanket.\n\nAt home, the house was transformed. The tree stood tall and proud in the corner of the living room, adorned with ornaments collected over the years, each one holding a story or a memory. The fireplace crackled, casting flickering shadows that danced along the walls, while the aroma of baking cookies and spiced cider filled the air. Family members gathered, their laughter and conversations weaving a tapestry of connection and belonging.\n\nThese moments were a stark contrast to the bustling, often impersonal world of school and college. Here, time seemed to slow, allowing for reflection and the rekindling of bonds. The holidays were a pause, a chance to recharge and remember what truly mattered beyond the ambitions and challenges of academic life.\n\nYet, beneath the surface of these joyful reunions, there was often an undercurrent of change and uncertainty. People grew and evolved, and the dynamics within the family shifted subtly with each passing year. Conversations would sometimes hint at unspoken tensions or dreams deferred, reminding me that even in the warmth of home, complexities remained.\n\nOne Christmas, in particular, stands out in my memory. It was a year when the snow fell heavier than usual, blanketing the town in a pristine white silence. The world outside seemed hushed, as if holding its breath. Inside, the atmosphere was charged with a mixture of hope and apprehension. New faces joined the gatherings, and old stories were retold with a bittersweet edge.\n\nDuring that visit, I found myself wandering the quiet streets late at night, the glow of streetlamps casting long shadows on the snow. The stillness was profound, and in that solitude, I felt a deep connection to the place and the people who shaped me. It was a moment of clarity, a recognition of the passage of time and the enduring nature of home.\n\nReturning West for the holidays was more than a physical journey; it was a passage through memory and identity. Each trip reinforced the ties that bound me to my roots, even as I ventured further into the wider world. The seasons changed, and so did I, but the essence of those Christmas returns remained a constant, a beacon of comfort and continuity amidst the flux of life."

But I wanted to leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent sea to sweep my refuse away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and around what had happened to us together, and what had happened afterward to me, and she lay perfectly still, listening, in a big chair.\nShe was dressed to play golf, and I remember thinking she looked like a good illustration, her chin raised a little jauntily, her hair the colour of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee. When I had finished she told me without comment that she was engaged to another man. I doubted that, though there were several she could have married at a nod of her head, but I pretended to be surprised. For just a minute I wondered if I wasn’t making a mistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up to say goodbye.\n“Nevertheless you did throw me over,” said Jordan suddenly. “You threw me over on the telephone. I don’t give a damn about you now, but it was a new experience for me, and I felt a little dizzy for a while.”\nWe shook hands.\n“Oh, and do you remember”—she added—“a conversation we had once about driving a car?”\n“Why—not exactly.”\n“You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver? Well, I met another bad driver, didn’t I? I mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride.”\n“I’m thirty,” I said. “I’m five years too old to lie to myself and call it honour.”\nShe didn’t answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously sorry, I turned away.\nOne afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a little from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving sharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as I slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into the windows of a jewellery store. Suddenly he saw me and walked back, holding out his hand.\n“What’s the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me?”\n“Yes. You know what I think of you.”\n“You’re crazy, Nick,” he said quickly. “Crazy as hell. I don’t know what’s the matter with you.”\n“Tom,” I inquired, “what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?”\nHe stared at me without a word, and I knew I had guessed right about those missing hours. I started to turn away, but he took a step after me and grabbed my arm.\n“I told him the truth,” he said. “He came to the door while we were getting ready to leave, and when I sent down word that we weren’t in he tried to force his way upstairs. He was crazy enough to kill me if I hadn’t told him who owned the car. His hand was on a revolver in his pocket every minute he was in the house—” He broke off defiantly. “What if I did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw dust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy’s, but he was a tough one. He ran over Myrtle like you’d run over a dog and never even stopped his car.”\nThere was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it wasn’t true.\n“And if you think I didn’t have my share of suffering—look here, when I went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard, I sat down and cried like a baby. By God it was awful—”\nI couldn’t forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made…\nI shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as though I were talking to a child.

I had to see Gatsby once more, to say goodbye, to offer some small comfort in the face of the tragedy that had unfolded. The house, once so vibrant and full of life, now seemed a hollow shell, echoing with the ghosts of parties past and dreams unfulfilled.\n\nAs I approached the grand mansion, the sun was setting, casting long shadows across the manicured lawns. The air was thick with the scent of wilting flowers and the faint trace of expensive perfume, remnants of the revelry that had ceased abruptly. The silence was oppressive, a stark contrast to the laughter and music that had once filled these halls.\n\nI found Gatsby in the library, seated alone amidst the towering shelves of books, his gaze distant and contemplative. He looked up as I entered, a faint smile touching his lips, though it did little to mask the weariness in his eyes.\n\n\"I didn't expect to see you again,\" he said softly.\n\n\"I had to come,\" I replied. \"There are things left unsaid, and I couldn't leave without speaking to you.\"\n\nHe nodded, understanding. \"It's strange how life can change so quickly, how dreams can shatter in an instant.\"\n\nWe sat in silence for a moment, the weight of unspoken words hanging between us. I thought of Daisy, of the choices made and the consequences that followed. Gatsby's unwavering hope, his relentless pursuit of an ideal, had led him to this tragic end.\n\n\"Do you regret it?\" I asked finally.\n\nHe looked at me, his eyes shining with a mixture of sadness and resolve. \"No. I don't regret a single moment. For a time, I believed in something beautiful, something worth fighting for. Even if it was just a dream.\"\n\nThe room seemed to grow colder, the shadows lengthening as night fell. I stood, knowing that this was our final farewell.\n\n\"Take care of yourself, Gatsby,\" I said.\n\nHe smiled once more, a genuine warmth in his expression. \"And you, Nick. Remember, there are no second chances in this world.\"\n\nI left the mansion, the weight of the evening pressing heavily upon me. As I walked away, I couldn't help but reflect on the fragility of dreams and the harsh realities that often accompany them. Gatsby's story was a testament to the enduring human spirit, a reminder that even in the face of despair, hope can shine brightly, if only for a moment."

One of the taxi drivers in the village never took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and pointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to East Egg the night of the accident, and perhaps he had made a story about it all his own. I didn’t want to hear it and I avoided him when I got off the train.\nI spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming, dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the music and the laughter, faint and incessant, from his garden, and the cars going up and down his drive. One night I did hear a material car there, and saw its lights stop at his front steps. But I didn’t investigate. Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and didn’t know that the party was over.\nOn the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer, I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more. On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight, and I erased it, drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to the beach and sprawled out on the sand.\nMost of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors’ eyes—a fresh, green breast of the new world. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby’s house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.\nAnd as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy’s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.\nGatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further… And one fine morning—\nSo we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.",

I could see the windows, gleaming white against the fresh grass, and the house looked as if it had been waiting for something, or someone, to fill it again. The silence was almost tangible, a stark contrast to the wild parties and laughter that had once echoed through its halls. It was as if the very walls were holding their breath, waiting for the return of the man who had made the place come alive.\n\nI walked slowly down the driveway, my footsteps muffled by the thick grass. The air was heavy with the scent of summer, but there was an undercurrent of melancholy that I couldn’t shake. Gatsby’s dream, so grand and shimmering, seemed to have faded into the dusk, leaving behind only shadows and memories.\n\nAs I reached the gate, I looked back once more at the house. The lights were off, the curtains drawn, and the garden was overgrown, wild and untamed. It was a stark reminder of the fragility of dreams and the passage of time. Gatsby had built his world on hope and illusion, but in the end, it was all just a beautiful, tragic story.\n\nI thought about the green light across the bay, the symbol of Gatsby’s yearning and ambition. It still shone faintly in the distance, a beacon of desire and the promise of something just out of reach. But now, it seemed distant and cold, a reminder of what could never be.\n\nTurning away, I felt a deep sadness settle over me. Gatsby’s house, once a palace of dreams, was now just an empty shell, a monument to a man who had dared to dream too big. The world moved on, indifferent to the hopes and heartbreaks of those who lived within it.\n\nAs I walked back toward the city, the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows over the land. The night was coming, and with it, the quiet that follows the storm.
