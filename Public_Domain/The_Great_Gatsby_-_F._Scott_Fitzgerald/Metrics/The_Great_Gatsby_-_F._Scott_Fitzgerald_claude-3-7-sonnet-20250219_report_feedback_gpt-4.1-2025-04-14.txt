   "they were merely casual events in a crowded summer and until much later they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs most of the time i worked in the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as i hurried down the white chasms of lower new york to the probity trust i knew the other clerks and young bondsalesmen by their first names and lunched with them in dark crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee i even had a short affair with a girl who lived in jersey city and worked in the accounting department but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction so when she went on her vacation in july i let it blow quietly away i took dinner usually at the yale clubfor some reason it was the gloomiest event of my dayand then i went upstairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour there were generally a few rioters around but they never came into the library so it was a good place to work after that if the night was mellow i strolled down madison avenue past the old murray hill hotel and over 33rd street to the pennsylvania station i began to like new york the racy adventurous feel of it at night and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye i liked to walk up fifth avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes i was going to enter into their lives and no one would ever know or disapprove sometimes in my mind i followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness at the enchanted metropolitan twilight i felt a haunting loneliness sometimes and felt it in otherspoor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinneryoung clerks in the dusk wasting the most poignant moments of night and life again at eight o ’ clock when the dark lanes of the forties were lined five deep with throbbing taxicabs bound for the theatre district i felt a sinking in my heart forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited and voices sang and there was laughter from unheard jokes and lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside imagining that i too was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate excitement i wished them well for a while i lost sight of jordan baker and then in midsummer i found her again at first i was flattered to go places with her because she was a golf champion and everyone knew her name then it was something more i wasn ’ t actually in love but i felt a sort of tender curiosity the bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed"
