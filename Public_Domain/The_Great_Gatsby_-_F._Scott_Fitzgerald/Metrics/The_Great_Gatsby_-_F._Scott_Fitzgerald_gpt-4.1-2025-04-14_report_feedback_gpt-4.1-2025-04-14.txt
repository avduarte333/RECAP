   "on the contrary they were merely casual events in a crowded summer and until much later they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs most of the time i worked in the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as i hurried down the white chasms of lower new york to the probity trust i knew the other clerks and young bondsalesmen by their first names and lunched with them in dark crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee i even had a short affair with a girl who lived in jersey city and worked in the accounting department but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction so when she went on her vacation in july i let it blow quietly away i took dinner usually at the yale clubfor some reason it was the gloomiest event of my dayand then i went upstairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour there were generally a few rioters around but they never came into the library so it was a good place to work after that if the night was mellow i strolled down madison avenue past the old murray hill hotel and over 33rd street to the pennsylvania station i began to like new york the racy adventurous feel of it at night and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye i liked to walk up fifth avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes i was going to enter into their lives and no one would ever know or disapprove sometimes in my mind i followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness at the enchanted metropolitan twilight i felt a haunting loneliness sometimes and felt it in otherspoor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinneryoung clerks in the dusk wasting the most poignant moments of night and life again at eight o ’ clock when the dark lanes of the forties were lined five deep with throbbing taxicabs bound for the theatre district i felt a sinking in my heart forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited and voices sang and there was laughter from unheard jokes and lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside imagining that i too was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate excitement i wished them well for a while i lost sight of jordan baker and then in midsummer i found her again at first i was flattered to go places with her because she was a golf champion and everyone knew her name then it was something more i wasn ’ t actually in love but i felt a sort of tender curiosity the bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed somethingmost affectations conceal something eventually even though they don ’ t in the beginningand one day i found what it was when we were on a houseparty together up in warwick she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down and then lied about itand suddenly i remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at daisy ’ s at her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapersa suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round the thing approached the proportions of a scandalthen died away a caddy retracted his statement and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken the incident and the name had remained together in my mind jordan baker instinctively avoided clever shrewd men and now i saw that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be thought impossible she was incurably dishonest she wasn ’ t able to endure being at a disadvantage and given this unwillingness i suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard jaunty body it made no difference to me dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeplyi was casually sorry and then i forgot it was on that same houseparty that we had a curious conversation about driving a car it started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one man ’ s coat “ you ’ re a rotten driver ” i protested “ either you ought to be more careful or you oughtn ’ t to drive at all ” “ i am careful ” “ no you ’ re not ” “ well other people are ” she said lightly “ what ’ s that got to do with it ” “ they ’ ll"

   "i think that he would have acknowledged anything now without reserve but he wanted to talk about daisy she was the first “ nice ” girl he had ever known in various unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people but always with indiscernible barbed wire between he found her excitingly desirable he went to her house at first with other officers from camp taylor then alone it amazed himhe had never been in such a beautiful house before but what gave it an air of breathless intensity was that daisy lived thereit was as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him there was a ripe mystery about it a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year ’ s shining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered it excited him too that many men had already loved daisyit increased her value in his eyes he felt their presence all about the house pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions but he knew that he was in daisy ’ s house by a colossal accident however glorious might be his future as jay gatsby he was at present a penniless young man without a past and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders so he made the most of his time he took what he could get ravenously and unscrupulouslyeventually he took daisy one still october night took her because he had no real right to touch her hand he might have despised himself for he had certainly taken her under false pretences i don ’ t mean that he had traded on his phantom millions but he had deliberately given daisy a sense of security he let her believe that he was a person from much the same strata as herselfthat he was fully able to take care of her as a matter of fact he had no such facilitieshe had no comfortable family standing behind him and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the world but he didn ’ t despise himself and it didn ’ t turn out as he had imagined he had intended probably to take what he could and gobut now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail he knew that daisy was extraordinary but he didn ’ t realize just how extraordinary a “ nice ” girl could be she vanished into her rich house into her rich full life leaving gatsbynothing he felt married to her that was all when they met again two days later it was gatsby who was breathless who was somehow betrayed her porch was bright with the bought luxury of starshine the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth she had caught a cold and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever and gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves of the freshness of many clothes and of daisy gleaming like silver safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor “ i can ’ t describe to you how surprised i was to find out i loved her old sport i even hoped for a while that she ’ d throw me over but she didn ’ t because she was in love with me too she thought i knew a lot because i knew different things from her well there i was way off my ambitions getting deeper in love every minute and all of a sudden i didn ’ t care what was the use of doing great things if i could have a better time telling her what i was going to do ” on the last afternoon before he went abroad he sat with daisy in his arms for a long silent time it was a cold fall day with fire in the room and her cheeks flushed now and then she moved and he changed his arm a little and once he kissed her dark shining hair the afternoon had made them tranquil for a while as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised they had never been closer in their month of love nor communicated more profoundly"
