          "text_segment": "In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.\n“Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”\nHe didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgements, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.\nAnd, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "During my youth, when I was more impressionable and vulnerable, my father shared advice that has resonated with me ever since. He told me, 'Whenever you feel like criticizing someone, just remember that not everyone in this world has had the advantages you've had.' He said no more, but given our typically reserved yet communicative relationship, I understood he meant something much deeper. Consequently, I tend to withhold judgments, a practice that has led many interesting individuals to reveal their true selves to me, while also making me a target for numerous experienced bores. People with unusual mentalities quickly recognize and attach themselves to this trait in a typical person, which is why during college, I was unfairly labeled a politician because I was privy to the private troubles of wild, unfamiliar men. Most of these confidences were unsolicited – I frequently pretended to be asleep, preoccupied, or dismissively cheerful when I sensed, through some clear signal, that a personal revelation was about to begin; this is because the intimate confessions of young men, or at least their expression, are usually imitative and marked by obvious omissions. The act of reserving judgment is an act of boundless hope. I still worry about missing something if I forget the (as my father snobbishly suggested and I snobbishly agree) unequal distribution of fundamental decency at birth. And after boasting about my tolerance, I must admit it has a breaking point. Conduct might originate from strong foundations or unstable ones, but beyond a certain threshold, I lose interest in its source. Upon returning from the East last autumn, I felt a desire for the world to conform to a sort of permanent moral discipline; I no longer wanted unrestrained glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the figure this book is named after, was exempt from this reaction – Gatsby, who embodied qualities I generally disdained. If personality is an uninterrupted series of successful actions, then there was something magnificent about him, a heightened capacity for life's potential, as if he were like a complex instrument registering earthquakes thousands of miles away. This responsiveness wasn't mere superficial impressionability often misidentified as 'creative temperament' – it was an exceptional gift for hope, a romantic readiness unlike anything I have ever encountered and am unlikely to find again. No, Gatsby himself turned out alright; it was what preyed upon him, the corrupt influence ('foul dust') that followed his dreams, that temporarily extinguished my interest in the failed sorrows and fleeting enthusiasms of others.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "When I was younger and more impressionable, my father once gave me advice that has stayed with me. He told me, \"Before you criticize someone, remember that not everyone has had your privileges.\" He never elaborated, but our family always communicated in a subtle way, so I knew his words carried greater meaning. Because of this advice, I tend to avoid judging others, which has made people of many sorts open up to me—though it has also left me enduring some tedious company. Those with unusual minds can sense and seek out this trait, and so during college, I was wrongly assumed to be a politician, simply because I knew the private troubles of many wild and mysterious men. I usually did not ask for these confidences—often I'd pretend to be busy or even asleep to avoid hearing them, since young men's personal revelations are often unoriginal and incomplete. To withhold judgment requires great optimism. I still worry that I’ll miss something important if I forget, as my father rather proudly implied and I now repeat, that basic decency isn’t equally distributed at birth. Yet, admitting all this about my tolerance, I recognize it has its boundaries. People may act from good or shaky principles, but beyond a certain point, their motives no longer matter to me. After returning from the East last fall, I wished the world would maintain a high moral standard and avoid wild adventures into people’s hearts. The only exception was Gatsby, after whom this book is named. Despite Gatsby embodying much that I normally disdain, he had a remarkable charm—a heightened sense for life’s possibilities, similar to a sensitive device recording distant tremors. This attribute was not the usual so-called artistic openness, but rather an amazing capacity for hope, a romantic optimism I’ve never seen before and don’t expect to again. In the end, Gatsby himself was innocent; it was the corrupting influences around him, the tainted aftermath of his dreams, that made me lose faith in the shallow joys and fleeting sorrows of other men."

The Carraways are something of a clan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today.\nI never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like him—with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father’s office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go East and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, “Why—ye-es,” with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.\nThe practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and I went out to the country alone. I had a dog—at least I had him for a few days until he ran away—and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.",

The Carraways function somewhat like a clan, and we have a long-held belief that we are descendants of the Dukes of Buccleuch. However, the true originator of my branch of the family was my grandfather’s brother, who arrived here in 1851. He avoided fighting in the Civil War by hiring someone to go in his place and established the wholesale hardware business that my father operates today. I never met this great-uncle, but people say I resemble him, especially noting the stern painting of him displayed in my father’s office. I finished my studies at New Haven in 1915, exactly twenty-five years after my father, and a little later, I took part in the military action against Germany known as the Great War. I found the experience of the counter-attack quite satisfying, so much so that I returned home feeling unsettled. Instead of being the vibrant core of the world, the Middle West now struck me as a distant, unpolished fringe—leading me to decide to move East and learn the bond market business. Everyone I knew was involved in the bond business, so I presumed there would be enough room for one more single person. My aunts and uncles discussed my plan extensively, as if they were selecting a preparatory school for me, and finally gave their cautious, somewhat hesitant consent, saying, “Why—ye-es.” My father agreed to support me financially for a year, and following various delays, I moved East, intending it to be a permanent relocation, in the spring of 1922. The practical approach would have been to find accommodation in the city itself, but it was a warm period, and I had recently left an area with spacious lawns and welcoming trees. Thus, when a young man from the office suggested we rent a house together in a town outside the city, it seemed like an excellent idea. He located the property, a weathered, simple bungalow costing eighty dollars a month. However, at the very last moment, his company transferred him to Washington, and I moved into the country house alone. I had a dog—at least for a few days until he ran off—an old Dodge car, and a Finnish woman who cleaned, prepared my breakfast, and murmured Finnish proverbs to herself over the electric stove.",

I graduated from Yale in 1915, just twenty-five years after my father, and soon after, I served in World War I. I enjoyed the action so much that I returned home feeling unsettled. The Midwest, which once felt like the center of everything, now appeared remote and insignificant. So, I decided to move East and learn the bond business, as it seemed everyone I knew was doing the same and I figured there was room for me too.

My father agreed to support me financially for a year, and after some delays, I moved East permanently in the spring of 1922.\n\nIt made sense to find an apartment in the city, but since the weather was warm and I missed the open spaces of my old home, I was attracted to the idea, suggested by a coworker, of renting a house together in a suburb.

I briefly had a dog, who soon ran away, an old Dodge car, and a Finnish housekeeper who cooked my breakfast, made my bed, and spoke Finnish sayings to herself as she worked in the kitchen."

For one thing, there was so much reading material available, and I felt I could absorb abundant good health from the young, life-giving air. I purchased twelve books covering banking, credit, and investment securities. They sat on my bookshelf, bound in red and gold, looking like freshly printed money and promising to reveal the valuable secrets known only to legendary wealthy figures such as Midas, Morgan, and Maecenas. Furthermore, I fully intended to read many other books as well. In college, I had a penchant for literature – one year I authored a series of quite serious and obvious opinion pieces for the Yale News – and now I planned to bring back these kinds of interests into my life and once again become that rather limited type of person, the 'well-rounded man.'

It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York—and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals—like the egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual wonder to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.\nI lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsby’s mansion. Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbour’s lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a month.\nAcross the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I’d known Tom in college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.\nHer husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven—a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savours of anticlimax. His family were enormously wealthy—even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he’d left Chicago and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for instance, he’d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest. It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.\nWhy they came East I don’t know. They had spent a year in France for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn’t believe it—I had no sight into Daisy’s heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.\nAnd so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.",

This location is on a thin, bustling island that extends directly east of New York City, featuring, among other notable natural sights, two peculiar land formations. About twenty miles from the city, a pair of enormous, identically shaped landmasses, resembling eggs and separated by a small bay, push out into Long Island Sound, the calmest saltwater area in the Western Hemisphere, like a vast wet farmyard. They aren't perfectly oval; like the egg in the famous story, both are flattened at the point where they almost touch. However, their physical similarity must be a constant source of amazement for the seagulls flying overhead. For those on the ground, their differences in every aspect except shape and size are a more interesting observation.\nI resided in West Egg, which was the—well, the less prestigious of the two, though describing it as just 'less fashionable' doesn't fully capture the strange and somewhat ominous contrast between them. My home was situated right at the tip of the egg-shaped peninsula, merely fifty yards from the Sound, positioned between two enormous estates that cost twelve or fifteen thousand dollars to rent for the season. The one on my right was incredibly large by any standard; it was a faithful copy of a town hall from Normandy, France, complete with a tower on one side, looking brand new under a thin covering of fresh ivy, and it boasted a marble swimming pool and over forty acres of gardens and lawn. This was Gatsby’s mansion. Or, more accurately, since I hadn't met Mr. Gatsby, it was the mansion inhabited by a gentleman named Gatsby. My own house was unattractive, but it was small enough to be overlooked, which provided me with a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor’s extensive grounds, and the comforting closeness of millionaires—all for just eighty dollars a month.\nAcross the small bay, the elegant white mansions of fashionable East Egg gleamed along the waterfront. The story of the summer truly begins on the evening I drove across the bay to have dinner with Tom and Daisy Buchanan. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I had known Tom from our time in college. I had also spent two days with them in Chicago immediately following the war.\nAmong his many athletic achievements, her husband had been one of the most formidable football players (an 'end') ever at Yale—a well-known figure nationally for a period, one of those people who achieve such focused, high-level skill at twenty-one that everything afterward feels anticlimactic. His family was immensely wealthy—even during college, his casual spending was criticized—but he had now left Chicago and moved East in a way that was quite impressive: for example, he had transported a group of polo horses from Lake Forest. It was difficult to comprehend that someone my age had the wealth to do such a thing.\nI don’t know why they came East. They had spent a year in France without any particular reason, and then had restlessly moved from place to place wherever rich people gathered and played polo. Daisy told me over the phone that this was a permanent move, but I didn't believe her; I couldn’t see into Daisy’s heart, but I felt that Tom would continue drifting indefinitely, searching, perhaps a little sadly, for the intense excitement of some unforgettable football game he could never relive.\nAnd so it was that on a pleasant, breezy evening, I drove over to East Egg to visit two old friends whom, paradoxically, I barely knew anymore. Their house was even more elaborate than I had anticipated, a cheerful Georgian Colonial mansion in red and white, overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach and stretched towards the front door for a quarter of a mile, flowing over sundials and brick walkways and vibrant flower gardens. Finally, as it reached the house, it seemed to climb the side walls as bright vines, as if carried by its own momentum. The front of the house was punctuated by a line of French windows, now glowing with reflected gold and wide open to the warm, windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan, dressed in riding clothes, stood on the front porch with his legs spread apart.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Purely by chance, I happened to rent a house in one of North America's most unusual neighborhoods. This community was situated on a narrow, lively island stretching directly east from New York City, notable for two distinctive land shapes. About twenty miles from the city, two enormous land masses—shaped like eggs and nearly identical—protrude into Long Island Sound, separated only by a narrow strip of water. These 'eggs' aren't perfect ovals; instead, they're slightly flattened where they touch, much like the egg from the Columbus story, which must constantly amaze the seagulls flying overhead. But for those on the ground, what's even more striking is how different the two areas are, despite their similar shapes and sizes.\n\nI lived in West Egg, which was considered less fashionable—though that only hints at the odd and rather unsettling differences between the two. My own small, rundown house sat at the very tip of West Egg, barely fifty yards from the water, squeezed between two grand estates that rented for as much as twelve or fifteen thousand dollars a season. The enormous property on my right was modeled after a French town hall, complete with a tower, new ivy, a marble pool, and over forty acres of gardens. This was Gatsby’s mansion, though at the time, I didn’t know Gatsby himself, and only knew it belonged to someone named Gatsby. My modest home was unsightly, but being small and overlooked, it gave me a view of the water, a glimpse of my neighbor's luxurious lawn, and the comfort of living near millionaires—all for just eighty dollars a month.\n\nOn the other side of the bay, the elegant houses of fashionable East Egg gleamed by the water. The real story of the summer began the evening I drove over there to have dinner with Tom and Daisy Buchanan. Daisy was my distant cousin, and I had known Tom at college. Shortly after the war, I visited them for a couple of days in Chicago.\n\nTom, in addition to his physical prowess, had been a star football player at Yale, becoming something of a national celebrity and reaching a peak so early in life that everything afterwards seemed less impressive. His family was extremely affluent—even at college, his lavish spending was remarkable. Now he’d left Chicago and moved East in a spectacular way, even bringing a team of polo ponies from Lake Forest, which seemed almost unbelievable for someone my age.\n\nI never really understood why they moved East. After spending a year in France for no particular reason, they drifted from place to place, following wealthy crowds and polo matches. Daisy claimed this move was permanent, but I doubted it. I couldn’t see into Daisy’s mind, but I had a sense that Tom would always be searching for the excitement and intensity of a long-lost football game.\n\nSo, on a warm and windy evening, I set off to East Egg to visit two old friends—though, truthfully, I barely knew them at all. Their house was even more impressive than I expected: a bright red-and-white Georgian Colonial mansion overlooking the bay. Its lawn stretched from the beach towards the front door for a quarter mile, crossing sundials, brick paths, and vibrant gardens, eventually climbing up the house in a cascade of vines. The front of the house was lined with glowing French windows thrown wide open to the gentle afternoon breeze, and Tom Buchanan, dressed in riding clothes, stood on the porch with his feet planted firmly apart."

          "text_segment": "He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.\nHis speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts.\n“Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he seemed to say, “just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are.” We were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.\nWe talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.\n“I’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly.\nTurning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped the tide offshore.\n“It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.” He turned me around again, politely and abruptly. “We’ll go inside.”\nWe walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.\nThe only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.\nThe younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.\nThe other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the room.\n“I’m p-paralysed with happiness.”\nShe laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she had. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker. (I’ve heard it said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)\nAt any rate, Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.\nI looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered “Listen,” a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Tom had undergone changes since his college days at New Haven. He was now a robust, sandy-haired man in his early thirties, with a somewhat stern mouth and an air of arrogance. His two bright, haughty eyes dominated his face, creating the impression that he was perpetually leaning forward aggressively. The effect of his powerful physique was undeniable, even his somewhat feminine riding clothes couldn't conceal it—his glistening boots seemed strained by his legs, and you could see significant muscle shifts under his thin coat when he moved his shoulder. It was a body built for tremendous physical force—a body that felt cruel.\nHis voice, a low, raspy tenor, reinforced the sense of irritability he projected. It carried a hint of condescending superiority, even towards acquaintances—and some men from New Haven had intensely disliked him.\nHe seemed to communicate, implicitly, \"Don't assume my judgment on these subjects is absolute merely because I possess greater strength and masculinity than you.\" We were members of the same exclusive college society, and while we were never close, I always felt he approved of me and desired my liking, perhaps with a certain harsh, defiant longing of his own.\nWe chatted briefly on the sunny porch.\n\"This is a pleasant estate I've got,\" he remarked, his gaze restlessly scanning his surroundings.\nTaking hold of my arm, he turned me to face the sweeping view from the front, indicating a submerged Italian-style garden, a half-acre section filled with dense, fragrant roses, and a small, blunt motorboat bobbing on the water offshore.\n\"It previously belonged to Demaine, the oil magnate.\" He then turned me back around, politely but abruptly. \"Let's go inside.\"\nWe walked through a tall entryway into a bright, rosy-hued room, bordered subtly at both ends by French windows that connected it to the house. The windows were slightly open, appearing stark white against the fresh green lawn outside that seemed to spill a little way into the room. A breeze swept through, causing the curtains to billow inward at one end and outward at the other like pale flags, spiraling them upwards towards the ornate, cake-like ceiling, before skimming across the deep red rug, creating a wave-like shadow as wind does on the surface of the sea.\nThe sole object in the room that remained perfectly still was a massive sofa where two young women reclined, appearing suspended as if on a tethered hot air balloon. They were both dressed in white, their gowns undulating and fluttering as though they had just drifted back inside after a brief flight around the residence. I must have stood for a few moments, listening to the sharp sound of the curtains flapping and a framed picture creaking on the wall. Then, with a distinct thud, Tom Buchanan closed the rear windows, and the captured wind in the room subsided, causing the curtains, the rug, and the two young women to settle slowly downwards onto the floor.\nThe younger of the two was unfamiliar to me. She was stretched out fully on her end of the sofa, completely still, her chin slightly lifted, as if she were balancing an object that might easily fall. If she noticed me peripherally, she gave no indication—in fact, I was nearly prompted to softly utter an apology for disturbing her entry. Her appearance exuded a perfect self-reliance.\nThe other young woman, Daisy, attempted to stand—she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious look—then she laughed, a delightful, slightly silly little laugh, and I joined in and moved further into the room.\n\"I'm utterly frozen with happiness,\" she declared.\nShe laughed again, as if she had just said something exceptionally clever, and held my hand momentarily, looking up into my face, assuring me that I was the person in the world she most wanted to see. This was typical behavior for her. She hinted in a soft tone that the last name of the woman balancing was Baker. (I've heard it suggested that Daisy's soft voice was just a technique to make people lean closer; a trivial observation that didn't diminish her charm at all.)\nRegardless, Miss Baker's lips twitched slightly, she gave me an almost imperceptible nod, and then quickly tilted her head back again—the item she was balancing had evidently wobbled slightly, startling her. Again, an urge to apologize arose within me. Any display of complete self-sufficiency tends to elicit an awestruck respect from me.\nI glanced back at my cousin, who began to question me in her low, captivating voice. It was the sort of voice that holds your attention, rising and falling as if each phrase were a unique musical sequence that would never be repeated. Her face was beautiful and held a touch of sadness, yet was bright with vibrant features—sparkling eyes and a vibrant, expressive mouth. However, it was the excitement in her voice that men who had loved her found unforgettable: a compelling, melodic quality, a hushed invitation to 'Listen,' a suggestion that she had recently experienced joyful, thrilling events and that more delightful, exciting things were waiting in the immediate future.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "He was different now than he had been during his college days at New Haven. He was a strong, fair-haired man of thirty, with a tough mouth and an arrogant attitude. His two bold, gleaming eyes dominated his face, making him look as if he was always aggressively pushing forward. The delicate look of his riding attire could not conceal the raw strength of his body—he seemed to fill out his shiny boots so much that they strained at the laces, and when he moved his shoulder beneath his thin jacket, you could see his muscles shifting. His physique suggested great power—a harsh, capable body. \n\nHis voice, with its gruff and husky tenor, contributed to the sense of restlessness he projected. He spoke with a trace of condescending authority, even to those he liked—there had been men at New Haven who couldn't stand him. It was as if he was always saying, 'Don't assume my opinion is conclusive just because I'm stronger and more masculine than you.' We had been in the same senior group, and although we were never close friends, I always felt he approved of me and wanted my approval as well, in a somewhat rough, longing way.\n\nWe chatted for a short while on his sunlit porch. \n\n\"I have a great place here,\" he told me, his eyes darting inquisitively around. He turned me by the arm and, with a broad hand, gestured across the front of the property, showing me an Italian garden below, a stretch of deep, fragrant roses, and a blunt-nosed motorboat bobbing in the offshore tide. \"It used to be Demaine's, the oil millionaire,\" he said, suddenly and courteously turning me again. \"Let's go inside.\"\n\nWe entered a tall hallway that led to a bright, rose-tinted room, barely tied to the rest of the house by French windows at each end. The windows were open, standing white against the fresh grass outside, which seemed to reach slightly indoors. A breeze moved through the room, pushing curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them toward the cake-like, frosted ceiling, and then rippling the wine-colored rug, casting shifting shadows across it like wind over the sea.\n\nThe only thing in the room that didn't move was a huge sofa, where two young women seemed to be anchored as if atop a tethered balloon. Both were dressed in white, and their dresses floated and billowed as though they had just breezed back in from a quick flight around the house. I stood for several moments, listening to the snapping curtains and the groaning picture on the wall. Then, Tom Buchanan slammed shut the rear windows, the breeze vanished, and the curtains, rug, and two women slowly settled to the ground.\n\nOf the two women, one was a stranger to me. She was stretched out on her end of the sofa, perfectly still, her chin slightly raised as if balancing something that might fall at any moment. Even if she noticed me from the side of her eyes, she didn't show it—in fact, I almost felt compelled to apologize for bothering her by arriving.\n\nThe other woman, Daisy, tried to get up—she leaned forward with earnestness—then let out a charming, quirky little laugh, prompting me to do the same as I entered the room. \"I'm paralyzed with happiness,\" she exclaimed. She laughed again as if making a clever remark, held my hand briefly, and looked up at me in a way that made it seem as if I was the only person she wanted to see. That was characteristic of her. She quietly hinted that the other woman's last name was Baker. (People say Daisy's soft-spoken manner forced others to lean in to hear her; a critique that didn't diminish her appeal.)\n\nMiss Baker barely moved her lips and nodded at me, then quickly tilted her head back again—whatever she was 'balancing' seemed to wobble and unsettle her. Again, I almost apologized—I'm always awed by displays of absolute self-assurance.\n\nI turned back to Daisy, who began to ask me questions in her low, captivating voice—the kind the ear follows as if it were a melodic tune heard only once. Her face was beautiful and a bit sad, with sparkling eyes and a passionate mouth; but her voice held a kind of excitement that men found unforgettable: a musical kind of insistence, a whisper that invited you to listen—a suggestion that she had just experienced something joyful and interesting, and that something equally thrilling was about to happen next."

She then added unexpectedly, 'You really should see the baby.' 'I'd like to,' I said. 'She's sleeping. She's three years old. Haven't you ever seen her?' 'Never.' 'Well, you must see her.

'Oh, I'll certainly stay in the East, don't you worry,' he stated, glancing quickly at Daisy and then back at me, seeming poised for something more. 'I'd be a total idiot to reside anywhere else.' At this moment, Miss Baker interjected, 'Absolutely!' so abruptly that I was startled—it was the first sound she'd made since I arrived.

'Don't look at me,' Daisy countered, 'I've been trying to get you to New York all afternoon.' 'No, thank you,' Miss Baker said to the four cocktails just brought from the kitchen. 'I'm sticking strictly to my training.' Her host regarded her with disbelief. 'You are!' He quickly downed his drink as if it were a mere drop. 'How you ever get anything accomplished is beyond my understanding.' I observed Miss Baker, wondering what activity she was referring to as 'getting done.' I found her pleasant to look at. She was a slim, flat-chested young woman with a straight posture, which she emphasized by leaning her shoulders back like a young military recruit. Her grey, sun-squinted eyes met mine with polite mutual curiosity from a pale, appealing, dissatisfied face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a photo of her, somewhere before.

It struck me that I'd seen her, or her photograph, somewhere before.\n\n\"You live in West Egg, don't you?\" she said with a hint of disdain. \"I know someone there.\"\n\n\"I don't know anyone—\"\n\n\"You must know Gatsby.\"\n\n\"Gatsby?\" Daisy asked. \"What Gatsby?\"\n\nBefore I could explain that he was my neighbor, dinner was announced; Tom firmly linked his arm with mine and ushered me out of the room as if he were moving a piece on a chessboard."

She snapped them out with her fingers. “In two weeks it’ll be the longest day in the year.” She looked at us all radiantly. “Do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it.”\n“We ought to plan something,” yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed.\n“All right,” said Daisy. “What’ll we plan?” She turned to me helplessly: “What do people plan?”\nBefore I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her little finger.\n“Look!” she complained; “I hurt it.”\nWe all looked—the knuckle was black and blue.\n“You did it, Tom,” she said accusingly. “I know you didn’t mean to, but you did do it. That’s what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a great, big, hulking physical specimen of a—”\n“I hate that word ‘hulking,’ ” objected Tom crossly, “even in kidding.”\n“Hulking,” insisted Daisy.\nSometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire. They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the West, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself.\n“You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,” I confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret. “Can’t you talk about crops or something?”\nI meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in an unexpected way.\n“Civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out Tom violently. “I’ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read The Rise of the Coloured Empires by this man Goddard?”\n“Why, no,” I answered, rather surprised by his tone.\n“Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly submerged. It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.”\n“Tom’s getting very profound,” said Daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness. “He reads deep books with long words in them. What was that word we—”\n“Well, these books are all scientific,” insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently. “This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It’s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things.”\n“We’ve got to beat them down,” whispered Daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun.\n“You ought to live in California—” began Miss Baker, but Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.\n“This idea is that we’re Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are, and—” After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again. “—And we’ve produced all the things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all that. Do you see?”\nThere was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned towards me.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Moving gracefully and without haste, the two young women, with their hands resting lightly on their hips, went ahead of us onto a pinkish porch facing the setting sun. On the table there, four candles gently flickered in the reduced breeze. Daisy frowned and asked, \"Why candles?\" She quickly put them out with her fingers. \"In two weeks, it will be the longest day of the year,\" she said, looking brightly at all of us. \"Do you always anticipate the longest day and then let it pass? I always look forward to the longest day of the year and somehow never observe it.\" Yawning, Miss Baker commented, \"We should make some plans,\" as she settled into her chair at the table, appearing as relaxed as if she were getting into bed. \"Okay,\" Daisy agreed. \"What shall we plan?\" She turned to me, seeming lost, and asked, \"What kinds of things do people plan?\" Before I had a chance to reply, she looked with a look of surprise and concern at her little finger. \"Look!\" she exclaimed, complaining, \"I've hurt it.\" We all looked, and her knuckle was bruised and discolored. \"You did this, Tom,\" she said, blaming him. \"I know you didn't intend to, but you actually did it. This is what happens when I marry a brutal man, a huge, imposing physical specimen of a—\" Tom interrupted grumpily, \"I dislike that word 'hulking,' even when you're joking.\" \"Hulking,\" Daisy repeated firmly. At times, she and Miss Baker spoke simultaneously, subtly and with playful randomness that wasn't quite trivial chat. It was as cool as their white dresses and their detached eyes, lacking any strong desire. They were present, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite, effortless attempt to entertain or be entertained. They understood that dinner would soon be over, and a little later, the evening itself would also end and be dismissed without ceremony. This felt starkly different from the West, where an evening was hurried through stages towards its conclusion, either in constant disappointed anticipation or in sheer nervous apprehension of the present moment. \"You make me feel unsophisticated, Daisy,\" I admitted after my second glass of somewhat impressive but corky claret. \"Couldn't you perhaps talk about farming or something similar?\" I didn't have any specific meaning behind this comment, but it was received in an unforeseen manner. \"Civilization is collapsing,\" Tom declared aggressively. \"I've become extremely pessimistic about things. Have you read 'The Rise of the Colored Empires' by this author, Goddard?\" \"Why, no,\" I replied, somewhat taken aback by how he said it. \"Well, it's an excellent book, and everyone should read it,\" he said. \"The central idea is that if we aren't careful, the white race will be... completely overwhelmed. It's all scientific data; it's been substantiated.\" \"Tom is becoming quite intellectual,\" Daisy remarked with an air of thoughtless sadness. \"He reads complicated books with difficult words. What was that word we—\" \"Look, these books are all scientific,\" Tom insisted, giving her an impatient look. \"This expert has fully developed the entire concept. It's our responsibility, as the leading race, to be vigilant, or these other races will take charge.\" \"We have to suppress them,\" Daisy whispered, winking intensely towards the strong sunlight. \"You should live in California—\" Miss Baker started to say, but Tom stopped her by shifting his weight heavily in his chair. \"The theory is that we are Nordic,\" he explained. \"I am, and you are, and you are, and—\" After a very brief pause, he included Daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again. \"—And we have created everything that constitutes civilization—you know, science and art, and all of that. Understand?\" There was something sad about how focused he was, as if his self-satisfaction, more intense than before, was no longer enough for him. When the telephone inside the house rang almost immediately and the butler left the porch, Daisy seized the brief interruption and leaned towards me.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Gracefully and leisurely, with their hands resting gently at their sides, the two young women led us outside onto a porch tinged with a pink glow from the setting sun. Four candles flickered on the table in the gentle breeze. \"Why do we need candles?\" Daisy questioned, frowning, as she extinguished them with her fingers. \"In two weeks it’ll be the longest day of the year.\" She beamed at us. \"Do any of you ever wait for the longest day of the year only to miss it? I always do.\" \n\n\"We should make plans,\" Miss Baker said with a yawn, settling into her chair as if she were slipping into bed.\n\n\"Okay,\" Daisy replied. \"What should we plan?\" She looked at me uncertainly. \"What do people normally plan?\"\n\nBefore I could answer, her gaze fixated on her little finger in surprise. \"Look,\" she complained, \"I hurt it.\" \n\nWe all looked and saw her knuckle was bruised. \"It was you, Tom,\" she accused. \"I know you didn’t intend it, but it happened. That’s what comes from marrying a brute of a man, a huge, hulking example of—\"\n\n\"I dislike that word, 'hulking,'\" Tom interrupted irritably, \"even in a joke.\"\n\n\"Hulking,\" Daisy repeated stubbornly.\n\nOccasionally, she and Miss Baker spoke at the same time, softly and playfully, never quite rambling, and their manner was as composed as their white dresses and uninterested gazes. They were present and welcoming to Tom and me, making only a modest show of interest or amusement. They understood that dinner would soon finish and the evening would pass quietly, in stark contrast to the West, where evenings felt rushed and filled with anxious expectation or dread about how they'd end.\n\n\"You make me feel uncultured, Daisy,\" I confessed after my second glass of wine. \"Can’t you talk about farming or something?\"\n\nI hadn't meant anything significant, but the comment took an unexpected turn.\n\n\"Civilization’s falling apart,\" Tom burst out. \"I’ve become very pessimistic about things. Have you read 'The Rise of the Coloured Empires' by this Goddard fellow?\"\n\n\"No,\" I replied, surprised by his intensity.\n\n\"It’s a great book—everyone should read it. The premise is that, unless we’re careful, the white race will be overwhelmed. It’s all scientifically proven.\"\n\n\"Tom’s getting very philosophical,\" said Daisy with a hint of absent sadness. \"He reads deep books with long words. What was that word we—\"\n\n\"These books are all scientific,\" Tom insisted, impatiently. \"This man’s figured everything out. As the dominant race, it’s our duty to make sure other races don’t take over.\"\n\n\"We have to stop them,\" Daisy murmured, winking at the fiery sunset.\n\n\"You ought to move to California—\" Miss Baker started, but Tom cut her off by shifting in his seat.\n\n\"The point is, we’re Nordics. I am, you are, and you are,\" he said, after a tiny pause including Daisy with a nod, and she winked at me again. \"We’re the people who made civilization—science, art, and everything. Understand?\"\n\nThere was something sadly earnest in his focus, as if his self-satisfaction was no longer enough for him. Then, as the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch, Daisy used the brief interruption to lean closer to me."

Do you want to hear about the butler’s nose?”\n“That’s why I came over tonight.”\n“Well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people. He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it began to affect his nose—”\n“Things went from bad to worse,” suggested Miss Baker.\n“Yes. Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up his position.”\nFor a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.\nThe butler came back and murmured something close to Tom’s ear, whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went inside. As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and singing.\n“I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a—of a rose, an absolute rose. Doesn’t he?” She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation: “An absolute rose?”\nThis was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house.\nMiss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said “Sh!” in a warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond, and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to hear. The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.\n“This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbour—” I began.\n“Don’t talk. I want to hear what happens.”\n“Is something happening?” I inquired innocently.\n“You mean to say you don’t know?” said Miss Baker, honestly surprised. “I thought everybody knew.”\n“I don’t.”\n“Why—” she said hesitantly. “Tom’s got some woman in New York.”\n“Got some woman?” I repeated blankly.\nMiss Baker nodded.\n“She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time. Don’t you think?”\nAlmost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at the table.\n“It couldn’t be helped!” cried Daisy with tense gaiety.\nShe sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and continued: “I looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very romantic outdoors. There’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He’s singing away—” Her voice sang: “It’s romantic, isn’t it, Tom?”\n“Very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to me: “If it’s light enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables.”\nThe telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone, and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldn’t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "With lively enthusiasm, she leaned in and whispered, \"I'll share a family secret with you. It's concerning the butler's nose. Are you interested in hearing about it?\" I responded, \"That's precisely why I came this evening.\" \"Well, he wasn't always a butler,\" she explained. \"He used to polish silver for a wealthy New York family who owned a silver collection large enough for two hundred people. He had to polish it constantly, from morning until evening, and over time, it began to affect his nose—\" Miss Baker chimed in, \"Things progressively worsened.\" \"Exactly. They kept getting worse,\" Daisy agreed, \"until he ultimately had to resign from his position.\" For a brief moment, the setting sun cast a lovely, warm light on her radiant face; her voice captivated me, drawing me forward intently as I listened—then the glow faded, each ray leaving her reluctantly, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk. The butler returned and quietly spoke something into Tom's ear, causing Tom to frown. He pushed back his chair and went indoors without a word. As if his departure energized her, Daisy leaned forward once more, her voice bright and melodic. \"I love having you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a—of a rose, a truly perfect rose. Doesn't he?\" She turned to Miss Baker for affirmation: \"A perfect rose?\" This was inaccurate; I don't resemble a rose in the slightest. She was speaking impulsively, but a compelling warmth emanated from her, as if her heart was trying to reach you, hidden within those intense, exciting words. Suddenly, she threw her napkin onto the table, excused herself, and followed Tom into the house. Miss Baker and I exchanged a brief look, deliberately expressionless. I was about to speak when she abruptly sat upright and issued a quiet, warning \"Sh!\" A low, fervent whispering could be heard from the adjacent room, and Miss Baker leaned forward without hesitation, trying to overhear. The faint voices seemed on the verge of becoming clear, then subsided, then rose excitedly, and finally stopped altogether. \"This Mr. Gatsby you mentioned is my neighbor—\" I started to say. \"Don't talk,\" she interrupted. \"I want to find out what's happening.\" \"Is something going on?\" I asked naively. \"Are you saying you don't know?\" Miss Baker replied, appearing genuinely surprised. \"I assumed everyone was aware.\" \"I wasn't,\" I said. \"Well,\" she hesitated, \"Tom has another woman in New York.\" \"He has a woman?\" I repeated, bewildered. Miss Baker nodded. \"She could show some consideration and not call him during dinner. Don't you think?\" Almost before I could fully grasp her meaning, there was the rustle of a dress and the sound of leather shoes, and Tom and Daisy were back seated at the table. \"It couldn't be helped!\" Daisy exclaimed with forced cheerfulness. She sat down, cast a sharp look at Miss Baker and then at me, and continued, \"I stepped outside for a moment, and it is exceptionally romantic out there. There's a bird on the lawn that I'm certain must be a nightingale that arrived on a transatlantic ship. It's singing away—\" Her voice became lyrical: \"It's romantic, isn't it, Tom?\" \"Very romantic,\" he replied, then added sadly to me, \"If there's sufficient light after dinner, I want to take you to see the stables.\" The telephone rang sharply from inside, startling us. As Daisy shook her head decisively at Tom, the topic of the stables, and indeed all previous conversation points, dissolved into thin air. Amid the fractured remnants of those final five minutes at the table, I recall the candles being relit pointlessly, and I felt an urge to look directly at everyone while simultaneously avoiding meeting anyone's gaze. I couldn't decipher what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but I doubted if even Miss Baker, who seemed to possess a certain tough skepticism, could completely dismiss the unseen guest's shrill, metallic urgency from her mind. To some personalities, the situation might have seemed intriguing—my own immediate impulse was to call the police.",

It has to do with the butler’s nose—are you interested?”\n“That’s exactly why I came by tonight,” I joked.\n“Well, he didn’t start out as a butler; he used to be a silver polisher for a wealthy family in New York who owned enough silver to serve two hundred people. Day after day, he polished silver from dawn till dusk, and eventually it began to affect his nose—”\n“Things probably got worse after that,” Miss Baker interjected.\n“Yes, exactly. Things just spiraled downward until he had to leave his job.”\nFor a brief instant, the fading sunlight shone warmly on her vibrant face as her voice drew me in, enraptured, until the light finally faded, every last ray leaving her like children reluctantly leaving a friendly street at dusk.\nThe butler returned and whispered something to Tom, who became annoyed, pushed away from the table, and silently went inside. As Tom left, Daisy seemed to come alive; she leaned toward me, her voice bright and melodic.\n“I really love having you at my table, Nick. You make me think of a rose, a real rose. Don’t you agree?” she asked Miss Baker, “He’s a real rose, right?”\nBut this wasn’t true—I didn’t resemble a rose at all. She was simply improvising, but I still felt a comforting warmth coming from her words, as if she was trying to reach out to me with her sincerity. Then, all at once, she put down her napkin, excused herself, and went into the house.\nMiss Baker and I shared a quick, meaningless glance. I was about to say something when she sat up straight and hushed me. From inside, we could hear a low, urgent conversation, and Miss Baker unabashedly leaned forward, trying to catch what was being said. The voices rose and fell excitedly, almost making sense at times, and then stopped altogether.\n“I mentioned that Mr. Gatsby is my neighbor—” I started, but she cut me off.\n“Shh, I want to listen.”\n“Is something going on?” I asked, genuinely unsure.\n“You mean you haven’t heard?” Miss Baker was surprised. “I thought everyone knew.”\n“No, I don’t.”\n“Well,” she said slowly, “Tom has a woman in New York.”\n“A woman?” I repeated in confusion.\nShe nodded. “She could at least wait to call him until after dinner, don’t you think?”\nBefore I could process this, Daisy and Tom returned to the table, Daisy’s demeanor strained but cheerful.\n“I couldn’t help it!” she cried, taking her seat and looking intently at Miss Baker and then at me. She added, “I stepped outside briefly and it’s so romantic out there. I saw a bird on the lawn—must be a nightingale from overseas. It’s singing beautifully.” Her tone was lilting: “Isn’t it romantic, Tom?”\n“Very romantic,” Tom replied, but then said glumly to me, “If we have enough daylight after dinner, I’ll show you the stables.”\nJust then, the phone rang loudly inside, and Daisy signaled to Tom not to go. Suddenly the topic of the stables and every other subject evaporated. As I sat there, the only concrete memory of those last tense minutes was the candles being relit, seemingly for no purpose, and a feeling of wanting to confront everyone directly but at the same time avoid their gaze. I couldn’t read either Daisy or Tom’s thoughts, and even Miss Baker, usually so skeptical, probably couldn’t ignore the tension caused by the persistent, demanding phone. For some, this drama might have felt intriguing; personally, it made me want to call the police right then and there."

Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while, trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.\nDaisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl.\n“We don’t know each other very well, Nick,” she said suddenly. “Even if we are cousins. You didn’t come to my wedding.”\n“I wasn’t back from the war.”\n“That’s true.” She hesitated. “Well, I’ve had a very bad time, Nick, and I’m pretty cynical about everything.”\nEvidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn’t say any more, and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter.\n“I suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything.”\n“Oh, yes.” She looked at me absently. “Listen, Nick; let me tell you what I said when she was born. Would you like to hear?”\n“Very much.”\n“It’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel about—things. Well, she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and wept. ‘All right,’ I said, ‘I’m glad it’s a girl. And I hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.’\n“You see I think everything’s terrible anyhow,” she went on in a convinced way. “Everybody thinks so—the most advanced people. And I know. I’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.” Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom’s, and she laughed with thrilling scorn. “Sophisticated—God, I’m sophisticated!”\nThe instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited, and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged.\nInside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the Saturday Evening Post—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running together in a soothing tune. The lamplight, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.\nWhen we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.\n“To be continued,” she said, tossing the magazine on the table, “in our very next issue.”\nHer body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she stood up.\n“Ten o’clock,” she remarked, apparently finding the time on the ceiling. “Time for this good girl to go to bed.”\n“Jordan’s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,” explained Daisy, “over at Westchester.”\n“Oh—you’re Jordan Baker.”\nI knew now why her face was familiar—its pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I had forgotten long ago.\n“Good night,” she said softly. “Wake me at eight, won’t you.”\n“If you’ll get up.”\n“I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.”\n“Of course you will,” confirmed Daisy.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Naturally, the discussion about horses wasn't brought up again. Tom and Miss Baker returned to the library, maintaining a distance, appearing as though they were keeping vigil beside something substantial. Meanwhile, attempting to seem politely interested while perhaps a bit oblivious, I trailed behind Daisy across a series of connecting porches until we reached the front porch. In its heavy shadows, we settled next to each other on a wicker sofa. Daisy held her face in her hands as if appreciating its beautiful form, and her gaze drifted out into the dark, soft evening. I could see she was troubled, so I tried asking calming questions about her young daughter. \"We don't know each other very well, Nick,\" she stated abruptly. \"Even though we're cousins. You weren't at my wedding.\" \"I hadn't returned from the war yet.\" \"That's right.\" She paused. \"Honestly, Nick, I've had a very difficult time, and I'm quite cynical about everything.\" She clearly had cause to feel that way. I waited, but she said nothing more, and after a moment, I rather weakly brought up her daughter again. \"I suppose she talks, and eats, and things like that.\" \"Oh, yes.\" She looked at me vaguely. \"Listen, Nick; let me tell you what I said the moment she was born. Would you care to hear?\" \"Very much.\" \"It will show you how I've come to feel about... life. Well, she was less than an hour old, and Tom was off somewhere or other. I woke up from the anesthesia with a total sense of abandonment and immediately asked the nurse if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and I turned my face away and cried. 'Okay,' I said, 'I'm glad it's a girl. And I hope she'll be a fool – that's the best a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.'\" \"You see, I think everything is awful anyway,\" she continued with conviction. \"Everyone does – all the most intelligent people. And I know. I've been everywhere, seen everything, done everything.\" Her eyes swept around defiantly, much like Tom's, and she let out a laugh of cutting scorn. \"Sophisticated – my God, I'm sophisticated!\" The instant her voice stopped, no longer commanding my attention or belief, I sensed the fundamental lack of sincerity in her words. It unsettled me, as if the entire evening had been some kind of setup to provoke an emotional reaction from me. I waited, and predictably, a moment later, she looked at me with a definite smirk on her lovely face, as if she had just confirmed her membership in a rather exclusive secret society that she and Tom belonged to. Inside, the red room glowed brightly. Tom and Miss Baker were seated at opposite ends of the long sofa, and she was reading aloud to him from The Saturday Evening Post – the words, low and without inflection, blending into a soothing rhythm. The lamp's light, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, caught the paper as she turned a page with a subtle movement of her arm muscles. When we entered, she paused us for a moment with a raised hand. \"To be continued,\" she announced, tossing the magazine onto the table, \"in our very next issue.\" Her body shifted with a restless movement of her knee, and she stood up. \"Ten o'clock,\" she remarked, seemingly finding the time by looking at the ceiling. \"Time for this good girl to retire.\" \"Jordan is playing in the tournament tomorrow,\" Daisy explained, \"up at Westchester.\" \"Oh – you are Jordan Baker.\" I now understood why her face was familiar – her pleasant, disdainful look had stared out at me from numerous rotogravure photos of the sports scene in places like Asheville, Hot Springs, and Palm Beach. I also remembered hearing a story about her, a critical, unpleasant one, but I had forgotten the specifics long ago. \"Good night,\" she said softly. \"Wake me at eight, won't you.\" \"If you actually get up.\" \"I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you soon.\" \"Of course you will,\" Daisy confirmed.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The horses were not brought up again after that. Tom and Miss Baker, walking with a small distance of evening light between them, headed back to the library together, as if keeping watch over something real. I tagged along with Daisy, trying to appear friendly and somewhat inattentive, as she led me through a series of linked porches to the one at the front of the house. We sat close together on a wicker bench in the dark shadows. Daisy put her face in her hands, almost as if to appreciate its beauty, and slowly looked out into the gentle night. I could see she was deeply troubled, so I tried asking a few calming questions about her daughter. Suddenly, she said that we didn’t truly know each other very well, even though we were cousins, and mentioned I hadn’t attended her wedding. I explained I hadn’t returned from the war yet. She acknowledged that, paused, and admitted she’d been through a rough time and was pretty pessimistic these days. It was clear she had reasons. She didn’t elaborate further, so after a little while, I brought up her daughter again, asking if the child talked and did all the ordinary things. Daisy, distracted, replied yes and asked if I wanted to hear what she’d said at her daughter’s birth. I encouraged her, and she explained that right after her daughter was born—and while Tom was nowhere to be found—she awoke under anesthesia, felt alone, and immediately asked whether she'd had a boy or girl. Learning it was a girl, she turned away and cried, saying she hoped her daughter would be a fool because, in her opinion, that was the best thing a girl could be: pretty and naive. She confided that she thought the world was awful, and she believed most sophisticated people felt the same, insisting she knew what she was talking about because of all she’d seen and experienced. She threw a challenging look around the porch like Tom sometimes did and laughed with biting irony, saying she was truly sophisticated. When she finished, I sensed a certain falseness in her tone, as if the whole interaction was meant to evoke sympathy from me. I waited, and soon she smiled at me as if sharing a secret only she and Tom understood. Inside, the brightly lit crimson room sparkled. Tom and Miss Baker sat at opposite sides of a long couch, while she read quietly from the Saturday Evening Post, her voice blending the words into a soothing flow. Light gleamed on Tom’s boots and caught the dull gold of her hair as she flipped a page with a graceful motion. When we entered, she paused by raising her hand for silence, then announced, 'To be continued in our next issue,' and tossed the magazine aside. She stood up with a restless shift, saying it was ten o’clock and time for her to go to bed. Daisy added that Jordan was playing in a tournament the next day at Westchester. That’s when I realized Jordan Baker’s identity, recalling her confident, slightly scornful look from many photographs of the sporting world, though I vaguely remembered hearing something negative about her in the past. She softly wished us good night and asked to be woken at eight, exchanged promises with Daisy, and then she said good night to me by name. Daisy assured her we’d see each other soon."

You know—lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing—”\n“Good night,” called Miss Baker from the stairs. “I haven’t heard a word.”\n“She’s a nice girl,” said Tom after a moment. “They oughtn’t to let her run around the country this way.”\n“Who oughtn’t to?” inquired Daisy coldly.\n“Her family.”\n“Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick’s going to look after her, aren’t you, Nick? She’s going to spend lots of weekends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be very good for her.”\nDaisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.\n“Is she from New York?” I asked quickly.\n“From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our beautiful white—”\n“Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?” demanded Tom suddenly.\n“Did I?” She looked at me. “I can’t seem to remember, but I think we talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I’m sure we did. It sort of crept up on us and first thing you know—”\n“Don’t believe everything you hear, Nick,” he advised me.\nI said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes later I got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor Daisy peremptorily called: “Wait!\n“I forgot to ask you something, and it’s important. We heard you were engaged to a girl out West.”\n“That’s right,” corroborated Tom kindly. “We heard that you were engaged.”\n“It’s a libel. I’m too poor.”\n“But we heard it,” insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again in a flower-like way. “We heard it from three people, so it must be true.”\nOf course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn’t even vaguely engaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the reasons I had come East. You can’t stop going with an old friend on account of rumours, and on the other hand I had no intention of being rumoured into marriage.\nTheir interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in arms—but apparently there were no such intentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he “had some woman in New York” was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.\nAlready it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages, where new red petrol-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight, and, turning my head to watch it, I saw that I was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbour’s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens.\nI decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and that would do for an introduction. But I didn’t call to him, for he gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone—he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was from him, I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Indeed, I think I'll arrange a marriage. Come over frequently, Nick, and I'll sort of—well—engineer situations for you two to be together.

It seemed to me that Daisy should have rushed out of the house with her child in her arms—but apparently, she had no such intentions. As for Tom, the fact that he \"had another woman in New York\" was genuinely less surprising than his being bothered by a book. Something seemed to be making him grapple with old ideas as if his strong physical arrogance no longer satisfied his demanding desires.\nAlready, it was the height of summer on the roofs of roadhouses and in front of garages along the road, where shiny red petrol-pumps sat in bright pools of light, and when I arrived at my place in West Egg, I pulled the car under its shelter and sat for a while on an old grass roller in the yard. The wind had died down, leaving a noisy, bright night, with wings flapping in the trees and a steady organ-like sound as the earth's full breath filled the frogs with life. The outline of a moving cat briefly appeared in the moonlight, and, turning my head to follow it, I saw I wasn't alone—fifty feet away a figure had stepped out of the shadow of my neighbour’s large house and was standing with his hands in his pockets, looking up at the scattered silver of the stars. Something about his relaxed movements and the confident way he stood on the grass suggested it was Mr. Gatsby himself, having come out to see what portion of our local sky belonged to him.\nI considered calling out to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, which could serve as an introduction. But I didn't call, because he suddenly indicated he was content to be by himself—he stretched his arms out towards the dark water in an unusual way, and, even from my distance, I could have sworn he was shaking. Without thinking, I looked towards the sea—and saw nothing but a single green light, tiny and far away, which might have been at the end of a dock.

Nick, if you visit us often, I'll make sure you and she have plenty of chances to meet—like accidentally locking you both in closets or sending you off in a boat together, that kind of thing.\" \n\n“Good night,” Miss Baker called from the stairs, pretending not to have listened. \n\nAfter a pause, Tom remarked, \"She's a nice girl. She really shouldn’t be wandering around like this on her own.”\n\n“Who says she shouldn’t?” Daisy responded icily.\n\n“Her family should be keeping an eye on her.”\n\n“She only has one elderly aunt. Anyway, Nick will keep her company, won't you, Nick? She’ll be visiting a lot this summer, and being here will be good for her.”\n\nDaisy and Tom exchanged a silent glance.\n\nI quickly asked, “Is she from New York?”\n\n“No, from Louisville. We grew up together there.”\n\nThen Tom suddenly asked Daisy, “Did you have a private chat with Nick outside?”\n\n“Did I?” she replied, looking at me. “I don't really remember, but I think we talked about the Nordic race. Yes, that's right. We got onto that topic before we realized it.”\n\nTom turned to me: “Don't believe everything you hear, Nick.”\n\nI replied that I hadn’t heard anything noteworthy, and I soon got up to leave. Both Daisy and Tom walked with me to the door, standing together in the bright doorway. As I started my car, Daisy abruptly called out: “Wait! I forgot to ask you something important. We heard you were engaged to someone out West.”\n\nTom agreed, “Yeah, that's what we heard.”\n\nI denied it, saying, “That’s not true. I don’t have the money for that.”\n\nDaisy persisted, “But we heard it from three different people, so it must be true.”\n\nI understood what they meant, though I was never even close to getting engaged. In fact, that kind of small-town gossip was partly why I moved to the East. You can't stop seeing an old friend just because of rumors, but I also didn’t plan to get pushed into marriage because of gossip.\n\nTheir curiosity made me feel they were a bit more approachable, but I also felt somewhat uncomfortable and disillusioned as I drove away. It seemed to me that Daisy should have just run out of the house with her child, but clearly she wasn't planning to. As for Tom, learning he had another woman in New York was less surprising than seeing how a book had unsettled him. Something seemed to be gnawing at him, as if he couldn't satisfy his demanding, forceful nature anymore.\n\nSummer had set in deeply, and as I drove past gas stations glowing with new red pumps, I parked at my West Egg house. For a while, I sat alone on an old grass roller outside, listening to the summer night—wind rustling, wings in the trees, frogs croaking energetically. A cat’s shadow rippled in the moonlight, and I noticed someone else was there—about fifty feet away stood a figure, hands in his pockets, gazing at the starry sky. His relaxed posture suggested it was Mr. Gatsby himself, out to admire the night.\n\nI thought about calling out to him—Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, which could serve as an introduction—but decided against it. He suddenly reached out his arms toward the dark water, in a way that made me think he was trembling. Looking toward the water, I only saw a small, distant green light at the end of a dock.

          "text_segment": "About halfway between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley of ashes—a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of ash-grey men, who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud, which screens their obscure operations from your sight.\nBut above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic—their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face, but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself into eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days, under sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.\nThe valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and, when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an hour. There is always a halt there of at least a minute, and it was because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan’s mistress.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Located about halfway between West Egg and New York, the main road briefly converges with the railway line for a short distance, deliberately avoiding a desolate territory. This region is the valley of ashes – a strange, infertile ground where ashes accumulate into ridges, hills, and bizarre formations as if they were growing crops. Here, ashes take the shape of buildings, chimneys, and rising smoke, eventually, through immense effort, even forming ash-colored individuals who move indistinctly and appear to be dissolving in the dusty air. Occasionally, a slow line of grey railway cars advances along an unseen track, emitting a jarring creak before stopping. Immediately, the ash-covered workers climb aboard with heavy shovels, stirring up a dense cloud that hides their murky activities. However, looking over this grey landscape and the continuous gusts of dreary dust, after a moment, one notices the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. These eyes are immense and blue, with pupils a yard high. They are not part of a face but are set within a giant pair of yellow spectacles resting where a nose should be, which doesn't exist. It seems some eccentric eye doctor placed them there to promote his business in Queens, before perhaps going permanently blind himself or simply forgetting about them and leaving. Yet, these eyes, slightly faded from enduring sun and rain over many paintless days, continue to look down upon the somber dumping ground. A small, polluted river forms one boundary of the valley of ashes. When the bridge is lifted to allow barges to pass, passengers on waiting trains can observe the gloomy scene for up to half an hour. There is always a stop there lasting at least a minute, and it was because of this mandatory halt that I initially encountered Tom Buchanan’s mistress.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Roughly midway between West Egg and New York, the main road merges quickly with the railroad, running alongside it for a short distance to skirt a bleak area of terrain. This region is known as the valley of ashes—a strange expanse where ashes pile up like crops, forming mounds and bizarre patches; where ashes shape themselves into buildings, smokestacks, rising smoke, and ultimately, with great effort, into pale, ghostly men who shuffle about, already fading into the gray, powdery air. Now and then, a line of gray cars creeps along an unseen track, emitting a terrible squeal before stopping, prompting the ash-covered men to emerge with heavy shovels, churning up dense clouds of ash that hide their activities from view.\nAbove this gray wasteland and its drifting clouds of dust, one notices after a moment the gaze of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. These eyes are huge and blue, with irises measuring one yard tall, staring out not from a human face but from gigantic yellow glasses perched on nothing. Apparently, a quirky eye doctor had them installed to advertise his business in Queens, only to later vanish or forget about them, leaving the eyes to languish, slightly faded by many days of sun and rain, still watching over the somber dumping ground.\nThe valley of ashes is bordered by a small, polluted river, and when its drawbridge lifts to allow barges through, train passengers can look upon the dreary sight for up to half an hour, since trains always pause there for at least a moment. It was during one of these stops that I first encountered Tom Buchanan’s mistress."

Then I heard footsteps on a stairs, and in a moment the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door.

Then she moistened her lips and spoke to her husband in a quiet, rough voice without turning around, telling him to get some chairs so someone could sit down. Wilson quickly agreed and went towards the small office, instantly blending into the gray color of the cement walls.

It was a few days before the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.\n“Terrible place, isn’t it,” said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor Eckleburg.\n“Awful.”\n“It does her good to get away.”\n“Doesn’t her husband object?”\n“Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He’s so dumb he doesn’t know he’s alive.”\nSo Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York—or not quite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom deferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be on the train.\nShe had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin, which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in New York. At the newsstand she bought a copy of Town Tattle and a moving-picture magazine, and in the station drugstore some cold cream and a small flask of perfume. Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one, lavender-coloured with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately she turned sharply from the window and, leaning forward, tapped on the front glass.\n“I want to get one of those dogs,” she said earnestly. “I want to get one for the apartment. They’re nice to have—a dog.”\nWe backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John D. Rockefeller. In a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an indeterminate breed.\n“What kind are they?” asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly, as he came to the taxi-window.\n“All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?”\n“I’d like to get one of those police dogs; I don’t suppose you got that kind?”\nThe man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and drew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.\n“That’s no police dog,” said Tom.\n“No, it’s not exactly a police dog,” said the man with disappointment in his voice. “It’s more of an Airedale.” He passed his hand over the brown washrag of a back. “Look at that coat. Some coat. That’s a dog that’ll never bother you with catching cold.”\n“I think it’s cute,” said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. “How much is it?”\n“That dog?” He looked at it admiringly. “That dog will cost you ten dollars.”\nThe Airedale—undoubtedly there was an Airedale concerned in it somewhere, though its feet were startlingly white—changed hands and settled down into Mrs. Wilson’s lap, where she fondled the weatherproof coat with rapture.\n“Is it a boy or a girl?” she asked delicately.\n“That dog? That dog’s a boy.”\n“It’s a bitch,” said Tom decisively. “Here’s your money. Go and buy ten more dogs with it.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "We waited for Daisy's friend, Myrtle Wilson, a short distance away and out of sight. It was just before the Fourth of July holiday, and a skinny, grey-complected Italian boy was arranging small explosives called torpedoes along the railway line. \"This is a dreadful place, isn't it,\" Tom commented, sharing a look of disapproval with the billboard of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg. \"It's awful,\" I agreed. \"It's good for her to escape from here,\" Tom added. \"Does her husband not mind?\" I asked. \"Wilson?\" Tom scoffed. \"He believes she's going to visit her sister in the city. He's so oblivious he doesn't even seem aware he's alive.\"  So, Tom Buchanan, his mistress, and I traveled to New York together—though not strictly side-by-side, as Mrs. Wilson chose to sit discreetly in a different train car. Tom made this concession out of consideration for the feelings of any people from East Egg who might be on the train.  Upon arrival in New York, she had changed into a brown patterned muslin dress that stretched tightly over her somewhat broad hips as Tom helped her onto the platform. At the newsstand, she purchased a copy of *Town Tattle* and a magazine about movies, and at the station pharmacy, she bought some cold cream and a small container of perfume. Upstairs, in the large, echoing concourse, she let four taxis pass by before selecting a new one, which was lavender with grey interior fabric. In this taxi, we moved out from the crowded station into the bright sunshine. However, she immediately turned away from the window and, leaning forward, tapped on the partition separating us from the driver.  \"I want to get a dog,\" she stated earnestly. \"I'd like to get one for the apartment. It's nice to have a dog.\"  We reversed to approach an elderly grey-haired man who bore a strangely similar appearance to John D. Rockefeller. In a basket hanging around his neck were about a dozen very young puppies of uncertain breed, huddled together nervously. \"What kind are they?\" Mrs. Wilson asked eagerly as the man approached the taxi window. \"All sorts. What kind are you looking for, madam?\" he replied. \"I'd prefer a police dog; I don't suppose you have any of that type?\"  The man looked uncertainly into the basket, reached in, and pulled one squirming puppy out by the scruff of its neck. \"That's not a police dog,\" Tom stated. \"No, it's not exactly a police dog,\" the man admitted with a tone of disappointment. \"It's more like an Airedale.\" He ran his hand over the puppy's rough, brown fur. \"Look at this coat. What a coat. This dog will never give you trouble catching a cold.\" \"I think it's adorable,\" Mrs. Wilson said enthusiastically. \"How much is he?\" \"This dog?\" The man looked at the puppy with admiration. \"This dog will cost you ten dollars.\" The Airedale—there was undoubtedly some Airedale heritage involved, although its paws were surprisingly white—was handed over and settled into Mrs. Wilson's lap, where she affectionately stroked its weather-resistant coat with delight. \"Is it a boy or a girl?\" she inquired delicately. \"That dog? That dog is a boy.\" \"It's a female,\" Tom declared definitively. \"Here's your money. Go buy ten more dogs with it.\"",

He thinks she’s visiting her sister in New York. He’s so clueless he doesn’t know he’s alive.” So Tom, his mistress, and I went to New York together—though not exactly together, since Mrs. Wilson sat in a separate car, out of concern for Tom’s East Egg acquaintances who might be on the train. She had changed into a brown printed muslin dress that fit snugly over her wide hips. When Tom helped her onto the platform, she stopped at the newsstand for a Town Tattle and a movie magazine, and at the drugstore for cold cream and some perfume. Upstairs, in the echoing station driveway, she let four taxis pass before choosing a lavender one with grey seats, and we left the station in the sunlight. Right away, she turned from the window, leaned forward, and signaled the driver. “I want to buy one of those dogs for the apartment,” she said. “It’s nice to have a dog.” We stopped near a grey old man who looked remarkably like John D. Rockefeller. He wore a basket around his neck with a dozen very young, mixed-breed puppies inside. “What kind of dogs are these?” Mrs. Wilson asked anxiously. “All kinds. Which do you want?” “I was hoping for a police dog, but I guess you don’t have one?” The man looked uncertain into the basket, then pulled out a puppy by the neck. “That’s not a police dog,” Tom said. “No, it’s more like an Airedale,” the man said, disappointed. “Look at the coat. With this, he’ll never catch a cold.” “I think he’s cute,” Mrs. Wilson said. “How much?” “That dog?” he said, admiringly. “Ten dollars.” The puppy—clearly part Airedale, though with very white feet—was handed to Mrs. Wilson. She cuddled him, stroking his rough coat with delight. “Is it a boy or a girl?” she asked. “A boy,” the man replied. “It’s a girl,” Tom corrected him. “Here’s your money. Now go buy ten more dogs.”"

I wouldn’t have been surprised to see a great flock of white sheep turn the corner.\n“Hold on,” I said, “I have to leave you here.”\n“No you don’t,” interposed Tom quickly. “Myrtle’ll be hurt if you don’t come up to the apartment. Won’t you, Myrtle?”\n“Come on,” she urged. “I’ll telephone my sister Catherine. She’s said to be very beautiful by people who ought to know.”\n“Well, I’d like to, but—”\nWe went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds. At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses. Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the neighbourhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases, and went haughtily in.\n“I’m going to have the McKees come up,” she announced as we rose in the elevator. “And, of course, I got to call up my sister, too.”\nThe apartment was on the top floor—a small living-room, a small dining-room, a small bedroom, and a bath. The living-room was crowded to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it, so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was an over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock. Looked at from a distance, however, the hen resolved itself into a bonnet, and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room. Several old copies of Town Tattle lay on the table together with a copy of Simon Called Peter, and some of the small scandal magazines of Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with the dog. A reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk, to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large, hard dog biscuits—one of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whisky from a locked bureau door.",

I wouldn't have been surprised to see a large group of white sheep appearing around the corner. I said, \"Wait, I need to get off here.\" Tom quickly jumped in, saying, \"No, you don't. Myrtle will be offended if you don't come up to the apartment. Right, Myrtle?\" She urged me, \"Come on. I'll call my sister Catherine. People whose opinions matter consider her very beautiful.\" I replied, \"Well, I'd like to, but—\" We drove on, turning back across the Park towards the West Hundreds. At 158th Street, the taxi stopped at one section of a long, white apartment building that looked like a cake. Giving the neighborhood a majestic glance as if returning home, Mrs. Wilson gathered her dog and her other purchases and went inside with a proud bearing. \"I'm going to have the McKees come up,\" she declared as we ascended in the elevator. \"And, naturally, I also need to call my sister.\" The apartment was on the highest floor—it had a small living room, a small dining room, a small bedroom, and a bathroom. The living room was so crammed with an overly large set of tapestried furniture that it was difficult to move; walking around meant constantly stumbling over depictions of ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The sole picture was an excessively enlarged photograph that seemed at first to be a hen on a blurry rock. However, when viewed from a distance, the hen became a bonnet, and the face of a plump old lady smiled down into the room. On the table lay several old copies of Town Tattle, along with a copy of Simon Called Peter and some of the small scandal magazines from Broadway. Mrs. Wilson's first concern was the dog. A reluctant elevator boy was sent to get a box of straw and some milk, to which he spontaneously added a tin of large, hard dog biscuits—one of which slowly dissolved in the saucer of milk throughout the afternoon. Meanwhile, Tom retrieved a bottle of whisky from a locked closet door.",

I half-expected to see a flock of sheep come around the corner. I told the others that I needed to get out there, but Tom quickly insisted I stay, saying Myrtle would be upset if I didn't come up to the apartment. Myrtle herself encouraged me, adding that she would call her sister Catherine, who was said to be very beautiful. Even though I hesitated, we continued, heading back through the Park toward the West Hundreds. At 158th Street, the cab stopped in front of one of many white apartment buildings. Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and packages with an air of importance and strutted inside. As we took the elevator up, she announced she was inviting the McKees and would call her sister, too. The apartment was on the top floor, consisting of small rooms—the living-room, dining-room, bedroom, and a bath. The living-room was cramped, filled to overflowing with oversized tapestry furniture, making it hard to move without bumping into elaborate scenes of ladies in Versailles gardens. The only artwork was a large, blurred photograph that, from afar, turned out to be an old woman in a bonnet, smiling down from the wall. Copies of Town Tattle, Simon Called Peter, and several Broadway gossip magazines were on the table. Mrs. Wilson focused on settling her dog, getting the elevator boy to bring a box of straw and some milk, to which he added a tin of big, hard biscuits—one of which soaked apathetically in the milk all afternoon. Meanwhile, Tom unlocked a bureau and took out a bottle of whiskey."

          "text_segment": "I have been drunk just twice in my life, and the second time was that afternoon; so everything that happened has a dim, hazy cast over it, although until after eight o’clock the apartment was full of cheerful sun. Sitting on Tom’s lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the telephone; then there were no cigarettes, and I went out to buy some at the drugstore on the corner. When I came back they had both disappeared, so I sat down discreetly in the living-room and read a chapter of Simon Called Peter—either it was terrible stuff or the whisky distorted things, because it didn’t make any sense to me.\nJust as Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called each other by our first names) reappeared, company commenced to arrive at the apartment door.\nThe sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty, with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky white. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle, but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved about there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary haste, and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I wondered if she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed immoderately, repeated my question aloud, and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel.\nMr. McKee was a pale, feminine man from the flat below. He had just shaved, for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone, and he was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room. He informed me that he was in the “artistic game,” and I gathered later that he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs. Wilson’s mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall. His wife was shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible. She told me with pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven times since they had been married.\nMrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before, and was now attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream-coloured chiffon, which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room. With the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a change. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage was converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her assertions became more violently affected moment by moment, and as she expanded the room grew smaller around her, until she seemed to be revolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I've only ever been significantly intoxicated on two occasions, and this afternoon was the second; consequently, my memory of the events is indistinct and fuzzy, even though the apartment was filled with bright sunshine until after eight o'clock. Sitting on Tom's knee, Mrs. Wilson made several phone calls. When we ran out of cigarettes, I left to buy some from the pharmacy on the corner. Upon my return, I found they had both gone, so I sat down quietly in the living room and attempted to read a chapter of *Simon Called Peter*. Either the book was truly awful or my judgment was impaired by the alcohol, because it made no sense to me whatsoever. Just as Tom and Myrtle (Mrs. Wilson and I started using first names after that first drink) reappeared, guests started showing up at the apartment door. Her sister, Catherine, arrived. She was a slim, sophisticated-looking woman around thirty, with a thick, slick bob of red hair and skin heavily powdered a milky white. Her eyebrows had been plucked and redrawn at a sharper angle, but nature's attempts to regrow the hairs in their original place made her face look somewhat smudged. As she moved, the countless pottery bracelets on her arms made a constant clicking noise as they slid up and down. She entered with such an air of ownership and looked around the furniture so possessively that I wondered if she lived there. However, when I asked her, she laughed loudly, repeated my question out loud, and explained that she shared a room with a female friend at a hotel. Mr. McKee, a pale, rather effeminate man from the apartment downstairs, was also there. He had just shaved, as evidenced by a small patch of white lather on his cheekbone, and he was very polite when greeting everyone. He mentioned he was in the 'art world,' and I later understood that he was a photographer. He was responsible for the faint enlargement of Mrs. Wilson's mother on the wall, which seemed to float like a ghost. His wife was loud, listless, attractive, yet unpleasant. She proudly told me her husband had photographed her 127 times since they got married. Some time earlier, Mrs. Wilson had changed her outfit and was now wearing an elaborate cream-colored chiffon afternoon dress that constantly rustled as she moved through the room. The dress seemed to influence her personality; the intense energy she had displayed at the garage was replaced by an air of impressive arrogance. Her laughter, gestures, and statements became more dramatically affected with each moment, and as she grew more imposing, the room felt smaller around her, giving the impression that she was spinning clumsily on a noisy, creaking axis through the smoky atmosphere.",

          "text_segment": "“My dear,” she told her sister in a high, mincing shout, “most of these fellas will cheat you every time. All they think of is money. I had a woman up here last week to look at my feet, and when she gave me the bill you’d of thought she had my appendicitis out.”\n“What was the name of the woman?” asked Mrs. McKee.\n“Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at people’s feet in their own homes.”\n“I like your dress,” remarked Mrs. McKee, “I think it’s adorable.”\nMrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain.\n“It’s just a crazy old thing,” she said. “I just slip it on sometimes when I don’t care what I look like.”\n“But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,” pursued Mrs. McKee. “If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could make something of it.”\nWe all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side, and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face.\n“I should change the light,” he said after a moment. “I’d like to bring out the modelling of the features. And I’d try to get hold of all the back hair.”\n“I wouldn’t think of changing the light,” cried Mrs. McKee. “I think it’s—”\nHer husband said “Sh!” and we all looked at the subject again, whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.\n“You McKees have something to drink,” he said. “Get some more ice and mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.”\n“I told that boy about the ice.” Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness of the lower orders. “These people! You have to keep after them all the time.”\nShe looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.\n“I’ve done some nice things out on Long Island,” asserted Mr. McKee.\nTom looked at him blankly.\n“Two of them we have framed downstairs.”\n“Two what?” demanded Tom.\n“Two studies. One of them I call Montauk Point—The Gulls, and the other I call Montauk Point—The Sea.”\nThe sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch.\n“Do you live down on Long Island, too?” she inquired.\n“I live at West Egg.”\n“Really? I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man named Gatsby’s. Do you know him?”\n“I live next door to him.”\n“Well, they say he’s a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm’s. That’s where all his money comes from.”\n“Really?”\nShe nodded.\n“I’m scared of him. I’d hate to have him get anything on me.”\nThis absorbing information about my neighbour was interrupted by Mrs. McKee’s pointing suddenly at Catherine:\n“Chester, I think you could do something with her,” she broke out, but Mr. McKee only nodded in a bored way, and turned his attention to Tom.\n“I’d like to do more work on Long Island, if I could get the entry. All I ask is that they should give me a start.”\n“Ask Myrtle,” said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as Mrs. Wilson entered with a tray. “She’ll give you a letter of introduction, won’t you, Myrtle?”\n“Do what?” she asked, startled.\n“You’ll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can do some studies of him.” His lips moved silently for a moment as he invented, “ ‘George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,’ or something like that.”\nCatherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear:\n“Neither of them can stand the person they’re married to.”\n“Can’t they?”\n“Can’t stand them.” She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom. “What I say is, why go on living with them if they can’t stand them? If I was them I’d get a divorce and get married to each other right away.”\n“Doesn’t she like Wilson either?”\nThe answer to this was unexpected. It came from Myrtle, who had overheard the question, and it was violent and obscene.\n“You see,” cried Catherine triumphantly. She lowered her voice again. “It’s really his wife that’s keeping them apart. She’s a Catholic, and they don’t believe in divorce.”\nDaisy was not a Catholic, and I was a little shocked at the elaborateness of the lie.\n“When they do get married,” continued Catherine, “they’re going West to live for a while until it blows over.”\n“It’d be more discreet to go to Europe.”\n“Oh, do you like Europe?” she exclaimed surprisingly. “I just got back from Monte Carlo.”\n“Really.”\n“Just last year. I went over there with another girl.”\n“Stay long?”\n“No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back. We went by way of Marseilles. We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started, but we got gyped out of it all in two days in the private rooms. We had an awful time getting back, I can tell you. God, how I hated that town!”\nThe late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue honey of the Mediterranean—then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called me back into the room.\n“I almost made a mistake, too,” she declared vigorously. “I almost married a little kike who’d been after me for years. I knew he was below me. Everybody kept saying to me: ‘Lucille, that man’s way below you!’ But if I hadn’t met Chester, he’d of got me sure.”\n“Yes, but listen,” said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down, “at least you didn’t marry him.”\n“I know I didn’t.”\n“Well, I married him,” said Myrtle, ambiguously. “And that’s the difference between your case and mine.”\n“Why did you, Myrtle?” demanded Catherine. “Nobody forced you to.”\nMyrtle considered.\n“I married him because I thought he was a gentleman,” she said finally. “I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn’t fit to lick my shoe.”\n“You were crazy about him for a while,” said Catherine.\n“Crazy about him!” cried Myrtle incredulously. “Who said I was crazy about him? I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that man there.”\nShe pointed suddenly at me, and everyone looked at me accusingly. I tried to show by my expression that I expected no affection.\n“The only crazy I was was when I married him. I knew right away I made a mistake. He borrowed somebody’s best suit to get married in, and never even told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he was out: ‘Oh, is that your suit?’ I said. ‘This is the first I ever heard about it.’ But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to beat the band all afternoon.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Addressing her sister in a loud, affected voice, she declared, “Honestly, dear, most of these guys are out to swindle you. All they care about is making money. Just last week, I had a woman come to examine my feet, and when she presented the bill, you’d have thought she’d removed my appendix.”\n“What was the name of that woman?” inquired Mrs. McKee.\n“Mrs. Eberhardt. She travels to people’s homes to look at their feet.”\n“I really like your dress,” Mrs. McKee commented. “It’s absolutely lovely, I think.”\nMrs. Wilson dismissed the praise with a scornful raised eyebrow.\n“It’s just some old, silly thing,” she replied. “I just throw it on when I’m not bothered about how I look.”\n“But it looks fantastic on you, really, if you understand what I mean,” Mrs. McKee persisted. “If Chester could only capture you in that exact pose, I believe he could create a masterpiece.”\nWe all silently observed Mrs. Wilson, who swept a lock of hair from her face and met our gaze with a radiant smile. Mr. McKee studied her intently, tilting his head, and then slowly moved his hand back and forth before his eyes.\n“I should adjust the lighting,” he stated after a pause. “I’d want to emphasize the contours of her face. And I’d try to gather all that hair at the back.”\n“I wouldn’t dream of changing the light!” exclaimed Mrs. McKee. “I think it’s—”\nHer husband hushed her with a “Sh!” and we all directed our attention back to the subject. At this point, Tom Buchanan let out a loud yawn and stood up.\n“You McKees should get something to drink,” he said. “Myrtle, fetch some more ice and mineral water before everyone dozes off.”\n“I already told that boy about the ice.” Myrtle rolled her eyes, exasperated by what she saw as the idleness of the working class. “These people! You have to constantly remind them.”\nShe glanced at me and chuckled without apparent reason. Then, she dramatically strode over to the dog, kissed it passionately, and swept into the kitchen, as if expecting a team of chefs awaiting her instructions.\n“I’ve done some good work out on Long Island,” Mr. McKee declared confidently.\nTom looked at him with a blank expression.\n“We have two of them framed downstairs.”\n“Two what?” Tom demanded.\n“Two studies. One I titled Montauk Point—The Gulls, and the other is Montauk Point—The Sea.”\nCatherine, the sister, sat down beside me on the sofa.\n“Do you also live down on Long Island?” she asked.\n“I live in West Egg.”\n“Really? I was at a party there about a month ago. At a place belonging to a man named Gatsby. Do you know him?”\n“I live right next door to him.”\n“Well, they say he’s supposedly a relative, a nephew or cousin, of Kaiser Wilhelm. That’s supposedly where he gets all his wealth.”\n“Is that so?”\nShe nodded.\n“He frightens me a bit. I’d hate for him to have anything on me.”\nJust as I was absorbing this intriguing detail about my neighbor, Mrs. McKee suddenly pointed at Catherine:\n“Chester, I think you could make something of her,” she blurted out. But Mr. McKee simply gave a weary nod and turned his attention towards Tom.\n“I’d like to take on more projects on Long Island, if I could just get a foot in the door. All I need is a starting point.”\n“Ask Myrtle,” Tom suggested, bursting into a brief laugh as Mrs. Wilson re-entered carrying a tray. “She’ll write you a letter of introduction, won’t you, Myrtle?”\n“Do what now?” she asked, looking confused.\n“You’ll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can photograph him for some studies.” His lips moved silently for a moment as he invented a title, “‘George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,’ or something similar.”\nCatherine leaned closer to me and whispered in my ear:\n“Neither of them can stand the person they’re married to.”\n“They can’t?”\n“Absolutely can’t stand them.” She glanced at Myrtle and then at Tom. “My opinion is, why stay together if they can’t stand each other? If I were in their situation, I’d get a divorce and marry each other right away.”\n“Does she dislike Wilson too?”\nThe response was unexpected and came from Myrtle, who had overheard the question. It was a fierce and vulgar outburst.\n“See?” Catherine exclaimed triumphantly. She lowered her voice again. “It’s actually his wife preventing them from being together. She’s Catholic, and Catholics don’t believe in divorce.”\nDaisy was not Catholic, and I was somewhat taken aback by the elaborate nature of the fabrication.\n“When they do get married,” Catherine continued, “they plan to move West for a while until the fuss dies down.”\n“Going to Europe would be more discreet.”\n“Oh, are you fond of Europe?” she asked, sounding surprised. “I just got back from Monte Carlo.”\n“Really?”\n“Yes, just last year. I went there with another girl.”\n“Did you stay long?”\n“No, we only went to Monte Carlo and back. We traveled via Marseilles. We started with over twelve hundred dollars, but we were completely cheated out of it in two days in the private gambling rooms. Getting back was incredibly difficult, I can tell you. God, I detested that city!”\nThe late afternoon sky briefly filled the window like the deep blue hue of the Mediterranean—then Mrs. McKee’s piercing voice summoned me back to the present.\n“I almost made a terrible mistake myself,” she stated emphatically. “I nearly married a little kike who had been pursuing me for years. I knew he was beneath me. Everyone kept telling me: ‘Lucille, that man is far below your station!’ But if I hadn’t met Chester, he surely would have trapped me.”\n“Yes, but listen,” said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head repeatedly, “at least you didn’t go through with it.”\n“I know I didn’t.”\n“Well, I did marry him,” Myrtle said, ambiguously. “And that’s the key difference between your situation and mine.”\n“But why, Myrtle?” Catherine pressed. “Nobody forced you into it.”\nMyrtle paused to think.\n“I married him because I believed he was a gentleman,” she finally explained. “I thought he understood refinement, but he wasn’t even fit to shine my shoes.”\n“You were absolutely smitten with him for a time,” Catherine remarked.\n“Smitten with him!” Myrtle cried out in disbelief. “Who said I was smitten with him? I was never any more smitten with him than I was with that man right there.”\nShe suddenly pointed at me, and everyone turned to look, seeming to accuse me. I tried to convey through my expression that I wasn’t expecting any affection.\n“The only time I was ‘crazy’ was when I married him. I knew immediately it was a mistake. He borrowed someone else’s best suit to get married in, and he never even told me about it. The owner came by for it one day when he was out: ‘Oh, that’s your suit?’ I said. ‘This is the very first I’ve heard of it.’ But I gave it back to him and then I lay down and wept uncontrollably for the rest of the afternoon.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "“My dear,” she told her sister in a loud, affected voice, “most of these men will trick you every chance they get. They only care about money. Last week a woman came here to examine my feet, and when I saw what she charged, you’d think she’d done surgery!”\n\n“What was her name?” Mrs. McKee asked.\n\n“Mrs. Eberhardt. She visits people at home to look at their feet.”\n\n“I really like your dress,” Mrs. McKee commented, “it’s lovely.”\n\nMrs. Wilson dismissed the flattery with a look of contempt. “Oh, this old thing? I just throw it on when I don’t care about my appearance.”\n\n“But it really suits you, if you know what I mean,” Mrs. McKee continued. “If Chester could get you to pose like that, he could make something beautiful from it.”\n\nWe all stared at Mrs. Wilson as she brushed hair from her eyes and smiled brightly at us. Mr. McKee gazed at her, tilting his head and moving his hand thoughtfully before his face.\n\n“I’d need different lighting,” he mused at last. “I want to bring out the features—and I’d want all her hair back.”\n\n“I wouldn’t change the lighting!” Mrs. McKee exclaimed. “I think it—”\n\nHer husband hushed her, and we looked again at Mrs. Wilson. At that, Tom Buchanan loudly yawned and stood.\n\n“You McKees should have another drink,” he said. “Myrtle, fetch more ice and mineral water before we all fall asleep.”\n\n“I already told the boy about the ice.” Myrtle rolled her eyes, frustrated by the laziness of the staff. “These people! You constantly have to chase after them.”\n\nShe gave me a senseless laugh, then pranced over to the dog, smothered it in kisses, and swept into the kitchen as if commanding an army of chefs.\n\n“I’ve done some good work out on Long Island,” Mr. McKee stated.\n\nTom looked at him blankly.\n\n“We have two of them framed downstairs.”\n\n“Two what?” Tom demanded.\n\n“Two pictures. One I call Montauk Point—The Gulls, and the other Montauk Point—The Sea.”\n\nCatherine sat beside me on the sofa.\n\n“Do you also live on Long Island?” she asked.\n\n“I live at West Egg.”\n\n“Really? I went to a party there last month at a man named Gatsby’s. Do you know him?”\n\n“I’m his neighbor.”\n\n“Well, they say he’s some relation to Kaiser Wilhelm. That’s where his fortune comes from.”\n\n“Is that so?”\n\nShe nodded. “He scares me. I wouldn’t want him to have any secrets on me.”\n\nOur conversation was interrupted as Mrs. McKee pointed at Catherine:\n\n“Chester, I think you could do a picture of her,” she said, but Mr. McKee just nodded indifferently and focused on Tom.\n\n“I’d love to get more work in Long Island if someone would give me a chance. All I need is a way in.”\n\n“Ask Myrtle,” Tom laughed as Mrs. Wilson returned with a tray. “She’ll write you an introduction, won’t you, Myrtle?”\n\n“Write who a what?” she replied, confused.\n\n“You’ll give McKee a letter to your husband so he can paint him. Maybe ‘George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump’ or something.”\n\nCatherine leaned in and whispered to me:\n\n“Neither of them can stand their spouse.”\n\n“They can’t?”\n\nShe nodded again. “They absolutely can’t. I don’t get why they stay together. If I were them, I’d divorce and marry each other.”\n\n“Does Myrtle dislike Wilson too?”\n\nUnexpectedly, Myrtle, having overheard, responded with a furious outburst.\n\n“You see,” Catherine said victoriously, lowering her voice, “it’s really his wife keeping them apart. She’s Catholic, and Catholics don’t believe in divorce.”\n\nDaisy wasn’t Catholic, so I was surprised at how well this lie was constructed.\n\n“When they get married,” Catherine continued, “they’re going to live out West for a while, until the scandal dies down.”\n\n“It might be safer to go to Europe.”\n\n“Oh, do you like Europe?” she asked energetically. “I just returned from Monte Carlo.”\n\n“Really?”\n\n“Last year. I went with another girl.”\n\n“Did you stay long?”\n\n“No, we just visited Monte Carlo and came back through Marseilles. We started with over twelve hundred dollars but lost it all in private gambling rooms in two days. Getting home was a nightmare. I really hated that place!”\n\nThe late afternoon sky glowed for a moment like Mediterranean blue before Mrs. McKee’s sharp voice pulled me back.\n\n“I almost made a big mistake,” she said forcefully. “I nearly married a pushy little man who chased me for years. I always knew he was beneath me. People warned me, ‘Lucille, he’s not your equal!’ If I hadn’t met Chester, I might have ended up with him.”\n\n“Yes, but look,” Myrtle said, nodding, “at least you didn’t marry him.”\n\n“I know.”\n\n“Well, I did,” Myrtle said cryptically. “That’s the difference between us.”\n\n“Why did you, Myrtle?” Catherine asked. “No one made you do it.”\n\nMyrtle pondered. “I married him because I thought he was a gentleman. I thought he came from a good family. But he’s not even worthy to clean my shoes.”\n\n“You were wild about him at first,” Catherine said.\n\n“Wild about him!” Myrtle exclaimed, amazed. “Who said that? I was never more interested in him than in that guy there.”\n\nShe pointed at me, and everyone stared my way. I tried to look as neutral as possible.\n\n“The only crazy thing I did was marry him. I realized my mistake right away. He even borrowed someone else’s best suit for the wedding and didn’t tell me. One day, the owner came by for it. ‘Is that your suit?’ I asked. I’d never heard about it until then. I gave it back and then cried all afternoon.”"

I wanted to get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight, but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild, strident argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I saw him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.\nMyrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.\n“It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the last ones left on the train. I was going up to New York to see my sister and spend the night. He had on a dress suit and patent leather shoes, and I couldn’t keep my eyes off him, but every time he looked at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head. When we came into the station he was next to me, and his white shirtfront pressed against my arm, and so I told him I’d have to call a policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into a taxi with him I didn’t hardly know I wasn’t getting into a subway train. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was ‘You can’t live forever; you can’t live forever.’ ”\nShe turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial laughter.\n“My dear,” she cried, “I’m going to give you this dress as soon as I’m through with it. I’ve got to get another one tomorrow. I’m going to make a list of all the things I’ve got to get.

She mentioned that they had been residing above that garage for eleven years, and Tom was the first romantic partner Myrtle had ever known. A second bottle of whiskey was now being constantly sought after by everyone present, apart from Catherine, who claimed she felt perfectly fine without drinking anything. Tom summoned the janitor and sent him out for some renowned sandwiches, which were substantial enough to serve as a full dinner. I wanted to escape and walk east toward the park in the gentle evening light, but each time I attempted to leave, I became caught up in a loud, aggressive argument that pulled me back into my chair as if with ropes. Yet, high above the city, our illuminated yellow windows must have added their part of human secrecy to the casual observer in the darkening streets below, and I felt I saw him too, looking up and wondering. I was both involved in and separate from the scene, simultaneously drawn in and pushed away by the endless diversity of life. Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine and suddenly, with her warm breath, recounted the story of how she first met Tom. 'It happened on the two small, face-to-face seats, the kind that are always the last available on the train,' she began. 'I was traveling to New York to visit my sister and stay for the night. He was wearing a formal suit and shiny patent leather shoes, and I couldn’t take my eyes off him, but whenever he looked in my direction, I had to pretend I was looking at the advertisement overhead. When we reached the station, he was right next to me, and his crisp white shirtfront was pressing against my arm. I told him I would have to call a policeman, but he knew I was lying. I was so thrilled that when I got into a taxi with him, I barely noticed I wasn’t getting onto a subway train.

Meanwhile, everyone except Catherine drank from the second bottle of whiskey, as she claimed she felt fine without any. Tom summoned the janitor to bring famous sandwiches that were filling enough for a whole meal. I wanted to slip out and wander east toward the park in the evening light, but every attempt was thwarted by heated arguments that seemed to draw me back as though I were physically restrained. Our row of lit windows, high above the city, must have contributed its own mystery to someone passing below. I too noticed an onlooker gazing up and imagining our lives. I felt both included in and detached from the unfolding scene, fascinated and unsettled by its intensity and unpredictability.\n\nMyrtle moved her chair closer and shared how she first met Tom. It had been on a train, in the last two empty seats facing each other, as she was headed to New York to visit her sister. Tom wore formal clothes and shiny shoes, and she couldn’t help but stare at him, though she pretended to read an advertisement whenever he looked her way. When they arrived at the station, his pristine shirtfront touched her arm, and she jokingly threatened to call the police, but he saw through her bluff. Overwhelmed with excitement, she barely registered getting into a taxi with him, thinking repeatedly that life is short and should be lived fully.\n\nShe turned to Mrs. McKee, declaring theatrically that she would pass on her dress when done with it, as she was shopping for a new one the following day. Myrtle began listing everything she needed to buy, from personal pampering to a grave wreath for her mother, determined to write it all down so she wouldn’t forget.\n\nTime passed quickly. At nine o’clock, I glanced at my watch again, and it was already ten. Mr. McKee dozed, fists curled in his lap, looking like a posed portrait. I wiped a dry shaving mark from his face that had bothered me earlier. The little dog sat on the table, staring blankly through cigarette smoke and occasionally whimpering. Guests came and went, planned outings, lost and found each other in the small apartment. Near midnight, Tom and Myrtle argued passionately, debating whether she was entitled to bring up Daisy’s name."

In his vividly colored gardens, men and women gathered and dispersed like moths drawn to light, amid quiet conversations, champagne, and the starry sky. In the afternoon at high tide, I observed his visitors leaping from the tower of his floating dock, or basking in the sun on his hot sandy beach while his two speedboats sliced through the waters of the Sound, creating foamy trails as they pulled aquaplanes.

Every Friday, five crates of oranges and lemons were delivered from a New York fruit seller—by Monday, these same fruits were discarded from his back door in a heap of juiceless halves. A machine in the kitchen could extract juice from two hundred oranges in half an hour if a butler pressed a small button two hundred times. At least every two weeks, a team of caterers arrived with hundreds of feet of canvas and sufficient colorful lights to transform Gatsby’s vast garden into something resembling a massive Christmas tree. Buffet tables, adorned with glittering appetizers, were laden with spiced baked hams placed alongside salads in intricate patterns, pastry pigs, and turkeys expertly cooked to a deep gold. In the main hall, a bar with a legitimate brass rail was erected, stocked with various types of gin, other alcoholic beverages, and liqueurs so out of date that the majority of his young female guests were unfamiliar with them.",

In his blue-hued gardens, men and women moved about like moths drawn to the soft talk, champagne, and shining stars. Most afternoons, I’d watch his guests jump from the tower into the water, lounge in the sunshine on his hot beach, while his two motorboats sliced through the Sound, pulling aquaplaners across sprays of foam. On weekends, his Rolls-Royce acted like a bus, shuttling partygoers between the city and his home from morning until well after midnight, and his station wagon hurried to the train station like a fast little yellow bug. Mondays saw eight servants, with an extra gardener, laboring all day to clean and repair everything, erasing the signs of the previous night’s festivities.\n\nEach Friday, five crates of oranges and lemons were delivered from a New York fruit vendor, and by Monday, those fruits had been juiced and left in stacks of empty peels by the back door. The kitchen had a machine that could squeeze the juice from two hundred oranges in thirty minutes if the butler pressed a button repeatedly.\n\nEvery couple of weeks, a team of caterers would arrive with rolls of canvas and so many colored lights that Gatsby's huge garden would look like a Christmas tree. The buffet tables overflowed with sparkling hors d’oeuvres, baked hams packed closely beside vibrantly decorated salads, pastry pigs, and turkeys roasted to a rich, dark gold. Inside, a bar with a brass rail was set up and filled with plenty of spirits and liqueurs—many so obscure the youngest partygoers didn’t even recognize them."

My voice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden.\n“I thought you might be here,” she responded absently as I came up. “I remembered you lived next door to—”\nShe held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she’d take care of me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses, who stopped at the foot of the steps.\n“Hello!” they cried together. “Sorry you didn’t win.”\nThat was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week before.\n“You don’t know who we are,” said one of the girls in yellow, “but we met you here about a month ago.”\n“You’ve dyed your hair since then,” remarked Jordan, and I started, but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer’s basket. With Jordan’s slender golden arm resting in mine, we descended the steps and sauntered about the garden. A tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight, and we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble.\n“Do you come to these parties often?” inquired Jordan of the girl beside her.\n“The last one was the one I met you at,” answered the girl, in an alert confident voice. She turned to her companion: “Wasn’t it for you, Lucille?”\nIt was for Lucille, too.\n“I like to come,” Lucille said. “I never care what I do, so I always have a good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked me my name and address—inside of a week I got a package from Croirier’s with a new evening gown in it.”\n“Did you keep it?” asked Jordan.\n“Sure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the bust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two hundred and sixty-five dollars.”\n“There’s something funny about a fellow that’ll do a thing like that,” said the other girl eagerly. “He doesn’t want any trouble with anybody.”\n“Who doesn’t?” I inquired.\n“Gatsby.

I’ll bet he killed a man.”\nShe narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned and looked around for Gatsby.

Regardless of whether I was welcome, I felt I needed to find someone to talk to before I started talking overly friendly to strangers. \"Hello!\" I called out loudly, moving towards her. My voice seemed unusually loud across the garden space. \"I suspected you might be here,\" she replied distractedly as I reached her. \"I remembered you lived right next to—\" She gave my hand a brief, detached squeeze, signaling she'd be available in a moment, and then turned her attention to two girls wearing matching yellow dresses who had stopped at the bottom of the steps. \"Hello!\" they said in unison. \"Sorry you didn't win.\" This was a reference to the golf tournament she had lost in the finals the previous week. \"You don't recognize us,\" one of the girls in yellow stated, \"but we met you here about a month ago.\" \"You've colored your hair since then,\" Jordan commented, which surprised me, but the girls had already casually moved on, and her remark seemed aimed at the unnaturally early moon, likely as artificial as the party's food, probably from a caterer's delivery. With Jordan's slim, sun-tanned arm linked in mine, we went down the steps and wandered around the garden. A server carrying a tray of cocktails appeared before us in the dim light, and we found seats at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men, whose names were introduced so quickly they sounded like \"Mr. Mumble.\" Jordan asked the girl next to her, \"Do you attend these parties often?\" \"The last time I was here was the occasion I met you,\" the girl answered confidently and clearly. She turned to her friend: \"Didn't that happen with you too, Lucille?\" It was the same for Lucille. \"I enjoy coming,\" Lucille said. \"I'm always open to anything, so I always have a good time. The last time I was here, I tore my dress on a chair, and he asked for my name and address—within a week, I received a package from Croirier’s containing a new evening gown.\" \"Did you keep it?\" Jordan inquired. \"Absolutely,\" she replied. \"I was planning to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the chest area and required alterations. It was a pale blue color with purple beads. Two hundred and sixty-five dollars.\" \"There's something peculiar about someone who would do that,\" the other girl added eagerly. \"He doesn't want any trouble with anyone.\" \"Who doesn't?\" I asked. \"Gatsby. Someone told me—\" The two girls and Jordan leaned closer together conspiratorially. \"Someone told me they believe he once killed a man.\" A wave of excitement swept over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles leaned forward, listening intently. \"I don't think it's really that,\" Lucille argued doubtfully; \"It's more probable he was a German spy during the war.\" One of the men confirmed this with a nod. \"I heard that from someone who knew him very well, who grew up with him in Germany,\" he assured us definitively. \"Oh, no,\" the first girl insisted, \"that couldn't be true, because he served in the American army during the war.\" As we shifted our attention and belief back to her, she leaned forward enthusiastically. \"Sometimes, observe him when he thinks nobody is looking. I bet he's killed a man.\" She narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned, scanning the crowd for Gatsby. The extent of the imaginative speculation he inspired was evident in the fact that even people who usually found little worth whispering about in the world were spreading these rumors about him.",

Whether she welcomed my company or not, I felt compelled to join someone before I started speaking too openly to strangers. I greeted her loudly as I approached, my voice echoing across the garden. She responded distantly, recalling that I lived next to someone she meant to mention, and shook my hand in a detached manner, suggesting she'd return her attention to me shortly. Meanwhile, two women in identical yellow dresses stopped at the bottom of the steps to say hello and express regret that she lost at her recent golf tournament. They reminded Jordan that they'd met her about a month before, though one had since changed her hair color, a detail Jordan pointed out, but the women soon drifted away. With Jordan holding my arm, we walked into the garden and joined a table where the two women in yellow and three men, all introduced as Mr. Mumble, were sitting. Jordan asked one of the women if she came to these parties often, to which she replied that she was last here when they first met, a memory shared by her friend Lucille. Lucille remarked that she enjoyed coming and that the last time, after tearing her dress at the party, she received a new one from Gatsby a week later. Jordan asked if she kept it; Lucille replied yes, describing the elaborate and costly gown. One of the women commented that it was odd for someone to be so generous, to which I asked who she meant. She replied it was Gatsby, and the women leaned in confidentially to exchange rumors: one claimed Gatsby had killed a man, another suggested he was a German spy, and a man at the table backed this up, claiming first-hand knowledge, while someone else insisted Gatsby had served in the American army. As the conversation circled around these mysterious stories, the women and Jordan speculated in whispers about Gatsby, reflecting the air of intrigue he always seemed to generate among the guests."

          "text_segment": "The first supper—there would be another one after midnight—was now being served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party, who were spread around a table on the other side of the garden. There were three married couples and Jordan’s escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo, and obviously under the impression that sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling, this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the countryside—East Egg condescending to West Egg and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gaiety.\n“Let’s get out,” whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate half-hour; “this is much too polite for me.”\nWe got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host: I had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. The undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.\nThe bar, where we glanced first, was crowded, but Gatsby was not there. She couldn’t find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn’t on the veranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas.\nA stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.\n“What do you think?” he demanded impetuously.\n“About what?”\nHe waved his hand toward the bookshelves.\n“About that. As a matter of fact you needn’t bother to ascertain. I ascertained. They’re real.”\n“The books?”\nHe nodded.\n“Absolutely real—have pages and everything. I thought they’d be a nice durable cardboard. Matter of fact, they’re absolutely real. Pages and—Here! Lemme show you.”\nTaking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and returned with Volume One of the Stoddard Lectures.\n“See!” he cried triumphantly. “It’s a bona-fide piece of printed matter. It fooled me. This fella’s a regular Belasco. It’s a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop, too—didn’t cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?”\nHe snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf, muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse.\n“Who brought you?” he demanded. “Or did you just come? I was brought. Most people were brought.”\nJordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without answering.\n“I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,” he continued. “Mrs. Claud Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I’ve been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.”\n“Has it?”\n“A little bit, I think. I can’t tell yet. I’ve only been here an hour. Did I tell you about the books? They’re real. They’re—”\n“You told us.”\nWe shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The initial dinner, which would be followed by another after midnight, was underway. Jordan Baker asked me to join her group, seated at a table across the garden. This gathering consisted of three married pairs and Jordan's date, a persistently suggestive college student who clearly believed he would eventually have a physical relationship with Jordan. Unlike the rest of the lively crowd, this group maintained a sense of reserved uniformity, positioning themselves as representatives of the established high society from East Egg, looking down on West Egg and cautiously avoiding its flamboyant atmosphere. 'Let's leave,' Jordan whispered after about thirty minutes that felt unproductive and misplaced; 'this is much too formal for me.' We stood up, and she explained that we were going to look for the host, Gatsby. She mentioned I hadn't met him yet and that it was making me uneasy. The college student responded with a cynical, gloomy nod. We first checked the crowded bar, but Gatsby wasn't there. She couldn't spot him from the top of the stairs, nor was he on the porch. On impulse, we opened an imposing-looking door and stepped into a tall Gothic library, adorned with carved English oak panels that seemed like they might have been relocated from a historic ruin overseas. A heavy-set man in his middle years, wearing huge spectacles that looked like owl's eyes, was sitting rather drunkenly on the edge of a large table, staring intently but unsteadily at the bookshelves. When we entered, he spun around quickly and scrutinized Jordan from head to toe. 'What do you think?' he asked impulsively. 'About what?' He gestured towards the shelves of books. 'About that. Actually, you don't need to bother confirming. I already did. They are real.' 'The books?' He nodded. 'Absolutely real—complete with pages and everything. I assumed they'd be made of some durable cardboard. In fact, they are genuinely real. Pages and—Here! Let me show you.' Assuming we were skeptical, he hurried to the shelves and came back with the first volume of the Stoddard Lectures series. 'See!' he exclaimed triumphantly. 'It's actual printed material. It fooled me. This fellow is a true showman, a real Belasco. It's incredible. Such attention to detail! Such realism! He even knew where to stop—he didn't cut the pages. But what else would you expect? What do you want?' He quickly took the book back from me and put it back on the shelf, murmuring that removing even one brick would cause the entire library to collapse. 'Who brought you here?' he demanded. 'Or did you just arrive? I was brought. Most people were brought.' Jordan looked at him attentively and cheerfully but said nothing. 'I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,' he continued. 'Mrs. Claud Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I've been drinking for about a week straight, and I thought sitting in a library might help me sober up.' 'Has it?' 'A little, I think. It's hard to tell yet. I've only been here for an hour. Did I tell you about the books? They're real. They're—' 'You already told us.' We formally shook his hand and returned outside.",

The group consisted of three married couples and Jordan’s date, a persistent college student who made bold insinuations and clearly believed that, eventually, Jordan would give in to his advances. Rather than mingling, this group kept a reserved unity, projecting an image of the dignified upper class—people from East Egg looking down on West Egg and staying vigilant against its gaudy festivities.\n\nAfter sitting through an awkward and uninteresting half hour, Jordan whispered, \"Let’s leave; this is too proper for me.\" We stood up, and she clarified that we were going to look for the host, whom I had yet to meet and whose absence was making her uncomfortable. The young man simply nodded, looking cynically resigned.\n\nThe bar, our first stop, was full but Gatsby wasn’t there. Jordan also checked the view from the steps and the veranda, but still didn't find him. On a whim, we opened an imposing door and entered a grand Gothic library, lined with intricately carved English oak, likely imported whole from abroad.\n\nInside, a stout, middle-aged man with huge round glasses, looking slightly drunk, sat on the edge of a large table, intently staring at the books. As we entered, he spun around, eagerly sizing up Jordan.\n\n“What do you think?” he asked impulsively. \n\n“About what?”\n\nHe gestured toward the shelves. \n\n“About those. Actually, you don’t need to check. I already did. They're real.”\n\n“The books?”\n\nHe confirmed. “Completely real—actual pages and all. I thought they’d be fake cardboard, but no—they’re the real thing. Here, let me show you.”\n\nAssuming we doubted him, he hurried to the bookshelves, grabbed Volume One of the Stoddard Lectures, and brought it over.\n\n“See?” he proclaimed. “It’s a legit book, real print. It fooled me. This guy’s a real Belasco. Such detail, so lifelike! Even knew where to stop—he didn’t cut the pages. But what else would you want? What more do you expect?”\n\nHe snatched the book back and quickly returned it to the shelf, mumbling that if one book was removed, the whole library might come crashing down.\n\n“Who invited you?” he asked. “Or did you just show up? I was brought here. Most people were.”\n\nJordan looked at him, alert and cheerful, but said nothing.\n\n“I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,” he continued. “Mrs. Claud Roosevelt. Do you know her? Met her last night, I think. I’ve been drunk for about a week and thought the library might help me sober up.”\n\n“Did it help?”\n\n“A little, maybe. I’m not sure yet. I’ve only been here an hour. Did I mention about the books? They’re real. They’re—”\n\n“You told us.”\n\nWe shook his hand solemnly and then went back outside."

By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian, and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz, and between the numbers people were doing “stunts” all over the garden, while happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A pair of stage twins, who turned out to be the girls in yellow, did a baby act in costume, and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger-bowls. The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn.\nI was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl, who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying myself now. I had taken two finger-bowls of champagne, and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental, and profound.\nAt a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.\n“Your face is familiar,” he said politely. “Weren’t you in the First Division during the war?”\n“Why yes. I was in the Twenty-eighth Infantry.”\n“I was in the Sixteenth until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I’d seen you somewhere before.”\nWe talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France. Evidently he lived in this vicinity, for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane, and was going to try it out in the morning.\n“Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound.”\n“What time?”\n“Any time that suits you best.”\nIt was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around and smiled.\n“Having a gay time now?” she inquired.\n“Much better.” I turned again to my new acquaintance. “This is an unusual party for me. I haven’t even seen the host. I live over there—” I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, “and this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation.”\nFor a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.\n“I’m Gatsby,” he said suddenly.\n“What!” I exclaimed. “Oh, I beg your pardon.”\n“I thought you knew, old sport. I’m afraid I’m not a very good host.”\nHe smiled understandingly—much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced—or seemed to face—the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey. Precisely at that point it vanished—and I was looking at an elegant young roughneck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced himself I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Dancing was now happening on the canvas laid out in the garden; elderly men awkward with young women in continuous, clumsy circles, while sophisticated couples held each other rigidly and fashionably, staying towards the edges. Numerous single women danced alone or gave the orchestra a brief break from playing the banjo or drums. By midnight, the level of merriment had risen. A celebrated tenor sang opera in Italian, and a well-known contralto sang jazz. Between the performances, guests were performing 'stunts' across the garden, as cheerful, empty bursts of laughter floated up towards the summer sky. A pair of performers known for their stage act, who turned out to be the women in yellow, did a routine dressed as babies, and champagne was served in glasses larger than typical finger bowls. The moon had climbed higher, and on the surface of the Sound lay a glimmering triangle of light, resembling silver scales, trembling slightly with the rigid, metallic beat of the banjos from the lawn. I was still in the company of Jordan Baker. We were seated at a table with a man around my age and a rowdy young woman who would erupt in uncontrollable laughter at the slightest excuse. I was finding myself enjoying the evening now. After having two servings of champagne from the large glasses, the scene before my eyes had transformed into something significant, fundamental, and deeply meaningful. During a quiet moment in the entertainment, the man looked at me and smiled. 'Your face seems familiar,' he said politely. 'Weren't you part of the First Division during the war?' 'Yes, I was in the Twenty-eighth Infantry,' I confirmed. 'I was with the Sixteenth until June of nineteen-eighteen. I knew I'd encountered you somewhere before.' We talked for a moment about some damp, grey little villages in France. He evidently resided in the area, as he mentioned he had recently acquired a hydroplane and planned to test it the following morning. 'Would you like to come along, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound,' he invited. 'What time?' I asked. 'Whatever time suits you best,' he replied. I was just about to inquire about his name when Jordan turned and smiled. 'Are you having a good time now?' she asked. 'Much better,' I responded. I turned back to my new acquaintance. 'This is a very unusual party for me. I haven't even met the host. I live over there,' I said, gesturing towards the invisible barrier in the distance, 'and this Mr. Gatsby sent his chauffeur to deliver the invitation.' For a moment, he looked at me as if he didn't grasp what I was saying. 'I'm Gatsby,' he stated suddenly. 'What!' I exclaimed. 'Oh, please forgive me.' 'I assumed you were aware, old sport. I'm afraid I'm not a very effective host,' he said. He smiled with an understanding that surpassed mere comprehension. It was one of those exceptionally rare smiles possessing a quality of enduring reassurance, the kind you might experience only a few times in your life. For an instant, it seemed to embrace the entire world before focusing intently on you with an irresistible partiality in your favor. It understood you precisely as much as you wished to be understood, believed in you as you would want to believe in yourself, and confirmed that it perceived you exactly as, at your peak, you hoped to be perceived. At that precise moment, it vanished—and I was looking at a polished yet somewhat rough-around-the-edges young man, a year or two past thirty, whose overly formal manner of speaking was almost comical. Some time before he introduced himself, I had gotten a strong impression that he was choosing his words very carefully.",

Many young women danced alone or occasionally played instruments with the orchestra. By midnight, the party had become more uproarious. A famous tenor had sung in Italian, and a well-known contralto performed a jazz number. In between songs, people did various tricks and antics across the garden, with laughter ringing out under the summer night sky. The twin performers, revealed to be the girls in yellow, did a comedic baby-themed act, and champagne flowed in oversized glasses. The moon had climbed higher, casting a shimmery reflection on the water, trembling to the sound of banjos. I remained with Jordan Baker, seated at a table with a man about my age and a lively young woman prone to uncontrollable giggles. I was thoroughly enjoying myself, having had two large glasses of champagne, and everything now felt meaningful and intense. When the entertainment paused, the man turned to me and remarked that my face looked familiar, asking if I had served in the First Division during the war. After confirming our military backgrounds, we chatted briefly about the villages in France. He mentioned living nearby and having just bought a hydroplane, inviting me to join him for a ride the next day. Jordan shifted focus by asking if I was having a good time, which I agreed I was. I then explained that though I lived nearby, I hadn’t met our host, as Gatsby had simply sent his chauffeur with an invitation. The man paused, then revealed himself as Gatsby. Surprised, I apologized, but Gatsby reassured me with a remarkable, sincere smile—a smile rare in life, that seemed, just for a moment, to look out upon the entire world and then focus solely on you, offering the understanding and affirmation you long for. Just as suddenly, the smile disappeared, and I saw an elegant yet slightly rough-looking young man in his thirties, whose overly careful way of speaking almost seemed comical. Even before he introduced himself, I sensed he was choosing his words with great care."

I will rejoin you later.”\nWhen he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan—constrained to assure her of my surprise. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in his middle years.\n“Who is he?” I demanded. “Do you know?”\n“He’s just a man named Gatsby.”\n“Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?”\n“Now you’re started on the subject,” she answered with a wan smile. “Well, he told me once he was an Oxford man.”\nA dim background started to take shape behind him, but at her next remark it faded away.\n“However, I don’t believe it.”\n“Why not?”\n“I don’t know,” she insisted, “I just don’t think he went there.”\nSomething in her tone reminded me of the other girl’s “I think he killed a man,” and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I would have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York. That was comprehensible. But young men didn’t—at least in my provincial inexperience I believed they didn’t—drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island Sound.\n“Anyhow, he gives large parties,” said Jordan, changing the subject with an urban distaste for the concrete. “And I like large parties. They’re so intimate. At small parties there isn’t any privacy.”\nThere was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.\n“Ladies and gentlemen,” he cried. “At the request of Mr. Gatsby we are going to play for you Mr. Vladmir Tostoff’s latest work, which attracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the papers you know there was a big sensation.” He smiled with jovial condescension, and added: “Some sensation!” Whereupon everybody laughed.\n“The piece is known,” he concluded lustily, “as ‘Vladmir Tostoff’s Jazz History of the World!’ ”\nThe nature of Mr. Tostoff’s composition eluded me, because just as it began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and looking from one group to another with approving eyes. His tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister about him. I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased. When the “Jazz History of the World” was over, girls were putting their heads on men’s shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into men’s arms, even into groups, knowing that someone would arrest their falls—but no one swooned backward on Gatsby, and no French bob touched Gatsby’s shoulder, and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby’s head for one link.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Just as Mr. Gatsby revealed who he was, a servant rushed up to inform him that Chicago was on the telephone line for him. He excused himself with a slight bow that acknowledged each of us. He urged me, saying, 'If you need anything at all, just ask for it, old sport.' He added, 'Please excuse me; I’ll rejoin you later.' Once he was gone, I immediately turned to Jordan, compelled to share my astonishment. I had expected Mr. Gatsby to be a ruddy-faced and overweight man in his middle years. 'Who exactly is he?' I demanded. 'Do you know?' She simply replied, 'He’s just a man named Gatsby.' I clarified, 'I mean, where is he from? And what does he do?' With a faint smile, she responded, 'Ah, now you’re getting into it.' She continued, 'Well, he once told me he attended Oxford.' A vague picture of his background began to form, but her next comment made it disappear. 'However,' she stated, 'I don’t believe it.' I asked, 'Why not?' 'I don’t know,' she insisted, 'I just have a feeling he didn’t go there.' Something in her tone reminded me of the other woman who said, 'I think he killed a man,' which heightened my curiosity. I would have easily accepted information that Gatsby originated from rough places like the Louisiana swamps or the lower East Side of New York; that seemed understandable. But, in my limited experience, young men didn’t coolly appear out of nowhere and purchase a mansion on Long Island Sound. Jordan then shifted the topic, displaying an urban aversion to discussing specifics, saying, 'In any case, he throws huge parties.' She added, 'And I enjoy large parties. They feel so private. Small parties lack any privacy.' A bass drum thundered, and the orchestra leader’s voice suddenly cut through the echoing chatter of the garden. 'Ladies and gentlemen,' he announced loudly, 'At Mr. Gatsby’s request, we are presenting Mr. Vladmir Tostoff’s newest work, which garnered significant attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the newspapers, you know it caused quite a stir.' He smiled with patronizing good humor and added, 'Some sensation, indeed!' This prompted laughter from everyone. He concluded energetically, 'The piece is called ‘Vladmir Tostoff’s Jazz History of the World!’' The nature of Mr. Tostoff’s composition wasn’t clear to me, because just as it started, my gaze fell upon Gatsby. He was standing alone on the marble steps, observing the various groups with an approving look. His tanned skin was taut and appealing, and his short hair appeared as though it was neatly trimmed every day. I saw nothing suspicious or sinister about him. I wondered if his not drinking set him apart from his guests, as it seemed to me he became more reserved while the atmosphere grew increasingly unrestrained and friendly. After the 'Jazz History of the World' finished, young women were resting their heads on men’s shoulders in a casual, friendly way, playfully falling backward into men’s arms or even into crowds, knowing someone would catch them—but no one fell backward onto Gatsby, no woman’s bobbed hair touched Gatsby’s shoulder, and no singing groups formed with Gatsby participating.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Just as Mr. Gatsby introduced himself, a butler approached to tell him he had a call from Chicago. Gatsby politely excused himself, telling me to let him know if I needed anything and promising to return. After he left, I immediately expressed my surprise to Jordan; I’d thought Gatsby would be an extravagant, overweight, middle-aged man. I asked Jordan if she knew who he was and where he was from. She replied he was just a man named Gatsby and mentioned he once told her he went to Oxford, though she doubted it. Her skepticism made me even more curious, reminding me of the rumor that Gatsby might have killed someone. I found it reasonable to imagine Gatsby coming from somewhere like Louisiana or New York’s Lower East Side, but it didn’t seem possible, to my inexperienced mind, for someone to simply appear from nowhere and buy a huge mansion on Long Island. Jordan then shifted the topic, saying she liked Gatsby’s large parties because they were more private than small gatherings. Suddenly, music blared as the orchestra leader announced they would play Mr. Vladmir Tostoff’s newest piece that had caused a stir at Carnegie Hall, which made everyone laugh. As the music began, I noticed Gatsby standing alone on the marble steps, watching his guests with approval. His skin was attractively tan and his hair neatly cut. I saw nothing threatening about him and wondered if his refusal to drink made him seem different, increasingly proper as the party grew wilder. After the music, the guests became more playful and affectionate with each other, but no one behaved that way with Gatsby; he remained apart, uninvolved in the revelry."

          "text_segment": "“I beg your pardon.”\nGatsby’s butler was suddenly standing beside us.\n“Miss Baker?” he inquired. “I beg your pardon, but Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you alone.”\n“With me?” she exclaimed in surprise.\n“Yes, madame.”\nShe got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment, and followed the butler toward the house. I noticed that she wore her evening-dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes—there was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.\nI was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and intriguing sounds had issued from a long, many-windowed room which overhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan’s undergraduate, who was now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who implored me to join him, I went inside.\nThe large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was playing the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of champagne, and during the course of her song she had decided, ineptly, that everything was very, very sad—she was not only singing, she was weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks—not freely, however, for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky colour, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face, whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair, and went off into a deep vinous sleep.\n“She had a fight with a man who says he’s her husband,” explained a girl at my elbow.\nI looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan’s party, the quartet from East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of the men was talking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife, after attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent way, broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks—at intervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed: “You promised!” into his ear.\nThe reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant wives. The wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices.\n“Whenever he sees I’m having a good time he wants to go home.”\n“Never heard anything so selfish in my life.”\n“We’re always the first ones to leave.”\n“So are we.”\n“Well, we’re almost the last tonight,” said one of the men sheepishly. “The orchestra left half an hour ago.”\nIn spite of the wives’ agreement that such malevolence was beyond credibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives were lifted, kicking, into the night.",

I noticed how she wore her evening dress, and all her outfits, with the casualness of sports attire – there was a confident swing to her step, as if she had first learned to walk on pristine golf courses on bright, cool mornings. I was left alone, and it was nearing two o'clock. For a while, confusing and intriguing sounds had been coming from a long room with many windows, situated above the terrace. Avoiding Jordan’s university companion, who was now deep in a strange conversation about childbirth with two showgirls and begging me to join him, I went inside. The large room was filled with people. One of the women in yellow was playing the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young woman from a well-known chorus line, singing. She had clearly drunk a good amount of champagne, and during her song, she had mistakenly concluded that everything was intensely sad – she wasn't just singing, she was also crying. Whenever there was a break in the music, she filled it with gasping, broken sobs, before picking up the song again in a shaky high-pitched voice. Tears streamed down her face – though not easily, as they turned black upon hitting her heavily beaded eyelashes and continued their path as slow, dark rivulets. Someone humorously suggested she sing the music written on her face, at which point she threw up her hands, collapsed into a chair, and fell into a deep, wine-induced sleep. “She had an argument with a man claiming to be her husband,” a woman explained standing near me. I looked around. Most of the women still present were now arguing with men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan’s group, the four people from East Egg, were fractured by conflict. One of the men was talking very intently to a young actress, and his wife, after trying to pretend she found the situation amusing and didn’t care, completely lost her composure and started attacking him indirectly – every so often she would suddenly appear beside him like an enraged jewel, whispering intensely into his ear: “You made a promise!” The reluctance to leave wasn't limited to straying men. The entrance hall was currently occupied by two noticeably sober men and their highly annoyed wives. The wives were commiserating with each other in slightly raised voices. “He always wants to go home just when I’m enjoying myself.” “I’ve never heard anything so selfish.” “We’re always the first to leave.” “So are we.” “Well, tonight we’re almost the last,” one of the men admitted sheepishly. “The band left half an hour ago.” Despite the wives agreeing that such meanness was unbelievable, the disagreement ended with a brief struggle, and both wives were lifted, struggling and kicking, out into the night.",

I noticed that her evening gown, like all her clothing, had a sporty flair, and her gait suggested she was used to moving about golf courses on fresh mornings. \n\nNow by myself—nearly two o’clock—I heard a mix of confusing, intriguing noises coming from a large room with many windows overlooking the terrace.

In the ditch beside the road, right side up, but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupé which had left Gatsby’s drive not two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However, as they had left their cars blocking the road, a harsh, discordant din from those in the rear had been audible for some time, and added to the already violent confusion of the scene.\nA man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in the middle of the road, looking from the car to the tyre and from the tyre to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.\n“See!” he explained. “It went in the ditch.”\nThe fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and I recognized first the unusual quality of wonder, and then the man—it was the late patron of Gatsby’s library.\n“How’d it happen?”\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\n“I know nothing whatever about mechanics,” he said decisively.\n“But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?”\n“Don’t ask me,” said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole matter. “I know very little about driving—next to nothing. It happened, and that’s all I know.”\n“Well, if you’re a poor driver you oughtn’t to try driving at night.”\n“But I wasn’t even trying,” he explained indignantly, “I wasn’t even trying.”\nAn awed hush fell upon the bystanders.\n“Do you want to commit suicide?”\n“You’re lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even trying!”\n“You don’t understand,” explained the criminal. “I wasn’t driving. There’s another man in the car.”\nThe shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained “Ah-h-h!” as the door of the coupé swung slowly open. The crowd—it was now a crowd—stepped back involuntarily, and when the door had opened wide there was a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale, dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.\nBlinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant groaning of the horns, the apparition stood swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the duster.\n“Wha’s matter?” he inquired calmly. “Did we run outa gas?”\n“Look!”\nHalf a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel—he stared at it for a moment, and then looked upward as though he suspected that it had dropped from the sky.\n“It came off,” someone explained.\nHe nodded.\n“At first I din’ notice we’d stopped.”\nA pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders, he remarked in a determined voice:\n“Wonder’ff tell me where there’s a gas’line station?”\nAt least a dozen men, some of them a little better off than he was, explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond.\n“Back out,” he suggested after a moment. “Put her in reverse.”\n“But the wheel’s off!”\nHe hesitated.\n“No harm in trying,” he said.\nThe caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and cut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsby’s house, making the night fine as before, and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden. A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host, who stood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "As I descended the steps, I noticed the evening's events weren't entirely finished. About fifty feet from the entrance, a cluster of headlights illuminated a strange and chaotic scene. Lying upright in the ditch beside the road, though missing one wheel that had been violently torn off, was a new coupe that had left Gatsby’s driveway only moments before. A sharp wall projection was the cause of the wheel's detachment, and it was now drawing significant attention from several curious chauffeurs. However, because they had parked their cars in a way that blocked the road, a loud, unpleasant noise from those behind had been audible for a while, contributing to the already intense disarray of the situation.\nA man wearing a long duster coat had exited the damaged vehicle and was now standing in the middle of the road. He looked from the car to the tire and then to the onlookers with a calmly bewildered expression.\n\"Look!\" he announced. \"It ended up in the ditch.\"\nThe fact seemed utterly astonishing to him. I first recognized the unusual quality of his surprise and then recognized the man – it was the visitor I had met in Gatsby’s library.\n\"How did that happen?\"\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\n\"I know absolutely nothing about cars or how they work,\" he stated with finality.\n\"But seriously, how did it happen? Did you hit the wall?\"\n\"Don’t ask me,\" the man known as Owl Eyes replied, completely dismissing responsibility. \"I barely know how to drive – practically not at all. It just happened, and that’s all I can say.\"\n\"Well, if you're not a good driver, you shouldn't attempt to drive at night.\"\n\"But I wasn’t even trying to drive,\" he protested indignantly, \"I genuinely wasn’t attempting to drive.\"\nAn astonished silence fell over those watching.\n\"Are you trying to kill yourself?\"\n\"You're incredibly lucky it was just the wheel! A terrible driver who wasn't even putting in effort!\"\n\"You don’t understand,\" the person responsible clarified. \"I wasn’t the one driving. There's another person in the car.\"\nThe shock that followed this revelation was voiced in a collective, drawn-out \"Ah-h-h!\" as the coupe's door slowly swung open. The onlookers – now a definite crowd – instinctively stepped back, and once the door was fully open, there was an eerie silence. Then, very slowly, a weak-looking, swaying person emerged piece by piece from the wreck, gingerly probing the ground with a large, uncertain shoe designed for dancing.\nBlinded by the bright headlights and disoriented by the constant honking of horns, the ghost-like figure stood unsteadily for a moment before spotting the man in the duster.\n\"Wha’s wrong?\" he asked calmly. \"Did we run out of gas?\"\n\"Look!\"\nSeveral fingers pointed at the wheel that had been torn off. He stared at it briefly, then looked upwards as if he suspected it might have fallen from the sky.\n\"It came off,\" someone explained.\nHe nodded.\n\"Initially I din’ notice we’d stopped.\"\nThere was a pause. Then, taking a deep breath and squaring his shoulders, he asked with a determined tone:\n\"Could someone tell me where there’s a gas station?\"\nAt least a dozen people, some of whom were in a slightly better state than he was, explained to him that the wheel and the car were no longer connected in any way.\n\"Drive backward,\" he suggested after a moment. \"Put it in reverse gear.\"\n\"But the wheel’s missing!\"\nHe hesitated.\n\"There's no harm in trying,\" he said.\nThe blaring horns had reached their peak loudness, and I turned away, cutting across the lawn toward my house. I glanced back once. A slender crescent moon was shining above Gatsby’s mansion, making the night seem as pleasant as before, and unaffected by the noise and the glow of his still lit garden. A sudden feeling of emptiness seemed to emanate from the windows and grand doorways, making the figure of the host, who stood on the porch with his hand raised in a formal farewell gesture, appear completely isolated.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As I descended the steps, I realized the evening's events weren't finished. Not far from the entrance, the glow of several headlights lit up a chaotic and unusual situation. A brand new coupé, which had just left Gatsby’s driveway moments earlier, sat upright in a ditch, missing a wheel that had been torn off by a sharply projecting wall. Several intrigued chauffeurs were concentrated on the lost wheel, having left their cars haphazardly, which caused a loud and unpleasant commotion among other blocked drivers. This confusion heightened the disorder of the moment.\n\nA man in a long coat had gotten out of the wrecked car and now stood in the road, glancing with cheerful confusion between the car, the wheel, and the crowd. “See!” he clarified, “It ended up in the ditch.” He was genuinely amazed by this, and I soon realized he was the same person who had once admired Gatsby’s library.\n\nWhen asked how the accident had happened, he responded with a shrug, insisting he knew nothing at all about mechanics. “Did you hit the wall?” someone questioned. He refused responsibility, claiming he hardly knew how to drive and had no idea how it occurred. Someone objected that such a poor driver shouldn’t be driving at night. He protested, clarifying that he hadn’t really been driving at all.\n\nOnlookers fell silent in surprise. “Do you have a death wish?” one demanded, while another pointed out that only a wheel was lost and scolded him for apparently driving badly without actually trying. “You don’t get it,” the man insisted, “I wasn’t driving. Someone else was.”\n\nThis startling statement provoked a shocked chorus from the crowd, who watched as the coupé’s door creaked open. They instinctively stepped back as a pale, unsteady figure slowly emerged, feeling the ground uncertainly with an oversized shoe. Dazzled by lights and noise, this second man took a moment to realize what was happening, then calmly asked, “What’s wrong? Did we run out of gas?”\n\nSeveral people pointed at the missing wheel and explained the situation. He nodded, admitting he hadn’t noticed the car had even stopped at first. Gathering himself, he then inquired matter-of-factly where he could find a gas station. Many bystanders tried to explain the obvious—that his car and wheel were no longer attached—but he optimistically suggested trying to reverse the car out anyway. Despite being told the wheel was gone, he shrugged, saying there was no harm in trying.\n\nThe noise from the horns grew overwhelming, so I left, walking across the grass toward my house. I looked back once to see the thin moon shining over Gatsby’s mansion, the night still beautiful amid the laughter and music from his glowing garden. Yet a sudden sense of emptiness came from its doors and windows, making Gatsby himself, standing alone on the porch with his hand raised in a formal goodbye, seem completely solitary."

          "text_segment": "Reading over what I have written so far, I see I have given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me. On the contrary, they were merely casual events in a crowded summer, and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs.\nMost of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their first names, and lunched with them in dark, crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction, so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow quietly away.\nI took dinner usually at the Yale Club—for some reason it was the gloomiest event of my day—and then I went upstairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour. There were generally a few rioters around, but they never came into the library, so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night was mellow, I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel, and over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station.\nI began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night, and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever know or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness. At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others—poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner—young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.\nAgain at eight o’clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were lined five deep with throbbing taxicabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside. Imagining that I, too, was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate excitement, I wished them well.\nFor a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I found her again. At first I was flattered to go places with her, because she was a golf champion, and everyone knew her name. Then it was something more. I wasn’t actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed something—most affectations conceal something eventually, even though they don’t in the beginning—and one day I found what it was. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about it—and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at Daisy’s. At her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapers—a suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round. The thing approached the proportions of a scandal—then died away. A caddy retracted his statement, and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.\nJordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest. She wasn’t able to endure being at a disadvantage and, given this unwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body.\nIt made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeply—I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on that same house-party that we had a curious conversation about driving a car. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one man’s coat.\n“You’re a rotten driver,” I protested. “Either you ought to be more careful, or you oughtn’t to drive at all.”\n“I am careful.”\n“No, you’re not.”\n“Well, other people are,” she said lightly.\n“What’s that got to do with it?”\n“They’ll keep out of my way,” she insisted. “It takes two to make an accident.”\n“Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.”\n“I hope I never will,” she answered. “I hate careless people. That’s why I like you.”\nHer grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved her. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home. I’d been writing letters once a week and signing them: “Love, Nick,” and all I could think of was how, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint moustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.\nEveryone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Looking back at what I've written, I realize I might have suggested that the events of just three specific nights over several weeks were the only things that mattered to me. Actually, those were just minor occurrences during a very busy summer, and, until much later, they occupied my thoughts far less than my own personal life.\nMost days were filled with work. Early each morning, as the sun cast my shadow towards the west, I hurried down the narrow, skyscraper-lined streets of lower Manhattan to my job at the Probity Trust. I knew the other office workers and junior bond salespeople by their first names, and we would have lunch in crowded, dimly lit restaurants, eating small sausages with mashed potatoes and coffee. I even had a brief relationship with a woman from the accounting department who lived in Jersey City, but when her brother started giving me hostile looks, I let the relationship fade away quietly when she took her vacation in July.\nDinner was usually at the Yale Club, which, for some reason, always felt like the most unpleasant part of my day. Afterward, I'd go up to the library and diligently spend an hour studying investments and securities. There were often some noisy people nearby, but they didn't come into the library, so it was a good place to concentrate. If the weather was pleasant after that, I'd take a walk down Madison Avenue, passing the old Murray Hill Hotel, then over to 33rd Street and on to Pennsylvania Station.\nI began to enjoy New York City, particularly its lively, adventurous atmosphere at night, and the sense of satisfaction that the constant movement of people, cars, and lights offered to my restless eyes. I liked walking up Fifth Avenue and picking out women from the crowd, imagining that very soon I would become a part of their lives, and that nobody would ever know or disapprove. Sometimes, in my imagination, I would follow them mentally to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they would turn back and smile at me just before disappearing through a doorway into a warm, dark interior. During the magical twilight hours in the city, I sometimes felt a persistent sense of loneliness, and saw it in others as well—like the poor young clerks who lingered outside shop windows, waiting until it was late enough for a lonely dinner in a restaurant—young men in the fading light, letting the most significant moments of night and life slip away.\nAgain, around eight o'clock, when the dark streets of the Forties were filled with five deep rows of pulsing taxis heading towards the theater district, I felt a pang in my heart. People leaned close together inside the waiting cabs, voices were singing, there was laughter at private jokes, and the glow of cigarettes made unclear shapes inside the windows. Imagining that I, too, was rushing towards fun and sharing in their personal excitement, I silently wished them well.\nFor a while, I didn't see Jordan Baker, but then in the middle of summer, I encountered her again. Initially, I was pleased to be seen with her because she was a well-known golf champion. Then my feelings developed into something more. I wasn't truly in love, but I felt a kind of gentle curiosity. The cool, superior look she presented to the world seemed to hide something—most poses eventually hide something, even if not initially—and one day I discovered what it was. When we were at a house party together north of the city in Warwick, she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the roof down and then lied about it. Suddenly, I remembered a story about her that I couldn't recall the night I met her at Daisy's. At her first major golf tournament, there was an incident that almost became public knowledge—an accusation that she had moved her ball from a difficult spot during the semifinal match. It nearly turned into a significant scandal but eventually faded away. A caddy withdrew his statement, and the only other witness admitted he might have been mistaken. The event and her name had remained connected in my mind.\nJordan Baker instinctively avoided intelligent, perceptive men, and now I realized this was because she felt more secure in an environment where it was assumed people would never break the rules. She was inherently dishonest. She couldn't stand being at a disadvantage, and because of this unwillingness, I suppose she started using deception from a young age to maintain that calm, arrogant smile towards the world while still satisfying the needs of her strong, confident physical presence.\nIt didn't bother me much. Dishonesty in a woman is something you don't tend to judge too harshly—I felt a casual regret for a moment, and then I forgot about it. It was during that same house party that we had a strange conversation about driving. It came up because she drove so close to some workmen that our car's fender brushed a button off one man's coat.\n\"You're a terrible driver,\" I complained. \"You either need to be much more careful, or you shouldn't drive at all.\"\n\"I am careful.\"\n\"No, you're not.\"\n\"Well, other people are careful,\" she said casually.\n\"What does that have to do with it?\"\n\"They will stay out of my way,\" she insisted. \"It takes two people to cause an accident.\"\n\"What if you met someone just as careless as you are?\"\n\"I hope that never happens,\" she replied. \"I dislike careless people. That's why I like you.\"\nHer gray eyes, narrowed against the sun, looked straight ahead, but she had intentionally changed the dynamic between us, and for a moment I thought I was falling in love with her. But I am slow to make decisions and guided by internal principles that restrain my impulses, and I knew that first I needed to definitively resolve the situation back home. I had been writing letters once a week and ending them with \"Love, Nick,\" and all I could think about was the slight line of sweat that appeared on the upper lip of the girl back home when she played tennis. Despite this, there was a vague understanding with her that needed to be ended gently before I could be truly free.\nEveryone believes they possess at least one major virtue, and mine is this: I am one of the few truly honest people I have ever known.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Looking back at what I've written, I realize it might seem as though only those few nights, spaced out over several weeks, occupied my time. But in reality, those events were just minor parts of a very busy summer, and for a long while my own life mattered to me far more than those occasions did. Most days were filled with work. Early in the mornings, as I rushed through the tall, bright canyons of downtown New York to my job at the Probity Trust, the sunlight would cast my shadow behind me. I was on friendly terms with the other young clerks and bond sellers, sharing lunches with them in dim, bustling restaurants over sausages, mashed potatoes, and coffee. I even briefly dated a woman from my office who lived in Jersey City, but after her brother started giving me unfriendly looks, I let our romance quietly fade when she left for her vacation that July. \n\nI usually had dinner at the Yale Club, though I found it the most depressing part of my day, after which I would spend a diligent hour upstairs in the library studying finance. There were often noisy people nearby, but the library stayed peaceful and made a good place to focus. If the evening was pleasant, I liked to wander down Madison Avenue past old landmarks to Pennsylvania Station. \n\nI began to enjoy the exhilarating energy of New York at night, the liveliness that fascinated my wandering gaze, and the sense of possibility among all the people and movement. Sometimes I would stroll along Fifth Avenue, picking out interesting women in the crowd and imagining myself briefly entering their lives without anyone noticing or caring. In my imagination, I might follow them to their homes, where they would smile at me before vanishing into the warmth of their buildings. At dusk, the romantic evening light brought a sense of loneliness, which I saw mirrored in other young men—lonely clerks lingering by storefronts, waiting to eat alone, wasting the most meaningful moments of their youth. \n\nAt night, when the streets filled with lines of taxis ready to take people to the theaters, I sometimes felt a longing in my heart. Couples leaned together in cabs, laughing and talking, their cigarettes glowing in the dark. Imagining myself sharing in their excitement and fun, I silently wished them happiness. \n\nFor a time, I didn't see Jordan Baker, but we reconnected in midsummer. Initially, I was proud to be seen with her because of her fame as a golfer, but it became something more—a gentle curiosity, though I wasn't truly in love. I realized that her cool, aloof facade hid something deeper. I found out what it was when we were at a house party in Warwick together: she left someone else's car out in the rain with the roof down and lied about it. That reminded me of a past scandal in her golf career—she had allegedly improved her position during a tournament, something that almost made the news before it quietly died down. That incident had stuck in my mind ever since. \n\nJordan tended to avoid intelligent, shrewd men—perhaps because she felt safest where it wouldn't occur to anyone that she might cheat. Essentially, she was habitually dishonest. She couldn't stand being at a disadvantage, and I guessed she'd started using deception from an early age, just to keep up her self-assured image and to satisfy her ambitious spirit. \n\nIt didn't really bother me. I believe dishonesty in a woman doesn't provoke deep reproach; I was mildly regretful and then forgot about it. During that same house party, we had an odd conversation about driving, after she drove so close to some workers that our car brushed one’s coat. I scolded her for her careless driving, but she claimed that her caution was unnecessary because other people would avoid her, saying it takes two people to cause a crash. When I asked what would happen if she met someone equally careless, she just replied she hoped never to, saying she disliked careless people—which was partly why she liked me. \n\nFor a moment, looking at her calm, determined expression, I thought I might love her, but I’m careful and governed by my own rules, so I knew I needed to settle my unresolved relationship back home first. I’d been writing affectionate letters every week to a girl, but our relationship was ambiguous, and I knew I needed to end it gently before moving on. \n\nI think everyone prides themselves on at least one major virtue, and for me, it is honesty—I am one of the few truly honest people I’ve ever known."

          "text_segment": "On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages alongshore, the world and its mistress returned to Gatsby’s house and twinkled hilariously on his lawn.\n“He’s a bootlegger,” said the young ladies, moving somewhere between his cocktails and his flowers. “One time he killed a man who had found out that he was nephew to Von Hindenburg and second cousin to the devil. Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there crystal glass.”\nOnce I wrote down on the empty spaces of a timetable the names of those who came to Gatsby’s house that summer. It is an old timetable now, disintegrating at its folds, and headed “This schedule in effect July 5th, 1922.” But I can still read the grey names, and they will give you a better impression than my generalities of those who accepted Gatsby’s hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing whatever about him.\nFrom East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches, and a man named Bunsen, whom I knew at Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet, who was drowned last summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and the Willie Voltaires, and a whole clan named Blackbuck, who always gathered in a corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near. And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and Mr. Chrystie’s wife), and Edgar Beaver, whose hair, they say, turned cotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.\nClarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He came only once, in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the garden. From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O. R. P. Schraeders, and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia, and the Fishguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there three days before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive that Mrs. Ulysses Swett’s automobile ran over his right hand. The Dancies came, too, and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over sixty, and Maurice A. Flink, and the Hammerheads, and Beluga the tobacco importer, and Beluga’s girls.\nFrom West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Schoen and Gulick the State senator and Newton Orchid, who controlled Films Par Excellence, and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don S. Schwartz (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the movies in one way or another. And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G. Earl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his wife. Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B. (“Rot-Gut”) Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly—they came to gamble, and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was cleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably next day.\nA man named Klipspringer was there so often that he became known as “the boarder”—I doubt if he had any other home. Of theatrical people there were Gus Waize and Horace O’Donavan and Lester Myer and George Duckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New York were the Chromes and the Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry L. Palmetto, who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train in Times Square.\nBenny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite the same ones in physical person, but they were so identical one with another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before. I have forgotten their names—Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela, or Gloria or Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American capitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves to be.\nIn addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O’Brien came there at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer, who had his nose shot off in the war, and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag, his fiancée, and Ardita Fitz-Peters and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of the American Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip, with a man reputed to be her chauffeur, and a prince of something, whom we called Duke, and whose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten.\nAll these people came to Gatsby’s house in the summer.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "As Sunday morning dawned and church bells rang out in nearby towns, the multitude of guests and their companions reappeared at Gatsby's estate, filling his lawn with raucous festivity. Amongst the revelers, young women circulated between the drinks and flowers, spreading rumors. One popular story claimed Gatsby was a bootlegger who had committed murder after someone discovered his supposed connection to Von Hindenburg and the devil, before quickly demanding a rose or another drink. I once used the blank areas of an old train schedule, titled 'This schedule in effect July 5th, 1922,' to record the names of everyone who visited Gatsby's house that summer. This old, crumbling list offers a more concrete picture than my general descriptions of the people who accepted Gatsby's generosity, subtly honoring him by knowing virtually nothing about him. From East Egg came various families like the Chester Beckers and the Leeches, acquaintances like Bunsen from Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet, who later drowned. The Hornbeams, the Willie Voltaires, and the Blackbuck family, known for their snobbishness, were also present, along with the Ismays and Chrysties (including Hubert Auerbach and Mrs. Chrystie), and Edgar Beaver, famously said to have inexplicably gone white-haired one winter. Clarence Endive from East Egg, arriving only once in distinctive attire, was involved in a garden altercation with a man named Etty. Guests from farther parts of the Island included the Cheadles, the O. R. P. Schraeders, the Southern socialite Stonewall Jackson Abrams, the Fishguards, and Ripley Snell. Snell was there just three days before being sent to prison, so intoxicated on the driveway that Mrs. Ulysses Swett's car injured his hand. The Dancies, the elderly S. B. Whitebait, Maurice A. Flink, the Hammerheads, tobacco importer Beluga and his companions also frequented the parties. West Egg contributed figures like the Poles, the Mulreadys, Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Schoen, state senator Gulick, film producer Newton Orchid, Eckhaust, Clyde Cohen, Don S. Schwartz (son of an important figure), and Arthur McCarty—many linked to the film industry. The Catlips, Bembergs, and G. Earl Muldoon, brother of a man who later killed his wife, were also among them. Gamblers like promoter Da Fontano, Ed Legros, James B. (“Rot-Gut”) Ferret, the De Jongs, and Ernest Lilly were common attendees; Ferret's presence in the garden signaled he had lost all his money, anticipating a profitable stock market fluctuation the next day. A man named Klipspringer was such a constant presence that he earned the nickname “the boarder,” seemingly lacking any other residence. Theatrical attendees included Gus Waize, Horace O’Donavan, Lester Myer, George Duckweed, and Francis Bull. From New York, the guest list included the Chromes, Backhyssons, Dennickers, Russel Betty, the Corrigans, Kellehers, Dewars, Scullys, S. W. Belcher, the Smirkes, the now-divorced young Quinns, and Henry L. Palmetto, who tragically committed suicide by jumping in front of a subway train. Benny McClenahan always arrived accompanied by four young women; although physically different individuals each time, they were so alike they gave the impression of being the same group returning. Their names, possibly Jaqueline, Consuela, Gloria, Judy, or June, were either romantically floral or monthly, or sternly capitalistic—names whose wealthy families they would claim kinship to if asked. Beyond these, I recall Faustina O’Brien visited at least once, along with the Baedeker girls, young Brewer who lost his nose in the war, Mr. Albrucksburger and his fiancée Miss Haag, Ardita Fitz-Peters, Mr. P. Jewett (a former head of the American Legion), and Miss Claudia Hip, attended by a man believed to be her chauffeur, and a European noble we simply called Duke, whose actual name I have forgotten. This entire diverse assembly frequented Gatsby’s house throughout that summer.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "On Sunday mornings, as church bells rang in the nearby coastal villages, crowds of people flocked back to Gatsby’s mansion, filling his lawn with lively festivities. Gossip circulated among the women as they strolled between the drinks and the flowers. They whispered that Gatsby was a bootlegger, with wild rumors spreading that he had once killed a man who discovered he was related to Von Hindenburg and the devil. One asked for a rose and a final glass of drink. I once made a list on an old timetable, now falling apart, of everyone who visited Gatsby that summer. The list, dated July 5th, 1922, still reveals the names of those who took advantage of Gatsby’s hospitality while remaining ignorant about him personally. Attendees from East Egg included the Chester Beckers, the Leeches, Bunsen (an acquaintance from Yale), Dr. Webster Civet (who drowned last summer), the Hornbeams, the Willie Voltaires, the extensive Blackbuck family (who were standoffish), the Ismays, the Chrysties (with Hubert Auerbach and Mrs. Chrystie), and Edgar Beaver (whose hair suddenly turned white one winter). Clarence Endive, also from East Egg, only came once and caused a scuffle at the party. From farther out on the Island came families like the Cheadles, the Schraeders, the Stonewall Jackson Abrams from Georgia, the Fishguards, and the Ripley Snells—Snell got so drunk he was later run over by Mrs. Swett’s car. Other guests included the Dancies, S. B. Whitebait (an elderly man), Maurice A. Flink, the Hammerheads, and Beluga the tobacco importer with his girls. From West Egg, there were the Poles, the Mulreadys, Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Schoen, state senator Gulick, Newton Orchid (who ran a film company), Eckhaust, Clyde Cohen, Don S. Schwartz, Arthur McCarty, and others tied to the movie business. Also present were the Catlips, the Bembergs, G. Earl Muldoon (whose brother later committed a crime), Da Fontano the promoter, Ed Legros, James B. Ferret, the De Jongs, and Ernest Lilly—many of whom gambled and speculated on the markets. Klipspringer stayed at the house so frequently that he was known as \"the boarder.\" There were theater people like Gus Waize, Horace O’Donavan, Lester Myer, and George Duckweed. Guests also arrived from New York, including the Chromes, Backhyssons, Dennickers, Russel Betty, the Corrigans, Kellehers, Dewars, Scullys, S. W. Belcher, Smirkes, the young Quinns (now divorced), and Henry L. Palmetto (who later committed suicide). Benny McClenahan always brought four girls, though their identities seemed to blend together with similar names, often evoking flowers, months, or wealthy families. I also recall others like Faustina O’Brien, the Baedeker girls, young Brewer (wounded in the war), Mr. Albrucksburger and his fiancée Miss Haag, Ardita Fitz-Peters, Mr. P. Jewett (former American Legion head), Miss Claudia Hip (with a man rumored to be her driver), and a mysterious prince known as Duke. Altogether, these were the people who filled Gatsby’s house each summer."

          "text_segment": "At nine o’clock, one morning late in July, Gatsby’s gorgeous car lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody from its three-noted horn.\nIt was the first time he had called on me, though I had gone to two of his parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation, made frequent use of his beach.\n“Good morning, old sport. You’re having lunch with me today and I thought we’d ride up together.”\nHe was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American—that comes, I suppose, with the absence of lifting work in youth and, even more, with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games. This quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.\nHe saw me looking with admiration at his car.\n“It’s pretty, isn’t it, old sport?” He jumped off to give me a better view. “Haven’t you ever seen it before?”\nI’d seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream colour, bright with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and toolboxes, and terraced with a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory, we started to town.\nI had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and found, to my disappointment, that he had little to say. So my first impression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate roadhouse next door.\nAnd then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn’t reached West Egg village before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-coloured suit.\n“Look here, old sport,” he broke out surprisingly, “what’s your opinion of me, anyhow?”\nA little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that question deserves.\n“Well, I’m going to tell you something about my life,” he interrupted. “I don’t want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear.”\nSo he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavoured conversation in his halls.\n“I’ll tell you God’s truth.” His right hand suddenly ordered divine retribution to stand by. “I am the son of some wealthy people in the Middle West—all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford, because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It is a family tradition.”\nHe looked at me sideways—and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was lying. He hurried the phrase “educated at Oxford,” or swallowed it, or choked on it, as though it had bothered him before. And with this doubt, his whole statement fell to pieces, and I wondered if there wasn’t something a little sinister about him, after all.\n“What part of the Middle West?” I inquired casually.\n“San Francisco.”\n“I see.”\n“My family all died and I came into a good deal of money.”\nHis voice was solemn, as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan still haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg, but a glance at him convinced me otherwise.\n“After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of Europe—Paris, Venice, Rome—collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago.”\nWith an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The very phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a turbaned “character” leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne.\n“Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief, and I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a commission as first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest I took the remains of my machine-gun battalion so far forward that there was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn’t advance. We stayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty men with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of dead. I was promoted to be a major, and every Allied government gave me a decoration—even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea!”\nLittle Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded at them—with his smile. The smile comprehended Montenegro’s troubled history and sympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people. It appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had elicited this tribute from Montenegro’s warm little heart. My incredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming hastily through a dozen magazines.\nHe reached in his pocket, and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon, fell into my palm.\n“That’s the one from Montenegro.”\nTo my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look. “Orderi di Danilo,” ran the circular legend, “Montenegro, Nicolas Rex.”\n“Turn it.”\n“Major Jay Gatsby,” I read, “For Valour Extraordinary.”\n“Here’s another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Oxford days. It was taken in Trinity Quad—the man on my left is now the Earl of Doncaster.”\nIt was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an archway through which were visible a host of spires. There was Gatsby, looking a little, not much, younger—with a cricket bat in his hand.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Around nine o'clock on a summer morning in late July, Gatsby's impressive vehicle bumped up the uneven path to my place, sounding a unique three-note horn. He hadn't visited me before, although I had attended two of his parties, ridden in his seaplane, and frequently used his beach at his strong encouragement. \"Good morning, old sport. You're joining me for lunch today, and I thought we could drive there together,\" he said. He perched effortlessly on the dashboard of his car with a characteristic American agility, which I attribute to a youth free from manual labor and, even more, to the uninhibited fluidity seen in our unpredictable sports. This quality often surfaced as restlessness, disrupting his otherwise meticulous demeanor. He was never completely still; there was always a foot tapping somewhere or a hand opening and closing impatiently. He noticed me admiring his car. \"It's quite attractive, isn't it, old sport?\" He hopped down to give me a better view. \"Haven't you seen it before?\" I certainly had. Everyone had seen it. It was a shiny cream color, gleaming with nickel trim, bloated here and there along its immense length with triumphant compartments for hats, meals, and tools, and layered with a complex arrangement of windshields that reflected numerous suns. Seated behind multiple layers of glass in what felt like a green leather greenhouse, we set off towards town. I had conversed with him perhaps six times over the past month and discovered, disappointingly, that he wasn't very talkative. Consequently, my initial impression of him as someone of significant but mysterious importance had gradually diminished, and he had become, in my mind, merely the owner of the extravagant house next door. Then came that unsettling journey. We hadn't even reached the village of West Egg before Gatsby began leaving his sophisticated sentences unfinished and tapping himself distractedly on the knee of his tan suit. \"Look here, old sport,\" he blurted out unexpectedly, \"what do you honestly think of me?\" Feeling somewhat taken aback, I started offering the general, non-committal responses that such a question usually elicits. \"Well, I'm about to share some facts about my life,\" he interrupted. \"I don't want you forming a false impression of me based on all the rumors you hear.\" So, he was aware of the strange accusations that were common topics of conversation in his home. \"I'll tell you the absolute truth.\" He suddenly raised his right hand as if calling for divine judgment to witness. \"I am the child of affluent people from the Middle West—they are all deceased now. I grew up in the United States but was educated at Oxford, as it has been a tradition for all my ancestors for many years. It's a family custom.\" He glanced at me from the side—and I understood why Jordan Baker had suspected he was fabricating the story. He rushed the words \"educated at Oxford,\" or mumbled them, or choked on them, as if they had caused him trouble before. And with that moment of doubt, his entire narrative seemed to crumble, and I wondered if there wasn't something slightly ominous about him after all. \"Which part of the Middle West?\" I asked casually. \"San Francisco.\" \"I see.\" \"My family passed away, and I inherited a considerable amount of money.\" His voice was solemn, as if the memory of his family's sudden demise still haunted him. For a moment, I suspected he was teasing me, but observing his expression convinced me otherwise. \"After that, I lived like a young prince in all the major European cities—Paris, Venice, Rome—amassing jewels, particularly rubies, engaging in big-game hunting, doing a little painting just for myself, and attempting to forget a deeply sorrowful event that happened a long time ago.\" I had to make an effort to suppress my disbelieving laughter. The very phrases he used were so overused they brought to mind only the image of a cliché exotic figure shedding sawdust from every pore while supposedly chasing a tiger through a Parisian park. \"Then the war began, old sport. It was a great relief, and I made every effort to die, but I seemed to lead a charmed life. I accepted a commission as a first lieutenant when it started. In the Argonne Forest, I led the remnants of my machine-gun unit so far forward that there was a half-mile gap on either side where the infantry couldn't advance. We held that position for two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty men with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry finally caught up, they found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of dead. I was promoted to major, and every Allied government awarded me a decoration—even Montenegro, that small country down on the Adriatic Sea!\" Little Montenegro! He emphasized the words and nodded approvingly at them—with his smile. That smile encapsulated Montenegro's turbulent past and conveyed sympathy for the brave struggles of its people. It fully recognized the sequence of national events that had prompted this tribute from Montenegro's small but generous heart. My disbelief was now replaced by fascination; it felt like quickly flipping through numerous magazines. He reached into his pocket, and a metal object, attached to a ribbon, landed in my palm. \"That's the one from Montenegro.\" To my surprise, the item looked genuinely authentic. \"Orderi di Danilo,\" read the circular inscription, \"Montenegro, Nicolas Rex.\" \"Flip it over.\" \"Major Jay Gatsby,\" I read, \"For Valour Extraordinary.\" \"Here's something else I always carry. A memento from my time at Oxford. It was taken in Trinity Quad—the man on my left is now the Earl of Doncaster.\" It was a photo showing about six young men in blazers casually standing in an archway through which a multitude of spires were visible. There was Gatsby, looking slightly, but not much, younger—holding a cricket bat.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "One morning at nine o'clock, late in July, Gatsby's impressive car rumbled up the rough driveway to my house, the horn playing a short tune. This was his first visit to me, though I had been to two of his parties, gone out on his hydroplane, and often used his beach at his encouragement. \"Good morning, old sport. You're having lunch with me today, so let's drive there together,\" he said. He steadied himself on the dashboard with his characteristically energetic, American style of movement—restless, graceful, and never quite still, his manners interrupted by fidgeting feet or hands. Seeing me admire his car, Gatsby hopped out to show it off. \"Beautiful, isn't it, old sport? Haven't you seen it before?\" he asked. I had—everyone had. The car was a luxurious cream color with bright nickel, oversized at parts to fit all sorts of boxes, and layered with windshields that reflected the sunlight. Seated behind the glass and surrounded by green leather, we set off for the city. Although I'd spoken with him a handful of times over the last month, I had realized, with some let-down, that he wasn't as extraordinary as I'd first thought—just the owner of an extravagant house next door. Then, during our drive, Gatsby started to act nervously, leaving sentences unfinished and fidgeting with his caramel-colored suit before suddenly asking, \"What do you think of me, old sport?\" Caught off guard, I began answering vaguely, but he cut in, \"I want to explain a few things about my life—I don't want you to believe all the stories about me.” He was clearly aware of the rumors that circulated at his parties. With a solemn gesture, he declared, \"I'll tell you the truth. My family was wealthy and from the Midwest, but they're all gone now. I was raised in America and studied at Oxford, as it was a family tradition.\" He said \"educated at Oxford\" in a way that seemed forced, which made me doubt him, just as Jordan Baker had. The entire story seemed to unravel, making Gatsby seem slightly suspicious. When I asked where in the Midwest his family was from, he responded, \"San Francisco,\" which only increased my doubts. He continued that, after inheriting his family's fortune, he lived lavishly in European cities, collecting jewels, hunting, painting, and trying to move past a sad memory. I struggled not to laugh at how rehearsed it all sounded. Then he told me about his experiences in the war, how he sought danger but always survived, led men in battle, and received decorations from several allied countries—including \"little Montenegro,\" which he described with admiration and affection. To further prove his claims, he handed me a medal inscribed with \"Orderi di Danilo, Montenegro, Nicolas Rex\" on one side and \"Major Jay Gatsby, For Valour Extraordinary\" on the other. He also produced a photograph from his Oxford days, showing him with a cricket bat among other young men, one of whom was now a British peer."

          "text_segment": "Then it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace on the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with their crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart.\n“I’m going to make a big request of you today,” he said, pocketing his souvenirs with satisfaction, “so I thought you ought to know something about me. I didn’t want you to think I was just some nobody. You see, I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad things that happened to me.” He hesitated. “You’ll hear about it this afternoon.”\n“At lunch?”\n“No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you’re taking Miss Baker to tea.”\n“Do you mean you’re in love with Miss Baker?”\n“No, old sport, I’m not. But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak to you about this matter.”\nI hadn’t the faintest idea what “this matter” was, but I was more annoyed than interested. I hadn’t asked Jordan to tea in order to discuss Mr. Jay Gatsby. I was sure the request would be something utterly fantastic, and for a moment I was sorry I’d ever set foot upon his overpopulated lawn.\nHe wouldn’t say another word. His correctness grew on him as we neared the city. We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of red-belted oceangoing ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark, undeserted saloons of the faded-gilt nineteen-hundreds. Then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a glimpse of Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting vitality as we went by.\nWith fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half Astoria—only half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevated I heard the familiar “jug-jug-spat!” of a motorcycle, and a frantic policeman rode alongside.\n“All right, old sport,” called Gatsby. We slowed down. Taking a white card from his wallet, he waved it before the man’s eyes.\n“Right you are,” agreed the policeman, tipping his cap. “Know you next time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse me!”\n“What was that?” I inquired. “The picture of Oxford?”\n“I was able to do the commissioner a favour once, and he sends me a Christmas card every year.”\nOver the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of nonolfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.\nA dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two carriages with drawn blinds, and by more cheerful carriages for friends. The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short upper lips of southeastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of Gatsby’s splendid car was included in their sombre holiday. As we crossed Blackwell’s Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white chauffeur, in which sat three modish negroes, two bucks and a girl. I laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in haughty rivalry.\n“Anything can happen now that we’ve slid over this bridge,” I thought; “anything at all…”\nEven Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "At that moment, I realized everything he had told me was true. I could picture the fiery tiger skins in his Venice palace on the Grand Canal and see him opening a chest of dazzling rubies, using their deep red glow to soothe the pain of his broken heart. 'I'm preparing to ask you something significant today,' he stated, putting his mementos back in his pocket with satisfaction, 'so I felt it was necessary for you to know a bit about me. I didn't want you to mistake me for a nobody. You see, I usually find myself among people I don't know because I wander from place to place attempting to escape the painful events of my past.' He paused for a moment. 'You'll hear about it later this afternoon.' 'During lunch?' I asked. 'No, later today. I happened to learn that you're scheduled to have tea with Miss Baker.' 'Are you implying you're romantically involved with Miss Baker?' I questioned. 'No, old sport, I'm not,' he replied. 'However, Miss Baker has kindly agreed to discuss this matter with you.' I had absolutely no clue what 'this matter' referred to, but I felt more irritated than curious. I hadn't invited Jordan for tea intending to talk about Mr. Jay Gatsby. I was certain his request would be something completely outlandish, and for a brief moment, I regretted ever stepping foot on his excessively crowded lawn. He refused to say anything further. His formal demeanor intensified as we got closer to the city. We drove past Port Roosevelt, catching a glimpse of large oceangoing vessels marked with red bands, and then sped along a cobbled street in a less prosperous area, lined with the old, never-empty bars that still had hints of their faded golden-age decor from the early 1900s. Then the industrial area known as the valley of ashes appeared on either side, and as we drove by, I briefly saw Mrs. Wilson struggling with the garage pump with energetic effort. His car, with its wide fenders like wings, cast light across half of Astoria—only half, because as we maneuvered around the pillars of the elevated train tracks, I recognized the distinctive 'jug-jug-spat!' sound of a motorcycle, and an urgent-looking policeman rode up alongside us. 'It's alright, old sport,' Gatsby called out. We slowed down. He took a white card from his wallet and briefly showed it to the policeman. 'Understood,' the policeman agreed, tipping his cap respectfully. 'I'll remember you next time, Mr. Gatsby. My apologies!' 'What was that?' I asked. 'Was it a picture of Oxford?' 'I was able to do a favor for the police commissioner once,' Gatsby explained, 'and he sends me a Christmas card every single year.' We crossed the magnificent bridge, with the sunlight filtering through the steel structure creating a constantly shifting pattern on the cars below, and the city rising across the river in structures resembling white mounds and sugar cubes, seemingly conjured by pure desire from wealth that bore no trace of its origin. The city viewed from the Queensboro Bridge always feels like the first time you've seen it, revealing its initial wild promise of all the world's mystery and splendor. A hearse loaded with flowers, carrying a deceased person, passed us, followed by two carriages with their window blinds pulled down, and then more cheerful carriages carrying friends. These friends looked out at us with the sorrowful eyes and tight upper lips typical of people from southeastern Europe, and I felt a strange satisfaction that the sight of Gatsby's remarkable car was part of their solemn occasion. As we drove over Blackwell's Island, a limousine passed us, driven by a white chauffeur, inside which sat three stylish Black individuals—two men and a young woman. I couldn't help but laugh aloud as their eyeballs rolled towards us in a look of haughty rivalry. 'Anything is possible now that we've crossed this bridge,' I thought to myself; 'absolutely anything...' Even someone like Gatsby could exist, without seeming particularly astonishing.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Everything he said was real. I imagined the sight of tiger skins burning bright in an extravagant mansion on the Grand Canal, and pictured him unlocking a chest filled with rubies to try and soothe his troubled heart. \n\nHe turned to me and said, tucking away his mementos with contentment, \"Today I have an important favor to ask of you, so I thought you should know a little about my past. I didn’t want you to think I’m a nobody. The truth is, I often end up among strangers because I wander from place to place, trying to forget the sorrowful events in my life.\" He hesitated before adding, \"You’ll hear more about it later today.\"\n\n\"At lunch?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, later this afternoon. I’ve heard you’re taking Miss Baker to tea.\"\n\n\"Are you in love with Miss Baker?\"\n\n\"No, of course not,\" he replied. \"But Miss Baker has graciously agreed to talk to you about what I have in mind.\"\n\nI had no clue what this mysterious subject was, but rather than being intrigued, I was mildly irritated. I hadn't invited Jordan to tea just to discuss Jay Gatsby, and I was almost regretful I’d ever set foot on his crowded lawn, certain that whatever was to come would be fantastical.\n\nGatsby fell silent after that, and his demeanor became more formal as we approached the city. We passed Port Roosevelt, where I caught sight of large ocean ships with red belts, and then sped through a rough neighborhood, its streets lined with old, lively saloons from a golden but long-gone age. The landscape spread out into the bleak valley of ashes, and I glimpsed Mrs. Wilson energetically pumping gas as we passed.\n\nOur car sped through Astoria, illuminating the streets, but just as we ducked between the supports of the elevated train, we heard the abrupt sound of a motorcycle. Suddenly, a police officer pulled up beside us. \n\n\"It’s all right, old sport,\" Gatsby calmly said as we slowed down. He took a white card from his wallet and showed it to the officer.\n\n\"I see, Mr. Gatsby,\" the officer replied, tipping his hat. \"I’ll remember you next time. Sorry to stop you!\"\n\n\"What was that?\" I asked Gatsby. \"A picture from Oxford?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said, explaining that years ago he had helped the police commissioner and now gets a Christmas card from him every year.\n\nWe drove over the great bridge, the sunlight flickering on the moving cars, the city emerging across the river like stacks of sugar cubes, built on dreams and money with no smell. Every time I saw it from the Queensboro Bridge, the city seemed new, offering the excitement and beauty of the world’s possibilities.\n\nWe saw a funeral procession pass us—a hearse covered in flowers, trailed by two carriages with closed curtains, and a few livelier cars for the friends of the deceased. The mourners inside glanced at Gatsby’s grand car with somber, almost tragic expressions that reminded me of southeastern Europe. I was glad Gatsby’s car was part of their day. Then, as we crossed Blackwell’s Island, a limousine went by with a white driver and three stylish Black passengers, two men and a woman. Their competitive, confident stares made me laugh out loud.\n\nAt that moment I thought, \"Anything might be possible now that we’ve crossed this bridge—anything at all. Even Gatsby seems possible, somehow, without surprising me.\""

Blinking away the brightness of the street outside, my eyes picked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.\n“Mr. Carraway, this is my friend Mr. Wolfshiem.”\nA small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half-darkness.\n“—So I took one look at him,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, shaking my hand earnestly, “and what do you think I did?”\n“What?” I inquired politely.\nBut evidently he was not addressing me, for he dropped my hand and covered Gatsby with his expressive nose.\n“I handed the money to Katspaugh and I said: ‘All right, Katspaugh, don’t pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.’ He shut it then and there.”\nGatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the restaurant, whereupon Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was starting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction.\n“Highballs?” asked the head waiter.\n“This is a nice restaurant here,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, looking at the presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. “But I like across the street better!”\n“Yes, highballs,” agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfshiem: “It’s too hot over there.”\n“Hot and small—yes,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “but full of memories.”\n“What place is that?” I asked.\n“The old Metropole.”\n“The old Metropole,” brooded Mr. Wolfshiem gloomily. “Filled with faces dead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I can’t forget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. It was six of us at the table, and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening. When it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a funny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside. ‘All right,’ says Rosy, and begins to get up, and I pulled him down in his chair.\n“ ‘Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don’t you, so help me, move outside this room.’\n“It was four o’clock in the morning then, and if we’d of raised the blinds we’d of seen daylight.”\n“Did he go?” I asked innocently.\n“Sure he went.” Mr. Wolfshiem’s nose flashed at me indignantly. “He turned around in the door and says: ‘Don’t let that waiter take away my coffee!’ Then he went out on the sidewalk, and they shot him three times in his full belly and drove away.”\n“Four of them were electrocuted,” I said, remembering.\n“Five, with Becker.” His nostrils turned to me in an interested way. “I understand you’re looking for a business gonnegtion.”\nThe juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered for me:\n“Oh, no,” he exclaimed, “this isn’t the man.”\n“No?” Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed.\n“This is just a friend. I told you we’d talk about that some other time.”\n“I beg your pardon,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “I had a wrong man.”\nA succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting the more sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with ferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around the room—he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly behind. I think that, except for my presence, he would have taken one short glance beneath our own table.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "It was the height of the day, around noon. I met Gatsby for lunch in a cool basement restaurant on Forty-second Street that had fans running. My eyes, adjusting after the glare of the street, vaguely made him out in the waiting area, talking to another man. Gatsby introduced us, saying, 'Mr. Carraway, meet my friend, Mr. Wolfshiem.' This was a short man with a flat nose and a large head. He looked at me, and I noticed two prominent tufts of hair growing in his nostrils. After a moment, I could see his small eyes in the dim light. Mr. Wolfshiem shook my hand firmly and continued a story he seemed to be telling someone else, saying, '—So I took one look at him, and what do you think I did?' I politely asked, 'What?' However, he wasn't really speaking to me; he let go of my hand and turned his expressive nose towards Gatsby. 'I gave the money to Katspaugh,' he went on, 'and told him: \"All right, Katspaugh, don't give him a cent until he shuts up.\" He shut up immediately.' Gatsby took each of us by the arm and guided us into the dining room. Mr. Wolfshiem stopped the sentence he had just begun and seemed to fall into a daze. The head waiter asked, 'Highballs?' Mr. Wolfshiem commented, looking at the angelic figures on the ceiling, 'This is a nice restaurant here. But I prefer the place across the street!' 'Yes, highballs,' Gatsby confirmed, then explained to Mr. Wolfshiem, 'It's too hot in there.' 'Hot and small—yes,' Mr. Wolfshiem agreed, 'but full of memories.' I asked, 'What place are you talking about?' 'The old Metropole,' he answered. 'The old Metropole,' Mr. Wolfshiem repeated mournfully. 'It's full of people who are dead and gone. Full of friends who are lost to me forever now. As long as I live, I can never forget the night they killed Rosy Rosenthal there. There were six of us at the table, and Rosy had been eating and drinking a lot all evening. When it was nearly morning, the waiter came up to him with a strange look and said someone wanted to see him outside. \"All right,\" Rosy said and started to get up, but I pulled him back into his chair. \"Let the jerks come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don't you, I swear, step outside this room.\" It was four in the morning then, and if we had raised the blinds, we would have seen daylight.' 'Did he go?' I asked innocently. 'Of course he went.' Mr. Wolfshiem's nose seemed to twitch with indignation as he looked at me. 'He turned around at the door and said: \"Don't let that waiter take my coffee!\" Then he went out onto the sidewalk, and they shot him three times in his stomach and drove away.' 'Four of them were executed in the electric chair,' I said, recalling the event. 'Five, including Becker.' His nostrils turned towards me with interest. 'I hear you're looking for a business connection.' This sudden change from the murder story was surprising. Gatsby quickly answered for me, exclaiming, 'Oh, no, this isn't the man.' 'No?' Mr. Wolfshiem sounded disappointed. 'This is just a friend. I told you we'd discuss that another time.' 'My apologies,' said Mr. Wolfshiem, 'I had the wrong person.' A delicious hash was served, and Mr. Wolfshiem, abandoning the sad mood about the Metropole, began to eat with intense concentration and surprising grace. Meanwhile, his eyes slowly scanned the entire room—he even turned to look closely at the people sitting directly behind us. I suspect that if I hadn't been there, he might have even taken a quick peek under our own table.",

Coming in from the bright sunlight, I struggled to adjust my eyes and eventually saw him in a side room talking with another man. Gatsby introduced me: “Mr. Carraway, meet my friend Mr. Wolfshiem.”\n\nMr. Wolfshiem, a small Jewish man with a broad nose, looked at me, his nostrils adorned with impressive tufts of hair. After a moment in the dimness, I spotted his tiny eyes.\nHe began telling a story, shaking my hand firmly. “—So I just looked at him,” he said, but although he started speaking to me, he soon dropped my hand, turning his attention to Gatsby. “I handed the money to Katspaugh and told him: ‘Don’t give him a cent until he keeps quiet.’ And that’s exactly what he did.”\n\nGatsby hooked his arm through ours and directed us into the restaurant. Mr. Wolfshiem, abandoning his sentence, became lost in thought, almost as if sleepwalking.\n“Highballs?” offered the head waiter.\n“This is a fine place,” Mr. Wolfshiem observed, glancing at the decorative figures on the ceiling. “But I prefer the place across the street.”\n“Yes, highballs,” Gatsby replied, then added to Wolfshiem, “It’s too hot over there.”\n\n“Hot and cramped, yes,” Wolfshiem agreed, “but it holds a lot of memories.”\n“What place is that?” I asked.\n“The old Metropole,” he replied solemnly, “full of faces—people long gone. Full of friends who are lost forever. I’ll never be able to forget the night Rosy Rosenthal was killed there. Six of us sat together, and Rosy had been eating and drinking all evening. Near dawn, a waiter approached with a strange look and said someone wanted to see Rosy outside. ‘All right,’ Rosy said, starting to rise, but I pulled him back into his seat.\n‘Let them come in if they want you, Rosy—just don’t you step outside.’\nIt was four in the morning then, and if we’d opened the blinds daylight would have showed.”\n\n“Did he go?” I asked naively.\n“He sure did.” Mr. Wolfshiem looked at me sharply. “He turned at the door and joked, ‘Don’t let that waiter take my coffee!’ Then he stepped outside, and they shot him three times in the stomach before driving off.”\n“Four of them were executed,” I remembered aloud.\n“Five, counting Becker.” Wolfshiem looked at me with new interest. “I hear you’re after a business connection.”\n\nThe sudden shift in topic caught me off guard. But Gatsby responded quickly, “Oh, no, he’s not the person.”\n\n“No?” Wolfshiem seemed let down.\n“This is just my friend. We’ll talk about that business later.”\n\n“Sorry,” Wolfshiem said. “I made a mistake.”\n\nOur food arrived, a hearty hash, and Wolfshiem, leaving behind memories of the Metropole, began to eat with intense, almost delicate care. Meanwhile, his gaze swept slowly around the room, finishing with a glance at the people behind us. I suspect, if I hadn’t been there, he might have even looked under our own table."

Why has it all got to come through Miss Baker?”\n“Oh, it’s nothing underhand,” he assured me. “Miss Baker’s a great sportswoman, you know, and she’d never do anything that wasn’t all right.”\nSuddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up, and hurried from the room, leaving me with Mr. Wolfshiem at the table.\n“He has to telephone,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, following him with his eyes. “Fine fellow, isn’t he? Handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman.”\n“Yes.”\n“He’s an Oggsford man.”\n“Oh!”\n“He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?”\n“I’ve heard of it.”\n“It’s one of the most famous colleges in the world.”\n“Have you known Gatsby for a long time?” I inquired.\n“Several years,” he answered in a gratified way. “I made the pleasure of his acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a man of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to myself: ‘There’s the kind of man you’d like to take home and introduce to your mother and sister.’ ” He paused. “I see you’re looking at my cuff buttons.”\nI hadn’t been looking at them, but I did now. They were composed of oddly familiar pieces of ivory.\n“Finest specimens of human molars,” he informed me.\n“Well!” I inspected them. “That’s a very interesting idea.”\n“Yeah.” He flipped his sleeves up under his coat. “Yeah, Gatsby’s very careful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend’s wife.”\nWhen the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat down Mr. Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet.\n“I have enjoyed my lunch,” he said, “and I’m going to run off from you two young men before I outstay my welcome.”\n“Don’t hurry Meyer,” said Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfshiem raised his hand in a sort of benediction.\n“You’re very polite, but I belong to another generation,” he announced solemnly. “You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and your—” He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his hand. “As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won’t impose myself on you any longer.”\nAs he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling. I wondered if I had said anything to offend him.\n“He becomes very sentimental sometimes,” explained Gatsby. “This is one of his sentimental days. He’s quite a character around New York—a denizen of Broadway.”\n“Who is he, anyhow, an actor?”\n“No.”\n“A dentist?”\n“Meyer Wolfshiem? No, he’s a gambler.” Gatsby hesitated, then added, coolly: “He’s the man who fixed the World’s Series back in 1919.”\n“Fixed the World’s Series?” I repeated.\nThe idea staggered me. I remembered, of course, that the World’s Series had been fixed in 1919, but if I had thought of it at all I would have thought of it as a thing that merely happened, the end of some inevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million people—with the single-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe.\n“How did he happen to do that?” I asked after a minute.\n“He just saw the opportunity.”\n“Why isn’t he in jail?”\n“They can’t get him, old sport. He’s a smart man.”\nI insisted on paying the check. As the waiter brought my change I caught sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room.\n“Come along with me for a minute,” I said; “I’ve got to say hello to someone.”\nWhen he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our direction.\n“Where’ve you been?” he demanded eagerly. “Daisy’s furious because you haven’t called up.”\n“This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.”\nThey shook hands briefly, and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over Gatsby’s face.\n“How’ve you been, anyhow?” demanded Tom of me. “How’d you happen to come up this far to eat?”\n“I’ve been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.”\nI turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Gatsby leaned closer and said, \"Listen, old sport, I'm concerned I might have upset you slightly in the car this morning.\" He offered that smile again, but this time I resisted its charm. \"I dislike things being kept secret,\" I responded, \"and I don't get why you can't just be upfront and tell me what you want directly. Why does it all have to come through Miss Baker?\" He reassured me, \"Oh, there's nothing secretive or dishonest involved. Miss Baker is a renowned sportswoman, you know, and she would never participate in anything questionable.\" He suddenly glanced at his watch, stood up quickly, and hurried out of the room, leaving me alone at the table with Mr. Wolfshiem. \"He needs to make a call,\" Mr. Wolfshiem remarked, watching him go. \"Wonderful man, isn't he? Very good-looking and a true gentleman.\" \"Yes,\" I agreed. \"He's an Oggsford fellow.\" \"Oh!\" I said. \"He attended Oggsford College in England. You're familiar with Oggsford College?\" \"I've heard of it.\" \"It's considered one of the world's premier universities.\" I inquired, \"Have you known Gatsby for a long time?\" He answered with evident satisfaction, \"Several years. I had the pleasure of meeting him right after the war. But within an hour of talking to him, I recognized I had found a person of excellent character. I thought to myself, 'This is the sort of person you'd be happy to bring home and introduce to your mother and sister.'\" He paused. \"I see you're noticing my cuff buttons.\" I hadn't been, but I did now. They were made of curiously familiar ivory pieces. \"Finest samples of human molars,\" he informed me. \"Well!\" I examined them. \"That's a rather unique concept.\" \"Indeed,\" he replied, pulling his shirt cuffs down slightly under his jacket. \"Yes, Gatsby is exceptionally careful regarding women. He wouldn't even spare a glance for a friend's wife.\" When the subject of this innate trustworthiness returned to the table and took his seat, Mr. Wolfshiem abruptly finished his coffee and rose to his feet. \"I've thoroughly enjoyed our lunch,\" he stated, \"and I think I'll leave you two young men now before I wear out my welcome.\" \"No need to rush, Meyer,\" Gatsby said without much enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfshiem lifted his hand in a sort of blessing. \"You are very gracious, but I belong to a different era,\" he declared gravely. \"You stay here and discuss your sports, your young ladies, and your...\" He added an imaginary topic with another wave of his hand. \"As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won't intrude on your time any further.\" As he shook hands and turned away, his prominent nose was visibly trembling. I wondered if something I had said had offended him. \"He gets quite emotional sometimes,\" Gatsby explained. \"Today is one of those sentimental days for him. He's a notable figure around New York—a real Broadway character.\" \"Who exactly is he, anyway? An actor?\" \"No.\" \"A dentist?\" \"Meyer Wolfshiem? No, he's a professional gambler.\" Gatsby hesitated, then added coolly, \"He's the man responsible for fixing the World Series back in 1919.\" \"Fixed the World Series?\" I repeated, taken aback. The idea was astounding. I certainly recalled that the 1919 World Series had been rigged, but I had always thought of it as something that just happened, an inevitable outcome of circumstances. It had never occurred to me that one individual could deliberately manipulate the trust of fifty million people with the singular focus of a burglar breaking into a safe. \"How did he manage to do that?\" I asked after a moment. \"He simply recognized the opportunity.\" \"Why isn't he in prison?\" \"They can't touch him, old sport. He's too sharp.\" I insisted on paying the bill. As the waiter returned with my change, I spotted Tom Buchanan across the bustling room. \"Come with me for a second,\" I said to Gatsby; \"I need to say hello to someone.\" Seeing us, Tom immediately stood up and walked several steps toward us. \"Where have you been?\" he asked eagerly. \"Daisy is furious because you haven't called.\" \"This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.\" They shook hands briefly, and an unusual, uncomfortable look of embarrassment appeared on Gatsby's face. \"How have you been, anyway?\" Tom asked me. \"What brings you this far uptown for lunch?\" \"I was having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.\" I turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Gatsby leaned in and said, “Listen, old sport, I’m worried I upset you earlier this morning in the car.” He gave me his familiar smile, but this time I didn’t give in. I replied, “I don’t like secrets, and I wish you would just be open with me about what you want. Why does everything have to come through Miss Baker?”\n\nGatsby quickly reassured me that there was nothing suspicious going on, insisting, “Miss Baker is a great sportswoman and would never do anything improper.” Suddenly, he checked his watch, got up quickly, and left the room, leaving me with Mr. Wolfshiem at the table.\n\nMr. Wolfshiem explained, “He just needs to use the phone,” while watching Gatsby. “He’s a fine man, good-looking, and a real gentleman.”\n\nI agreed. Wolfshiem added, “He’s an Oggsford man.”\n\nI reacted with surprise, saying I’d heard of the famous English college. Wolfshiem then reminisced about meeting Gatsby just after the war and immediately feeling he was a man of quality, the kind you’d want to introduce to your own family. Then he noticed me glancing at his cuff buttons, which he revealed were made from human teeth.\n\nI examined them, saying they were quite unusual. Wolfshiem went on to say Gatsby is very dependable around women and would never be unfaithful to a friend.\n\nWhen Gatsby came back, Wolfshiem finished his coffee abruptly and said he needed to leave, not wanting to outstay his welcome. Despite Gatsby’s polite protests, Wolfshiem insisted that he belonged to an older generation and left after shaking hands. I wondered if I had offended him, but Gatsby told me Wolfshiem sometimes gets emotional and is a well-known Broadway character.\n\nI asked if Wolfshiem was an actor or a dentist. Gatsby replied he was a gambler—the one who had managed to fix the World Series in 1919. The revelation shocked me, since I’d never thought one man could manipulate something as important as the nation’s favorite sporting event.\n\nWhen I inquired why Wolfshiem wasn’t in jail, Gatsby replied he was simply too clever to be caught.\n\nI insisted on paying for lunch, and as we were about to leave, I noticed Tom Buchanan across the restaurant. I approached him with Gatsby. Tom greeted us, complaining Daisy was angry I hadn’t called, and I introduced Tom and Gatsby. They exchanged a brief, awkward handshake, with Gatsby looking uncomfortable. Tom asked about our lunch, but when I turned toward Gatsby, he had already quietly slipped away."

          "text_segment": "One October day in nineteen-seventeen—\n(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)\n—I was walking along from one place to another, half on the sidewalks and half on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on shoes from England with rubber knobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground. I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind, and whenever this happened the red, white, and blue banners in front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tut-tut-tut-tut, in a disapproving way.\nThe largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to Daisy Fay’s house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She dressed in white, and had a little white roadster, and all day long the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night. “Anyways, for an hour!”\nWhen I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside the kerb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen before. They were so engrossed in each other that she didn’t see me until I was five feet away.\n“Hello, Jordan,” she called unexpectedly. “Please come here.”\nI was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older girls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross to make bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she couldn’t come that day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since. His name was Jay Gatsby, and I didn’t lay eyes on him again for over four years—even after I’d met him on Long Island I didn’t realize it was the same man.\nThat was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a few beaux myself, and I began to play in tournaments, so I didn’t see Daisy very often. She went with a slightly older crowd—when she went with anyone at all. Wild rumours were circulating about her—how her mother had found her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas. She was effectually prevented, but she wasn’t on speaking terms with her family for several weeks. After that she didn’t play around with the soldiers any more, but only with a few flat-footed, shortsighted young men in town, who couldn’t get into the army at all.\nBy the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a début after the armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a man from New Orleans. In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago, with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He came down with a hundred people in four private cars, and hired a whole floor of the Muhlbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\nI was a bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in her flowered dress—and as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottle of Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.\n“ ’Gratulate me,” she muttered. “Never had a drink before, but oh how I do enjoy it.”\n“What’s the matter, Daisy?”\nI was scared, I can tell you; I’d never seen a girl like that before.\n“Here, dearies.” She groped around in a wastebasket she had with her on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls. “Take ’em downstairs and give ’em back to whoever they belong to. Tell ’em all Daisy’s change’ her mine. Say: ‘Daisy’s change’ her mine!’ ”\nShe began to cry—she cried and cried. I rushed out and found her mother’s maid, and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath. She wouldn’t let go of the letter. She took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up in a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the soap-dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.\nBut she didn’t say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress, and half an hour later, when we walked out of the room, the pearls were around her neck and the incident was over. Next day at five o’clock she married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver, and started off on a three months’ trip to the South Seas.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Jordan Baker recounted an event from October 1917 while sitting in the Plaza Hotel's tea-garden. She described walking through Louisville, sometimes on the sidewalk and sometimes on the grass. She preferred walking on the grass because her English-made shoes had rubber soles that gripped the soft ground. She wore a new plaid skirt that occasionally billowed in the breeze, and whenever it did, the red, white, and blue flags displayed in front of homes seemed to flutter stiffly, sounding disapprovingly. The largest lawn and accompanying flag belonged to Daisy Fay's residence. Daisy was eighteen, two years Jordan's senior, and was the most sought-after young woman in Louisville. She typically wore white, drove a small white roadster, and her phone constantly rang with eager young officers from Camp Taylor requesting to spend the evening with her, even if just for an hour. Passing Daisy's house that morning, Jordan saw the white roadster at the curb with Daisy sitting inside alongside a lieutenant Jordan didn't recognize. They were so absorbed in each other that Daisy didn't notice Jordan until she was only five feet away. To Jordan's surprise, Daisy called out, 'Hello, Jordan. Please come here.' Jordan was pleased that Daisy wanted to speak to her, as she admired Daisy more than any other older girl. Daisy asked if Jordan was going to the Red Cross to make bandages, which Jordan confirmed. Daisy then asked if Jordan would inform them that she couldn't come that day. While Daisy spoke, the officer looked at her in a way that every young woman wishes to experience, and because it felt romantic to Jordan, she never forgot the moment. The officer was named Jay Gatsby, and Jordan wouldn't see him again for more than four years, even meeting him on Long Island later without realizing he was the same person. That was in 1917. By the following year, Jordan had her own suitors and began playing golf tournaments, so she didn't see Daisy frequently. Daisy associated with an older crowd when she socialized. Rumors circulated about Daisy, including one about her mother stopping her from leaving for New York one winter night to say goodbye to a soldier deploying overseas. Although prevented, Daisy didn't speak to her family for several weeks afterward. Following this incident, she stopped dating soldiers and instead went out with local young men who were unfit for military service due to flat feet or poor eyesight. By the next autumn, Daisy was cheerful again. She had a debutante party after the armistice and was reportedly engaged to a man from New Orleans in February. In June, she married Tom Buchanan from Chicago in a ceremony more lavish than Louisville had ever witnessed. He arrived with a large entourage in private railway cars, booked an entire floor of the Muhlbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding, presented Daisy with a string of pearls worth three hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Jordan was a bridesmaid. Arriving in Daisy's room a half-hour before the bridal dinner, Jordan found Daisy lying on her bed. She looked beautiful in her flowered dress, like the June night, but was extremely intoxicated. She held a bottle of Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other. Daisy mumbled, 'Congratulate me. I've never had a drink before, but I truly enjoy this.' Jordan, scared and having never seen someone like that, asked, 'What's wrong, Daisy?' Daisy fumbled in a wastebasket on the bed and pulled out the pearls, saying, 'Here, darlings. Take these downstairs and return them to their owner. Tell everyone Daisy's changed her mind. Say: Daisy's changed her mind!' She then began to cry uncontrollably. Jordan rushed out, found Daisy's mother's maid, and together they locked the door and put Daisy in a cold bath. Daisy refused to let go of the letter, taking it into the tub and squeezing it into a wet ball. She only allowed Jordan to place it on the soap-dish when she saw it disintegrating like snow. She said nothing more. They gave her smelling salts, put ice on her forehead, and helped her back into her dress. Half an hour later, when they left the room, the pearls were around her neck, and the incident was over. The next day at five o'clock, she married Tom Buchanan without showing any nervousness and departed for a three-month honeymoon in the South Seas.",

She was wearing a new plaid skirt that fluttered in the wind, and whenever it did, the red, white, and blue flags in front of the houses seemed to flap sternly, as though disapproving. The most impressive banner and biggest lawn were at Daisy Fay's house. Daisy was eighteen, two years older than Jordan, and extremely popular among Louisville's young women. She dressed in white, owned a little white car, and her house phone rang constantly with young officers from Camp Taylor vying for her attention. One morning, when Jordan passed by, Daisy was in her car talking closely with a lieutenant Jordan didn't know. Daisy spotted Jordan and called her over, which made Jordan feel honored, as Daisy was a role model. Daisy asked if Jordan was going to help make bandages at the Red Cross, and if so, if Jordan could explain that Daisy was unable to come that day. The officer looked at Daisy in a way that seemed very romantic, making the moment unforgettable to Jordan. The officer was Jay Gatsby, but Jordan wouldn’t realize this for over four years, even after meeting Gatsby again on Long Island.\n\nIn 1918, Jordan had suitors of her own and began participating in tournaments, so she saw less of Daisy, who was now hanging out with an older crowd, if anyone at all. Rumors about Daisy abounded—one claimed her mother caught her getting ready late at night to go to New York City and say goodbye to a soldier bound for war. Daisy’s family stopped her, but she didn’t speak to them for weeks.

Daisy said she’d never had a drink before but was enjoying it now and asked Jordan to return the pearls, stammering that she’d changed her mind. Daisy started crying uncontrollably. Jordan and Daisy’s maid locked the door and put Daisy into a cold bath. Daisy clung to the letter, only letting it go when it was falling to pieces. They revived her, helped her get dressed again, and when she left the room half an hour later, she wore the pearls as if nothing had happened. The next evening, Daisy married Tom Buchanan without hesitation and left with him on a long honeymoon in the South Seas."

If he left the room for a minute she’d look around uneasily, and say: “Where’s Tom gone?” and wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the door. She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour, rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable delight. It was touching to see them together—it made you laugh in a hushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A week after I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night, and ripped a front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got into the papers, too, because her arm was broken—she was one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.\nThe next April Daisy had her little girl, and they went to France for a year. I saw them one spring in Cannes, and later in Deauville, and then they came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in Chicago, as you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation. Perhaps because she doesn’t drink. It’s a great advantage not to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue and, moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they don’t see or care. Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour at all—and yet there’s something in that voice of hers…\nWell, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first time in years. It was when I asked you—do you remember?—if you knew Gatsby in West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me up, and said: “What Gatsby?” and when I described him—I was half asleep—she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know.

If he stepped out of the room even briefly, she would look around anxiously, asking, “Where has Tom gone?” and remain distracted until she saw him re-enter. She would spend hours on the beach with his head resting in her lap, gently stroking his eyes and gazing at him with profound happiness. Witnessing their closeness was touching—it prompted a soft, intrigued chuckle. This occurred in August. A week after I left Santa Barbara, Tom was involved in an accident one night on the Ventura road, colliding with a horse-drawn wagon and tearing off one of his car's front wheels. The woman accompanying him was also reported in the newspapers because she suffered a broken arm; she was identified as a chambermaid from the Santa Barbara Hotel.\n\nThe following April, Daisy gave birth to her daughter, and they traveled to France for a year. I encountered them one spring in Cannes and later in Deauville before they returned to Chicago to settle permanently. As you know, Daisy was quite popular in Chicago. They associated with a fast-paced circle, all young, wealthy, and reckless, yet she maintained a completely flawless reputation. This was possibly because she doesn't consume alcohol. Avoiding drink is a significant advantage among heavy drinkers; it allows you to remain silent and, moreover, to time any minor missteps of your own so effectively that everyone else is too inebriated to notice or care. Perhaps Daisy never engaged in extramarital affairs at all—and yet, there is something about her voice...\n\nAbout six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby again after many years. This happened when I questioned you—do you recall?—if you knew Gatsby from West Egg. After you departed, she entered my room, awakened me, and asked, “Which Gatsby?” When I described him, despite being half-asleep, she stated in a remarkably peculiar tone that it must be the man she had known previously. It was only then that I connected this Gatsby to the military officer she was with in the white car.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I met them in Santa Barbara after they returned, and I’d never seen a woman so enamored with her husband. Whenever Tom left, Daisy grew anxious, asking where he’d gone and looked distracted until he returned. She would spend hours sitting on the beach, with Tom’s head in her lap, gently touching his eyes and gazing at him with deep joy. Watching them together was moving—it made you quietly amused and captivated. That was in August. A week after I left, Tom had a car accident on Ventura Road at night, tearing off a front wheel. The woman with him, a chambermaid from the Santa Barbara Hotel, made the news because she broke her arm. Daisy gave birth to her daughter the following April, and afterward, they spent a year in France. I saw them in Cannes one spring, later in Deauville, and then they returned to Chicago to settle down. Daisy became quite popular in Chicago, as you know. They associated with a lively group—young, wealthy, and free-spirited—but Daisy managed to keep an impeccable reputation, perhaps because she didn’t drink. Not drinking is a great asset in such company; you can be discreet and time any missteps when others are too inebriated to notice. Maybe Daisy never got involved in affairs—but still, there’s something compelling in her voice…\n\nThen, around six weeks ago, she heard Gatsby’s name for the first time in years. It happened when I asked you, do you remember, if you knew Gatsby in West Egg. After you left, she came to my room at night, woke me, and asked, “What Gatsby?” When I explained, drowsy as I was, she reacted strangely, saying it had to be a man she once knew. That was when I connected this Gatsby to the officer from her past, the one with the white car."

Realizing this, I understood that it wasn’t just the stars he longed for that June night: now Gatsby’s motivations seemed real and purposeful. Jordan went on to say that Gatsby wanted to know if I could invite Daisy over to my home one afternoon, and then allow him to come by as well. Such a humble request surprised me—he had waited five years and purchased a grand mansion, hosting lavish parties just so he might have the chance to visit Daisy at a neighbor’s house. I wondered if it was really necessary for me to know everything before Gatsby could ask such a simple favor. Jordan explained that Gatsby was nervous after waiting so long, and feared I might be offended; she assured me that beneath it all, Gatsby was quite tough. I was troubled by something, so I asked why Gatsby hadn’t asked Jordan to arrange a meeting herself. Jordan replied that Gatsby wanted Daisy to see his house, as mine was right next door. She suggested that perhaps Gatsby had once hoped Daisy would come to one of his parties, but since she never did, he started asking around if anyone knew her — Jordan was the first person he found. She recalled how Gatsby had summoned her at his party and indirectly worked up to asking her help. Jordan had even suggested a lunch in New York, but Gatsby resisted, insisting he didn’t want to do anything unusual; he wanted Daisy to visit somewhere right next door. When Jordan mentioned that I was a close friend of Tom’s, Gatsby considered abandoning the plan, since he apparently knew little of Tom, though he claimed to have followed Chicago newspapers for years, hoping to spot Daisy’s name."

Two o’clock and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light, which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a corner, I saw that it was Gatsby’s house, lit from tower to cellar.\nAt first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved itself into “hide-and-go-seek” or “sardines-in-the-box” with all the house thrown open to the game. But there wasn’t a sound. Only wind in the trees, which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned away I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.\n“Your place looks like the World’s Fair,” I said.\n“Does it?” He turned his eyes toward it absently. “I have been glancing into some of the rooms. Let’s go to Coney Island, old sport. In my car.”\n“It’s too late.”\n“Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven’t made use of it all summer.”\n“I’ve got to go to bed.”\n“All right.”\nHe waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.\n“I talked with Miss Baker,” I said after a moment. “I’m going to call up Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea.”\n“Oh, that’s all right,” he said carelessly. “I don’t want to put you to any trouble.”\n“What day would suit you?”\n“What day would suit you?” he corrected me quickly. “I don’t want to put you to any trouble, you see.”\n“How about the day after tomorrow?”\nHe considered for a moment. Then, with reluctance: “I want to get the grass cut,” he said.\nWe both looked down at the grass—there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began. I suspected that he meant my grass.\n“There’s another little thing,” he said uncertainly, and hesitated.\n“Would you rather put it off for a few days?” I asked.\n“Oh, it isn’t about that. At least—” He fumbled with a series of beginnings. “Why, I thought—why, look here, old sport, you don’t make much money, do you?”\n“Not very much.”\nThis seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently.\n“I thought you didn’t, if you’ll pardon my—you see, I carry on a little business on the side, a sort of side line, you understand. And I thought that if you don’t make very much—You’re selling bonds, aren’t you, old sport?”\n“Trying to.”\n“Well, this would interest you. It wouldn’t take up much of your time and you might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing.”\nI realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might have been one of the crises of my life. But, because the offer was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no choice except to cut him off there.\n“I’ve got my hands full,” I said. “I’m much obliged but I couldn’t take on any more work.”\n“You wouldn’t have to do any business with Wolfshiem.” Evidently he thought that I was shying away from the “gonnegtion” mentioned at lunch, but I assured him he was wrong. He waited a moment longer, hoping I’d begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he went unwillingly home.\nThe evening had made me lightheaded and happy; I think I walked into a deep sleep as I entered my front door. So I don’t know whether or not Gatsby went to Coney Island, or for how many hours he “glanced into rooms” while his house blazed gaudily on.",

As I turned a corner, I realized it was Gatsby’s house, lit up from top to bottom.\n\nAt first, I assumed it must be another one of his extravagant parties and thought perhaps people were playing games throughout the house. But it was silent; the only sound was the wind rustling the trees and making the lights flicker on and off, as if the house was blinking in the darkness. As my taxi departed, I saw Gatsby walking across his lawn toward me.\n\n\"Your house looks like the World’s Fair,\" I remarked.\n\n\"Does it?\" he replied absentmindedly, glancing at the house. \"I’ve just been looking into some of the rooms. Why don’t we go to Coney Island, old sport? In my car.\"\n\n\"It’s too late for that.\"\n\n\"Then how about a swim in the pool? I haven’t used it all summer.\"\n\n\"I need to get some sleep.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\nHe lingered, appearing eager but holding back.\n\n\"I spoke with Miss Baker,\" I eventually said. \"I’ll call Daisy tomorrow and ask her over for tea.\"\n\n\"That’s fine,\" he replied nonchalantly. \"I don’t want to trouble you.\"\n\n\"Which day works for you?\"\n\nHe quickly replied, \"Which day works for you? I really don’t want to put you out, you know.\"\n\n\"How about the day after tomorrow?\"\n\nHe thought for a bit and then said, reluctantly, \"I should get the grass cut.\"\n\nWe both looked down at the lawn. There was a clear, sharp line where my patchy grass stopped and Gatsby’s lush lawn began. I had a feeling he meant he wanted my grass cut.\n\n\"There’s another small thing,\" he said, hesitating.\n\n\"Would you prefer to wait a few days?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, it’s not that. At least—\" He fumbled for words. \"Well, old sport, you don’t earn a lot, do you?\"\n\n\"Not very much.\"\n\nHe seemed comforted by this and continued, more assuredly.\n\n\"I thought as much. If you don’t mind my mentioning it—I have a bit of a side business, nothing too big, you understand. I thought that since you don’t earn much—and you’re selling bonds, right, old sport?\"\n\n\"I’m trying to.\"\n\n\"Well, you might find this interesting. It wouldn’t take much of your time and could make you some decent money. The job is rather confidential.\"\n\nI realize now that in another setting, this conversation could have been a turning point in my life. But since it was obviously an awkward offer in exchange for a favor, I felt compelled to decline.\n\n\"I’m already busy,\" I told him. \"I appreciate it, but I can’t take on anything else.\"\n\n\"You wouldn’t have to deal with Wolfshiem.\" He clearly thought I was hesitant because of the connection mentioned over lunch, but I told him that wasn’t the case. He waited a bit, hoping I would start talking again, but I was too distracted, and he eventually left for home, disappointed.\n\nThe events of the evening had left me dizzy but happy; I probably drifted into deep sleep as soon as I got inside. I’m still not sure if Gatsby actually went to Coney Island, or how long he continued wandering through his brilliantly illuminated house."

At eleven o’clock a man in a raincoat, dragging a lawn-mower, tapped at my front door and said that Mr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass. This reminded me that I had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back, so I drove into West Egg Village to search for her among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buy some cups and lemons and flowers.\nThe flowers were unnecessary, for at two o’clock a greenhouse arrived from Gatsby’s, with innumerable receptacles to contain it. An hour later the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold-coloured tie, hurried in. He was pale, and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes.\n“Is everything all right?” he asked immediately.\n“The grass looks fine, if that’s what you mean.”\n“What grass?” he inquired blankly. “Oh, the grass in the yard.” He looked out the window at it, but, judging from his expression, I don’t believe he saw a thing.\n“Looks very good,” he remarked vaguely. “One of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four. I think it was The Journal. Have you got everything you need in the shape of—of tea?”\nI took him into the pantry, where he looked a little reproachfully at the Finn. Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen shop.\n“Will they do?” I asked.\n“Of course, of course! They’re fine!” and he added hollowly, “… old sport.”\nThe rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist, through which occasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyes through a copy of Clay’s Economics, starting at the Finnish tread that shook the kitchen floor, and peering towards the bleared windows from time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking place outside. Finally he got up and informed me, in an uncertain voice, that he was going home.\n“Why’s that?”\n“Nobody’s coming to tea. It’s too late!” He looked at his watch as if there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere. “I can’t wait all day.”\n“Don’t be silly; it’s just two minutes to four.”",

She responded, \"What?\" I repeated, \"Don't bring Tom.\" \"Who are you referring to as 'Tom'?\" she asked with assumed innocence. The appointed day was marked by heavy rain. Around eleven in the morning, a person in a raincoat, pulling a lawnmower, knocked on my door and informed me he had been sent by Mr. Gatsby to mow my lawn. This made me realize I hadn't told my Finnish maid to return, so I drove to West Egg Village to search for her among the wet, white-painted lanes and also to purchase some tea cups, lemons, and flowers. The flowers turned out to be unnecessary, as a large delivery, resembling a greenhouse, arrived from Gatsby's at two o'clock, complete with numerous containers for the plants. An hour later, the front door opened tentatively, and Gatsby rushed in, wearing a white flannel suit, a silver shirt, and a gold tie. He appeared pale, with dark circles indicating a lack of sleep under his eyes. \"Is everything satisfactory?\" he immediately inquired. \"The lawn looks good, if that's what you're asking,\" I replied. \"Which lawn?\" he asked blankly. \"Oh, the lawn outside.\" He glanced through the window at it, but his expression suggested he didn't truly see anything. \"It looks quite nice,\" he commented vaguely. \"One of the newspapers mentioned they anticipated the rain would stop around four. I think it was The Journal. Have you arranged for everything needed for—for tea?\" I led him into the pantry, where he cast a slightly disapproving look at the maid. Together, we examined the twelve lemon cakes from the deli. \"Will these be adequate?\" I asked. \"Certainly, certainly! They're perfect!\" and he added in a strained tone, \"...old sport.\" The rain eased into a damp mist around half-past three, with occasional sparse drops appearing like dew. Gatsby stared vacantly at a copy of Clay's Economics, flinching at the maid's footsteps that vibrated the kitchen floor, and periodically peering towards the fogged windows as if unsettling, unseen events were occurring outside. Eventually, he stood up and announced, in an shaky voice, that he was leaving for home. \"Why is that?\" I asked. \"No one is arriving for tea. It's too late!\" He consulted his watch as though he had an urgent appointment elsewhere. \"I cannot spend the entire day waiting.\" \"Don't be absurd; it's only two minutes before four.\"",

I needn’t have bought flowers, since at two o’clock a whole greenhouse full arrived from Gatsby in countless containers. An hour later, Gatsby arrived, looking anxious in a white suit, silver shirt, and gold tie. He seemed pale and tired, with dark circles under his eyes. He immediately asked if everything was ready. I replied about the lawn, though he seemed unaware of its significance at first and then absent-mindedly said it looked good. He mentioned that one of the papers predicted the rain would stop by four and asked if I had everything needed for tea. I took him to the pantry, where he looked reproachfully at the Finn, and together we inspected a dozen lemon cakes I’d bought. I asked if they were acceptable and he assured me they were, though not very enthusiastically. By half-past three, the rain had lessened to a mist with a few drops now and then. Gatsby distractedly flipped through a book, listened to the Finn moving around, and kept glancing nervously at the cloudy windows. Eventually, he stood up and uncertainly said he was leaving because no one was coming for tea and it was too late. He checked his watch, implying he was needed elsewhere and couldn’t wait any longer.

Daisy’s face, tipped sideways beneath a three-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic smile.\n“Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?”\nThe exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I had to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone, before any words came through. A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek, and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car.\n“Are you in love with me,” she said low in my ear, “or why did I have to come alone?”\n“That’s the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go far away and spend an hour.”\n“Come back in an hour, Ferdie.” Then in a grave murmur: “His name is Ferdie.”\n“Does the gasoline affect his nose?”\n“I don’t think so,” she said innocently. “Why?”\nWe went in. To my overwhelming surprise the living-room was deserted.\n“Well, that’s funny,” I exclaimed.\n“What’s funny?”\nShe turned her head as there was a light dignified knocking at the front door.

His eyes glanced momentarily at me, and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh. Luckily the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his head, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers, and set it back in place. Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of the sofa and his chin in his hand.\n“I’m sorry about the clock,” he said.\nMy own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn. I couldn’t muster up a single commonplace out of the thousand in my head.\n“It’s an old clock,” I told them idiotically.\nI think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on the floor.\n“We haven’t met for many years,” said Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact as it could ever be.\n“Five years next November.”\nThe automatic quality of Gatsby’s answer set us all back at least another minute.",

We both sprang to our feet. Feeling a bit rattled myself, I went out into the yard.  A large open car was driving up the path under the soaking, bare lilac trees. It stopped. Daisy’s face, tilted sideways beneath a three-cornered lavender hat, peered out at me with a radiant, joyful smile.  “Is this absolutely where you make your home, my dearest one?”  The thrilling energy of her voice was a wild remedy against the rain. I had to simply follow the sound of it with my ear for a moment, letting it wash over me, before the actual words registered. A damp strand of hair lay across her cheek like a smear of blue paint, and her hand was wet with sparkling drops as I took it to help her alight from the car.  “Are you enamored with me,” she whispered close to my ear, “or why was I required to come here by myself?”  “That’s the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your driver to go far off and occupy himself for an hour.”  “Return in sixty minutes, Ferdie.” Then, in a solemn undertone: “His name is Ferdie.”  “Does the petrol smell affect his nose?”  “I don’t believe so,” she replied innocently. “Why do you ask?”  We entered the house. To my immense surprise, the living room was deserted.  “Well, that’s peculiar,” I exclaimed.  “What’s peculiar?”  She turned her head as a soft, polite knocking sounded at the front door. I went to open it. Gatsby, deathly pale, his hands shoved deep like weights in his coat pockets, stood in a puddle, staring intensely and tragically into my eyes.  With his hands still buried in his coat pockets, he strode past me into the hall, spun around sharply as if on a wire, and disappeared into the living room. It wasn't funny anymore. Aware of the loud thumping of my own heart, I pulled the door shut against the increasing downpour.  For half a minute, there was absolute silence. Then, from the living room, I heard a kind of muffled, choked sound and a brief laugh, followed by Daisy’s voice speaking in a clear, forced tone:  “I am certainly extremely happy to see you again.”  A pause followed; it lingered unbearably. I had nothing to do in the hall, so I entered the room.  Gatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was leaning against the mantelpiece, attempting an awkward imitation of complete relaxation, even indifference. His head was tilted so far back it rested against the face of a broken mantel clock, and from this position, his troubled eyes gazed down at Daisy, who was perched, looking scared but still graceful, on the edge of a stiff chair.  “We’ve met before,” Gatsby mumbled. His eyes flickered briefly at me, and his lips parted in a failed attempt at a laugh. Luckily, at that moment, the clock tilted dangerously under the pressure of his head. He turned and caught it with trembling fingers, then put it back in place. He then sat down stiffly, with his elbow on the sofa arm and his chin in his hand.  “I apologize about the clock,” he said.  My own face had now turned a deep red. I couldn’t summon up a single normal comment from the countless thoughts in my head.  “It’s an old clock,” I told them foolishly.  I think for a moment we all believed it had smashed into pieces on the floor.  “We haven’t seen each other for many years,” said Daisy, her voice as plain and factual as possible.  “Five years next November.”  The automatic way Gatsby answered made the awkwardness hang in the air for at least another minute for all of us.",

Daisy leaned out, her head tilted under a lavender hat, and gave me a radiant, joyful smile. \n\n\"Is this really where you live, darling?\" she asked. Her lively, vibrant voice lifted my spirits in the gloomy weather. For an instant, I focused only on the sound before understanding her words. Her damp hair streaked across her cheek like blue paint, and her hand was wet as I helped her out of the car. \n\nQuietly in my ear, she asked, \"Do you love me, or why did you make me come here alone?\"\n\nI replied, \"That’s Castle Rackrent’s secret. Ask your driver to leave for an hour.\"\n\nShe instructed, \"Come back in an hour, Ferdie,\" then added softly, \"His name’s Ferdie.\"\n\n\"Does gasoline bother his nose?\" I asked.\n\n\"I don’t think so,\" she answered innocently. \"Why?\"\n\nWe entered the house, and to my surprise, found the living room empty.\n\n\"Well, that’s odd,\" I said.\n\n\"What’s odd?\" she replied, just as there was a quiet, dignified knock at the front door.

My heart pounded loudly as I shut the door against the increasing rain.\n\nFor about thirty seconds, everything was silent. Then, I heard a shaky sound and part of a laugh from the living room, quickly followed by Daisy’s voice, bright but obviously forced: \"I really am very happy to see you again.\"\n\nA tense silence followed, drawing out the discomfort. With nothing to do in the hallway, I entered the room. Gatsby still had his hands in his pockets and was leaning against the mantel in a strained imitation of ease—almost as if bored.

Gatsby got himself into a shadow and, while Daisy and I talked, looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with tense, unhappy eyes. However, as calmness wasn’t an end in itself, I made an excuse at the first possible moment, and got to my feet.\n“Where are you going?” demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm.\n“I’ll be back.”\n“I’ve got to speak to you about something before you go.”\nHe followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door, and whispered: “Oh, God!” in a miserable way.\n“What’s the matter?”\n“This is a terrible mistake,” he said, shaking his head from side to side, “a terrible, terrible mistake.”\n“You’re just embarrassed, that’s all,” and luckily I added: “Daisy’s embarrassed too.”\n“She’s embarrassed?” he repeated incredulously.\n“Just as much as you are.”\n“Don’t talk so loud.”\n“You’re acting like a little boy,” I broke out impatiently. “Not only that, but you’re rude. Daisy’s sitting in there all alone.”\nHe raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable reproach, and, opening the door cautiously, went back into the other room.\nI walked out the back way—just as Gatsby had when he had made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour before—and ran for a huge black knotted tree, whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain. Once more it was pouring, and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by Gatsby’s gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric marshes. There was nothing to look at from under the tree except Gatsby’s enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church steeple, for half an hour. A brewer had built it early in the “period” craze, a decade before, and there was a story that he’d agreed to pay five years’ taxes on all the neighbouring cottages if the owners would have their roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their refusal took the heart out of his plan to Found a Family—he went into an immediate decline. His children sold his house with the black wreath still on the door. Americans, while willing, even eager, to be serfs, have always been obstinate about being peasantry.\nAfter half an hour, the sun shone again, and the grocer’s automobile rounded Gatsby’s drive with the raw material for his servants’ dinner—I felt sure he wouldn’t eat a spoonful. A maid began opening the upper windows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and, leaning from the large central bay, spat meditatively into the garden. It was time I went back. While the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and swelling a little now and then with gusts of emotion. But in the new silence I felt that silence had fallen within the house too.\nI went in—after making every possible noise in the kitchen, short of pushing over the stove—but I don’t believe they heard a sound. They were sitting at either end of the couch, looking at each other as if some question had been asked, or was in the air, and every vestige of embarrassment was gone. Daisy’s face was smeared with tears, and when I came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before a mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply confounding. He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little room.\n“Oh, hello, old sport,” he said, as if he hadn’t seen me for years. I thought for a moment he was going to shake hands.\n“It’s stopped raining.”\n“Has it?” When he realized what I was talking about, that there were twinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man, like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to Daisy. “What do you think of that? It’s stopped raining.”\n“I’m glad, Jay.” Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told only of her unexpected joy.\n“I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,” he said, “I’d like to show her around.”\n“You’re sure you want me to come?”\n“Absolutely, old sport.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "To break the awkwardness, I desperately proposed that Daisy and Gatsby help me make tea in the kitchen. Just as we were about to, the servant, who seemed somewhat wild, brought the tea in on a tray. The arrival of cups and cakes provided a welcome distraction, creating a sense of physical ease. Gatsby moved into a corner, and while Daisy and I chatted, he watched us intently and unhappily. However, since just being calm wasn't enough, I found the earliest chance to make an excuse and stand up. Gatsby, instantly alarmed, demanded, 'Where are you going?' I said I'd return. He insisted, 'I’ve got to speak to you about something before you go.' He followed me hastily into the kitchen, shut the door, and whispered a despairing 'Oh, God!' I asked what was wrong. Shaking his head, he declared, 'This is a terrible mistake,' repeating, 'a terrible, terrible mistake.' I told him he was merely feeling awkward, adding fortunately, 'Daisy’s embarrassed too.' He repeated, sounding surprised, 'She’s embarrassed?' I confirmed, 'Just as much as you are.' He cautioned me to speak softly. Impatiently, I burst out, 'You’re behaving like a child! Not only that, but you're rude. Daisy is sitting alone in there.' He raised his hand to stop me, gave me a look of unforgettable reproach, then cautiously opened the door and returned to the other room. I exited through the back door, just as Gatsby had done earlier during his nervous pacing around the house, and ran toward a massive, dark, gnarled tree whose thick leaves formed a barrier against the rain. It was pouring again, and my lawn, recently mown by Gatsby’s gardener, was dotted with small muddy pools and ancient-looking marshy spots. The only thing visible from under the tree was Gatsby's immense house, so I gazed at it for half an hour, like Kant contemplating his church steeple. A brewer had constructed it about a decade prior during the trend for period architecture, and there was a story that he offered to cover five years of taxes for nearby cottages if their owners would thatch their roofs with straw. Perhaps their refusal dampened his ambition to establish a lasting family legacy; he quickly went into decline. His children sold the house with a black wreath still on the door. Americans, while often willing, even eager, to be subordinate, have always been stubborn about being peasants. After half an hour, the sun emerged again, and the grocer's car pulled up Gatsby's driveway with supplies for his servants' dinner—I was certain he wouldn't eat any of it. A maid started opening the upper windows of the house, appearing briefly in each, and leaning out of the large central bay window, she spat thoughtfully into the garden. It was time for me to go back inside. While the rain had lasted, it had seemed like the soft sound of their voices, occasionally rising and falling with bursts of feeling. But in the new quiet, I sensed that silence had also settled within the house. I went in, making as much noise as possible in the kitchen, short of knocking over the stove, but I don't think they heard me. They were seated at opposite ends of the sofa, gazing at each other as if a question had been posed or was pending, and all signs of embarrassment had vanished. Daisy’s face was wet with tears, and when I entered, she quickly stood up and began drying her face with her handkerchief in front of a mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby that was truly astonishing. He literally seemed to glow; without saying a word or making any triumphant gesture, a new sense of well-being radiated from him, filling the small room. 'Oh, hello, old sport,' he greeted me, as if he hadn't seen me in years. For a moment, I expected him to offer a handshake. I remarked, 'It’s stopped raining.' 'Has it?' he asked. When he grasped what I meant, that rays of sunshine were now visible in the room, he smiled broadly, like a weather forecaster, like someone overjoyed by the return of light, and relayed the news to Daisy. 'What do you think of that? It’s stopped raining.' 'I’m glad, Jay,' she replied. Her voice, full of sorrowful yet beautiful emotion, conveyed only her unexpected happiness. 'I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,' he said. 'I’d like to show her around.' I asked, 'Are you sure you want me to come?' 'Absolutely, old sport,' he confirmed.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I quickly suggested to both of them that they help me prepare tea in the kitchen, but right then the intense Finn servant brought it out on a tray. Amidst the lively bustle of cups and pastries, a sense of basic decorum appeared. Gatsby retreated into a darker corner and, as Daisy and I chatted, anxiously watched each of us with tense, troubled eyes. But since calmness wasn’t the main goal, I found an excuse as soon as I could and stood up. Gatsby instantly sounded worried, asking where I was going. I told him I’d be back, but he insisted we speak before I left. He hurried after me into the kitchen, closed the door, and whispered miserably, \"Oh, God!\" When I asked what was wrong, he said, \"This is a terrible mistake,\" shaking his head repeatedly. I told him he was just embarrassed, and assured him Daisy was just as uncomfortable. He repeated that incredulously, asking me not to speak so loudly. Irritated, I accused him of acting childishly and being rude, pointing out that Daisy was alone in the next room. He gestured for me to stop, gave me a look I couldn’t forget, and cautiously went back out. I left by the back door—just like Gatsby had in his anxious walk earlier—and ran to a huge old tree, sheltering under its thick leaves from the rain. The downpour continued, turning my carefully kept lawn into muddy puddles. I gazed at Gatsby’s huge house—there was little else to see—much like Kant would contemplate his church steeple, and stood there for half an hour. The house had been built a decade earlier by a brewer who, according to rumor, offered to pay five years of taxes for the neighboring homes if their owners would thatch their roofs, but they refused. Perhaps that rejection discouraged his ambitions to start a grand family. He soon fell into decline, his children eventually selling the house, which still had a mourning wreath on its door. Americans, though eager to serve, have always been resistant to peasant-like status. After a while, the sun came out, and the grocer’s car arrived with food for Gatsby’s servants—I doubted Gatsby would eat any of it. A maid opened the house’s upstairs windows, pausing at each, and at one point spit thoughtfully into the garden below. I realized it was time to go back inside. While the rain fell, their voices had seemed to blend in with its sound, but now, in the quiet, I felt peace had settled over the house too. I returned—making as much noise as possible in the kitchen without causing real damage—but I doubt they noticed. They were sitting at opposite ends of the couch, looking at each other as if silently questioning one another, all their former awkwardness gone. Daisy’s face was streaked with tears, and she quickly wiped her face when I entered. But what amazed me was the transformation in Gatsby—he seemed to be practically glowing with happiness, changed beyond recognition, his contentment filling the room. \"Oh, hello, old sport,\" he greeted me warmly, as if we hadn’t seen each other in years. For a moment I thought he’d offer to shake hands. I remarked the rain had stopped. \"Has it?\" he replied, then seeing the sunshine in the room, smiled joyfully and told Daisy. \"Isn’t it something? It’s stopped raining.\" Daisy replied, her voice full of bittersweet emotion, \"I’m glad, Jay.\" Gatsby then invited both of us to his house to show Daisy around. I asked if he was sure he wanted me to come, and he enthusiastically confirmed, \"Absolutely, old sport.\""

          "text_segment": "Daisy went upstairs to wash her face—too late I thought with humiliation of my towels—while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn.\n“My house looks well, doesn’t it?” he demanded. “See how the whole front of it catches the light.”\nI agreed that it was splendid.\n“Yes.” His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower. “It took me just three years to earn the money that bought it.”\n“I thought you inherited your money.”\n“I did, old sport,” he said automatically, “but I lost most of it in the big panic—the panic of the war.”\nI think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what business he was in he answered: “That’s my affair,” before he realized that it wasn’t an appropriate reply.\n“Oh, I’ve been in several things,” he corrected himself. “I was in the drug business and then I was in the oil business. But I’m not in either one now.” He looked at me with more attention. “Do you mean you’ve been thinking over what I proposed the other night?”\nBefore I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight.\n“That huge place there?” she cried pointing.\n“Do you like it?”\n“I love it, but I don’t see how you live there all alone.”\n“I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People who do interesting things. Celebrated people.”\nInstead of taking the shortcut along the Sound we went down to the road and entered by the big postern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the gardens, the sparkling odour of jonquils and the frothy odour of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odour of kiss-me-at-the-gate. It was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but bird voices in the trees.\nAnd inside, as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music-rooms and Restoration Salons, I felt that there were guests concealed behind every couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through. As Gatsby closed the door of “the Merton College Library” I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into ghostly laughter.\nWe went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing-rooms and poolrooms, and bathrooms with sunken baths—intruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pyjamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. It was Mr. Klipspringer, the “boarder.” I had seen him wandering hungrily about the beach that morning. Finally we came to Gatsby’s own apartment, a bedroom and a bath, and an Adam’s study, where we sat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall.\nHe hadn’t once ceased looking at Daisy, and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes. Sometimes too, he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way, as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer real. Once he nearly toppled down a flight of stairs.\nHis bedroom was the simplest room of all—except where the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush with delight, and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and began to laugh.\n“It’s the funniest thing, old sport,” he said hilariously. “I can’t—When I try to—”\nHe had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third. After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder at her presence. He had been full of the idea so long, dreamed it right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to speak, at an inconceivable pitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction, he was running down like an over-wound clock.\nRecovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and his shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high.\n“I’ve got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.”\nHe took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one, before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel, which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in many-coloured disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher—shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange, with monograms of indian blue. Suddenly, with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily.\n“They’re such beautiful shirts,” she sobbed, her voice muffled in the thick folds. “It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such—such beautiful shirts before.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Daisy excused herself to go upstairs and freshen up, which I felt was a bit late given the state of my towels, causing me some embarrassment. While she was gone, Gatsby and I waited on the lawn. Gatsby prompted, 'My house looks impressive, doesn't it?' adding, 'Notice how the entire front section catches the sunlight.' I agreed, saying it was magnificent. 'Yes,' he responded, his gaze sweeping across the building, taking in every arched entryway and square tower. He then stated, 'It took me precisely three years to earn the funds I used to purchase it.' I commented that I believed he had inherited his wealth. 'I did, old sport,' he replied almost automatically, 'but I lost a large portion of it during the major financial downturn—the one that happened during the war.' I suspect he was hardly aware of what he was saying, because when I inquired about his current profession, he initially answered, 'That's personal,' before realizing the response was inappropriate. He quickly corrected himself, saying, 'Oh, I've been involved in several ventures. I was in the pharmaceutical industry, and then I was in the petroleum industry. But I'm not currently active in either one.' He then looked at me more intently and asked, 'Are you suggesting you've been considering what I suggested the other evening?' Before I could reply, Daisy reappeared from the house, the twin rows of brass buttons on her dress glinting in the sunshine. Pointing, she exclaimed, 'That enormous estate over there?' Gatsby asked, 'Do you like it?' She replied, 'I adore it, but I don't understand how you manage to live there completely alone.' He explained, 'I always keep it populated with fascinating individuals, day and night. People who do remarkable things. Well-known people.' Instead of following the direct path along the Sound, we took the lower road and entered through the substantial back gate. With delightful exclamations, Daisy expressed her admiration for various aspects of the fortress-like shape silhouetted against the sky, the meticulously kept gardens, the vibrant scent of jonquils, the airy fragrance of hawthorn and plum blossoms, and the gentle golden aroma of kiss-me-at-the-gate. It felt odd to reach the marble steps and find no activity, no movement of brightly dressed figures entering or exiting, and to hear nothing but the sounds of birds in the trees. Inside, as we meandered through rooms decorated in the style of Marie Antoinette's era and drawing-rooms from the Restoration period, I had the distinct impression that guests were hidden behind every piece of furniture, instructed to remain perfectly silent until we had moved on. When Gatsby closed the door of what he called 'the Merton College Library,' I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man let out a faint, ghost-like laugh. We ascended the stairs, passing through bedrooms decorated in period style, draped in rose and lavender silks and filled with fresh, vibrant flowers, through dressing areas, game rooms, and bathrooms featuring sunken tubs—even stumbling into one room where a rumpled man in pyjamas was performing liver exercises on the floor. This was Mr. Klipspringer, identified as the 'boarder.' I had seen him earlier that morning wandering the beach looking hungry. Finally, we reached Gatsby's private living space, comprising a bedroom, a bathroom, and a study designed in the Adam style, where we settled down and had a drink of some Chartreuse that he retrieved from a built-in cabinet. He hadn't stopped gazing at Daisy for a moment, and I sensed that he was re-evaluating everything in his mansion based on the reaction it elicited from her beloved eyes. At times, he also stared around at his possessions in a bewildered manner, as if in her actual and astonishing presence, none of it felt real anymore. He nearly fell down a staircase at one point. His bedroom was the simplest room in the suite, with the exception of the dresser, which was adorned with a set of pure, matte gold toiletries. Daisy picked up the brush with evident pleasure and smoothed her hair, causing Gatsby to sit down, shade his eyes, and begin laughing uncontrollably. 'It's the most hilarious thing, old sport,' he chuckled loudly. 'I just can't—When I try to—' He had clearly gone through two distinct emotional states and was entering a third. Following his initial embarrassment and subsequent irrational joy, he was now overwhelmed with amazement at her being there. He had held this idea in his mind for so long, envisioned it down to the smallest detail, waited with intense, almost unbearable anticipation. Now, in the aftermath, he was winding down like a clock that had been excessively tightened. After a minute, he composed himself and opened two large, heavy cabinets containing his vast collection of suits, dressing gowns, ties, and shirts, which were stacked neatly like bricks a dozen high. 'I have a tailor in England who purchases clothing for me,' he explained. 'He sends me a selection of items at the start of each season, spring and autumn.' He pulled out a stack of shirts and began tossing them, one by one, towards us—shirts made of sheer linen, thick silk, and fine flannel. They lost their creases as they fell, covering the table in a colourful mess. As we admired them, he brought out more, and the soft, luxurious pile grew higher—shirts with stripes, intricate patterns, and plaids in shades of coral, apple-green, lavender, and pale orange, each featuring monograms in Indian blue. Suddenly, with a choked sound, Daisy buried her face in the pile of shirts and began to weep uncontrollably. 'They are such exquisite shirts,' she sobbed, her voice muffled by the thick layers. 'It makes me sad because I have never seen such—such beautiful shirts before.'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Daisy went upstairs to freshen up, and I found myself feeling embarrassed about the towels she would use, while Gatsby and I stayed outside on the grass. Gatsby asked if his house looked impressive, pointing out how the entire front gleamed in the sunlight. I told him it looked magnificent. Gatsby, scanning the house's doors and towers, remarked that it had taken him only three years to make the money to buy it. When I commented that I thought he had inherited his wealth, he replied that he had, but lost most of it during the economic turmoil caused by the war. He seemed unsure of himself, and when I asked what line of business he was in, he gave a dismissive answer, then corrected himself by saying he had worked in the drug and oil industries, but wasn't involved with them any longer. Then, focusing on me, he asked if I had considered his proposal from the other night. Before I could answer, Daisy reappeared, her dress gleaming in the sunlight. She pointed at the huge mansion and exclaimed in amazement. When Gatsby asked her if she liked it, she said she loved it but didn't know how he could live there by himself. Gatsby explained he always filled it with fascinating and famous people, keeping it lively night and day.\n\nInstead of taking a shortcut by the water, we walked along the road and came in through the large gate. Daisy was enchanted by every view of the grand house, its gardens, and the fragrant, blooming flowers. It felt strange reaching the marble steps and finding the house quiet and empty, with only the sounds of birds in the trees.\n\nInside, as we wandered through lavish music rooms and salons styled after French royalty, it seemed as though party guests might be secretly hiding, waiting for us to pass. I thought I heard a ghostly laugh from the owl-eyed man as Gatsby closed the library door. We proceeded upstairs, passing elegant bedrooms decorated with silk and fresh flowers, dressing-rooms, poolrooms, and luxurious bathrooms. We even came upon Mr. Klipspringer, the houseguest, exercising awkwardly in his pajamas. Eventually, we reached Gatsby’s private rooms, where we sat and had a drink of Chartreuse.\n\nThroughout all this, Gatsby couldn't take his eyes off Daisy, looking at his possessions as if measuring their worth by her reaction. He seemed dazed, as though Daisy's presence made everything surreal. At one point, he almost tumbled down some stairs. His bedroom was the simplest in the house, except for a fancy gold toilet set. Daisy delightedly took a brush and began to fix her hair, prompting Gatsby to laugh and confess his overwhelming emotions. He had dreamed so long of this moment that now, with Daisy actually there, he was left almost stunned, like a wound-up clock winding down.\n\nRegaining his composure, Gatsby opened up two large cabinets brimming with suits, dressing gowns, ties, and shirts stacked high. He explained that he had someone in England buy him clothes every season. He began tossing out shirts of every fine fabric and color until they formed a large, beautiful pile on the table. Overcome with emotion, Daisy buried her face in the shirts and began to cry, saying their beauty made her sad, as she had never seen such exquisite shirts before."

Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star to the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one.\nI began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects in the half darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.\n“Who’s this?”\n“That? That’s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.”\nThe name sounded faintly familiar.\n“He’s dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.”\nThere was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the bureau—Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly—taken apparently when he was about eighteen.\n“I adore it,” exclaimed Daisy. “The pompadour! You never told me you had a pompadour—or a yacht.”\n“Look at this,” said Gatsby quickly. “Here’s a lot of clippings—about you.”\nThey stood side by side examining it. I was going to ask to see the rubies when the phone rang, and Gatsby took up the receiver.\n“Yes… Well, I can’t talk now… I can’t talk now, old sport… I said a small town… He must know what a small town is… Well, he’s no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small town…”\nHe rang off.\n“Come here quick!” cried Daisy at the window.\nThe rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west, and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.\n“Look at that,” she whispered, and then after a moment: “I’d like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around.”\nI tried to go then, but they wouldn’t hear of it; perhaps my presence made them feel more satisfactorily alone.\n“I know what we’ll do,” said Gatsby, “we’ll have Klipspringer play the piano.”\nHe went out of the room calling “Ewing!” and returned in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man, with shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blond hair. He was now decently clothed in a “sport shirt,” open at the neck, sneakers, and duck trousers of a nebulous hue.\n“Did we interrupt your exercise?” inquired Daisy politely.\n“I was asleep,” cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment. “That is, I’d been asleep. Then I got up…”\n“Klipspringer plays the piano,” said Gatsby, cutting him off. “Don’t you, Ewing, old sport?”\n“I don’t play well. I don’t—hardly play at all. I’m all out of prac—”\n“We’ll go downstairs,” interrupted Gatsby. He flipped a switch. The grey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light.\nIn the music-room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano. He lit Daisy’s cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her on a couch far across the room, where there was no light save what the gleaming floor bounced in from the hall.\nWhen Klipspringer had played “The Love Nest” he turned around on the bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.\n“I’m all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldn’t play. I’m all out of prac—”\n“Don’t talk so much, old sport,” commanded Gatsby. “Play!”\n“In the morning,\nIn the evening,\nAin’t we got fun—”\nOutside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the Sound. All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric trains, men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New York. It was the hour of a profound human change, and excitement was generating on the air.\n“One thing’s sure and nothing’s surer\nThe rich get richer and the poor get—children.\nIn the meantime,\nIn between time—”\nAs I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of bewilderment had come back into Gatsby’s face, as though a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness. Almost five years! There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams—not through her own fault, but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man can store up in his ghostly heart.\nAs I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand took hold of hers, and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion. I think that voice held him most, with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because it couldn’t be over-dreamed—that voice was a deathless song.\nThey had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand; Gatsby didn’t know me now at all.

However, it started raining heavily again outside Gatsby's window, so we stood in a line gazing at the choppy surface of the Sound.\n\n\"If the fog wasn't here, we could see your place across the water,\" Gatsby remarked. \"There's always a green light burning all night at the very end of your dock.\"\n\nDaisy suddenly linked her arm through his, but Gatsby seemed preoccupied with what he had just said. Perhaps he realized that the immense symbolic importance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the vast distance that had separated him from Daisy, it had once seemed incredibly close to her, almost within reach. It had felt as near as a star feels to the moon. But now, it was simply a green light on a dock again. The number of magical items he possessed had decreased by one.\n\nI started to wander around the room, looking at various indistinct objects in the dim light. A large picture of an older man in a yachting outfit, hanging above his desk, caught my attention.\n\n\"Who is this?\"\n\n\"That? That's Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.\"\n\nThe name sounded vaguely familiar.\n\n\"He passed away. He was my closest friend years ago.\"\n\nOn the dresser, there was a smaller photo of Gatsby, also dressed for yachting—Gatsby with his head tilted back confidently—apparently taken when he was around eighteen.\n\n\"I love it!\" Daisy exclaimed. \"The hairstyle! You never mentioned you had that kind of hair—or a yacht.\"\n\n\"Look at this,\" Gatsby quickly said. \"Here are many newspaper clippings—all about you.\"\n\nThey stood together examining the clippings. I was about to ask to see the rubies when the telephone rang, and Gatsby picked it up.\n\n\"Yes... Listen, I can't talk right now... I really can't talk now, old sport... I said a small town... He surely knows what a small town is... Well, he's no good to us if he thinks Detroit is a small town...\"\n\nHe hung up.\n\n\"Come here quickly!\" Daisy called from the window.\n\nThe rain continued, but the sky in the west had cleared, revealing a pink and golden mass of frothy clouds above the sea.\n\n\"Look at that,\" she whispered, then after a moment added, \"I wish I could just take one of those pink clouds, put you in it, and gently push you around.\"\n\nI considered leaving then, but they wouldn't let me; maybe my presence made them feel more genuinely alone together.\n\n\"I know what we'll do,\" Gatsby announced, \"we'll have Klipspringer play the piano.\"\n\nHe left the room calling for \"Ewing!\" and returned a few minutes later with a shy, slightly worn young man wearing wire-rimmed glasses and thin blond hair. He was now dressed more appropriately in a casual, open-necked 'sport shirt,' sneakers, and light-colored duck trousers.\n\n\"Did we interrupt your exercise?\" Daisy asked politely.\n\n\"I was sleeping,\" Mr. Klipspringer blurted out, flustered. \"That is, I had been sleeping. Then I woke up...\"\n\n\"Klipspringer is a pianist,\" Gatsby interrupted him. \"Isn't that right, Ewing, old sport?\"\n\n\"I don't play well. I hardly play at all. I'm completely out of prac—\"\n\n\"We'll go downstairs,\" Gatsby cut in again. He flipped a switch. The dull grey look of the windows vanished as the house filled with light.\n\nIn the music room, Gatsby switched on a single lamp next to the piano. He lit Daisy's cigarette with a trembling match and sat down with her on a sofa far across the room, where the only light came from the gleaming floor reflecting the light from the hall.\n\nAfter Klipspringer finished playing \"The Love Nest,\" he turned on the piano bench and awkwardly looked for Gatsby in the shadows.\n\n\"I haven't practiced in ages, you see. I told you I wasn't good. I'm completely out of prac—\"\n\n\"Stop talking so much, old sport,\" Gatsby ordered. \"Play!\"\n\n\"In the morning,\nIn the evening,\nAin't we got fun—\"\n\nOutside, the wind howled, and a faint rumble of thunder echoed across the Sound. All the lights were now coming on in West Egg; the electric commuter trains, carrying people, were rushing home through the rain from New York. It was a time of significant human transition, and excitement seemed to fill the air.\n\n\"One thing's certain, absolutely certain,\nThe rich get richer, and the poor get—children.\nIn the meantime,\nIn between time—\"\n\nAs I approached to say goodbye, I noticed the expression of confusion return to Gatsby's face, as if a slight doubt had crossed his mind regarding the quality of his current happiness. Almost five years! There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy didn't quite measure up to his dreams—not because of any fault of her own, but because of the immense power of his fantasy. It had grown beyond her, beyond everything. He had poured himself into it with creative intensity, constantly adding to it, decorating it with every brilliant detail that came his way. No amount of real-world passion or freshness can compare to what a person can build up in their idealized internal world.\n\nAs I observed him, he visibly composed himself a little. He took her hand, and as she whispered something softly in his ear, he turned towards her with a surge of feeling. I believe her voice held him most strongly, with its shifting, fervent warmth, because that voice couldn't be idealized or surpassed—it was like an eternal melody.\n\nThey had forgotten about me, but Daisy looked up and offered her hand; Gatsby didn't even seem to recognize me now. I looked at them one last time, and they looked back, distant, consumed by intense emotion. Then I left the room and went down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them there together.",

Gatsby commented, “If it weren’t for the mist, you could see your house across the bay. You always have a green light shining at the end of your dock.” Daisy slipped her arm through Gatsby’s, but he seemed preoccupied, perhaps realizing the green light, which had held such meaning for him, had now lost its significance. Before, it had seemed so close to Daisy, almost within reach, as if it were a star close to the moon. Now, it was simply a green light on a dock, and Gatsby’s collection of enchanted things had shrunk by one.\n\nI wandered around the room, examining vague objects in the dimness. A large photograph of an older man in a yachting outfit above the desk caught my eye. I asked who it was. “That’s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport,” said Gatsby. The name sounded somewhat familiar. “He’s passed away now. He was my best friend many years ago.” On the bureau, I noticed a small photo of a young Gatsby in yachting clothes, head held back defiantly, likely taken when he was about eighteen. “I love it,” Daisy said. “The pompadour! You never told me you had one, or a yacht.” \n\nGatsby quickly showed her a large bundle of newspaper clippings about her. They looked at them side by side. I was about to ask to see some rubies when the phone rang. Gatsby answered, sounding impatient: “Yes… Well, I can’t talk now… I said a small town… If he thinks Detroit is a small town he’s no use to us…” He hung up.\n\n“Come here quick!” Daisy called from the window. Despite the rain, the sky in the west was clearing, with pink and golden clouds above the sea. “Look at that,” she whispered. After a moment, she added, “I’d like to grab one of those pink clouds, put you in it, and push you around.”\n\nI tried to take my leave, but they insisted I stay—maybe my presence created a comfortable sense of privacy for them. “I know—we’ll have Klipspringer play piano,” suggested Gatsby. He left the room and returned with a self-conscious, slightly disheveled young man in glasses and casual clothes. “Did we interrupt your workout?” Daisy asked. “I was asleep,” replied Klipspringer, embarrassed. “I mean, I had been… Then I got up…”\n\n“Klipspringer plays piano,” Gatsby interjected. “You play, right?”\n\n“I don’t play very well… I’m out of practice—”\n\n“We’ll go downstairs,” Gatsby insisted, turning on all the lights.\n\nIn the music room, Gatsby switched on a lamp by the piano, lit Daisy’s cigarette, and sat with her on a far couch where only soft light from the hall touched them. Klipspringer played “The Love Nest,” and then looked back at Gatsby, apologetic. “I told you I was out of practice…”\n\n“Just play, old sport,” ordered Gatsby.\n\nKlipspringer began to sing “Ain’t We Got Fun.” The wind howled outside, thunder rumbled over the Sound, and lights began to glow in West Egg as trains carried people home through the rain. Evening had ushered in a mood of transition and excitement.\n\nAs he sang, the lyrics went: “The rich get richer, and the poor get—children. In the meantime, In between time—”\n\nAs I moved to leave, I saw confusion return to Gatsby’s face—as if some doubt crept in about whether his happiness was real. Almost five years had passed—surely even that afternoon Daisy fell short of his dreams, not through any fault of hers, but because his vision had become too great. He had poured so much creativity and longing into it, embellishing it ever further, until no reality could match what he had conjured up in his heart.\n\nAs I watched, Gatsby visibly regathered himself, holding Daisy’s hand as she spoke quietly to him. He turned to her with a surge of feeling. I sensed that her voice fascinated him most, with its lively warmth that couldn’t be imagined or idealized—a voice like an immortal melody.\n\nThey had forgotten my presence until Daisy looked up and reached for my hand. Gatsby now seemed not to notice me at all. I gave them a final look; they looked back, absorbed in each other, radiating life. I left the room and went down the marble steps, out into the rain, leaving the two of them together."

It was his day off, and demonstrating commendable proactivity, he had hurried out simply \"to see what was happening.\" Although it was a speculative visit, the reporter's instinct was accurate.

Over the summer, Gatsby’s fame—fueled by the many people who attended his parties and then acted as self-proclaimed experts on his background—had grown to the point that he was almost newsworthy. Wild stories circulated about him, such as the rumor that he had a secret smuggling route to Canada, and another persistent tale claimed that he didn’t actually reside in a house, but rather on a boat designed to look like a house, which was moved surreptitiously up and down the Long Island coast. Why these fanciful rumors were gratifying to James Gatz, originally from North Dakota, is difficult to explain."

His brown, hardening body lived naturally through the half-fierce, half-lazy work of the bracing days. He knew women early, and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous of them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of the others because they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming self-absorption he took for granted.\nBut his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy’s wing.\nAn instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before, to the small Lutheran College of St. Olaf’s in southern Minnesota. He stayed there two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor’s work with which he was to pay his way through. Then he drifted back to Lake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the day that Dan Cody’s yacht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore.\nCody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields, of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since seventy-five.

The demanding yet sometimes relaxed nature of these invigorating days naturally shaped his tanned, strong body. He had early encounters with women; their indulgence of him led him to feel superior to them, viewing young virgins with disdain for their lack of experience and others as overly emotional about matters he considered trivial given his intense focus on himself. However, his inner state was one of constant, chaotic unrest. At night, while in bed, he was preoccupied by the most bizarre and extraordinary visions. In his mind, a world of indescribable splendor unfolded, while the clock ticked on the dresser and the moonlight bathed his scattered clothes on the floor in a pale glow. Every night, he elaborated on the details of his daydreams until sleep arrived, drawing him into an oblivious embrace that ended the vivid scene. For a period, these imaginings offered an outlet for his creative energy; they served as a compelling suggestion that reality might be less solid than it appeared, a promise that the fundamental basis of the world was as fragile as a fairy's wing. Guided by an intuition about his future success, he had, several months prior, gone to the small Lutheran institution, St. Olaf's College, located in southern Minnesota. He remained there for only two weeks, discouraged by its seeming lack of interest in his aspirations and fate, and finding the janitorial duties he was required to perform to fund his education contemptible.

He gained early experience with women, and their indulgence made him look down on them—he saw young girls as naïve, and the others as overly emotional about things he found commonplace, absorbed as he was in himself.\n\nHowever, inside, he was always restless and in turmoil; bizarre and fantastic dreams plagued his nights. He would lie awake as his mind spun visions of dazzling possibilities, while the clock ticked and moonlight shone on his scattered clothes. Every night, he expanded these dreams until sleep overtook him. For a time, these fantasies satisfied his need for escape, offering him the sense that reality itself was unstable, and hinting that the world's solid foundations rested on something magical and fleeting.\n\nA sense of his destined greatness had led him a few months earlier to enroll at a small Lutheran college in southern Minnesota, St. Olaf’s. He only lasted two weeks before becoming discouraged with the school’s complete disregard for his ambitions—and resentful because he had to work as a janitor to pay his expenses. After leaving, he returned to Lake Superior, still looking for his purpose, and it was on this quest that he encountered Dan Cody’s yacht anchored offshore.\n\nAt that time, Cody was fifty years old and had made his fortune in silver mining in Nevada, in the Yukon, and throughout every mineral rush since 1875. His wealth from Montana copper deals had made him a millionaire many times over. Though still physically strong, he was beginning to lose his mental sharpness, and because of that, countless women tried to get his money.

I suppose he smiled at Cody—he had probably discovered that people liked him when he smiled. At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of them elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick and extravagantly ambitious. A few days later he took him to Duluth and bought him a blue coat, six pairs of white duck trousers, and a yachting cap. And when the Tuolomee left for the West Indies and the Barbary Coast, Gatsby left too.\nHe was employed in a vague personal capacity—while he remained with Cody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even jailor, for Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be about, and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more trust in Gatsby. The arrangement lasted five years, during which the boat went three times around the Continent. It might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye came on board one night in Boston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably died.",

He likely smiled at Cody, perhaps having learned that people responded positively to his smile. Cody, in turn, asked him some questions (one of which revealed his new identity), determining that he was sharp and extraordinarily driven. Shortly after, Cody brought him to Duluth and bought him specific clothing: a blue coat, six pairs of white duck trousers, and a yachting cap. When the Tuolomee set sail for regions like the West Indies and the Barbary Coast, Gatsby was on board. His role was vaguely defined but personal; during his time with Cody, he served consecutively as steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even acted as a sort of keeper. This was because a sober Dan Cody understood the potential excesses of a drunken Dan Cody and increasingly entrusted Gatsby to handle such possibilities. The association lasted for five years, during which the vessel circumnavigated the continent three times. It could have continued indefinitely, were it not for Ella Kaye boarding the ship one night in Boston, followed by Dan Cody's abrupt death just a week later.",

I imagine he smiled warmly at Cody—likely having realized that people responded well to his smile. In any case, Cody questioned him a bit (one question led to Gatz inventing a new name) and noticed that he was sharp and very ambitious. Shortly afterward, Cody took him to Duluth, outfitted him in a blue jacket, six pairs of white trousers, and a yachting cap. When the Tuolomee sailed for the West Indies and Barbary Coast, Gatsby went along.\n\nHis job was rather undefined—while he was with Cody, he acted as steward, mate, captain, secretary, and even jailor, since Cody, when sober, was aware of the reckless behavior he might get up to when drunk, and he increasingly relied on Gatsby to keep order. This arrangement continued for five years, during which they circled the continent three times. Things might have continued this way if not for Ella Kaye’s arrival one night in Boston; after her visit, Dan Cody died within a week, under unfortunate circumstances."

It was indirectly due to Cody that Gatsby drank so little. Sometimes in the course of gay parties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he formed the habit of letting liquor alone.\nAnd it was from Cody that he inherited money—a legacy of twenty-five thousand dollars. He didn’t get it. He never understood the legal device that was used against him, but what remained of the millions went intact to Ella Kaye. He was left with his singularly appropriate education; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the substantiality of a man.\nHe told me all this very much later, but I’ve put it down here with the idea of exploding those first wild rumours about his antecedents, which weren’t even faintly true. Moreover he told it to me at a time of confusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and nothing about him.

This was the early profligate who, in a certain period of US history, reintroduced the brutal roughness of Western bordellos and bars to the East Coast. Cody's influence was indirectly responsible for Gatsby's minimal alcohol intake. At lively gatherings, women sometimes playfully rubbed champagne into his hair, but he himself chose to abstain from alcoholic drinks. Furthermore, he received an inheritance from Cody: a sum of twenty-five thousand dollars. However, he never actually received this money. He couldn't grasp the legal maneuver employed to prevent him from inheriting it, resulting in the substantial fortune passing entirely to Ella Kaye. What he did gain was his remarkably suitable education, through which the indistinct figure of Jay Gatsby developed into a fully formed individual. Gatsby shared all these details with me much later, but I am including them now to correct the initial, baseless speculations about his background. He also confided in me during a period when I was feeling uncertain, simultaneously inclined to believe everything and nothing I heard about him. Therefore, I am using this brief pause, as if Gatsby is taking a moment to compose himself, to dispel these false ideas.",

Cody’s influence was one reason Gatsby rarely drank; at parties, some women would splash champagne on his hair, but Gatsby himself chose to avoid alcohol. Cody also left Gatsby a legacy of $25,000, but Gatsby never received it. He never understood exactly how he was cheated out of the money, which ended up going to Ella Kaye, while Gatsby was left only with the practical lessons he’d learned. This contributed to Jay Gatsby’s transformation into a man of substance. He confided this story to me much later, but I’m sharing it here to dispel the wild rumors about his past, which were completely unfounded.

For several weeks I didn’t see him or hear his voice on the phone—mostly I was in New York, trotting around with Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile aunt—but finally I went over to his house one Sunday afternoon. I hadn’t been there two minutes when somebody brought Tom Buchanan in for a drink. I was startled, naturally, but the really surprising thing was that it hadn’t happened before.\nThey were a party of three on horseback—Tom and a man named Sloane and a pretty woman in a brown riding-habit, who had been there previously.\n“I’m delighted to see you,” said Gatsby, standing on his porch. “I’m delighted that you dropped in.”\nAs though they cared!\n“Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar.” He walked around the room quickly, ringing bells. “I’ll have something to drink for you in just a minute.”\nHe was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there. But he would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in a vague way that that was all they came for. Mr. Sloane wanted nothing. A lemonade? No, thanks. A little champagne? Nothing at all, thanks… I’m sorry—\n“Did you have a nice ride?”\n“Very good roads around here.”\n“I suppose the automobiles—”\n“Yeah.”\nMoved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom, who had accepted the introduction as a stranger.\n“I believe we’ve met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan.”\n“Oh, yes,” said Tom, gruffly polite, but obviously not remembering. “So we did. I remember very well.”\n“About two weeks ago.”\n“That’s right. You were with Nick here.”\n“I know your wife,” continued Gatsby, almost aggressively.\n“That so?”\nTom turned to me.\n“You live near here, Nick?”\n“Next door.”\n“That so?”\nMr. Sloane didn’t enter into the conversation, but lounged back haughtily in his chair; the woman said nothing either—until unexpectedly, after two highballs, she became cordial.\n“We’ll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby,” she suggested. “What do you say?”\n“Certainly; I’d be delighted to have you.”\n“Be ver’ nice,” said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. “Well—think ought to be starting home.”\n“Please don’t hurry,” Gatsby urged them. He had control of himself now, and he wanted to see more of Tom. “Why don’t you—why don’t you stay for supper? I wouldn’t be surprised if some other people dropped in from New York.”\n“You come to supper with me,” said the lady enthusiastically. “Both of you.”\nThis included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.\n“Come along,” he said—but to her only.\n“I mean it,” she insisted. “I’d love to have you. Lots of room.”\nGatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go and he didn’t see that Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn’t.\n“I’m afraid I won’t be able to,” I said.\n“Well, you come,” she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.\nMr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear.\n“We won’t be late if we start now,” she insisted aloud.\n“I haven’t got a horse,” said Gatsby. “I used to ride in the army, but I’ve never bought a horse. I’ll have to follow you in my car. Excuse me for just a minute.”\nThe rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady began an impassioned conversation aside.\n“My God, I believe the man’s coming,” said Tom. “Doesn’t he know she doesn’t want him?”\n“She says she does want him.”\n“She has a big dinner party and he won’t know a soul there.” He frowned. “I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may be old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to suit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish.”\nSuddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted their horses.\n“Come on,” said Mr. Sloane to Tom, “we’re late. We’ve got to go.” And then to me: “Tell him we couldn’t wait, will you?”\nTom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod, and they trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August foliage just as Gatsby, with hat and light overcoat in hand, came out the front door.",

For several weeks, I had no contact with him, not seeing him or speaking on the phone.

I had only been there for a couple of minutes when someone arrived with Tom Buchanan for a drink. While I was startled, the truly surprising part was that this encounter hadn't occurred sooner.\n\nTom was part of a group of three who had arrived on horseback. The others were a man named Sloane and a pretty woman in a brown riding outfit, someone who had visited Gatsby before.\n\nStanding on his porch, Gatsby greeted them warmly, saying, \"I'm delighted to see you,\" and \"I'm delighted that you dropped in.\"\n\nIt seemed unlikely that they genuinely cared!\n\nGatsby urged them, \"Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar.\" He hurried around the room, pressing service bells. \"I'll have something for you to drink momentarily.\"\n\nTom's presence clearly deeply affected him. Still, Gatsby would have been restless regardless until he had offered them something, dimly aware that this was the only reason they had come. Mr. Sloane didn't want anything. A lemonade? No, thank you. A little champagne? Absolutely nothing, thank you... I apologize—\n\n“Did you enjoy your ride?” Gatsby asked.\n\n“The roads are quite good around here,” Sloane replied.\n\n“I suppose the automobiles—” Gatsby began.\n\n“Yes,” Sloane cut in.\n\nPushed by an overwhelming impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom, who had accepted the introduction as if he were a stranger.\n\n“I believe we’ve met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan,” Gatsby ventured.\n\n“Oh, yes,” Tom responded, his tone roughly polite, though he clearly didn't recall. “Indeed we have.

He was composed now and eager to spend more time with Tom. “Why don’t you—why don’t you stay for supper? I wouldn’t be surprised if some other people from New York show up.”\n\n“You come to supper with me,” the lady suggested enthusiastically. “Both of you.”\n\nThis invitation included me. Mr. Sloane immediately stood up.\n\n“Come along,” he said, but directed the remark only to her.\n\n“I mean it,” she insisted. “I’d truly love for you to come. There’s plenty of space.”\n\nGatsby looked at me uncertainly. He wanted to accept but didn't seem to grasp that Mr. Sloane had decided against it.\n\n“I’m afraid I won’t be able to,” I said.\n\n“Well, you come,” she urged, focusing her attention on Gatsby.\n\nMr. Sloane murmured something quietly in her ear.\n\n“We won’t be late if we start now,” she stated aloud.\n\n“I don’t have a horse,” Gatsby said. “I used to ride in the army, but I’ve never bought one.

Honestly, I may hold old-fashioned views, but women nowadays are out and about too much for my liking. They encounter all sorts of odd characters.”\n\nSuddenly, Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted their horses.\n\n“Come on,” Mr. Sloane said to Tom, “we’re behind schedule. We need to go.” Then, addressing me: “Could you tell him we couldn’t wait?”\n\nTom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged cool nods, and they quickly rode down the drive, vanishing beneath the August leaves just as Gatsby, with his hat and light overcoat in hand, emerged from the front door.",

Eventually, one Sunday afternoon, I visited Gatsby’s mansion. I had hardly arrived when Tom Buchanan was brought in for a drink, which surprised me—though, in hindsight, it was more surprising this hadn’t happened before. Tom arrived with two companions, Mr. Sloane and an attractive woman in riding gear who had been to Gatsby’s before. Gatsby warmly welcomed them, though it was clear they weren’t genuinely interested. He offered them cigarettes, cigars, and drinks, eager to be a good host, though it was apparent that their visit was just for refreshments. Mr. Sloane declined all offers. Conversation was brief and forced until the woman, after some drinks, became friendly and suggested they should all attend Gatsby’s next party. Gatsby agreed, but soon the group prepared to leave. The woman invited Gatsby and me to join their dinner, but Mr. Sloane clearly didn’t intend for us to come. Gatsby, unsure, wanted to accept but I declined. When the woman focused her invitation on Gatsby, he responded that he didn’t have a horse but could drive. As Gatsby went to get ready, the others quickly left, making it clear they hadn’t really meant the invitation. Tom remarked disapprovingly about how women, including Daisy, socialize too freely these days. As the group departed, Gatsby emerged only to find them all gone."

Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness—it stands out in my memory from Gatsby’s other parties that summer. There were the same people, or at least the same sort of people, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-coloured, many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that hadn’t been there before. Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world complete in itself, with its own standards and its own great figures, second to nothing because it had no consciousness of being so, and now I was looking at it again, through Daisy’s eyes. It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment.\nThey arrived at twilight, and, as we strolled out among the sparkling hundreds, Daisy’s voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat.\n“These things excite me so,” she whispered. “If you want to kiss me any time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I’ll be glad to arrange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green card. I’m giving out green—”\n“Look around,” suggested Gatsby.\n“I’m looking around. I’m having a marvellous—”\n“You must see the faces of many people you’ve heard about.”\nTom’s arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.\n“We don’t go around very much,” he said; “in fact, I was just thinking I don’t know a soul here.”\n“Perhaps you know that lady.” Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white-plum tree. Tom and Daisy stared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies.\n“She’s lovely,” said Daisy.\n“The man bending over her is her director.”\nHe took them ceremoniously from group to group:\n“Mrs. Buchanan… and Mr. Buchanan—” After an instant’s hesitation he added: “the polo player.”\n“Oh no,” objected Tom quickly, “not me.”\nBut evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained “the polo player” for the rest of the evening.\n“I’ve never met so many celebrities,” Daisy exclaimed. “I liked that man—what was his name?—with the sort of blue nose.”\nGatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer.\n“Well, I liked him anyhow.”\n“I’d a little rather not be the polo player,” said Tom pleasantly, “I’d rather look at all these famous people in—in oblivion.”\nDaisy and Gatsby danced. I remember being surprised by his graceful, conservative foxtrot—I had never seen him dance before. Then they sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour, while at her request I remained watchfully in the garden. “In case there’s a fire or a flood,” she explained, “or any act of God.”\nTom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together. “Do you mind if I eat with some people over here?” he said. “A fellow’s getting off some funny stuff.”\n“Go ahead,” answered Daisy genially, “and if you want to take down any addresses here’s my little gold pencil.”… She looked around after a moment and told me the girl was “common but pretty,” and I knew that except for the half-hour she’d been alone with Gatsby she wasn’t having a good time.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Tom's clear annoyance about Daisy attending parties alone led him to accompany her to Gatsby's the following Saturday. Nick felt Tom's presence perhaps gave the evening an unusually heavy feeling, making it stand out unpleasantly from Gatsby's other summer parties in his memory. The crowd, plentiful champagne, and vibrant noise were the same, but Nick perceived an unwelcome harshness that hadn't been there before. He wondered if he had merely gotten accustomed to West Egg as its own unique world, self-important because it lacked self-awareness, and was now seeing it critically through Daisy's eyes. He noted it's always disheartening to view familiar things you've adjusted to from a new perspective. They arrived at dusk, and as they walked among the glittering crowd, Daisy's voice had a soft, playful quality. \"These events are so exciting,\" she whispered, adding playfully, \"If you want a kiss anytime tonight, Nick, just let me know, and I'll make it happen. Just mention my name or show a green card. I'm giving them out.\" Gatsby suggested she look around. \"I am looking,\" she replied, \"I'm having a wonderful time...\" Gatsby interrupted, \"You must see people whose names you know.\" Tom's arrogant gaze swept over the guests. \"We don't get out much,\" he said, adding, \"In fact, I was just thinking I don't recognize a single person here.\" \"Perhaps you know that lady,\" Gatsby offered, pointing to a stunning, almost unnatural woman who sat regally under a white tree. Tom and Daisy stared, experiencing the strange, slightly unreal feeling of recognizing a famous person they'd only seen in movies. \"She's beautiful,\" Daisy commented. \"The man leaning over her is her director,\" Gatsby explained. He then formally guided them through various groups. \"Mrs. Buchanan… and Mr. Buchanan—\" After a brief pause, he added, \"the polo player.\" Tom quickly objected, \"Oh no, not me.\" But Gatsby seemed pleased with this, and Tom remained \"the polo player\" for the rest of the night. \"I've never met so many famous people,\" Daisy exclaimed. \"I liked that man—what was his name?—with the kind of blue nose.\" Gatsby identified him as a minor producer. \"Well, I liked him anyway,\" she insisted. \"I'd slightly prefer not to be called the polo player,\" Tom said pleasantly, \"I'd rather observe all these famous people from—from obscurity.\" Daisy and Gatsby danced. Nick recalled being surprised by Gatsby's elegant, conventional foxtrot, having never seen him dance before. Afterward, they walked over to Nick's house and sat on the steps for half an hour. At Daisy's request, Nick stayed in the garden as a lookout, as she explained, \"In case there's a fire or a flood, or some kind of natural disaster.\" Tom reappeared from wherever he had been just as they were sitting down to eat. \"Would you mind if I joined some people over there?\" he asked. \"Someone's telling some funny stories.\" \"Go ahead,\" Daisy replied agreeably, adding, \"and if you want to jot down any addresses, here's my little gold pencil.\" A moment later, she looked around and told Nick the girl Tom was with was \"common but pretty.\" Nick realized that aside from the thirty minutes she had spent alone with Gatsby, she was not enjoying herself.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Tom was clearly unsettled by Daisy going out by herself, so the next Saturday he accompanied her to Gatsby’s party. His attendance may have been what made the evening feel so stifling—the event stands out in my mind from Gatsby’s other parties that summer. There were the usual guests, or at least the same sort of crowd, just as much champagne, and the same lively, multi-colored chaos, but this time I sensed a certain discomfort, a harshness in the atmosphere that I hadn’t noticed before. Maybe I had just grown accustomed to it—perhaps West Egg had become a complete, self-contained world in my mind, with its own standards and celebrities, feeling important simply because it didn’t know any different, and now I was seeing it anew, through Daisy’s perspective. It’s always a bit disheartening to see things differently after you’ve already adjusted to them.\nTom and Daisy arrived at dusk, and as we mingled with the glittering crowd, Daisy spoke in a soft, excited voice. She whispered to me that she found the occasion thrilling and joked that if I wanted to kiss her during the evening, I only needed to ask or present a green card, as she was 'giving out green.' Gatsby encouraged her to look around, and she replied that she was enjoying herself, marveling at all the famous faces. Tom, looking around arrogantly, remarked that they didn’t socialize much and that he didn’t know anyone there. Gatsby pointed out a magnificent woman under a white-plum tree whom Tom and Daisy recognized as a famous movie star, leaving them a bit awed. Gatsby introduced Tom and Daisy to people, calling Tom 'the polo player' despite Tom’s quick objection, much to Gatsby’s amusement. Daisy exclaimed about meeting so many celebrities, enjoying particularly a man with a blue nose, whom Gatsby identified as a minor producer.\nTom insisted he’d rather observe than be called a polo player, preferring to stay in the background among all the famous guests.\nDaisy and Gatsby danced together; I was surprised by Gatsby’s skillful and understated foxtrot, since I’d never seen him dance before. Afterwards, they strolled over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour while I waited nearby in the garden at Daisy’s suggestion, supposedly in case of an emergency. Later, when we sat down for supper, Tom reappeared and asked if he could join another group because someone was telling jokes, and Daisy cheerfully offered him her gold pencil for taking addresses. After a while, she told me that a certain girl was ‘common but pretty,’ and I realized that except for the time she spent alone with Gatsby, Daisy hadn’t actually enjoyed herself at the party."

          "text_segment": "We were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my fault—Gatsby had been called to the phone, and I’d enjoyed these same people only two weeks before. But what had amused me then turned septic on the air now.\n“How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?”\nThe girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my shoulder. At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes.\n“Wha’?”\nA massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf with her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker’s defence:\n“Oh, she’s all right now. When she’s had five or six cocktails she always starts screaming like that. I tell her she ought to leave it alone.”\n“I do leave it alone,” affirmed the accused hollowly.\n“We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: ‘There’s somebody that needs your help, Doc.’ ”\n“She’s much obliged, I’m sure,” said another friend, without gratitude, “but you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool.”\n“Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,” mumbled Miss Baedeker. “They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey.”\n“Then you ought to leave it alone,” countered Doctor Civet.\n“Speak for yourself!” cried Miss Baedeker violently. “Your hand shakes. I wouldn’t let you operate on me!”\nIt was like that. Almost the last thing I remember was standing with Daisy and watching the moving-picture director and his Star. They were still under the white-plum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale, thin ray of moonlight between. It occurred to me that he had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this proximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate degree and kiss at her cheek.\n“I like her,” said Daisy, “I think she’s lovely.”\nBut the rest offended her—and inarguably because it wasn’t a gesture but an emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented “place” that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village—appalled by its raw vigour that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a shortcut from nothing to nothing. She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand.\nI sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car. It was dark here in front; only the bright door sent ten square feet of light volleying out into the soft black morning. Sometimes a shadow moved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow, an indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an invisible glass.\n“Who is this Gatsby anyhow?” demanded Tom suddenly. “Some big bootlegger?”\n“Where’d you hear that?” I inquired.\n“I didn’t hear it. I imagined it. A lot of these newly rich people are just big bootleggers, you know.”\n“Not Gatsby,” I said shortly.\nHe was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the drive crunched under his feet.\n“Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie together.”\nA breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy’s fur collar.\n“At least they are more interesting than the people we know,” she said with an effort.\n“You didn’t look so interested.”\n“Well, I was.”\nTom laughed and turned to me.\n“Did you notice Daisy’s face when that girl asked her to put her under a cold shower?”\nDaisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper, bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again. When the melody rose her voice broke up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.\n“Lots of people come who haven’t been invited,” she said suddenly. “That girl hadn’t been invited. They simply force their way in and he’s too polite to object.”\n“I’d like to know who he is and what he does,” insisted Tom. “And I think I’ll make a point of finding out.”\n“I can tell you right now,” she answered. “He owned some drugstores, a lot of drugstores. He built them up himself.”\nThe dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive.\n“Good night, Nick,” said Daisy.\nHer glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps, where “Three O’Clock in the Morning,” a neat, sad little waltz of that year, was drifting out the open door. After all, in the very casualness of Gatsby’s party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from her world. What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside? What would happen now in the dim, incalculable hours? Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare and to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with one fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would blot out those five years of unwavering devotion.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Our group at the table was noticeably drunk. I was partly to blame for this; Gatsby had been called away, and I'd enjoyed interacting with the same people just two weeks prior. However, what I'd found amusing then now felt off-putting. Someone asked, \"How are you feeling, Miss Baedeker?\" The young woman being addressed was unsuccessfully trying to lean against my shoulder. Hearing the question, she sat up and opened her eyes, responding, \"What?\" A large, sluggish woman who had been trying to convince Daisy to play golf with her the next day defended Miss Baedeker, saying, \"Oh, she's fine now. She always starts screaming like that after five or six cocktails. I keep telling her to stop.\" Miss Baedeker weakly insisted, \"I do stop.\" The other woman continued, \"We heard you yelling, so I told Doc Civet here, 'Someone needs your help, Doc.'\" Another friend sarcastically added, \"She's surely grateful, but you soaked her dress when you shoved her head in the pool.\" \"I hate having my head shoved in a pool,\" Miss Baedeker mumbled. \"They almost drowned me once in New Jersey.\" Doctor Civet retorted, \"Then you should avoid it.\" Miss Baedeker aggressively shot back, \"Mind your own business! Your hand shakes. I wouldn't let you operate on me!\" The atmosphere was like that. One of my final memories from the party was standing with Daisy, watching the movie director and his lead actress. They were still under the white plum tree, their faces close, separated only by a thin line of moonlight. It struck me that he had been slowly leaning towards her all night to get this close, and even as I watched, he leaned one last bit and kissed her cheek. Daisy commented, \"I like her; I think she's lovely.\" But the rest of the party bothered her, definitely because it wasn't just behavior but a feeling. She was disturbed by West Egg, this strange new place created by mixing Broadway people with a Long Island fishing village – disturbed by its crude energy that didn't fit with old traditions and by the obvious way its residents were quickly moving from obscurity to nothingness. She found something unsettling in the very simplicity she couldn't grasp. I sat with them on the front steps, waiting for their car. It was dark there, with only the bright light from the doorway extending ten square feet into the soft, dark morning. Sometimes a shadow moved behind a dressing room window upstairs, replaced by another shadow, a hazy line of figures applying makeup and powder in an unseen mirror. Tom suddenly asked, \"Who exactly is this Gatsby? Some major bootlegger?\" \"Where did you hear that?\" I asked. \"I didn't hear it. I just figured it. A lot of these newly wealthy people are just big bootleggers, you know.\" \"Not Gatsby,\" I stated simply. He was quiet for a moment, the gravel on the driveway crunching under his feet. \"Well, he certainly had to work hard to gather this assortment of people.\" A breeze rustled the grey fluff of Daisy's fur collar. \"At least they're more interesting than the people we know,\" she said with effort. \"You didn't seem that interested.\" \"Well, I was.\" Tom laughed and turned to me. \"Did you see Daisy's reaction when that girl suggested putting her under a cold shower?\" Daisy started singing softly to the music in a low, rhythmic whisper, giving each word a meaning it had never held before and would never hold again. When the tune went higher, her voice sweetly followed, breaking slightly, as contralto voices sometimes do, and with each change, a little of her warm, human charm seemed to spread into the air. \"Many people come who aren't invited,\" she said abruptly. \"That girl wasn't invited. They just push their way in, and he's too polite to say no.\" Tom insisted, \"I want to know who he is and what he does. And I plan to find out.\" \"I can tell you now,\" she replied. \"He owned drugstores, many of them. He built them up himself.\" The slow-moving limousine finally drove up. \"Good night, Nick,\" Daisy said. Her eyes left me and went up to the lit area at the top of the steps, where \"Three O'Clock in the Morning,\" a simple, melancholic little waltz from that year, was drifting out the open door. After all, in the casual nature of Gatsby's party, there were romantic possibilities completely absent from her life. What was it about that song upstairs that seemed to call her back inside? What would happen during the unpredictable hours ahead? Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a truly exceptional and amazing person, some genuinely radiant young woman who, with one fresh look at Gatsby, one moment of magical connection, would erase those five years of steady devotion.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "We were sitting at a table where most of us were a little drunk, which I was responsible for since Gatsby had left to take a call, and I had only recently enjoyed the same company. Yet, what amused me before felt unpleasant now. Someone asked Miss Baedeker how she was feeling as she tried to lean on my shoulder but sat up and replied incoherently. A large, slow-moving woman defended her, saying Miss Baedeker always starts yelling after several cocktails and should perhaps avoid drinking. Miss Baedeker insisted she already does. The woman continued, mentioning how they called for Doctor Civet’s help after hearing her screams, but another friend complained he’d gotten her dress wet by dipping her head in the pool. Miss Baedeker grumbled about hating that, recalling nearly being drowned in New Jersey, and Doctor Civet echoed that she should leave drinking alone. She retorted hotly that maybe he should worry about himself since his hands shake and she wouldn’t trust him to operate on her. \n\nThe night carried on like this. One of the last things I remembered was standing with Daisy, observing a film director and his star beneath a white-plum tree. They were close, nearly touching faces save for a sliver of moonlight, and after a long time, he finally leaned in and kissed her cheek. Daisy commented that she liked the actress, finding her lovely, but the scene’s underlying emotion unsettled her. West Egg’s crude energy and its stark contrast to old social customs seemed to disturb her. She found an alarming simplicity in all of it, a simplicity she couldn’t comprehend.\n\nI waited with the group for their car on the steps, with only the front door casting a rectangle of light into the darkness. Occasionally, shadows passed in the windows above, likely people preparing to leave, putting on makeup unseen. Tom suddenly asked if Gatsby was a notorious bootlegger, and I replied he wasn’t. Tom seemed disapproving of Gatsby’s guests and the kind of party he threw, yet Daisy pointed out that such gatherings were more interesting than those of their own circle. Tom joked about Daisy’s reaction when one of the girls had asked her for help to cool off in the shower. Daisy then started singing along softly to the party’s music, adding her own emotion to the words in a way that was uniquely hers.\n\nDaisy remarked that many guests attended without invitations, barging in because Gatsby was too polite to turn them away. Tom insisted he wanted to know more about Gatsby, and Daisy casually told him Gatsby owned several drugstores, having built them up himself. Soon their limousine arrived and Daisy wished me goodnight, her eyes drifting to the house where a popular waltz drifted through the open door. There was, despite the nearly chaotic atmosphere of Gatsby’s parties, something romantic and enchanting that was lacking in Daisy’s usual world. She seemed drawn by the music, perhaps wondering what else might happen as the night carried on—maybe someone extraordinary would arrive, someone who could, with a single enchanting moment with Gatsby, erase five years of longing."

          "text_segment": "I stayed late that night. Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free, and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run up, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights were extinguished in the guestrooms overhead. When he came down the steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes were bright and tired.\n“She didn’t like it,” he said immediately.\n“Of course she did.”\n“She didn’t like it,” he insisted. “She didn’t have a good time.”\nHe was silent, and I guessed at his unutterable depression.\n“I feel far away from her,” he said. “It’s hard to make her understand.”\n“You mean about the dance?”\n“The dance?” He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of his fingers. “Old sport, the dance is unimportant.”\nHe wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say: “I never loved you.” After she had obliterated four years with that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken. One of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back to Louisville and be married from her house—just as if it were five years ago.\n“And she doesn’t understand,” he said. “She used to be able to understand. We’d sit for hours—”\nHe broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds and discarded favours and crushed flowers.\n“I wouldn’t ask too much of her,” I ventured. “You can’t repeat the past.”\n“Can’t repeat the past?” he cried incredulously. “Why of course you can!”\nHe looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.\n“I’m going to fix everything just the way it was before,” he said, nodding determinedly. “She’ll see.”\nHe talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy. His life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he could find out what that thing was…\n… One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight. They stopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of the year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees—he could climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.\nHis heart beat faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning-fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips’ touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.\nThrough all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was reminded of something—an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man’s, as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air. But they made no sound, and what I had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I remained there for a considerable time that evening. Gatsby requested me to stay until he became available, so I waited in the garden until the inevitable group from the swimming pool had come up, feeling both cold and energized, from the dark shoreline, and until the lights in the rooms above were turned off. When he finally descended the steps, the tanned skin on his face was pulled unusually tight, and his eyes were bright but fatigued. He immediately stated, \"She didn’t like it.\" \"Of course, she did,\" I replied. \"She didn't like it,\" he insisted again. \"She didn't enjoy herself.\" He fell silent, and I could sense his profound sadness. \"I feel distant from her,\" he said. \"It's difficult to make her grasp things.\" \"You mean about the party?\" I asked. \"The party?\" He dismissively snapped his fingers, brushing aside all the parties he had hosted. \"My dear fellow, the party is inconsequential.\" What he desired from Daisy was nothing less than for her to approach Tom and say, \"I never loved you.\" After she had erased four years with that statement, they could then decide on the more practical steps to take. One of these was that, once she was free, they would return to Louisville and be married from her family home—exactly as if five years had not passed. \"And she still doesn't understand,\" he lamented. \"She used to be able to understand. We would sit and talk for hours—\" He stopped himself and began pacing up and down a desolate path covered in discarded fruit peels, party favors, and crushed flowers. \"I wouldn’t demand too much from her,\" I cautiously suggested. \"You can't bring back the past.\" \"Can't bring back the past?\" he exclaimed in disbelief. \"Why, certainly you can!\" He looked around him wildly, as though the past were lurking nearby in the shadow of his house, just out of reach. \"I'm going to restore everything exactly as it was,\" he said, nodding with determination. \"She will see.\" He spoke extensively about the past, and I gathered that he wished to recover something, perhaps an aspect of himself, that had been invested in loving Daisy. His life had been chaotic and messy since then, but if he could just return to a specific beginning point and revisit it slowly, he believed he could identify what that 'thing' was… …On a night in the autumn, five years prior, they had been walking down the street as the leaves were falling, and they arrived at a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was illuminated white by the moonlight. They paused there and faced each other. Now, it was a cool night containing that mysterious thrill that accompanies the two seasonal transitions of the year. The gentle lights from the houses hummed outward into the darkness, and there was a stir and activity among the stars. Out of the corner of his eye, Gatsby perceived that the sidewalk blocks actually formed a staircase ascending to a secret place above the trees—he could climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there, he could draw sustenance from the core of life, drink deeply of the incomparable milk of wonder. His heart pounded faster as Daisy’s pale face came close to his own. He understood that when he kissed this girl, and forever bound his immeasurable dreams to her mortal breath, his mind would no longer possess the boundless scope it once had, like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for another moment to the resonant tone, like a tuning fork struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. As his lips touched hers, she blossomed for him like a flower, and that moment of becoming was complete. Through everything he said, even through his terrible sentimentality, I was reminded of something—an elusive rhythm, a fragment of forgotten words, that I had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment, a phrase attempted to form itself in my mouth, and my lips parted like those of someone unable to speak, as though something more than a puff of surprised air was struggling to escape them. But they produced no sound, and what I had almost recalled remained forever beyond expression.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I stayed late that evening because Gatsby wanted me to wait until he was available, so I remained in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had finished and the guests had left, the lights in their rooms going out. When Gatsby finally came outside, he looked especially tense and exhausted. Without waiting, he told me, \"She didn't like it.\" I reassured him that Daisy had enjoyed herself, but he was adamant that she hadn't and insisted she hadn't had a good time. He then fell silent, and I could sense his profound sadness. He confessed, \"I feel distant from her. It's difficult to make her see things from my perspective.\" I asked if he was talking about the dance, but he dismissed that, saying it was irrelevant. What Gatsby truly wanted was for Daisy to tell Tom she never loved him, to erase their years together with one statement, so that she and Gatsby could plan their future—one where she would return to Louisville, free, and marry Gatsby as if no time had passed. But Gatsby believed Daisy did not understand him as she once did when they would spend hours together. He wandered, disheartened, among the remnants of the party. I suggested he shouldn't expect too much from Daisy, reminding him, \"You can't repeat the past.\" Gatsby was shocked by this, insisting that the past absolutely could be recreated. Looking around as though searching for the past, Gatsby proclaimed that he would restore everything exactly as it once was, convinced Daisy would see it too. He talked extensively about reclaiming something—maybe an idealized version of himself—lost in his love for Daisy. Since then, his life had been unsettled, but he believed that if he could return to a specific point and relive it, he could rediscover what had been lost. He recalled a memory from five years earlier: walking with Daisy on an autumn night, the moonlight bright on the sidewalk where there were no trees. The night was charged with the special excitement that comes with a change of seasons, the cozy house lights glowing into the darkness and the stars lively above. Out of the corner of his eye, Gatsby imagined the sidewalk blocks forming a ladder up to a secret place above the trees; if he ascended alone, he could reach a realm of life’s pure wonder. As Daisy drew close, Gatsby realized that by kissing her, he would forever tie his deepest dreams to her mortal existence; his mind would never again be as boundless as it once was. He lingered in that moment a bit longer, as if awaiting some cosmic signal, and then kissed her—at that instant, she blossomed for him, and his longing was realized. Despite Gatsby’s emotional excess, his words reminded me of something — a vague memory, a half-remembered phrase, that I tried to recall but it slipped away, never to be remembered again."

Only gradually did I become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away. Wondering if he were sick I went over to find out—an unfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door.\n“Is Mr. Gatsby sick?”\n“Nope.” After a pause he added “sir” in a dilatory, grudging way.\n“I hadn’t seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell him Mr. Carraway came over.”\n“Who?” he demanded rudely.\n“Carraway.”\n“Carraway. All right, I’ll tell him.”\nAbruptly he slammed the door.\nMy Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never went into West Egg village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered moderate supplies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that the kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the village was that the new people weren’t servants at all.\nNext day Gatsby called me on the phone.\n“Going away?” I inquired.\n“No, old sport.”\n“I hear you fired all your servants.”\n“I wanted somebody who wouldn’t gossip. Daisy comes over quite often—in the afternoons.”\nSo the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in her eyes.\n“They’re some people Wolfshiem wanted to do something for.

Gradually, I noticed cars turning into his driveway with anticipation, only to leave moments later, looking dejected. Concerned he might be ill, I went to check on him. An unfamiliar butler with a suspicious, unpleasant expression eyed me warily from the doorway. I asked, \"Is Mr. Gatsby unwell?\" He simply replied, \"Nope,\" adding a drawn-out, reluctant \"sir\" after a pause. I explained, \"I haven't seen him around and was a bit concerned. Please tell him Mr. Carraway stopped by.\" He rudely demanded, \"Who?\" I repeated, \"Carraway.\" He acknowledged, \"Carraway. Alright, I'll inform him,\" before abruptly shutting the door in my face. My cleaning woman told me Gatsby had fired all his previous staff a week earlier and hired a new group of about six people. These new employees stayed out of the local village, avoiding interaction or bribes from shopkeepers, and placed small orders over the phone. The boy who delivered groceries reported the kitchen was filthy, and the general consensus locally was that these new people were not actually servants. The following day, Gatsby telephoned me. I asked if he was leaving. He said, \"No, old sport.\" I mentioned hearing about him firing all his servants. He explained, \"I wanted staff who wouldn't spread rumors. Daisy comes over quite frequently now—in the afternoons.\" So, it seemed the entire elaborate setup had collapsed completely, like a house of cards, due to her disapproval. He added, \"They are people Mr. Wolfshiem wanted to help out. They are all family, brothers and sisters. They used to operate a small hotel.\" I responded, \"I understand.\"",

I gradually noticed that cars would drive in expecting festivities, only to leave shortly after in disappointment. Concerned that Gatsby might be unwell, I decided to check on him myself, only to be met by a new, unfriendly butler who eyed me with suspicion. When I asked for Gatsby, the butler answered tersely, and even seemed unfamiliar with my name before rudely shutting the door. Later, I learned from my housekeeper that Gatsby had recently let go of his entire staff, replacing them with a handful of people who kept to themselves and didn’t socialize in the village, instead making only modest orders over the phone. Gossip around town claimed the newcomers didn’t even seem like real servants, and that the kitchen was in disarray. The following day, Gatsby phoned me. When I asked about the staff change, he explained he wanted to avoid gossip because Daisy had been visiting frequently in the afternoons. The extravagant house parties had ceased, collapsing like a house of cards under Daisy’s disapproval. Gatsby added that the new servants were associates of Wolfshiem’s, supposedly siblings who once managed a small hotel. I accepted this explanation."

The butler, answering the phone, loudly declared into the receiver, \"The master's body? My apologies, madam, but we cannot provide it – it is much too hot to handle this afternoon!\" However, what he actually said was simply, \"Yes... Yes... I will see.\" He then placed the receiver down and approached us, slightly gleaming with sweat, to take our stiff straw hats. \"Madame is expecting you in the drawing-room!\" he announced, unnecessarily gesturing towards it. In such intense heat, any superfluous movement felt like an imposition. The drawing-room, well-shaded by awnings, was cool and dimly lit. Daisy and Jordan were reclining on a vast sofa, resembling motionless silver statues weighing down their white dresses against the fanning breeze. \"We are incapable of moving,\" they stated in unison. Jordan's fingers, powdered white over her tanned skin, briefly rested in mine. \"And what about Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?\" I inquired. At that exact moment, I heard his deep, muffled, hoarse voice from the telephone in the hall. Gatsby stood in the center of the deep red rug, looking around with captivated eyes. Daisy watched him, letting out her sweet, captivating laugh; a small cloud of powder drifted up from her chest. Jordan whispered, \"The rumor is that's Tom's mistress on the phone.\" We fell silent. The voice in the hall grew louder with frustration: \"Fine, then, I refuse to sell you the car at all... I have absolutely no obligation to you... and as for bothering me about it during lunch, I absolutely will not tolerate that!\" \"He's just pretending to hang up,\" Daisy remarked sarcastically. \"No, he isn't,\" I corrected her. \"It's a genuine transaction. I happen to know about it.\" Tom burst through the door, his large frame momentarily filling the space, and hurried into the room. \"Mr. Gatsby!\" He extended his wide, flat hand with barely hidden dislike. \"It's a pleasure to see you, sir... Nick...\" \"Get us a cold drink,\" Daisy called out. As he left the room again, she got up, went over to Gatsby, and pulled his face down, kissing him on the mouth. \"You know I am in love with you,\" she whispered. \"You seem to be forgetting there is a lady present,\" Jordan commented. Daisy glanced around uncertainly. \"You should kiss Nick too.\" \"What a crude, common girl!\" Jordan exclaimed. \"I don't care!\" Daisy cried, and began doing a little dance on the brick fireplace. Then she remembered the heat and settled back onto the couch with a look of guilt just as a freshly dressed nurse entered with a small girl. \"Blessed little darling,\" she cooed, holding out her arms. \"Come to your very own mother who adores you.\" The child, released by the nurse, quickly crossed the room and shyly burrowed into her mother's dress. \"My blessed precious! Did mother get powder on your slightly yellow hair? Stand up now, and say—Hello.\" Both Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the child's small, hesitant hand. Afterwards, he continued to look at the child with astonishment. I don't believe he had ever truly accepted her existence before. \"I was dressed before lunch,\" the child said, turning eagerly to Daisy. \"That's because your mother wanted to show you off.\" Her face softened into the single wrinkle of the child's small white neck. \"You are a dream, you are. An absolute little dream.\" \"Yes,\" the child agreed calmly. \"Aunt Jordan is wearing a white dress too.\" \"How do you like your mother's friends?\" Daisy turned her so she faced Gatsby. \"Do you think they are attractive?\" \"Where is Daddy?\" \"She doesn't resemble her father,\" Daisy explained. \"She looks like me. She has my hair and face shape.\" Daisy leaned back onto the couch. The nurse stepped forward and extended her hand. \"Let's go, Pammy.\" \"Goodbye, sweetheart!\" With a reluctant backward glance, the well-behaved child held the nurse's hand and was led out the door, just as Tom returned, carrying four gin rickeys that clinked with ice.",

The butler shouted dramatically into the phone about ‘the master’s body’ being too hot to touch, but in reality, he just said he would see to it, then put down the phone and approached us while wiping away some sweat to collect our hats. He announced, rather unnecessarily, that we were expected in the salon, pointing us in the direction. The awning-shaded room was cool and dim. Daisy and Jordan were lying on a huge sofa, looking like elegant statues pressing down their white dresses, unmoving in the breeze from the fans. They claimed they couldn’t move, speaking as one. Jordan briefly touched my hand with her pale fingers. I asked after Tom Buchanan, referring to him as the athlete, and just then I heard his rough, muffled voice at the hall phone. Gatsby stood on the bright red carpet, taking in everything around him intently, while Daisy giggled as she watched him, sending a cloud of powder into the air. Jordan whispered that the rumor was the woman on the phone was Tom’s mistress. We fell silent as Tom’s voice became loud and irritated, arguing about not selling a car and refusing to be disturbed during lunch. Daisy sarcastically commented that Tom was holding down the receiver, but I corrected her, saying it was a real business deal. Tom then entered the room, filling the doorway with his imposing build, and greeted Gatsby with forced politeness. Daisy promptly asked for cold drinks. As Tom left to get them, Daisy immediately got up, kissed Gatsby passionately, and declared her love. Jordan reminded Daisy of her presence, prompting Daisy to jokingly tell her to kiss me as well, to which Jordan called Daisy crude, but Daisy didn’t care, dancing around until the heat made her sit down just as a newly cleaned nurse led in Daisy’s daughter. Daisy greeted her affectionately, inviting her to come to her mother. The little girl shyly approached Daisy, who fussed over her and introduced her to Gatsby and me. Gatsby seemed stunned by the child's presence, as if he had never believed Daisy truly had a daughter. The child explained she had dressed up specially, and Daisy doted on her, commenting on how the girl resembled herself, not Tom. After a moment, the nurse called for the girl to leave, and she obediently left the room, just as Tom returned with cold drinks clinking with ice."

          "text_segment": "Gatsby took up his drink.\n“They certainly look cool,” he said, with visible tension.\nWe drank in long, greedy swallows.\n“I read somewhere that the sun’s getting hotter every year,” said Tom genially. “It seems that pretty soon the earth’s going to fall into the sun—or wait a minute—it’s just the opposite—the sun’s getting colder every year.\n“Come outside,” he suggested to Gatsby, “I’d like you to have a look at the place.”\nI went with them out to the veranda. On the green Sound, stagnant in the heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea. Gatsby’s eyes followed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed across the bay.\n“I’m right across from you.”\n“So you are.”\nOur eyes lifted over the rose-beds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse of the dog-days alongshore. Slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and the abounding blessed isles.\n“There’s sport for you,” said Tom, nodding. “I’d like to be out there with him for about an hour.”\nWe had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat, and drank down nervous gaiety with the cold ale.\n“What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon?” cried Daisy, “and the day after that, and the next thirty years?”\n“Don’t be morbid,” Jordan said. “Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.”\n“But it’s so hot,” insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, “and everything’s so confused. Let’s all go to town!”\nHer voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding its senselessness into forms.\n“I’ve heard of making a garage out of a stable,” Tom was saying to Gatsby, “but I’m the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage.”\n“Who wants to go to town?” demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby’s eyes floated toward her. “Ah,” she cried, “you look so cool.”\nTheir eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space. With an effort she glanced down at the table.\n“You always look so cool,” she repeated.\nShe had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was astounded. His mouth opened a little, and he looked at Gatsby, and then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as someone he knew a long time ago.\n“You resemble the advertisement of the man,” she went on innocently. “You know the advertisement of the man—”\n“All right,” broke in Tom quickly, “I’m perfectly willing to go to town. Come on—we’re all going to town.”\nHe got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife. No one moved.\n“Come on!” His temper cracked a little. “What’s the matter, anyhow? If we’re going to town, let’s start.”\nHis hand, trembling with his effort at self-control, bore to his lips the last of his glass of ale. Daisy’s voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive.\n“Are we just going to go?” she objected. “Like this? Aren’t we going to let anyone smoke a cigarette first?”\n“Everybody smoked all through lunch.”\n“Oh, let’s have fun,” she begged him. “It’s too hot to fuss.”\nHe didn’t answer.\n“Have it your own way,” she said. “Come on, Jordan.”\nThey went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky. Gatsby started to speak, changed his mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.\n“Have you got your stables here?” asked Gatsby with an effort.\n“About a quarter of a mile down the road.”\n“Oh.”\nA pause.\n“I don’t see the idea of going to town,” broke out Tom savagely. “Women get these notions in their heads—”\n“Shall we take anything to drink?” called Daisy from an upper window.\n“I’ll get some whisky,” answered Tom. He went inside.\nGatsby turned to me rigidly:\n“I can’t say anything in his house, old sport.”\n“She’s got an indiscreet voice,” I remarked. “It’s full of—” I hesitated.\n“Her voice is full of money,” he said suddenly.\nThat was it. I’d never understood before. It was full of money—that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals’ song of it… High in a white palace the king’s daughter, the golden girl…\nTom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and carrying light capes over their arms.\n“Shall we all go in my car?” suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, green leather of the seat. “I ought to have left it in the shade.”\n“Is it standard shift?” demanded Tom.\n“Yes.”\n“Well, you take my coupé and let me drive your car to town.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Gatsby picked up his drink. \"They certainly look refreshing,\" he commented, a clear strain in his voice. We drank down our beverages quickly and eagerly. \"I read somewhere that the sun is heating up every year,\" Tom stated casually. \"It seems the earth is going to collide with the sun relatively soon—or hold on—it’s the reverse—the sun is actually cooling down each year.\"\n\n\"Come outside,\" he suggested to Gatsby, \"I'd like you to see the property.\" I followed them out to the porch. On the green water of the Sound, still and heavy with heat, one small sailboat moved slowly towards the more open sea. Gatsby's gaze followed it briefly; he lifted his hand and pointed across the bay. \"I'm directly opposite your place.\" \"Indeed, you are.\" Our eyes lifted over the rose bushes, the hot lawn, and the unkempt weeds along the shoreline, characteristic of the oppressive summer heat. Slowly, the white sails of the boat moved against the cool blue edge of the sky. Ahead lay the wavy ocean and the many fortunate islands. \"That's a fine way to spend time,\" Tom said, nodding. \"I wouldn't mind being out there with him for an hour or so.\"\n\nWe had lunch in the dining area, which was also darkened to ward off the heat, and we drank down our strained cheerfulness along with the cold ale. \"What are we going to do with ourselves this afternoon?\" Daisy called out, adding, \"and tomorrow, and for the coming thirty years?\" \"Don't be so gloomy,\" Jordan responded. \"Life begins anew when the weather turns crisp in the fall.\" \"But it's so terribly hot,\" Daisy insisted, her voice on the verge of tears, \"and everything is so muddled. Let's all go to the city!\" Her voice pushed through the heat, struggling against it, trying to shape its disorder into something understandable.\n\n\"I've heard of converting a stable into a garage,\" Tom was telling Gatsby, \"but I think I'm the only person who has ever done the reverse and made a garage into a stable.\" \"Who wants to go to the city?\" Daisy demanded persistently. Gatsby's eyes drifted towards her. \"Ah,\" she exclaimed, \"you look so cool.\" Their eyes met, and they stared at each other, momentarily isolated together. With an effort, she looked down at the table. \"You always appear so cool,\" she repeated. She had just confessed her love for him, and Tom Buchanan realized it. He was taken aback. His mouth slightly open, he looked at Gatsby, then back at Daisy, as if he were just now recognizing her after a long time.\n\n\"You remind me of that man in the advertisement,\" she went on artlessly. \"You know, the one in the advertisement—\" \"Alright,\" Tom cut in quickly, \"I am perfectly willing to go to the city. Come on—we're all going to the city.\" He stood up, his eyes still fixed alternately on Gatsby and his wife. No one moved. \"Let's go!\" His self-control fractured slightly. \"What's the delay, anyway? If we're heading to the city, let's leave.\" His hand, shaking with the effort to maintain composure, brought the last drops of his ale to his lips. Daisy's voice prompted us to stand up and walk out onto the scorching gravel driveway. \"Are we just leaving?\" she protested. \"Like this? Aren't we going to allow anyone to have a cigarette first?\" \"Everyone smoked throughout lunch.\" \"Oh, let's just relax,\" she pleaded with him. \"It's too hot for arguing.\" He didn't reply. \"Have it your way,\" she said. \"Come on, Jordan.\" They went upstairs to get ready while the three of us men stood there kicking at the hot stones with our feet. A thin silver curve of the moon was already visible in the western sky. Gatsby started to speak, then changed his mind, but not before Tom turned quickly and faced him expectantly. \"Do you keep your horses here?\" Gatsby asked with difficulty. \"About a quarter of a mile further down the road.\" \"Oh.\" A period of silence followed.\n\n\"I fail to see the purpose of going to the city,\" Tom erupted fiercely. \"Women get these strange ideas in their heads—\" \"Should we bring something to drink?\" Daisy called from an upstairs window. \"I'll get some whiskey,\" Tom answered. He went back inside. Gatsby turned stiffly to me: \"I can't express myself freely in his house, old sport.\" \"Her voice is quite revealing,\" I commented. \"It's full of—\" I hesitated, searching for the right word. \"Her voice is full of money,\" he said suddenly. That was the explanation. I had never understood it until then. It was filled with the sound of money—that was the unending appeal that rose and fell within it, the clink of it, the song of cymbals it created… High in a white mansion, the king’s daughter, the girl made of gold… Tom emerged from the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed by Daisy and Jordan wearing small, tight hats made of metallic material and carrying light wraps draped over their arms. \"Shall we all go in my car?\" Gatsby suggested. He felt the hot, green leather of the seat. \"I really should have parked it in the shade.\" \"Is it a stick shift?\" Tom demanded. \"Yes.\" \"Alright, you take my coupe, and I'll drive your car into town.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Gatsby picked up his drink. \"They really do look cool,\" he commented, though tension was plain on his face. We all drank in greedy gulps. Tom then remarked, in a friendly way, \"I read somewhere the sun gets hotter every year. Seems like soon the earth will fall into it—or maybe it’s the opposite, it’s getting colder every year.\" Turning to Gatsby, Tom said, \"Come outside, I want you to see the place.\" I accompanied them to the porch. Out on the green water, which was stagnant in the heat, a single sailboat crawled slowly toward the cooler open sea. Gatsby watched it for a moment, then gestured across the bay. \"I’m right across from you,\" he said. \"So you are,\" Tom replied. We looked over the rose garden, the scorched lawn, and the messy shoreline. The boat’s white sails moved slowly against the deep blue sky, beyond which were the inviting ocean and distant islands. \"That’s the life,\" Tom said, nodding. \"I’d love to be out there for an hour.\" We had lunch in the dark dining room, drinking cold ale and trying to be cheerful but feeling uneasy. Daisy asked, \"What should we do this afternoon? And what about the decades ahead?\" Jordan told her not to be morbid, saying life restarts when fall comes. Daisy, nearly in tears, complained about the heat and suggested they all go to town. She struggled to make her voice cut through the stifling air. Tom then joked to Gatsby about converting a garage into a stable, while Daisy pressed, \"Who wants to go to town?\" Gatsby’s gaze turned to her, and she exclaimed, \"You look so cool.\" The two locked eyes, alone in their own world, before Daisy looked down and repeated, \"You always look so cool.\" She had told Gatsby she loved him, and Tom realized it, shocked by the revelation. Daisy went on to say Gatsby resembled the man from an advertisement. Tom abruptly insisted they all go to town, tense as he glanced between his wife and Gatsby. After no one moved, Tom snapped, urging everyone to get ready to leave, struggling to keep his composure as he finished his ale. Daisy’s insistence prompted everyone to get up and head outside, although she complained about rushing and wanted to have a cigarette first, saying it was too hot to quarrel. Tom gave no answer, so Daisy told Jordan to come with her, and they went upstairs to prepare, leaving the men standing outside. A crescent moon was already visible in the western sky. Gatsby began to speak but stopped, drawing Tom’s attention. Gatsby asked Tom about his stables, learned their location, and then Tom, frustrated, grumbled about going to town. Then Daisy shouted down about drinks, and Tom went to get some whisky. Rigidly, Gatsby told me he couldn’t talk freely at Tom’s house. I noted Daisy’s voice was full of something, and Gatsby replied, \"Her voice is full of money.\" In that moment, I finally understood—it was the elusive, magnetic quality in her voice, like the jingle of coins. Tom came back with a whisky bottle, followed by Daisy and Jordan, both in shiny hats and light capes. Gatsby suggested everyone travel in his car, but after checking its hot leather seats, Tom arranged for Gatsby to take his coupe while Tom would drive Gatsby’s car into town."

After a moment the proprietor emerged from the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.\n“Let’s have some gas!” cried Tom roughly. “What do you think we stopped for—to admire the view?”\n“I’m sick,” said Wilson without moving. “Been sick all day.”\n“What’s the matter?”\n“I’m all run down.”\n“Well, shall I help myself?” Tom demanded. “You sounded well enough on the phone.”\nWith an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and, breathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his face was green.\n“I didn’t mean to interrupt your lunch,” he said. “But I need money pretty bad, and I was wondering what you were going to do with your old car.”\n“How do you like this one?” inquired Tom. “I bought it last week.”\n“It’s a nice yellow one,” said Wilson, as he strained at the handle.\n“Like to buy it?”\n“Big chance,” Wilson smiled faintly. “No, but I could make some money on the other.”\n“What do you want money for, all of a sudden?”\n“I’ve been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and I want to go West.”\n“Your wife does,” exclaimed Tom, startled.\n“She’s been talking about it for ten years.” He rested for a moment against the pump, shading his eyes. “And now she’s going whether she wants to or not. I’m going to get her away.”\nThe coupé flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a waving hand.\n“What do I owe you?” demanded Tom harshly.\n“I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,” remarked Wilson. “That’s why I want to get away. That’s why I been bothering you about the car.”\n“What do I owe you?”\n“Dollar twenty.”\nThe relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had a bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadn’t alighted on Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world, and the shock had made him physically sick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour before—and it occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well. Wilson was so sick that he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty—as if he had just got some poor girl with child.\n“I’ll let you have that car,” said Tom.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "As the billboard featuring Doctor T. J. Eckleburg’s faded eyes came into view down the road, I was reminded of Gatsby’s warning about our gasoline level. “We have enough gas to reach town,” Tom declared. “But there’s a garage right here,” Jordan objected. “I don’t want to get stuck in this scorching heat.” Tom impatiently slammed on the brakes, bringing us to a sudden, dusty stop beneath Wilson’s sign. After a moment, the proprietor emerged from inside his establishment, staring hollowly at the car. “Give us some gas!” Tom demanded roughly. “Why do you think we stopped—to admire the scenery?” “I’m ill,” Wilson stated without moving. “Been unwell all day.” “What’s wrong?” “I’m completely worn out.” “Well, should I just serve myself?” Tom challenged. “You sounded well enough on the phone.” With effort, Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and, breathing heavily, struggled to unscrew the tank cap. In the sunlight, his face had a green tint. “I didn’t mean to interrupt your meal,” he said. “But I’m in serious need of money, and I was curious what you planned to do with your old car.” “How about this one?” Tom inquired. “I got it last week.” “It’s a lovely yellow car,” Wilson commented, pulling at the handle. “Interested in buying it?” “Highly unlikely,” Wilson offered a weak smile. “No, but I could make a decent profit on the other one.” “Why the sudden need for funds?” “I’ve been here too long. I want to leave. My wife and I want to move out West.” “Your wife does?” Tom exclaimed, startled. “She’s been talking about it for ten years.” He paused briefly, leaning against the pump and shielding his eyes. “And now she’s going whether she wants to or not. I’m taking her away.” The coupé zipped past us in a swirl of dust, and a hand waved from inside. “How much do I owe you?” Tom demanded sharply. “I’ve just discovered something strange in the last couple of days,” Wilson remarked. “That’s why I need to get away. That’s why I’ve been bothering you about the car.” “What is the total?” “One dollar twenty.” The intense, oppressive heat was beginning to muddle my thoughts, and I had a difficult moment there before realizing his suspicions hadn’t landed on Tom. He had learned that Myrtle had a separate existence apart from him, in another world, and the shock had physically incapacitated him. I looked at him and then at Tom, who had made a similar discovery less than an hour prior—and it struck me that there was no difference between individuals, regardless of intelligence or background, as profound as the distinction between the sick and the healthy. Wilson looked so ill that he appeared guilty, unforgivably guilty—as if he had just impregnated some unfortunate girl. “You can have that car,” Tom said.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As Doctor T. J. Eckleburg’s faded eyes appeared ahead, I remembered Gatsby warning us about the gas. Tom assured us we had enough fuel to make it into the city, but Jordan was worried and pointed out there was a garage nearby, saying she didn’t want to be stranded in the intense heat. Tom, annoyed, abruptly braked and brought the car to a stop in the dusty lot under Wilson’s sign. After a moment, Wilson, the owner, came out looking exhausted and stared at the vehicle. \n\nTom rudely told him to bring gas, asking if he thought they’d stopped just to look around. Wilson replied that he was ill and had been feeling that way all day. Tom asked what was wrong, and Wilson said he was simply worn out. Tom threatened to pump the gas himself, noting Wilson hadn’t sounded sick on the phone. With effort, Wilson left the doorway’s shade and, out of breath, unscrewed the gas cap. In the sunlight, his face looked sickly green. He apologized for the interruption, explained that he was short on money, and wondered what Tom planned to do with his old car.\n\nTom asked how he liked the new car, saying he had bought it the previous week. Wilson called it a nice yellow car while pumping gas. Tom asked if he wanted to buy it, and Wilson weakly joked that he’d rather make money on Tom’s old vehicle. Tom questioned his sudden need for money. Wilson explained he’d stayed in the area too long and wanted to leave, mentioning that both he and his wife wanted to go west. Tom was surprised and said it was only Wilson’s wife who wanted to. Wilson said she’d mentioned it for ten years and now he was taking her, regardless. Then a coupé sped by, scattering dust and someone waving.\n\nTom harshly asked how much he owed. Wilson, hinting at recent troubling realizations, said it was those worries that made him want to leave and ask about the car. Tom repeated his question, and Wilson said, “A dollar twenty.” The oppressive heat made me feel disoriented, and for a moment I worried Wilson suspected Tom. But I realized Wilson had only just learned that Myrtle, his wife, had another life away from him, which had made him physically ill. I glanced at Wilson and Tom, recalling Tom had just made a similar discovery, and I thought the biggest difference among people was not intelligence or race, but whether they were well or sick. Wilson, looking extremely unwell, seemed somehow guilty, as if he’d wronged some young woman. Tom then offered to let him have his old car."

Over the ash-heaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil, but I perceived, after a moment, that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away.\nIn one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little, and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car. So engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed, and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture. Her expression was curiously familiar—it was an expression I had often seen on women’s faces, but on Myrtle Wilson’s face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on Jordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife.\nThere is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping precipitately from his control. Instinct made him step on the accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in sight of the easygoing blue coupé.\n“Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,” suggested Jordan. “I love New York on summer afternoons when everyone’s away. There’s something very sensuous about it—overripe, as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands.”\nThe word “sensuous” had the effect of further disquieting Tom, but before he could invent a protest the coupé came to a stop, and Daisy signalled us to draw up alongside.\n“Where are we going?” she cried.\n“How about the movies?”\n“It’s so hot,” she complained. “You go. We’ll ride around and meet you after.” With an effort her wit rose faintly. “We’ll meet you on some corner. I’ll be the man smoking two cigarettes.”\n“We can’t argue about it here,” Tom said impatiently, as a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind us. “You follow me to the south side of Central Park, in front of the Plaza.”\nSeveral times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight. I think he was afraid they would dart down a side-street and out of his life forever.\nBut they didn’t. And we all took the less explicable step of engaging the parlour of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.\nThe prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into that room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in the course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back. The notion originated with Daisy’s suggestion that we hire five bathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as “a place to have a mint julep.” Each of us said over and over that it was a “crazy idea”—we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought, or pretended to think, that we were being very funny…\nThe room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four o’clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from the Park. Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us, fixing her hair.\n“It’s a swell suite,” whispered Jordan respectfully, and everyone laughed.\n“Open another window,” commanded Daisy, without turning around.\n“There aren’t any more.”\n“Well, we’d better telephone for an axe—”\n“The thing to do is to forget about the heat,” said Tom impatiently. “You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it.”\nHe unrolled the bottle of whisky from the towel and put it on the table.\n“Why not let her alone, old sport?” remarked Gatsby. “You’re the one that wanted to come to town.”\nThere was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered, “Excuse me”—but this time no one laughed.\n“I’ll pick it up,” I offered.\n“I’ve got it.” Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered “Hum!” in an interested way, and tossed the book on a chair.\n“That’s a great expression of yours, isn’t it?” said Tom sharply.\n“What is?”\n“All this ‘old sport’ business. Where’d you pick that up?”\n“Now see here, Tom,” said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, “if you’re going to make personal remarks I won’t stay here a minute. Call up and order some ice for the mint julep.”\nAs Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn’s Wedding March from the ballroom below.\n“Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!” cried Jordan dismally.\n“Still—I was married in the middle of June,” Daisy remembered. “Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?”\n“Biloxi,” he answered shortly.\n“A man named Biloxi. ‘Blocks’ Biloxi, and he made boxes—that’s a fact—and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.”\n“They carried him into my house,” appended Jordan, “because we lived just two doors from the church. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy told him he had to get out. The day after he left Daddy died.” After a moment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent, “There wasn’t any connection.”\n“I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,” I remarked.\n“That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he left. He gave me an aluminium putter that I use today.”",

In a window above the garage, the curtains had been slightly parted, and Myrtle Wilson was looking down at the car. She was so engrossed in watching that she didn't realize she was being watched, and one emotion after another appeared on her face, like details developing in a slow photograph. Her expression seemed strangely familiar—it was one I had often seen on women's faces, but on Myrtle Wilson's, it appeared meaningless and puzzling until I understood that her eyes, wide with fearful jealousy, were fixed not on Tom but on Jordan Baker, whom she believed to be his wife.\nThere's no bewilderment quite like that of a simple mind, and as we drove off, Tom was experiencing sharp pangs of panic. His wife and his mistress, both seemingly secure and untouchable until an hour ago, were rapidly slipping away from his control. Instinctively, he pressed the accelerator with the dual aim of catching up with Daisy and leaving Wilson behind. We sped towards Astoria at fifty miles an hour until we saw the relaxed blue coupé among the thin girders of the elevated train line.\n“Those big movie theaters around Fiftieth Street are great,” suggested Jordan. “I adore New York on summer afternoons when everyone is out of town. There’s something deeply sensual about it—overripe, as if all sorts of strange, pleasant things are about to fall into your lap.”\nThe word “sensuous” seemed to unsettle Tom even more, but before he could object, the coupé stopped, and Daisy signaled us to pull up next to them.\n“Where are we headed?” she called out.\n“How about seeing a movie?”\n“It’s so hot,” she complained. “You two go. We’ll drive around and meet you later.” With a slight effort, her wit emerged. “We’ll meet you on some corner. I’ll be the one smoking two cigarettes.”\n“We can’t debate this here,” Tom said irritably, as a truck behind us emitted a loud, harsh whistle. “Follow me to the south side of Central Park, by the Plaza.”\nSeveral times, he glanced back for their car, and if traffic slowed them down, he eased up until they were visible again. I suspected he was afraid they might turn down a side street and vanish from his life forever.\nBut they didn’t. And we all took the less logical step of renting a parlour suite in the Plaza Hotel.\nThe lengthy and heated disagreement that ultimately led us into that room is a blur, although I distinctly remember the physical sensation of my underwear constantly riding up like a damp snake around my legs and occasional cool drops of sweat trickling down my back.

Daisy went to the mirror and stood facing away from us, adjusting her hair.\n“It’s a wonderful suite,” Jordan whispered respectfully, and everyone laughed.\n“Open another window,” Daisy ordered without turning around.\n“There are no more.”\n“Well, we should probably phone for an axe—”\n“The best thing is to stop thinking about the heat,” Tom said impatiently. “You just make it ten times worse by complaining.”\nHe unwrapped the bottle of whisky from the towel and placed it on the table.\n“Why not leave her be, old sport?” Gatsby commented. “You were the one who wanted to come into the city.”\nThere was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from its hook and hit the floor with a splash. Jordan then whispered, “Excuse me”—but this time, nobody laughed.\n“I’ll get it,” I offered.\n“I have it.” Gatsby examined the snapped string, mumbled “Hmm!” with interest, and tossed the book onto a chair.\n“That’s a rather distinctive way of speaking, isn’t it?” Tom said sharply.\n“What is?”\n“All this ‘old sport’ talk. Where did you pick that up?”\n“Now listen, Tom,” Daisy said, turning from the mirror, “if you’re going to make rude personal comments, I’m leaving immediately. Call down and order some ice for the mint juleps.”\nAs Tom picked up the receiver, the stifling heat seemed to erupt into noise, and we heard the grand, imposing chords of Mendelssohn’s Wedding March drifting up from the ballroom below.\n“Imagine marrying someone in this heat!” Jordan exclaimed gloomily.\n“Still—I got married in the middle of June,” Daisy recalled. “Louisville in June! Someone fainted. Who was it who fainted, Tom?”\n“Biloxi,” he answered curtly.\n“A man named Biloxi. ‘Blocks’ Biloxi, and he made boxes—that’s true—and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.”\n“They carried him into my house,” Jordan added, “because we lived only two houses down from the church. And he stayed for three weeks, until Daddy finally told him he had to leave.

He was a friend of Daisy’s.”\n“He was not,” she denied. “I’d never seen him before. He came down in the private car.”\n“Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville. Asa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room for him.”\nJordan smiled.\n“He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of your class at Yale.”\nTom and I looked at each other blankly.\n“Biloxi?”\n“First place, we didn’t have any president—”\nGatsby’s foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.\n“By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you’re an Oxford man.”\n“Not exactly.”\n“Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.”\n“Yes—I went there.”\nA pause. Then Tom’s voice, incredulous and insulting:\n“You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven.”\nAnother pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but the silence was unbroken by his “thank you” and the soft closing of the door. This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.\n“I told you I went there,” said Gatsby.\n“I heard you, but I’d like to know when.”\n“It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That’s why I can’t really call myself an Oxford man.”\nTom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. But we were all looking at Gatsby.\n“It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the armistice,” he continued. “We could go to any of the universities in England or France.”\nI wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one of those renewals of complete faith in him that I’d experienced before.\nDaisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.\n“Open the whisky, Tom,” she ordered, “and I’ll make you a mint julep. Then you won’t seem so stupid to yourself… Look at the mint!”\n“Wait a minute,” snapped Tom, “I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question.”\n“Go on,” Gatsby said politely.\n“What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?”\nThey were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.\n“He isn’t causing a row,” Daisy looked desperately from one to the other. “You’re causing a row. Please have a little self-control.”\n“Self-control!” repeated Tom incredulously. “I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife. Well, if that’s the idea you can count me out… Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next they’ll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white.”\nFlushed with his impassioned gibberish, he saw himself standing alone on the last barrier of civilization.\n“We’re all white here,” murmured Jordan.\n“I know I’m not very popular. I don’t give big parties. I suppose you’ve got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any friends—in the modern world.”\nAngry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened his mouth. The transition from libertine to prig was so complete.\n“I’ve got something to tell you, old sport—” began Gatsby. But Daisy guessed at his intention.\n“Please don’t!” she interrupted helplessly. “Please let’s all go home. Why don’t we all go home?”\n“That’s a good idea,” I got up. “Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.”\n“I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.”\n“Your wife doesn’t love you,” said Gatsby. “She’s never loved you. She loves me.”\n“You must be crazy!” exclaimed Tom automatically.\nGatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.\n“She never loved you, do you hear?” he cried. “She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone except me!”\nAt this point Jordan and I tried to go, but Tom and Gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that we remain—as though neither of them had anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emotions.\n“Sit down, Daisy,” Tom’s voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal note. “What’s been going on? I want to hear all about it.”\n“I told you what’s been going on,” said Gatsby. “Going on for five years—and you didn’t know.”\nTom turned to Daisy sharply.\n“You’ve been seeing this fellow for five years?”\n“Not seeing,” said Gatsby. “No, we couldn’t meet. But both of us loved each other all that time, old sport, and you didn’t know. I used to laugh sometimes”—but there was no laughter in his eyes—“to think that you didn’t know.”\n“Oh—that’s all.” Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman and leaned back in his chair.\n“You’re crazy!” he exploded. “I can’t speak about what happened five years ago, because I didn’t know Daisy then—and I’ll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door. But all the rest of that’s a God damned lie. Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now.”\n“No,” said Gatsby, shaking his head.\n“She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her head and doesn’t know what she’s doing.” He nodded sagely. “And what’s more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time.”\n“You’re revolting,” said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice, dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: “Do you know why we left Chicago? I’m surprised that they didn’t treat you to the story of that little spree.”\nGatsby walked over and stood beside her.\n“Daisy, that’s all over now,” he said earnestly. “It doesn’t matter any more. Just tell him the truth—that you never loved him—and it’s all wiped out forever.”\nShe looked at him blindly. “Why—how could I love him—possibly?”\n“You never loved him.”\nShe hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal, as though she realized at last what she was doing—and as though she had never, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done now. It was too late.\n“I never loved him,” she said, with perceptible reluctance.\n“Not at Kapiolani?” demanded Tom suddenly.\n“No.”\nFrom the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up on hot waves of air.\n“Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry?” There was a husky tenderness in his tone… “Daisy?”\n“Please don’t.” Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it. She looked at Gatsby. “There, Jay,” she said—but her hand as she tried to light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette and the burning match on the carpet.\n“Oh, you want too much!” she cried to Gatsby. “I love you now—isn’t that enough? I can’t help what’s past.” She began to sob helplessly. “I did love him once—but I loved you too.”\nGatsby’s eyes opened and closed.\n“You loved me too?” he repeated.\n“Even that’s a lie,” said Tom savagely. “She didn’t know you were alive. Why—there’s things between Daisy and me that you’ll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget.”\nThe words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.\n“I want to speak to Daisy alone,” he insisted. “She’s all excited now—”\n“Even alone I can’t say I never loved Tom,” she admitted in a pitiful voice. “It wouldn’t be true.”\n“Of course it wouldn’t,” agreed Tom.\nShe turned to her husband.\n“As if it mattered to you,” she said.\n“Of course it matters. I’m going to take better care of you from now on.”\n“You don’t understand,” said Gatsby, with a touch of panic. “You’re not going to take care of her any more.”\n“I’m not?” Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to control himself now. “Why’s that?”\n“Daisy’s leaving you.”\n“Nonsense.”\n“I am, though,” she said with a visible effort.\n“She’s not leaving me!” Tom’s words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby. “Certainly not for a common swindler who’d have to steal the ring he put on her finger.”\n“I won’t stand this!” cried Daisy. “Oh, please let’s get out.”\n“Who are you, anyhow?” broke out Tom. “You’re one of that bunch that hangs around with Meyer Wolfshiem—that much I happen to know. I’ve made a little investigation into your affairs—and I’ll carry it further tomorrow.”\n“You can suit yourself about that, old sport,” said Gatsby steadily.\n“I found out what your ‘drugstores’ were.” He turned to us and spoke rapidly. “He and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of side-street drugstores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter. That’s one of his little stunts. I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw him, and I wasn’t far wrong.”\n“What about it?” said Gatsby politely. “I guess your friend Walter Chase wasn’t too proud to come in on it.”\n“And you left him in the lurch, didn’t you? You let him go to jail for a month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the subject of you.”\n“He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old sport.”\n“Don’t you call me ‘old sport’!” cried Tom. Gatsby said nothing. “Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but Wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth.”\nThat unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby’s face.\n“That drugstore business was just small change,” continued Tom slowly, “but you’ve got something on now that Walter’s afraid to tell me about.”\nI glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her husband, and at Jordan, who had begun to balance an invisible but absorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back to Gatsby—and was startled at his expression. He looked—and this is said in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden—as if he had “killed a man.” For a moment the set of his face could be described in just that fantastic way.\nIt passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been made. But with every word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave that up, and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room.\nThe voice begged again to go.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "As the ceremony concluded, the music faded, and then a loud cheer carried through the window, followed by scattered shouts of encouragement and finally the sound of jazz signaling the start of dancing. \"We're aging,\" Daisy remarked. \"If we were younger, we'd join them.\" Jordan cautioned her, \"Remember Biloxi.\" She then asked Tom, \"Where did you meet him?\" Tom paused, thinking hard. \"Biloxi? I didn't know him. He was a friend of Daisy's.\" \"He was not,\" she countered. \"I'd never encountered him before. He arrived in a private train car.\" \"Well, he claimed to know you. He stated he grew up in Louisville. Asa Bird brought him along at the last moment and inquired if we had space for him.\" Jordan smiled wryly. \"He was likely just getting a ride home. He told me he was the president of your class at Yale.\" Tom and I exchanged blank looks. \"Biloxi?\" Tom added, \"For starters, we didn't even have a president—\" Gatsby's foot tapped a quick, nervous rhythm, and Tom suddenly fixed his gaze on him. \"Speaking of which, Mr. Gatsby, I hear you attended Oxford.\" \"Not exactly,\" Gatsby replied. \"Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.\" \"Yes—I was there.\" A silence followed. Then Tom's voice, laced with disbelief and condescension, cut through: \"You must have gone around the same time Biloxi went to New Haven.\" Another pause ensued. A waiter arrived with crushed mint and ice after knocking, but his quiet \"thank you\" and the gentle closing of the door didn't break the silence. This significant piece of information was finally about to be clarified. \"I mentioned I went there,\" Gatsby stated. \"I heard you, but I'd like to know when.\" \"It was in nineteen-nineteen, and I only remained for five months. That's why I hesitate to call myself an Oxford man.\" Tom surveyed us to see if we shared his skepticism. Instead, we were all focused on Gatsby. \"It was an opportunity offered to some officers after the armistice,\" he explained. \"We had the option of attending any university in England or France.\" A surge of my earlier complete faith in him returned, and I felt like getting up to congratulate him. Daisy rose, offering a slight smile, and approached the table. \"Open the whisky, Tom,\" she instructed, \"and I'll mix you a mint julep. That way, you might not feel so foolish… Look at the mint!\" \"Hold on,\" Tom snapped, \"I have one more question for Mr. Gatsby.\" \"Proceed,\" Gatsby replied courteously. \"Just what kind of trouble are you trying to stir up in my home?\" At last, their conflict was out in the open, and Gatsby seemed ready for it. \"He isn't causing trouble,\" Daisy said, glancing desperately between them. \"You are. Please try to control yourself.\" \"Self-control!\" Tom echoed, disbelievingly. \"I suppose the modern fashion is to just sit back and allow some nobody from nowhere to make love to your wife. Well, if that's the trend, count me out… Nowadays, people start by ridiculing family life and traditional values, and next thing you know, they'll discard everything and allow intermarriage between races.\" Flushed with the intensity of his irrational outburst, he pictured himself as the last defender of civilization. \"We're all white here,\" Jordan murmured flatly. \"I know I'm not popular. I don't host lavish parties. I guess you have to turn your house into a pigsty to attract friends—in today's world.\" Despite my anger, and everyone else's, I was tempted to laugh every time he spoke. His transformation from a pleasure-seeker to a moralizer was absolute. \"I have something to tell you, old sport—\" Gatsby began, but Daisy anticipated his intention. \"Please don't!\" she interrupted pleadingly. \"Please, let's all go home. Why don't we just leave?\" \"That's a good idea,\" I agreed, standing up. \"Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.\" \"I want to hear what Mr. Gatsby intends to tell me.\" \"Your wife doesn’t love you,\" Gatsby declared. \"She’s never loved you. She loves me.\" \"You must be insane!\" Tom exclaimed automatically. Gatsby shot to his feet, alive with emotion. \"She never loved you, do you understand?\" he cried. \"She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a terrible mistake, but in her heart she has only ever loved me!\" At this point, Jordan and I attempted to leave, but Tom and Gatsby adamantly insisted we stay, competitive in their resolve—as if they had nothing to hide and we would benefit from witnessing their emotions firsthand. \"Sit down, Daisy,\" Tom's voice strained unsuccessfully for a commanding, paternal tone. \"What has been happening? I want to hear everything.\" \"I told you what's been happening,\" Gatsby said. \"It's been going on for five years—and you were oblivious.\" Tom turned sharply to Daisy. \"You've been seeing this man for five years?\" \"Not seeing,\" Gatsby clarified. \"No, we couldn't meet. But we loved each other the entire time, old sport, and you never knew. Sometimes I used to chuckle\"—though there was no hint of laughter in his eyes—\"thinking that you didn't know.\" \"Oh—is that all.\" Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman and leaned back. \"You're insane!\" he burst out. \"I can't comment on what transpired five years ago, as I didn't know Daisy then—and I'll be damned if I can see how you got near her unless you were delivering groceries to the back door. But everything else is an absolute lie. Daisy loved me when she married me, and she loves me now.\" \"No,\" Gatsby countered, shaking his head. \"She does, though. The problem is that occasionally she gets foolish notions and acts impulsively.\" He nodded sagely. \"And furthermore, I love Daisy too. Occasionally I go off on a binge and make a fool of myself, but I always return, and in my heart, I love her constantly.\" \"You are disgusting,\" Daisy said, turning to me. Her voice, dropping an octave, filled the room with intense scorn: \"Do you know why we left Chicago? I'm surprised they haven't recounted the tale of that little binge for you.\" Gatsby approached and stood beside her. \"Daisy, that's all behind us now,\" he said sincerely. \"It doesn't matter anymore. Just tell him the truth—that you never loved him—and it will be erased forever.\" She stared at him blankly. \"Why—how could I possibly have loved him?\" \"You never loved him,\" Gatsby repeated. She hesitated. Her eyes sought out Jordan and me with a look of appeal, as though she finally grasped the magnitude of the situation—and perhaps as though she had never intended for things to escalate this far. But it was done now; it was too late. \"I never loved him,\" she stated, with noticeable reluctance. \"Not at Kapiolani?\" Tom demanded suddenly. \"No.\" From the ballroom below, muffled, heavy chords drifted up on the warm air. \"Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry?\" There was a rough tenderness in his tone… \"Daisy?\" \"Please stop.\" Her voice was cold, but the bitterness had vanished. She looked at Gatsby. \"There, Jay,\" she said—but her hand trembled as she attempted to light a cigarette. Abruptly, she flung the cigarette and the lit match onto the carpet. \"Oh, you demand too much!\" she cried to Gatsby. \"I love you *now*—isn't that sufficient? I cannot change the past.\" She began to sob uncontrollably. \"I *did* love him once—but I loved you *too*.\" Gatsby's eyes widened and closed. \"You loved me too?\" he repeated, stunned. \"Even that's a lie,\" Tom stated brutally. \"She wasn't even aware you were alive. Listen—there are things between Daisy and me that you will never comprehend, things neither of us can ever forget.\" His words seemed to physically wound Gatsby. \"I must speak to Daisy alone,\" he insisted. \"She's too upset right now—\" \"Even alone, I can't claim I never loved Tom,\" she confessed in a weak voice. \"It wouldn't be honest.\" \"Naturally it wouldn't,\" Tom agreed. She turned to her husband. \"As if that matters to you,\" she said. \"Of course it matters. I'm going to start taking better care of you from this moment on.\" \"You don't understand,\" Gatsby said, a hint of panic in his voice. \"You are no longer going to take care of her.\" \"I'm not?\" Tom widened his eyes and laughed, now able to control his emotions. \"Why is that?\" \"Daisy is leaving you.\" \"Nonsense.\" \"I am, though,\" she confirmed with visible effort. \"She is not leaving me!\" Tom's words suddenly bore down on Gatsby. \"Certainly not for a common criminal who would have to steal the ring he placed on her finger.\" \"I won't tolerate this!\" Daisy cried. \"Oh, please, let's just get out of here.\" \"Who exactly are you, anyway?\" Tom burst out. \"You're part of that crowd associated with Meyer Wolfshiem—that much I'm aware of. I've conducted a small inquiry into your dealings—and I'll continue it tomorrow.\" \"Feel free to do as you please, old sport,\" Gatsby replied calmly. \"I discovered the truth about your 'drugstores'.\" He turned to us and spoke quickly. \"He and this Wolfshiem acquired numerous small pharmacies on side streets here and in Chicago and illegally sold grain alcohol over the counter. That's one of his schemes. I suspected him of being a bootlegger the moment I saw him, and I wasn't far off.\" \"What of it?\" Gatsby said politely. \"I imagine your friend Walter Chase wasn't too proud to get involved.\" \"And you abandoned him, didn't you? You let him spend a month in jail in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear what Walter says about you.\" \"He came to us completely broke. He was quite happy to earn some money, old sport.\" \"Don't call me 'old sport'!\" Tom shouted. Gatsby remained silent. \"Walter could also report you for violating betting laws, but Wolfshiem intimidated him into silence.\" That familiar, yet unsettling, look returned to Gatsby's face. \"That drugstore business was just minor stuff,\" Tom continued slowly, \"but you're currently involved in something bigger that Walter is afraid to mention to me.\" I glanced at Daisy, who was staring in terror between Gatsby and her husband, and at Jordan, who was attempting to balance an unseen but engrossing object on her chin. Then I looked back at Gatsby—and was startled by his expression. He appeared—and I say this with absolute contempt for the nonsensical rumors from his parties—as if he had \"killed a man.\" For a brief moment, the cast of his face could only be described in that extraordinary manner. It passed, and he began speaking rapidly and emotionally to Daisy, denying everything, defending his reputation against accusations that hadn't actually been voiced. But with each word, she withdrew further into herself, so he stopped, and only the dying dream persisted as the afternoon faded, struggling futilely, without despair, toward that distant voice across the room. That voice again pleaded to leave.",

Daisy remarked that they were getting old; if they were young, they would join in the dancing. Jordan brought up Biloxi, asking Tom where he knew him from, but Tom was perplexed and said Biloxi was a friend of Daisy’s, which Daisy denied. According to Tom, Biloxi claimed to be from Louisville and was introduced by Asa Bird at the last moment as a guest. Jordan suggested Biloxi was likely just hitching a ride; he even falsely claimed he was the president of Tom’s Yale class, which both Tom and Nick found dubious because there hadn’t been such a president. Turning to Gatsby, Tom questioned his claim of having gone to Oxford, which Gatsby clarified, saying he attended after the war for five months, part of a program for officers, which is why he didn’t call himself a true Oxford man. Tom, unconvinced, looked to the others for support, but everyone was focused on Gatsby, who explained further. Nick felt a renewed trust in Gatsby."

He had slept through the heat until after five, when he strolled over to the garage, and found George Wilson sick in his office—really sick, pale as his own pale hair and shaking all over. Michaelis advised him to go to bed, but Wilson refused, saying that he’d miss a lot of business if he did. While his neighbour was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke out overhead.\n“I’ve got my wife locked in up there,” explained Wilson calmly. “She’s going to stay there till the day after tomorrow, and then we’re going to move away.”\nMichaelis was astonished; they had been neighbours for four years, and Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement. Generally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn’t working, he sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed along the road. When anyone spoke to him he invariably laughed in an agreeable, colourless way. He was his wife’s man and not his own.\nSo naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson wouldn’t say a word—instead he began to throw curious, suspicious glances at his visitor and ask him what he’d been doing at certain times on certain days. Just as the latter was getting uneasy, some workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant, and Michaelis took the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he didn’t. He supposed he forgot to, that’s all. When he came outside again, a little after seven, he was reminded of the conversation because he heard Mrs. Wilson’s voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in the garage.\n“Beat me!” he heard her cry. “Throw me down and beat me, you dirty little coward!”\nA moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and shouting—before he could move from his door the business was over.\nThe “death car” as the newspapers called it, didn’t stop; it came out of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, and then disappeared around the next bend. Mavro Michaelis wasn’t even sure of its colour—he told the first policeman that it was light green. The other car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark blood with the dust.\nMichaelis and this man reached her first, but when they had torn open her shirtwaist, still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap, and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped a little at the corners, as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The main witness at the official inquiry was the young Greek, Michaelis, who operated the coffee shop situated next to the valley of ashes. He had slept through the hot part of the day, waking up after five o'clock. He then took a walk over to the garage and found George Wilson unwell in his office—truly sick, looking as pale as his light-colored hair and shaking uncontrollably. Michaelis advised him to get some rest, but Wilson refused, claiming he would lose significant business if he did. While his neighbor was trying to convince him, a loud disturbance occurred upstairs. \"I've got my wife locked up there,\" Wilson calmly explained. \"She's going to remain there until the day after tomorrow, and then we plan to move away.\" Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbors for four years, and Wilson had never seemed even slightly capable of making such a declaration. Typically, he was one of those weary men: when he wasn't working, he sat on a chair in the doorway, watching the people and cars that went by on the road. When someone spoke to him, he consistently responded with a pleasant, monotone laugh. He seemed more his wife's man than his own person. Understandably, Michaelis attempted to find out what had happened, but Wilson wouldn't reveal anything—instead, he began directing strange, distrustful looks at his visitor and questioning him about his activities at specific times on previous days. Just as Michaelis started feeling uncomfortable, some workmen heading for his restaurant passed by the door, and Michaelis seized the chance to leave, intending to return later. However, he didn't. He supposed he simply forgot, that's all. When he stepped outside again, a little after seven, he was reminded of their conversation because he heard Mrs. Wilson's voice, loud and scolding, coming from downstairs in the garage. \"Hit me!\" he heard her scream. \"Knock me down and beat me, you pathetic little coward!\" A moment later, she rushed out into the dim light, flailing her arms and shouting—before he could move from his door, the terrible event was finished. The vehicle the newspapers dubbed the \"death car\" did not stop; it emerged from the deepening darkness, seemed to falter tragically for a moment, and then vanished around the next bend. Mavro Michaelis wasn't even certain of its color—he told the first police officer that it was light green. The other car, the one traveling toward New York, stopped about a hundred yards beyond, and its driver quickly returned to where Myrtle Wilson, her life brutally ended, lay on her knees in the road, mixing her thick dark blood with the dust. Michaelis and this man reached her first, but after they had pulled open her shirtwaist, still damp with sweat, they saw that her left breast was hanging loosely like a flap of skin, and there was no need to check for a heartbeat underneath. Her mouth was wide open and slightly torn at the corners, as though she had struggled briefly while releasing the immense vitality she had held onto for so long.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Michaelis, a young Greek who operated the coffee shop next to the ash-heaps, was the main witness at the inquiry. He had been sleeping through the afternoon heat until after five o’clock, at which point he wandered over to the garage and found George Wilson looking truly ill—his complexion as pale as his light hair and trembling noticeably. Michaelis suggested he go to bed, but Wilson declined, arguing that he’d lose too much business. As Michaelis tried to convince him, a loud commotion erupted upstairs. Wilson, surprisingly composed, said, “I’ve got my wife locked up there. She’s staying until the day after tomorrow, and then we’re leaving.” Michaelis was shocked; after four years as neighbors, Wilson had never seemed capable of such behavior. Normally, Wilson was tired and passive; when not working, he would just sit in the doorway, watching people and cars go by, and if anyone spoke to him, he would always respond with a mild, empty laugh. He acted more as his wife’s man than his own. Concerned, Michaelis tried to learn what had happened, but Wilson was uncommunicative and instead began looking at him peculiarly and questioning what Michaelis had been doing at certain times. As Michaelis began to feel uncomfortable, some workers passed by on their way to his café, giving him an excuse to leave—planning to come back later, though he never did, probably simply forgetting. When he went back outside after seven, he remembered the talk upon hearing Mrs. Wilson’s loud, angry voice downstairs. “Beat me!” she screamed. “Knock me down and beat me, you coward!” Moments later, she ran out into the fading light, waving her arms and shouting—and before Michaelis could react, the tragedy happened. The car that killed her, called the \"death car\" in the newspapers, didn’t stop; it emerged from the dusk, wavered briefly, then sped away around the next corner. Michaelis wasn’t even sure of its color—he guessed it was light green for the police. The other car, heading toward New York, stopped about a hundred yards away, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, having been struck down, lay in the road, her blood mixing with the dust. Michaelis and this man reached her first and tore open her damp shirtwaist, revealing that her left breast was loose and there was no point in checking for a heartbeat. Her mouth was wide open and torn slightly at the corners, as if she had struggled even in her final moments to release the powerful life force she had carried within her."

          "text_segment": "We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still some distance away.\n“Wreck!” said Tom. “That’s good. Wilson’ll have a little business at last.”\nHe slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping, until, as we came nearer, the hushed, intent faces of the people at the garage door made him automatically put on the brakes.\n“We’ll take a look,” he said doubtfully, “just a look.”\nI became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly from the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coupé and walked toward the door resolved itself into the words “Oh, my God!” uttered over and over in a gasping moan.\n“There’s some bad trouble here,” said Tom excitedly.\nHe reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage, which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging metal basket overhead. Then he made a harsh sound in his throat, and with a violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through.\nThe circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it was a minute before I could see anything at all. Then new arrivals deranged the line, and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.\nMyrtle Wilson’s body, wrapped in a blanket, and then in another blanket, as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night, lay on a worktable by the wall, and Tom, with his back to us, was bending over it, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down names with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I couldn’t find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed clamorously through the bare garage—then I saw Wilson standing on the raised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to the doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low voice and attempting, from time to time, to lay a hand on his shoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall, and then jerk back to the light again, and he gave out incessantly his high, horrible call:\n“Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!”\nPresently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and, after staring around the garage with glazed eyes, addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the policeman.\n“M-a-v—” the policeman was saying, “—o—”\n“No, r—” corrected the man, “M-a-v-r-o—”\n“Listen to me!” muttered Tom fiercely.\n“r—” said the policeman, “o—”\n“g—”\n“g—” He looked up as Tom’s broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder. “What you want, fella?”\n“What happened?—that’s what I want to know.”\n“Auto hit her. Ins’antly killed.”\n“Instantly killed,” repeated Tom, staring.\n“She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn’t even stopus car.”\n“There was two cars,” said Michaelis, “one comin’, one goin’, see?”\n“Going where?” asked the policeman keenly.\n“One goin’ each way. Well, she”—his hand rose toward the blankets but stopped halfway and fell to his side—“she ran out there an’ the one comin’ from N’York knock right into her, goin’ thirty or forty miles an hour.”\n“What’s the name of this place here?” demanded the officer.\n“Hasn’t got any name.”\nA pale well-dressed negro stepped near.\n“It was a yellow car,” he said, “big yellow car. New.”\n“See the accident?” asked the policeman.\n“No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster’n forty. Going fifty, sixty.”\n“Come here and let’s have your name. Look out now. I want to get his name.”\nSome words of this conversation must have reached Wilson, swaying in the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his grasping cries:\n“You don’t have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of car it was!”\nWatching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten under his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and, standing in front of him, seized him firmly by the upper arms.\n“You’ve got to pull yourself together,” he said with soothing gruffness.\nWilson’s eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.\n“Listen,” said Tom, shaking him a little. “I just got here a minute ago, from New York. I was bringing you that coupé we’ve been talking about. That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn’t mine—do you hear? I haven’t seen it all afternoon.”\nOnly the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said, but the policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent eyes.\n“What’s all that?” he demanded.\n“I’m a friend of his.” Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on Wilson’s body. “He says he knows the car that did it… It was a yellow car.”\nSome dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.\n“And what colour’s your car?”\n“It’s a blue car, a coupé.”\n“We’ve come straight from New York,” I said.\nSomeone who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this, and the policeman turned away.\n“Now, if you’ll let me have that name again correct—”\nPicking up Wilson like a doll, Tom carried him into the office, set him down in a chair, and came back.\n“If somebody’ll come here and sit with him,” he snapped authoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the door on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the table. As he passed close to me he whispered: “Let’s get out.”\nSelf-consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we pushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor, case in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.\nTom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend—then his foot came down hard, and the coupé raced along through the night. In a little while I heard a low husky sob, and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face.\n“The God damned coward!” he whimpered.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Even from a distance, we could see the gathering of people and the three or four cars. Tom exclaimed, \"Wreck! Good. At least Wilson will finally get some business.\" He slowed down, though he didn't initially intend to stop. However, as we got closer, the quiet, intense expressions of the people near the garage door made him instinctively hit the brakes. \"Let's just have a quick look,\" he said uncertainly. I then became aware of a continuous, mournful cry coming from the garage. As we exited the coupé and walked towards the entrance, this sound resolved into the words \"Oh, my God!\" repeated over and over as a gasping lament. \"There's serious trouble here,\" Tom said, sounding agitated. He stretched up on his toes, peering over the heads of the onlookers into the garage, which was only illuminated by a bare yellow bulb swinging from the ceiling in a metal cage. He then made a rough sound in his throat and, with a forceful push of his strong arms, shoved his way through the crowd. The circle of people quickly reformed with murmurs of protest; it took a moment before I could see anything clearly. Then, new arrivals disrupted the group, and Jordan and I were abruptly propelled inside. Myrtle Wilson's body, wrapped in one blanket, and then another, as if she were chilled on this warm night, lay on a workbench against the wall. Tom, with his back turned to us, was leaning over her, completely still. Beside him, a motorcycle policeman was noting down names in a small book, pausing frequently to correct mistakes. Initially, I couldn't identify the source of the loud, agonizing cries echoing piercingly through the sparse garage. Then I saw Wilson standing on the elevated threshold of his office, swaying back and forth, gripping the doorposts with both hands. Another man was speaking softly to him, occasionally attempting to place a hand on his shoulder, but Wilson seemed oblivious to both sound and sight. His gaze would slowly drop from the swinging light to the loaded table by the wall, then snap back to the light, and he ceaselessly uttered his high-pitched, dreadful wail: \"Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!\" After a moment, Tom abruptly raised his head. He stared around the garage with vacant eyes, then mumbled something unclear to the policeman. \"M-a-v—\" the officer began writing, \"—o—\" \"No, it's r—,\" the other man corrected him, \"M-a-v-r-o—\" \"Listen to me!\" Tom growled fiercely. \"r—\" said the policeman, \"o—\" \"g—\" \"g—\" The officer looked up as Tom's large hand slapped sharply onto his shoulder. \"What do you want, mister?\" \"What happened?—that's what I need to know.\" \"Car hit her. Killed instantly.\" \"Instantly killed,\" Tom repeated, staring. \"She ran out into the street. The son-of-a-bitch didn't even stop.\" \"There were two cars,\" said Michaelis, \"one coming, one going, get it?\" \"Going where?\" the policeman asked sharply. \"One going each way. Well, she\"—his hand started towards the blankets but stopped midway and dropped to his side—\"she ran out there and the one coming from New York slammed right into her, doing thirty or forty miles an hour.\" \"What's this place called?\" the officer demanded. \"It doesn't have a name.\" A pale, well-dressed Black man approached. \"It was a yellow car,\" he said, \"a big yellow car. New.\" \"Did you see the accident?\" the policeman asked. \"No, but the car passed me further down the road, going faster than forty. More like fifty, sixty.\" \"Come over here and let me get your name. Be careful now. I need his name.\" Some of this conversation must have reached Wilson, still swaying in the office doorway, because suddenly a new idea was woven into his gasping cries: \"You don't need to tell me what kind of car it was! I know exactly what kind of car it was!\" Watching Tom, I saw the bulge of muscle tighten in his shoulder under his jacket. He walked quickly over to Wilson and, standing directly in front of him, gripped his upper arms firmly. \"You have to get a grip on yourself,\" he said with a rough but soothing tone. Wilson's eyes fixed on Tom; he rose onto his tiptoes, then would have collapsed to his knees if Tom hadn't held him upright. \"Listen,\" Tom said, shaking him gently. \"I just got here a minute ago, from New York. I was bringing you that coupé we talked about. That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn't mine—do you understand? I haven't seen it at all this afternoon.\" Only the Black man and I were close enough to hear this, but the policeman detected something in Tom's tone and looked over with aggressive eyes. \"What's going on?\" he demanded. \"I'm his friend.\" Tom turned his head but kept his hands firmly on Wilson. \"He says he knows the car that did it… It was a yellow car.\" A faint instinct made the policeman look suspiciously at Tom. \"And what color is your car?\" \"It's blue, a coupé.\" \"We came directly from New York,\" I added. Someone who had been driving slightly behind us confirmed this, and the policeman turned away. \"Now, if you'll give me that name again correctly—\" Picking up Wilson as if he were a doll, Tom carried him into the office, placed him in a chair, and returned. \"Someone needs to come in here and sit with him,\" he ordered sharply, with authority. He watched as the two men nearest exchanged glances and reluctantly went into the room. Then Tom closed the door on them and stepped down from the single step, his eyes avoiding the table. As he passed close by me, he whispered: \"Let's get out.\" Conscious of being watched, we pushed our way through the still-growing crowd, Tom's imposing figure clearing the path. We passed a doctor hurrying forward, case in hand, who had been called for in a desperate hope half an hour earlier. Tom drove slowly until we rounded the bend. Then he pressed the gas pedal hard, and the coupé sped through the night. After a short while, I heard a low, hoarse sob and saw tears streaming down his face. \"The God damned coward!\" he whimpered.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As we approached, we could see several cars and a group of people gathered in the distance. Tom immediately guessed there had been an accident and thought Wilson might benefit from it. He slowed the car, but didn’t plan to stop until the intense, silent expressions of those at the garage compelled him to hit the brakes. Hesitantly, Tom suggested we check out what happened. Getting out, I noticed a continuous, hollow cry coming from inside the garage, which we soon realized was someone repeatedly gasping, \"Oh, my God!\" Tom, appearing excited, sensed serious trouble. He pushed through the crowd at the doorway as a faint yellow overhead light illuminated the interior. Tom made a rough sound, then forcefully broke through the line of onlookers. The crowd closed behind him, and after a few moments Jordan and I managed to get inside as more people arrived.\n\nWe saw Myrtle Wilson’s body on a worktable, wrapped in two blankets despite the warm night. Tom, facing away, was bent over her, still. Nearby, a sweaty police officer was taking down names, making many corrections in his notebook. I at first couldn’t tell where the desperate moaning was coming from, but then saw Wilson on the office threshold, swaying and clinging to the doorframe, oblivious to a man quietly trying to comfort him. Wilson kept staring between the light and Myrtle’s covered body, emitting his dreadful cry: \"Oh, my God! Oh, my God!\" \n\nSuddenly, Tom looked up in a daze and mumbled to the policeman, who was attempting to get the spelling of someone’s name right. Impatiently, Tom demanded to know what had happened. The officer explained that Myrtle had run into the road and was killed instantly by a passing car that didn’t stop. Another witness, Michaelis, clarified there were cars moving in both directions, but it was the car from New York that struck her, traveling at high speed. A well-dressed black man said it had been a new, large yellow car and that he’d seen it passing him on the road going well over forty miles an hour. The officer took his name.\n\nWilson, amid his cries, suddenly insisted that he knew what kind of car was involved. Tom, tensing up, went to him and forcibly tried to calm him, explaining he had just arrived with the coupé and the yellow car wasn’t his, nor had he driven it that afternoon. Only I and the black man could hear this exchange, but the nearby officer grew suspicious and asked about Tom’s car. Tom replied it was a blue coupé, and I confirmed we’d come straight from New York, which another witness corroborated. The officer moved on. Tom then physically helped Wilson into his office and asked two men to stay with him, shutting them inside before returning to us. As he passed me, Tom whispered that we should leave.\n\nWe pushed back through the onlookers, passing a doctor who appeared too late to help. Once out of sight, Tom sped off into the night, eventually breaking down in tears and cursing the driver who had fled the scene."

Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor, where two windows bloomed with light among the vines.\n“Daisy’s home,” he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and frowned slightly.\n“I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There’s nothing we can do tonight.”\nA change had come over him, and he spoke gravely, and with decision. As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of the situation in a few brisk phrases.\n“I’ll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you’re waiting you and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some supper—if you want any.” He opened the door. “Come in.”\n“No, thanks. But I’d be glad if you’d order me the taxi. I’ll wait outside.”\nJordan put her hand on my arm.\n“Won’t you come in, Nick?”\n“No, thanks.”\nI was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan lingered for a moment more.\n“It’s only half-past nine,” she said.\nI’d be damned if I’d go in; I’d had enough of all of them for one day, and suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of this in my expression, for she turned abruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the house. I sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler’s voice calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the house, intending to wait by the gate.\nI hadn’t gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from between two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird by that time, because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon.\n“What are you doing?” I inquired.\n“Just standing here, old sport.”\nSomehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was going to rob the house in a moment; I wouldn’t have been surprised to see sinister faces, the faces of “Wolfshiem’s people,” behind him in the dark shrubbery.\n“Did you see any trouble on the road?” he asked after a minute.\n“Yes.”\nHe hesitated.\n“Was she killed?”\n“Yes.”\n“I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It’s better that the shock should all come at once. She stood it pretty well.”\nHe spoke as if Daisy’s reaction was the only thing that mattered.\n“I got to West Egg by a side road,” he went on, “and left the car in my garage. I don’t think anybody saw us, but of course I can’t be sure.”\nI disliked him so much by this time that I didn’t find it necessary to tell him he was wrong.\n“Who was the woman?” he inquired.\n“Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did it happen?”\n“Well, I tried to swing the wheel—” He broke off, and suddenly I guessed at the truth.\n“Was Daisy driving?”\n“Yes,” he said after a moment, “but of course I’ll say I was. You see, when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to drive—and this woman rushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute, but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second my hand reached the wheel I felt the shock—it must have killed her instantly.”\n“It ripped her open—”\n“Don’t tell me, old sport.” He winced. “Anyhow—Daisy stepped on it. I tried to make her stop, but she couldn’t, so I pulled on the emergency brake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.\n“She’ll be all right tomorrow,” he said presently. “I’m just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon. She’s locked herself into her room, and if he tries any brutality she’s going to turn the light out and on again.”\n“He won’t touch her,” I said. “He’s not thinking about her.”\n“I don’t trust him, old sport.”\n“How long are you going to wait?”\n“All night, if necessary. Anyhow, till they all go to bed.”\nA new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy had been driving. He might think he saw a connection in it—he might think anything. I looked at the house; there were two or three bright windows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy’s room on the ground floor.\n“You wait here,” I said. “I’ll see if there’s any sign of a commotion.”\nI walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel softly, and tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains were open, and I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where we had dined that June night three months before, I came to a small rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window. The blind was drawn, but I found a rift at the sill.\nDaisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table, with a plate of cold fried chicken between them, and two bottles of ale. He was talking intently across the table at her, and in his earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own. Once in a while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.\nThey weren’t happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the ale—and yet they weren’t unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture, and anybody would have said that they were conspiring together.\nAs I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the dark road toward the house. Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in the drive.\n“Is it all quiet up there?” he asked anxiously.\n“Yes, it’s all quiet.” I hesitated. “You’d better come home and get some sleep.”\nHe shook his head.\n“I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport.”\nHe put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the moonlight—watching over nothing.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Suddenly, the Buchanan residence seemed to drift toward us through the shadowy, rustling trees. Tom parked near the porch and looked up at the second story, where light spilled from two windows among the creeping vines.\n\"Daisy's here,\" he announced. As we exited the car, he glanced at me, a slight frown on his face.\n\"Nick, I really should have dropped you off in West Egg. There's nothing for us to do tonight.\"\nHe had visibly changed, speaking seriously and with resolve. Walking across the moonlit gravel path to the porch, he quickly summarized the situation.\n\"I'll call for a taxi to take you home. While you wait, you and Jordan should go into the kitchen and ask them to get you some supper – if you want any.\" He opened the door. \"Come on in.\"\n\"No, thanks. But I would appreciate it if you'd order the taxi for me. I'll stay outside.\"\nJordan placed her hand on my arm.\n\"Are you sure you won't come in, Nick?\"\n\"No, I'm fine.\"\nI felt somewhat unwell and desired solitude. But Jordan lingered briefly.\n\"It's only nine-thirty,\" she pointed out.\nI absolutely refused to go in; I'd had enough of all of them for the day, and surprisingly, that included Jordan now. She must have sensed this from my expression, as she turned away abruptly and hurried up the porch stairs into the house. I sat for a few minutes, my head in my hands, until I heard the phone being picked up inside and the butler's voice requesting a taxi. Then I slowly made my way down the driveway away from the house, planning to wait by the gate.\nI had barely gone twenty yards when I heard my name called and saw Gatsby emerge from between two bushes onto the path. By then, I must have been feeling quite disoriented, because the only thing I could focus on was the bright glow of his pink suit under the moonlight.\n\"What are you doing?\" I asked.\n\"Just waiting here, old sport.\"\nSomehow, that struck me as a pathetic activity. For all I knew, he might attempt to rob the house any minute; I wouldn't have been shocked to see sinister faces, like those belonging to \"Wolfshiem's associates,\" lurking behind him in the dark bushes.\n\"Did you encounter any trouble on the road?\" he asked after a moment.\n\"Yes.\"\nHe paused.\n\"Was she killed?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"I suspected as much; I told Daisy I thought so. It's better for the shock to hit all at once. She handled it quite well.\"\nHe spoke as if Daisy's reaction was the only thing of importance.\n\"I reached West Egg by taking a different route,\" he continued, \"and left the car in my garage. I don't believe anyone saw us, but naturally, I can't be certain.\"\nBy this point, my dislike for him was so strong that I didn't feel the need to correct his assumption.\n\"Who was the woman?\" he inquired.\n\"Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How on earth did it happen?\"\n\"Well, I attempted to swerve the wheel—\" He stopped abruptly, and the truth suddenly dawned on me.\n\"Was Daisy driving?\"\n\"Yes,\" he admitted after a pause, \"but of course, I'll claim I was. You see, when we left New York, she was very shaken, and she thought driving would calm her down – and this woman ran out in front of us just as we were passing a car coming from the opposite direction. It all happened in an instant, but it seemed to me that she wanted to talk to us, perhaps mistook us for someone she knew. First, Daisy turned away from the woman towards the other car, then she panicked and turned back. The moment my hand grabbed the wheel, I felt the impact – it must have killed her instantly.\"\n\"It tore her open—\"\n\"Please, don't tell me, old sport.\" He winced. \"Anyway – Daisy accelerated. I tried to get her to stop, but she couldn't, so I pulled the emergency brake. Then she slumped over into my lap, and I kept driving.\n\"She'll be fine tomorrow,\" he said after a while. \"I'm just going to stay here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasant incident from this afternoon. She's locked herself in her room, and if he attempts any violence, she's going to signal by turning the light on and off.\"\n\"He won't touch her,\" I stated. \"He's not focused on her.\"\n\"I don't trust him, old sport.\"\n\"How long do you plan to wait?\"\n\"All night, if necessary. At least until they all go to bed.\"\nA new concern struck me. What if Tom discovered that Daisy was driving? He might interpret it in some way – he might assume anything. I looked at the house; there were a couple of bright windows downstairs and the faint pink light from Daisy's room on the ground floor.\n\"You wait here,\" I told him. \"I'll check if there's any sign of trouble.\"\nI walked back along the edge of the lawn, crossed the gravel quietly, and crept up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains were open, and I saw the room was empty. Crossing the porch where we had eaten dinner that night three months ago, I reached a small rectangle of light that I guessed was the pantry window. The blind was pulled down, but I found a gap at the bottom.\nDaisy and Tom were seated across from each other at the kitchen table, with a plate of cold fried chicken between them and two bottles of ale. He was talking intently across the table to her, and in his earnestness, his hand had rested upon and covered hers. Occasionally, she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.\nThey weren't happy, and neither had touched the food or drink – and yet they didn't seem unhappy either. There was an undeniable sense of natural closeness between them in the scene, and anyone observing would have thought they were secretly collaborating.\nAs I quietly left the porch, I heard my taxi slowly making its way along the dark road toward the house. Gatsby was waiting exactly where I had left him in the driveway.\n\"Is everything quiet up there?\" he asked anxiously.\n\"Yes, it's completely quiet.\" I hesitated. \"You should go home and get some rest.\"\nHe shook his head.\n\"I want to wait here until Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport.\"\nHe put his hands in his coat pockets and eagerly turned back to intently watching the house, as if my presence somehow diminished the sanctity of his vigil. So I walked away, leaving him standing there in the moonlight – keeping watch over nothing of substance.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As we approached, the Buchanans’ house appeared before us through the dark, whispering trees. Tom parked near the porch, gazing up at the two lit windows upstairs. “Daisy’s home,” he remarked. When we exited the car, he looked at me with a slight scowl. “I should have left you in West Egg, Nick. There’s nothing more to do tonight.” His demeanor had shifted—he now sounded serious and decisive. As we crossed the gravel in the moonlight to the porch, he quickly summarized the situation. “I’ll call you a taxi. While you wait, you and Jordan can have some supper in the kitchen if you want.” He opened the door. “Come in.”\n\n“No, thank you. But I’d appreciate you ordering the taxi; I’ll wait outside.”\n\nJordan touched my arm. “Please come in, Nick?”\n\n“No, thanks.”\n\nI was feeling a bit ill and wanted solitude. Jordan lingered. “It’s only half-past nine,” she pointed out. I was determined not to go in; I’d had enough of everyone, even Jordan. She must have sensed this, because she quickly turned and hurried into the house. I sat down for a while, holding my head, until I heard the butler inside call for a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the driveway to the gate.\n\nAfter a short distance, I heard my name—Gatsby emerged from the bushes onto the path. I must have been feeling quite strange since all I noticed was the brightness of his pink suit in the moonlight. “What are you doing?” I asked. “Just standing here, old sport.” For some reason, this seemed like an odd thing to do; I half-expected to see sinister faces lurking in the shadows. “Did you see any trouble on the road?” he asked. “Yes.” He paused. “Was she killed?” “Yes.” “I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It’s best if the shock comes all at once. She handled it fairly well.” He spoke as though Daisy’s reaction was all that mattered. “I got back to West Egg by a side road and left the car at my place. I don’t think anybody saw us, though I can’t be sure.” By this point, I disliked him enough to not bother protesting.\n\n“Who was the woman?” he asked. “Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How did it happen?” “Well, I tried to turn the wheel—” He stopped, and I suddenly realized the truth. “Was Daisy driving?” “Yes,” he replied quietly, “but I’ll take the blame. When we left New York she was so nervous that I let her drive to calm her down—and just as we passed by another car, the woman ran out at us. It happened so quickly, but I thought she wanted to speak to us, maybe thought we were someone else. Daisy first swerved away from her and then, panicking, turned back. The moment I touched the wheel, the crash happened—it must have killed her instantly.” “She was badly hurt—” “Please don’t tell me,” Gatsby said, wincing. “Anyway—Daisy floored it. I tried to make her stop, but she couldn’t, so I used the emergency brake. Then, overcome, she slumped into my lap and I kept driving.”\n\n“She’ll be okay tomorrow,” he said after a moment. “I’m going to stay here to make sure no one bothers her about what happened this afternoon. She’s in her room, and if Tom tries to hurt her, she’ll signal by flicking the light.”\n\n“He won’t touch her,” I reassured him. “He’s not thinking of her right now.”\n\n“I still don’t trust him,” Gatsby said.\n\n“How long will you wait?”\n\n“All night, if I have to. At least until everyone’s gone to bed.”\n\nA new thought occurred to me: if Tom found out Daisy had been driving, he might make further connections. I looked back at the house, noticing the downstairs windows lit up and Daisy’s room glowing pink. “Wait here,” I told Gatsby. “I’ll check if there’s any trouble.”\n\nI crept along the lawn, crossed the gravel quietly, and tiptoed to the veranda. Through the drawing-room curtains, I saw the room was empty. On the porch where we’d eaten together before, I found a sliver of light at the pantry window. Peeking through a small gap, I saw Daisy and Tom sitting at the kitchen table, with cold fried chicken and two bottles of ale untouched between them. Tom was speaking earnestly, his hand covering Daisy’s. Occasionally, she looked up and nodded. They didn’t seem happy or unhappy, but there was a sense of closeness that made them seem united, as if they were plotting together.\n\nAs I left the porch, I heard my taxi approaching in the dark. Gatsby was still waiting where I left him.\n\n“Is everything quiet?” he asked nervously. “Yes, all quiet.” I paused. “You should go home and rest.” He shook his head. “I want to wait until Daisy’s in bed. Good night, old sport.” He stuffed his hands in his pockets and looked back at the house, as though my presence disturbed his watchfulness. So I left him there, standing in the moonlight—watching over nothing."

          "text_segment": "It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with Dan Cody—told it to me because “Jay Gatsby” had broken up like glass against Tom’s hard malice, and the long secret extravaganza was played out. I think that he would have acknowledged anything now, without reserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy.\nShe was the first “nice” girl he had ever known. In various unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people, but always with indiscernible barbed wire between. He found her excitingly desirable. He went to her house, at first with other officers from Camp Taylor, then alone. It amazed him—he had never been in such a beautiful house before. But what gave it an air of breathless intensity, was that Daisy lived there—it was as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it, a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors, and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year’s shining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered. It excited him, too, that many men had already loved Daisy—it increased her value in his eyes. He felt their presence all about the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions.\nBut he knew that he was in Daisy’s house by a colossal accident. However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders. So he made the most of his time. He took what he could get, ravenously and unscrupulously—eventually he took Daisy one still October night, took her because he had no real right to touch her hand.\nHe might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under false pretences. I don’t mean that he had traded on his phantom millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he let her believe that he was a person from much the same strata as herself—that he was fully able to take care of her. As a matter of fact, he had no such facilities—he had no comfortable family standing behind him, and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the world.\nBut he didn’t despise himself and it didn’t turn out as he had imagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go—but now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail. He knew that Daisy was extraordinary, but he didn’t realize just how extraordinary a “nice” girl could be. She vanished into her rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby—nothing. He felt married to her, that was all.\nWhen they met again, two days later, it was Gatsby who was breathless, who was, somehow, betrayed. Her porch was bright with the bought luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth. She had caught a cold, and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever, and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor.\n“I can’t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her, old sport. I even hoped for a while that she’d throw me over, but she didn’t, because she was in love with me too. She thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her… Well, there I was, way off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden I didn’t care. What was the use of doing great things if I could have a better time telling her what I was going to do?”\nOn the last afternoon before he went abroad, he sat with Daisy in his arms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day, with fire in the room and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he changed his arm a little, and once he kissed her dark shining hair. The afternoon had made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised. They had never been closer in their month of love, nor communicated more profoundly one with another, than when she brushed silent lips against his coat’s shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were asleep.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "That evening, Gatsby recounted the unexpected details of his youth, including his time with Dan Cody. He shared this because Tom's harsh malice had utterly destroyed the \"Jay Gatsby\" identity, signaling the end of his grand, secretive charade. Nick felt that Gatsby would have confessed anything at that point, holding nothing back, but his main desire was to talk about Daisy. She represented the first \"respectable\" girl he had ever encountered. Although he had previously interacted with wealthy individuals in various unstated roles, there was always an invisible barrier between them. He found her overwhelmingly appealing. He began visiting her home, accompanying other officers from Camp Taylor at first, and later going by himself. The house itself astonished him; he had never been inside such a magnificent place. However, what truly gave the house a feeling of intense excitement was that Daisy resided there – it seemed as ordinary to her as his military tent was to him. The house possessed an aura of sophisticated intrigue, hinting at elegant, cool bedrooms upstairs, lively and bright events happening throughout its halls, and love stories that weren't stale or tucked away like old souvenirs, but vibrant, current, reflecting the glamour of modern cars and fresh flowers at dances. The fact that many men had already been in love with Daisy also thrilled him, increasing her perceived worth in his eyes. He felt their past emotions filling the house, permeating the air with the subtle presence and reminders of feelings still felt. Yet, he understood that his presence in Daisy's home was a result of immense chance. Regardless of how brilliant his future as Jay Gatsby might seem, he was, at that moment, a young man with no money and no established past, and his military cover could be stripped away unpredictably by his service. Consequently, he made the most of his limited time. He seized opportunities and possessions without hesitation or ethics – ultimately, on a quiet October evening, he took Daisy. The text highlights he did this precisely *because* he felt he had no genuine claim to be close to her. He might have felt disgusted with himself, given that he had clearly deceived her. This wasn't about fabricating wealth, but rather intentionally creating a false sense of security for Daisy; he allowed her to believe he belonged to a similar social standing as herself and was fully capable of looking after her. The truth was, he lacked any such means – he didn't have a supportive, established family, and he was liable to be sent anywhere in the world at the arbitrary command of an impersonal military. However, he did not feel self-loathing, and the outcome was different from what he had anticipated. His probable intention was to exploit the situation and move on, but he discovered he was now bound to chase a profound, almost sacred objective. While he recognized Daisy's unique qualities, he didn't fully comprehend the exceptional nature of a \"respectable\" young woman. She retreated back into her affluent residence and her privileged, abundant existence, leaving Gatsby with nothing. All he felt was a sense of being tied to her, as though they were married. When they reconnected two days later, it was Gatsby who felt breathless and, in a way, deceived. Her porch was brightly illuminated by the acquired extravagance that mimicked starlight; the wicker of the settee produced a stylish squeak as she turned towards him, and he kissed her intriguing and beautiful lips. She had caught a cold, which rendered her voice more husky and appealing than usual, and Gatsby became intensely conscious of the youthfulness and enigma that wealth safeguards and maintains, the crispness of numerous garments, and Daisy, radiant as silver, secure and elevated above the difficult lives of the less fortunate. Gatsby then quoted his past self, saying, \"I can’t explain how astonished I was to discover I was in love with her, old sport. I even wished for a time that she would break things off, but she didn’t, because she was also in love with me. She believed I was very knowledgeable because the things I knew were different from what she knew… So there I was, completely sidetracked from my ambitions, falling more deeply in love every moment, until suddenly nothing else mattered. What was the benefit of achieving great things if I could have a better time simply describing my future plans to her?\" On the final afternoon before his deployment abroad, he and Daisy sat embracing for a lengthy period in silence. It was a chilly fall day, with a warm fire in the room and her cheeks glowing. Periodically she would stir, and he would slightly shift his arm; on one occasion, he kissed her dark, lustrous hair. That afternoon momentarily granted them a sense of calm, almost as if preparing them with a profound memory for the long separation promised by the following day. In their month-long romance, they had never felt more connected or communicated more deeply than through her soft, silent touch against his coat shoulder or when he lightly touched the tip of her fingers, as though she were slumbering.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "That night, Gatsby shared with me the unusual tale of his youth and his time with Dan Cody—he told me because the persona of “Jay Gatsby” had shattered against Tom’s cruelty, and the secret fantasy he had built for so long was over. I felt he was now willing to admit anything, but he mostly wanted to talk about Daisy. She was the first genuinely “nice” girl he ever met. He had interacted with people like her before, in subtle ways, but there had always been an invisible barrier. He was deeply attracted to her. At first, he visited her house with other officers from Camp Taylor, then started going alone. He was astonished—he’d never seen such a magnificent house. What made the place even more exciting was that Daisy lived there; it was just as ordinary for her as Gatsby’s camp tent was for him. There was a mysterious allure about her home—the implication of beautiful, cool upstairs rooms, vibrant happenings throughout the halls, and romantic feelings alive and current, not old and faded. It excited Gatsby even more knowing that others had loved Daisy, giving her a special worth in his eyes. He could sense these former lovers in the house, their emotions still echoing there.\nBut Gatsby realized his presence in Daisy’s world was almost accidental. No matter what he might achieve as Jay Gatsby in the future, at that moment he was a young man with no money or background, and his officer’s uniform could be taken away at any time. So he seized every opportunity he could, taking everything he could with intense and reckless abandon—eventually, that meant being with Daisy one October night, even though he knew he had no real right to her.\nHe might have felt ashamed—after all, he’d misled her. He wasn’t pretending to be wealthy, but he let her believe he belonged to her social class and could give her security, when in reality he had no such means, no family fortune, and could be sent anywhere by fate at a moment’s notice.\nHowever, Gatsby didn’t feel guilt, and things didn’t happen as he expected. He likely thought he would enjoy the moment and then leave, but he found himself committed to following a dream. He knew Daisy was remarkable, but he hadn’t realized just how special a “nice” girl could be. She disappeared back into her wealthy life, leaving Gatsby with nothing but the feeling of being married to her.\nWhen they saw each other again two days later, it was Gatsby who felt breathless and betrayed. Her porch gleamed with the luxury of bought starlight; the wicker couch creaked fashionably as she turned and he kissed her beautiful, curious mouth. She had caught a cold, making her voice even more appealing, and Gatsby was struck by the youthful mystery protected by wealth, the freshness of her many clothes, and Daisy herself—shining, proud, and secure far above the struggles of the poor.\n“I can’t tell you how shocked I was to realize I loved her,” Gatsby said. “For a while I even hoped she’d leave me, but she didn’t, because she loved me too. She thought I knew a lot, just because I knew things she didn’t… So there I was, forgetting my ambitions, loving her more every minute, and suddenly it didn’t matter. Why chase big dreams when I had as much joy telling her about them?”\nOn his last afternoon before leaving for Europe, Gatsby and Daisy sat together quietly for a long time. It was a chilly autumn day, a fire burned in the room, and her cheeks were flushed. Occasionally she moved and he would shift his arm, sometimes kissing her dark, shining hair. That afternoon gave them a rare peacefulness, as if to create a lasting memory before their separation. They were never closer in their brief romance, nor understood each other so deeply, than in those silent gestures—Daisy’s gentle touch on Gatsby’s coat, or when he softly held her fingers, as if she were asleep."

He was a captain before he went to the front, and following the Argonne battles he got his majority and the command of the divisional machine-guns. After the armistice he tried frantically to get home, but some complication or misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He was worried now—there was a quality of nervous despair in Daisy’s letters. She didn’t see why he couldn’t come. She was feeling the pressure of the world outside, and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all.\nFor Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes. All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the “Beale Street Blues” while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust. At the grey tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low, sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the floor.\nThrough this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men, and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening-dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed. And all the time something within her was crying for a decision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately—and the decision must be made by some force—of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality—that was close at hand.\nThat force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom Buchanan. There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his position, and Daisy was flattered. Doubtless there was a certain struggle and a certain relief. The letter reached Gatsby while he was still at Oxford.\nIt was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of the windows downstairs, filling the house with grey-turning, gold-turning light. The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. There was a slow, pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool, lovely day.\n“I don’t think she ever loved him.” Gatsby turned around from a window and looked at me challengingly. “You must remember, old sport, she was very excited this afternoon. He told her those things in a way that frightened her—that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper. And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying.”\nHe sat down gloomily.\n“Of course she might have loved him just for a minute, when they were first married—and loved me more even then, do you see?”\nSuddenly he came out with a curious remark.\n“In any case,” he said, “it was just personal.”\nWhat could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in his conception of the affair that couldn’t be measured?\nHe came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their wedding trip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to Louisville on the last of his army pay. He stayed there a week, walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through the November night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which they had driven in her white car. Just as Daisy’s house had always seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses, so his idea of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded with a melancholy beauty.\nHe left feeling that if he had searched harder, he might have found her—that he was leaving her behind. The day-coach—he was penniless now—was hot. He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a folding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar buildings moved by. Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street.\nThe track curved and now it was going away from the sun, which, as it sank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing city where she had drawn her breath. He stretched out his hand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of the spot that she had made lovely for him.

Daisy was young, and her artificial world was filled with the scent of orchids, pleasant, cheerful snobbery, and orchestras that marked the year's rhythm, capturing life's sadness and allure in new songs. All night long, saxophones played the melancholic 'Beale Street Blues,' while dancers in gold and silver slippers shuffled across the polished floor. During the late afternoon tea hour, certain rooms always pulsed with this soft, sweet intensity, as young people with fresh faces drifted like rose petals scattered by the sad horns around the room. In this hazy, ethereal world, Daisy began to re-engage with the social season. Suddenly, she was back to having several dates a day with multiple men and falling asleep near dawn with parts of her evening dress tangled among wilting orchids on the floor beside her bed. All the while, something inside her cried out for a decision to be made. She wanted her life settled immediately, and this choice had to come from a nearby force – be it love, money, or practical necessity. That force manifested in mid-spring with the arrival of Tom Buchanan. His physical presence and social standing had a reassuring solidity about them, and Daisy was flattered. There was undoubtedly a period of internal conflict followed by a sense of relief. The letter informing Gatsby of this reached him while he was still at Oxford. It was now dawn on Long Island, and we proceeded to open the remaining downstairs windows, allowing the light, transitioning from grey to gold, to fill the house. The shadow of a tree abruptly crossed the dew, and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue-tinged leaves. There was a slow, pleasant movement in the air, barely a breeze, promising a cool, beautiful day. 'I don't think she ever loved him,' Gatsby said, turning from a window and looking at me defiantly. 'You have to remember, old sport, she was very upset this afternoon. He told her those things in a way that terrified her – making it seem like I was some kind of cheap trickster. And because of that, she barely knew what she was saying.' He sat down, looking glum. 'Of course, she might have loved him for just a moment, when they were first married – and loved me more even then, do you understand?' Suddenly, he made a peculiar statement. 'In any case,' he said, 'it was just between us.' How could one interpret that, except to suspect an intensity in his view of the relationship that was immeasurable?

Then:\n“However—I want to see you.”\n“I want to see you, too.”\n“Suppose I don’t go to Southampton, and come into town this afternoon?”\n“No—I don’t think this afternoon.”\n“Very well.”\n“It’s impossible this afternoon. Various—”\nWe talked like that for a while, and then abruptly we weren’t talking any longer. I don’t know which of us hung up with a sharp click, but I know I didn’t care. I couldn’t have talked to her across a tea-table that day if I never talked to her again in this world.",

My telephone rang just before midday, startling me awake and causing me to sit up abruptly, with perspiration forming on my brow. It was Jordan Baker calling; she frequently contacted me around this time of day because her unpredictable schedule, constantly moving among hotels, social clubs, and private residences, made it difficult to locate her otherwise. Typically, her voice sounded refreshing and calm on the phone line, like a piece of turf from a well-kept golf course had floated in through the office window, but today her tone sounded rough and devoid of warmth. \"I've departed from Daisy's residence,\" she informed me. \"I'm currently in Hempstead and plan to travel south to Southampton later today.\" It was likely a considerate move for her to have departed Daisy's place, but the action bothered me, and her subsequent comment caused me to become tense. \"You weren't very pleasant towards me yesterday evening.\" \"Why would that have been important at that moment?\" A brief pause followed. Then she continued: \"Nevertheless, I would like to meet with you.\" \"I also wish to see you.\" \"What if I decide not to proceed to Southampton and instead come into the city this afternoon?\" \"No, I don't believe this afternoon is suitable.\" \"Alright.\" \"It won't be possible today. Several...\" Our conversation continued in that strained manner for a short time, and then it ended suddenly. I'm not sure who ended the call with that distinct click, but I am certain I was indifferent about it. I felt incapable of having a calm, civil conversation with her at that moment, even if it meant never speaking to her again in my life.",

The caller was Jordan Baker; she often rang at this time due to her unpredictable schedule bouncing between hotels, clubs, and private homes, which made her difficult to reach otherwise. Normally, her voice sounded refreshing and invigorating, but today it came across strained and lifeless. She told me she had left Daisy’s home and was now in Hempstead, planning to travel to Southampton later that afternoon. Though leaving Daisy’s house was probably the polite thing to do, her decision irked me, and her next words left me tense. She said I hadn’t been kind to her the previous night. I questioned whether it really mattered in that moment. There was a brief pause, and then she expressed a desire to see me. I replied that I wanted to see her, too. She suggested she could skip Southampton and instead come into the city that afternoon, but I declined, insisting it wasn’t possible for me today, giving vague reasons. We continued with this back and forth for a bit, until suddenly the conversation just ended. I have no idea who hung up abruptly, but I felt indifferent. At that moment, I couldn’t have sat across from her at a tea table, even if it meant never seeing her again."

Taking out my train schedule, I drew a small circle around the train scheduled for three-fifty. Then I settled back in my chair and attempted to clear my thoughts. It was precisely noon. When I rode past the valley of ashes by train that morning, I purposefully moved to the opposite side of the carriage.

Now, I want to briefly recount what happened at the garage after we left the night before. Finding Catherine, Myrtle's sister, presented a challenge. She must have broken her usual practice of not drinking that night, because when she arrived, she was heavily intoxicated and couldn't comprehend that the ambulance had already departed for Flushing. Once they managed to make her understand this, she immediately fainted, as if that specific piece of information was the most unbearable aspect of the whole situation. Someone, perhaps out of compassion or just curiosity, put her in their car and followed behind her sister's body. A fluctuating group of people stayed gathered in front of the garage until long after midnight, while inside, George Wilson rocked back and forth on the couch. For a time, the office door remained open, and everyone who entered the garage couldn't help but glance through it. Eventually, someone commented that it was indecent and closed the door.

He announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car belonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen.\nBut when he heard himself say this, he flinched and began to cry “Oh, my God!” again in his groaning voice. Michaelis made a clumsy attempt to distract him.\n“How long have you been married, George? Come on there, try and sit still a minute, and answer my question. How long have you been married?”\n“Twelve years.”\n“Ever had any children? Come on, George, sit still—I asked you a question. Did you ever have any children?”\nThe hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light, and whenever Michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him like the car that hadn’t stopped a few hours before. He didn’t like to go into the garage, because the work bench was stained where the body had been lying, so he moved uncomfortably around the office—he knew every object in it before morning—and from time to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep him more quiet.\n“Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George? Maybe even if you haven’t been there for a long time? Maybe I could call up the church and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?”\n“Don’t belong to any.”\n“You ought to have a church, George, for times like this. You must have gone to church once. Didn’t you get married in a church? Listen, George, listen to me. Didn’t you get married in a church?”\n“That was a long time ago.”\nThe effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking—for a moment he was silent. Then the same half-knowing, half-bewildered look came back into his faded eyes.\n“Look in the drawer there,” he said, pointing at the desk.\n“Which drawer?”\n“That drawer—that one.”\nMichaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand. There was nothing in it but a small, expensive dog-leash, made of leather and braided silver. It was apparently new.\n“This?” he inquired, holding it up.\nWilson stared and nodded.\n“I found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell me about it, but I knew it was something funny.”\n“You mean your wife bought it?”\n“She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau.”\nMichaelis didn’t see anything odd in that, and he gave Wilson a dozen reasons why his wife might have bought the dog-leash. But conceivably Wilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle, because he began saying “Oh, my God!” again in a whisper—his comforter left several explanations in the air.\n“Then he killed her,” said Wilson. His mouth dropped open suddenly.\n“Who did?”\n“I have a way of finding out.”\n“You’re morbid, George,” said his friend. “This has been a strain to you and you don’t know what you’re saying. You’d better try and sit quiet till morning.”\n“He murdered her.”\n“It was an accident, George.”\nWilson shook his head. His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened slightly with the ghost of a superior “Hm!”\n“I know,” he said definitely. “I’m one of these trusting fellas and I don’t think any harm to nobody, but when I get to know a thing I know it. It was the man in that car. She ran out to speak to him and he wouldn’t stop.”\nMichaelis had seen this too, but it hadn’t occurred to him that there was any special significance in it. He believed that Mrs. Wilson had been running away from her husband, rather than trying to stop any particular car.\n“How could she of been like that?”\n“She’s a deep one,” said Wilson, as if that answered the question. “Ah-h-h—”\nHe began to rock again, and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in his hand.\n“Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George?”\nThis was a forlorn hope—he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend: there was not enough of him for his wife. He was glad a little later when he noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window, and realized that dawn wasn’t far off. About five o’clock it was blue enough outside to snap off the light.\nWilson’s glazed eyes turned out to the ash-heaps, where small grey clouds took on fantastic shapes and scurried here and there in the faint dawn wind.\n“I spoke to her,” he muttered, after a long silence. “I told her she might fool me but she couldn’t fool God. I took her to the window”—with an effort he got up and walked to the rear window and leaned with his face pressed against it—“and I said ‘God knows what you’ve been doing, everything you’ve been doing. You may fool me, but you can’t fool God!’ ”\nStanding behind him, Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, which had just emerged, pale and enormous, from the dissolving night.\n“God sees everything,” repeated Wilson.\n“That’s an advertisement,” Michaelis assured him. Something made him turn away from the window and look back into the room. But Wilson stood there a long time, his face close to the window pane, nodding into the twilight.",

Hearing his own words, he recoiled and started moaning \"Oh, my God!\" again in his painful voice. Michaelis made an awkward attempt to divert him. \"George, how long have you been married? Come on now, try to stay still for a minute and answer my question. How many years have you been married?\" \"Twelve years.\" \"Have you ever had any children? Come on, George, sit still—I asked you something. Did you ever have children?\" The persistent hard brown beetles kept hitting the dim light, and whenever Michaelis heard a car rushing down the road outside, it sounded to him like the car that had not stopped hours before. He preferred not to go into the garage because the workbench was stained from where the body had lain, so he restlessly moved around the office – he would know every detail of it by morning – and occasionally sat beside Wilson, trying to calm him down. \"George, do you have a church you attend sometimes? Even if you haven't been in a long time? Maybe I could call up the church and get a priest to come over and talk to you, see?\" \"Don't belong to one.\" \"You should have a church, George, for times like this. You must have gone to church at some point. Didn't you get married in a church? George, listen to me. Were you married in a church?\" \"That was a long time ago.\" Answering interrupted his rocking motion – he was silent for a moment. Then the same look, part knowing and part bewildered, returned to his tired eyes. \"Look in the drawer there,\" he said, pointing at the desk. \"Which drawer?\" \"That drawer—that one.\" Michaelis opened the drawer closest to him. Inside, there was nothing but a small, expensive dog leash made of leather and braided silver. It seemed new. \"This?\" he asked, holding it up. Wilson stared and nodded. \"I found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell me about it, but I knew something wasn't right.\" \"You mean your wife bought it?\" \"She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her dresser.\" Michaelis didn't find anything strange about that and gave Wilson many possible reasons his wife might have bought the dog leash. However, it's likely Wilson had heard some of these same explanations before, perhaps from Myrtle, because he began whispering \"Oh, my God!\" again – Michaelis's attempts to comfort him and his explanations were left unanswered. \"Then he killed her,\" Wilson stated. His mouth suddenly fell open. \"Who are you talking about?\" \"I have a way to find out.\" \"You're being morbid, George,\" his friend said. \"This ordeal has put a strain on you, and you don't know what you're saying. You should try to sit quietly until morning.\" \"He murdered her.\" \"George, it was an accident.\" Wilson shook his head. His eyes narrowed, and his mouth slightly widened with a hint of a superior \"Hm!\" \"I know,\" he said with certainty. \"I'm typically a trusting guy and don't mean harm to anyone, but when I learn something for sure, I know it. It was the man in that car. She ran out to speak to him, and he wouldn't stop.\" Michaelis had seen this too, but it hadn't occurred to him that it held any special importance. He believed Mrs. Wilson had been running away from her husband, rather than attempting to stop a particular car. \"How could she possibly have been like that?\" \"She's a complex person,\" Wilson said, as if that resolved the question. He sighed deeply. He started rocking again, and Michaelis stood, turning the leash over in his hand. \"Maybe there's a friend I could call for you, George?\" This was a desperate hope – he was almost certain Wilson had no friends; there didn't seem to be enough of him to even matter to his wife. He felt a little glad later when he noticed a change in the room, a blue brightening by the window, and realized dawn wasn't far off. Around five o'clock, it was blue enough outside to switch off the light indoors. Wilson's vacant eyes looked out towards the ash-heaps, where small gray clouds formed strange shapes and hurried about in the light dawn breeze. \"I spoke to her,\" he murmured after a long silence. \"I told her she might fool me, but she couldn't fool God. I led her to the window\" – with effort, he stood up and walked to the rear window, leaning with his face pressed against it – \"and I said, 'God knows what you've been doing, every single thing you've been doing. You might fool me, but you cannot fool God!'\" Standing behind him, Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, which had just appeared, pale and huge, out of the fading night. \"God sees everything,\" Wilson repeated. \"That's just an advertisement,\" Michaelis assured him.

Moving on, Wilson asked Michaelis to look in a drawer, where he found a fancy dog leash that Myrtle had recently bought. Wilson suspected there was something odd about it, and while Michaelis tried to give innocent explanations, Wilson grew distressed again.\n\nSuddenly Wilson asserted that someone had killed his wife, insisting he could find out who, despite Michaelis’s attempts to reason that it was an accident. Wilson was certain the man in the yellow car was responsible and believed Myrtle had tried to talk to him.\n\nMichaelis, seeing Wilson’s grief and confusion, wondered if he should call a friend but doubted Wilson had anyone. When dawn approached, Wilson stared out the window at the ash heaps and finally confessed he had told Myrtle that she might deceive him but couldn’t deceive God. He pointed to the billboard of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg’s eyes, likening them to God watching everything, even as Michaelis insisted it was just an advertisement.

Wilson was quieter now, and Michaelis went home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the garage, Wilson was gone.\nHis movements—he was on foot all the time—were afterward traced to Port Roosevelt and then to Gad’s Hill, where he bought a sandwich that he didn’t eat, and a cup of coffee. He must have been tired and walking slowly, for he didn’t reach Gad’s Hill until noon. Thus far there was no difficulty in accounting for his time—there were boys who had seen a man “acting sort of crazy,” and motorists at whom he stared oddly from the side of the road. Then for three hours he disappeared from view. The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis, that he “had a way of finding out,” supposed that he spent that time going from garage to garage thereabout, inquiring for a yellow car. On the other hand, no garage man who had seen him ever came forward, and perhaps he had an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to know. By half-past two he was in West Egg, where he asked someone the way to Gatsby’s house. So by that time he knew Gatsby’s name.\nAt two o’clock Gatsby put on his bathing-suit and left word with the butler that if anyone phoned word was to be brought to him at the pool. He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused his guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him to pump it up.

It was the man who had been watching the night before and promised to return, so Michaelis prepared breakfast for three people, which he and the other man consumed together. Wilson seemed more composed now, allowing Michaelis to leave for some sleep; when he woke up four hours later and hurried back to the repair shop, Wilson was no longer there. His movements—entirely on foot—were subsequently traced, first to Port Roosevelt, then to Gad’s Hill, where he purchased a sandwich he didn’t eat and a cup of coffee. He must have been exhausted and walking slowly, given that he didn't arrive at Gad’s Hill until midday. His time up to this point was easily accounted for; there were young boys who had seen a man appearing somewhat disturbed and drivers whom he stared at strangely from the roadside. He then vanished from sight for a period of three hours. The police, based on his remark to Michaelis about having \"a method for finding things out,\" speculated that he spent this time visiting nearby garages, searching for a yellow vehicle. However, no garage operator who encountered him ever came forward, suggesting he might have had a simpler, more certain way of obtaining the information he sought. By two-thirty that afternoon, he had reached West Egg and inquired with someone about how to get to Gatsby’s residence. Thus, he was aware of Gatsby's name by then. At two o’clock, Gatsby changed into his swimming costume and instructed the butler that if any calls came in, he was to be notified by the pool. He stopped at the garage to get an inflatable mattress that had been used for guest entertainment during the summer, and the chauffeur assisted him in pumping it up. He then gave explicit orders that the open car was not to be driven under any circumstances—which was odd considering the damaged front right fender needed repairs. Gatsby lifted the mattress onto his shoulder and began walking towards the pool. He paused briefly to adjust it, and the chauffeur offered assistance, but Gatsby shook his head and quickly disappeared among the trees whose leaves were starting to turn yellow.",

It was a man who had stayed to keep watch the previous night and had promised to return. Michaelis prepared breakfast for three people, and he and the visitor ate together. Wilson was now calmer, so Michaelis left to get some sleep. When Michaelis woke up four hours later and hurried back to the garage, he found that Wilson was no longer there.\n\nWilson’s movements—which were all on foot—were later traced first to Port Roosevelt, then to Gad’s Hill. There, he bought a sandwich (which he didn’t eat) and a cup of coffee. It’s likely he was tired and walked slowly, as he didn’t arrive in Gad’s Hill until noon. So far, accounting for his time was straightforward—some local boys remembered seeing a man behaving strangely, and some drivers noted that he stared at them oddly from the roadside. For the next three hours, though, there were no reports of anyone seeing him. Based on his conversation with Michaelis, where Wilson said he had his own way of finding things out, the police assumed he spent those hours going from garage to garage in the area, asking about a yellow car. Still, no garage owners who might have seen him reported doing so, so it’s possible he found out what he needed in an easier or more reliable way. By 2:30 PM, he was in West Egg, where he asked someone for directions to Gatsby’s house. So by then, he had already learned Gatsby’s name.\n\nAt 2 PM, Gatsby changed into his swimsuit and told his butler to let him know at the pool if anyone called. He made a stop at the garage to get a pneumatic mattress that guests had enjoyed over the summer, and the chauffeur helped him inflate it. Then Gatsby instructed that the open car should not be driven for any reason—which was odd, since the car’s front right fender needed to be repaired.\n\nCarrying the mattress, Gatsby walked toward the pool. He paused for a moment to adjust it, and when the chauffeur asked if he needed help, he declined. Soon after, he disappeared into the trees, their leaves starting to turn yellow."

I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn’t believe it would come, and perhaps he no longer cared. If that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream. He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about… like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward him through the amorphous trees.\nThe chauffeur—he was one of Wolfshiem’s protégés—heard the shots—afterwards he could only say that he hadn’t thought anything much about them. I drove from the station directly to Gatsby’s house and my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that alarmed anyone. But they knew then, I firmly believe. With scarcely a word said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener, and I hurried down to the pool.\nThere was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other. With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of transit, a thin red circle in the water.\nIt was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener saw Wilson’s body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was complete.",

I suspect Gatsby himself didn't truly expect the call to come, and perhaps he had even lost interest. If this was the case, he must have felt that he had lost touch with a comfortable, familiar past, having paid dearly for dedicating himself excessively to one ambition. He likely gazed at an alien sky through menacing foliage, shivering as he perceived the distortion in something as common as a rose and the harshness of the sunlight on the newly mowed lawn. He faced a new reality that seemed substantial but lacked authenticity, populated by unfortunate, spectral figures whose dreams sustained them like air, and who drifted aimlessly... much like the pale, surreal shape approaching him through the indistinct trees. The chauffeur, who was associated with Wolfshiem, heard the gunshots but later reported that he hadn't paid much attention to them at the time. I drove directly from the station to Gatsby's residence, and my hurried, worried ascent up the front steps was the first sign that something was wrong, alerting others. At that moment, I am certain, they understood. Almost silently, the four of us – the chauffeur, butler, gardener, and myself – rushed down to the swimming pool. The water showed a slight, almost undetectable stirring as the incoming fresh flow moved towards the drain. Carried on tiny ripples that were barely more than faint movements, the mattress with its weight drifted unevenly down the pool. Even a light breeze that barely wrinkled the water's surface was sufficient to alter the random path of the mattress and its unexpected load. When a clump of leaves touched it, the mattress slowly spun, leaving a faint red circle in the water, like the mark of a drawing compass. After we began to move Gatsby's body towards the house, the gardener discovered Wilson's body a short distance away in the grass, completing the tragedy.",

I suspect Gatsby himself had lost hope that the call would ever arrive and maybe he no longer even cared. If so, he must have felt the warm, comforting world he once knew had slipped away from him, that he’d sacrificed too much for a single dream. In those last moments, he must have gazed up at a sky that felt strange to him, shivered beneath unsettling leaves, and felt a chill at how bizarre a rose could appear and how harsh the sunlight was on newly grown grass. The world around him seemed new, physical but not truly alive—a realm where unlucky souls drifted through life, sustained only by their dreams, like the ghostly figure moving toward him among the shapeless trees.\n\nThe driver, who was one of Wolfshiem’s associates, heard gunshots, but later said he hadn’t thought much of them at the time. I hurried from the train station straight to Gatsby’s mansion, and my anxious arrival was the first thing that alerted anyone to trouble. But I believe that at that moment, they already knew something terrible had happened. Without much discussion, the chauffeur, butler, gardener, and I rushed to the pool.\n\nIn the stillness, the water barely moved as fresh water entered from one side and flowed toward the drain. On the surface, the mattress—with its heavy, tragic burden—floated unevenly, barely making any ripples. Even a light breeze that barely disturbed the water was enough to alter its path. As a clump of leaves brushed against it, the mattress slowly turned, tracing a thin, red circle across the pool, like the movement of a compass.\n\nAfter we started to carry Gatsby toward the house, the gardener noticed Wilson’s body lying in the grass nearby, and with that, the great tragedy was complete."

A rope stretched across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard, and there were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the pool. Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the expression “madman” as he bent over Wilson’s body that afternoon, and the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper reports next morning.\nMost of those reports were a nightmare—grotesque, circumstantial, eager, and untrue. When Michaelis’s testimony at the inquest brought to light Wilson’s suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade—but Catherine, who might have said anything, didn’t say a word. She showed a surprising amount of character about it too—looked at the coroner with determined eyes under that corrected brow of hers, and swore that her sister had never seen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband, that her sister had been into no mischief whatever. She convinced herself of it, and cried into her handkerchief, as if the very suggestion was more than she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a man “deranged by grief” in order that the case might remain in its simplest form. And it rested there.\nBut all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. I found myself on Gatsby’s side, and alone. From the moment I telephoned news of the catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and every practical question, was referred to me. At first I was surprised and confused; then, as he lay in his house and didn’t move or breathe or speak, hour upon hour, it grew upon me that I was responsible, because no one else was interested—interested, I mean, with that intense personal interest to which everyone has some vague right at the end.\nI called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her instinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away early that afternoon, and taken baggage with them.\n“Left no address?”\n“No.”\n“Say when they’d be back?”\n“No.”\n“Any idea where they are?

A barrier rope across the main gate with a policeman nearby kept the public away, but young boys quickly figured out they could access the property through my yard, and a few were always gathered around the pool, staring with their mouths open. Someone speaking authoritatively, perhaps a detective, referred to Wilson as a \"madman\" while examining his body that afternoon, and the apparent official weight of his remark influenced the tone of the newspaper articles the next morning. Many of those articles were dreadful—distorted, filled with extraneous details, overly eager, and inaccurate. When Michaelis's statement at the formal inquiry revealed Wilson's suspicions about his wife, I expected the entire story would soon be turned into sensational, gossipy accounts—but Catherine, who could have revealed anything, remained silent. She demonstrated a surprising amount of resolve regarding the situation—looking at the coroner with determined eyes under her modified eyebrows, and swore that her sister had never met Gatsby, was completely content with her husband, and had been involved in nothing improper. She convinced herself of this, and cried into her handkerchief, as if the very suggestion was too much for her to bear. Consequently, Wilson was characterized as a man \"driven insane by grief\" so that the official explanation could remain simple. And that's where the matter concluded. But this whole aspect felt distant and insignificant. I found myself supporting Gatsby, and I was isolated in this. From the moment I contacted the village of West Egg with news of the tragedy, every theory about him, and every practical question, was directed to me. Initially, I was startled and confused; then, as he lay motionless, silent, and not breathing in his house for hours on end, it gradually became clear to me that I was the one who needed to handle things, because no one else was interested—interested, I mean, with that deep, personal concern that everyone feels they have some vague right to at the end. I called Daisy about half an hour after we discovered him, calling her automatically and without hesitation. But she and Tom had departed early that afternoon, taking their luggage with them. \"Did they leave a forwarding address?\" \"No.\" \"Did they say when they'd return?\" \"No.\" \"Do you have any idea where they are? How I might get in touch with them?\" \"I don't know. I can't say.\"",

When Michaelis revealed at the inquest that Wilson had been suspicious of his wife, I expected the whole story to be sensationalized in the press.

She demonstrated unexpected strength, met the coroner’s eyes confidently, and swore that her sister had never met Gatsby, was perfectly content with her husband, and had done nothing wrong.

I’m afraid no one’s there.”\nI went back to the drawing-room and thought for an instant that they were chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled it. But, though they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with shocked eyes, his protest continued in my brain:\n“Look here, old sport, you’ve got to get somebody for me. You’ve got to try hard. I can’t go through this alone.”\nSomeone started to ask me questions, but I broke away and going upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk—he’d never told me definitely that his parents were dead. But there was nothing—only the picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence, staring down from the wall.\nNext morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem, which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next train. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it. I was sure he’d start when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there’d be a wire from Daisy before noon—but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem arrived; no one arrived except more police and photographers and newspaper men. When the butler brought back Wolfshiem’s answer I began to have a feeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and me against them all.\nDear Mr. Carraway. This has been one of the most terrible shocks of my life to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all. Such a mad act as that man did should make us all think.

Get my wire?”\n“There haven’t been any wires.”\n“Young Parke’s in trouble,” he said rapidly. “They picked him up when he handed the bonds over the counter.

Just trust that I will find someone.\" Meyer Wolfshiem wasn't listed in the telephone directory. The butler provided his office address on Broadway. I contacted Information for his number, but by the time I got it, it was well past five o'clock, and nobody answered the call. \"Could you please try calling again?\" I asked. \"I've already dialed three times,\" she replied. \"This is extremely important,\" I insisted. \"My apologies, but I don't believe anyone is available there,\" she said. Returning to the living room, I briefly thought the many official-looking people who had suddenly filled the space were just casual callers. However, they pulled back the sheet covering Gatsby and gazed at him with horrified expressions. Inside my head, I could still hear his plea echoing, \"Listen, old friend, you absolutely must find someone for me. You have to make a real effort. I can't face this by myself.\" Someone began directing questions at me, but I got away and went upstairs to quickly look through the parts of his desk that weren't locked – he'd never explicitly stated whether his parents were deceased. But I found nothing revealing – only the photograph of Dan Cody, a reminder of past turmoil, staring down from the wall. The following morning, I dispatched the butler to New York with a letter for Wolfshiem, requesting details and urging him to catch the very next train. As I wrote it, the request seemed unnecessary; I was convinced he would react upon seeing the news in the papers, just as I was certain I would receive a telegram from Daisy before noon. But neither a telegram nor Mr. Wolfshiem appeared. The only arrivals were more police officers, photographers, and journalists. When the butler returned with Wolfshiem's reply, I started to feel a sense of defiance, a scornful sense of alliance connecting Gatsby and me against everyone else.

You never know what'll happen in these small towns...\" \"Hello!\" I broke in breathlessly. \"Listen – this isn't Mr. Gatsby.

The butler gave me Wolfshiem’s office address on Broadway, so I called directory assistance, but by the time I got the number it was past five o’clock and no one answered.\n\n“Will you call again?” \n“I’ve called three times.” \n“It’s very important.” \n“Sorry, I don’t think anyone’s there.”\n\nI went back into the drawing-room. For a moment, all the official people who had suddenly filled the space seemed like strangers, just bystanders. But even when they pulled back the sheet and gazed at Gatsby with shocked expressions, I could still hear his pleading in my mind: \n\n\"Listen, old sport, you have to find someone for me. You have to really try. I can’t face this alone.\"\n\nSomeone started to ask me questions, but I pulled away. I headed upstairs and rifled through the unlocked areas of Gatsby’s desk; he’d never clearly told me his parents had died. There was nothing in the desk, only a portrait of Dan Cody on the wall, a memento of some forgotten brutality.\n\nThe next morning I sent the butler into New York with a letter for Wolfshiem, asking for information and urging him to come on the next train. The request felt almost pointless as I wrote it. Surely, I thought, he’d visit once he saw the news, just as I was certain Daisy would get in touch by noon. Neither Daisy nor Wolfshiem contacted us; no one showed up except more police, photographers, and journalists. When the butler returned with Wolfshiem’s response, I began to feel a sense of defiance—a kind of bond between Gatsby and me against everyone else.\n\nWolfshiem’s letter read:\n\nDear Mr. Carraway, This is one of the worst shocks of my life, I can hardly believe it. Such a senseless act should make us all think. I can’t come right now since I am tied up in important business and shouldn’t get involved. If there’s anything I can do later, let me know by letter to Edgar. I’m still in shock from the news and completely overwhelmed.\n\nSincerely,\nMeyer Wolfshiem\n\nThen, scrawled underneath: Let me know about the funeral, etc. I don’t know his family at all.\n\nThat afternoon the phone rang, and Long Distance said someone from Chicago was calling. I thought perhaps this was finally Daisy. But when the connection went through, it was a thin, distant male voice.\n\n“This is Slagle speaking…”\n“Yes?” I didn’t recognize the name.\n“Heard the news? Did you get my telegram?”\n“There haven’t been any messages.”\n“Young Parke got into trouble,” he said quickly. “He was arrested when he tried to cash the bonds. They got a warning from New York with the bond numbers just five minutes earlier. Can you believe it? These small-town cops—”\n\n“Hello!” I cut in, short of breath. “This isn’t Mr. Gatsby. Mr. Gatsby is dead.”\n\nThere was a long silence on the other end, then a shout, and a sudden click as the line went dead."

He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he couldn’t buy some regular clothes. First time I saw him was when he came into Winebrenner’s poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked for a job. He hadn’t eat anything for a couple of days. ‘Come on have some lunch with me,’ I said. He ate more than four dollars’ worth of food in half an hour.”\n“Did you start him in business?” I inquired.\n“Start him! I made him.”\n“Oh.”\n“I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter.

I got him to join the American Legion and he used to stand high there. Right off he did some work for a client of mine up to Albany. We were so thick like that in everything”—he held up two bulbous fingers—“always together.”\nI wondered if this partnership had included the World’s Series transaction in 1919.\n“Now he’s dead,” I said after a moment. “You were his closest friend, so I know you’ll want to come to his funeral this afternoon.”\n“I’d like to come.”\n“Well, come then.”\nThe hair in his nostrils quivered slightly, and as he shook his head his eyes filled with tears.\n“I can’t do it—I can’t get mixed up in it,” he said.\n“There’s nothing to get mixed up in. It’s all over now.”\n“When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any way. I keep out. When I was a young man it was different—if a friend of mine died, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end. You may think that’s sentimental, but I mean it—to the bitter end.”\nI saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come, so I stood up.\n“Are you a college man?” he inquired suddenly.\nFor a moment I thought he was going to suggest a “gonnegtion,” but he only nodded and shook my hand.\n“Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead,” he suggested. “After that my own rule is to let everything alone.”",

It is all finished now,” I argued. “When a man is killed, I never like to be connected to it in any way. I stay out. It was different when I was young—if a friend of mine died, no matter how, I remained with them until the end. You may find that sentimental, but I mean it—absolutely to the end.” Realizing he was determined not to come for reasons of his own, I rose to leave. “Are you a college graduate?” he suddenly asked. For a moment, I thought he might propose a “connection,” but he merely nodded and shook my hand. “Let us learn to demonstrate our friendship for a person when they are alive, not after they have passed away,” he suggested. “After that, my personal rule is to leave everything be.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "On the morning of the funeral, I went to New York to see Meyer Wolfshiem in person since I couldn't contact him any other way. Based on an elevator boy's advice, I entered an office marked \"The Swastika Holding Company.\" At first, the place seemed deserted. After calling out several times with no response, I heard an argument from behind a partition. Soon, an attractive Jewish woman appeared, eyeing me suspiciously. She told me no one was there and that Mr. Wolfshiem had gone to Chicago, although I knew someone was inside because I could hear someone whistling a tune. I asked her to tell Mr. Wolfshiem that Mr. Carraway wanted to see him, but she insisted she couldn't bring him back from Chicago. Just then, I heard Wolfshiem's voice call \"Stella!\" from inside. The woman quickly asked me to leave my name, but I protested, knowing he was really there. She angrily accused me of trying to force my way in. When I mentioned Gatsby, however, her demeanor changed and she asked my name again before disappearing. Shortly thereafter, Wolfshiem himself appeared and invited me into his office, expressing sadness over the situation and offering me a cigar. He reminisced about first meeting Gatsby after the war when he was a decorated and struggling young man who wore his uniform because he couldn't afford regular clothes and was looking for a job. Wolfshiem said he helped Gatsby get started and spoke highly of his character and background. I wondered if Wolfshiem's business dealings with Gatsby included the infamous 1919 World Series scandal. I told him Gatsby was dead and invited him to the funeral, but Wolfshiem declined, saying he did not want to get involved in such matters. He explained that while he used to stand by his friends to the very end, now he avoided such involvement after death. As I realized he would not come to the funeral, I stood up to leave. He suddenly asked if I was a college man, but instead of proposing any connection, he simply shook my hand and gave me some advice: we should show our friendship to people while they are alive, not after they are gone, and after that, let things be."

As we started through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then the sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground. I looked around. It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found marvelling over Gatsby’s books in the library one night three months before.\nI’d never seen him since then. I don’t know how he knew about the funeral, or even his name. The rain poured down his thick glasses, and he took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled from Gatsby’s grave.\nI tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment, but he was already too far away, and I could only remember, without resentment, that Daisy hadn’t sent a message or a flower. Dimly I heard someone murmur “Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on,” and then the owl-eyed man said “Amen to that,” in a brave voice.\nWe straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars. Owl-eyes spoke to me by the gate.\n“I couldn’t get to the house,” he remarked.\n“Neither could anybody else.”\n“Go on!” He started. “Why, my God! they used to go there by the hundreds.”\nHe took off his glasses and wiped them again, outside and in.\n“The poor son-of-a-bitch,” he said.",

As we began to move through the cemetery gate, I heard another car come to a halt, followed by the sound of someone splashing after us across the wet ground. I turned to look. It was the man with the owl-eyed spectacles, whom I had discovered three months prior, amazed by Gatsby's books in his library one evening. I hadn't encountered him since then. I had no idea how he learned about the funeral or even what his name was. The rain streamed down his thick lenses, and he removed them to clean them so he could view the protective cover being pulled back from Gatsby's grave. I made an effort to contemplate Gatsby for a moment then, but he felt too distant already, and I could only recall, without any resentment, that Daisy had not sent a message or any flowers. I faintly heard someone softly say, \"Blessed are the departed upon whom the rain falls,\" and then the owl-eyed man declared, \"Amen to that,\" with apparent firmness. We quickly made our way back through the rain to the cars. Owl-eyes spoke to me near the gate. \"I wasn't able to make it to the house,\" he mentioned. \"Nor was anyone else,\" I replied. \"Really!\" He seemed startled. \"Good heavens!

At about five, our small group of three vehicles—first a stark black hearse, then a limousine carrying Mr. Gatz, the minister, and myself, and finally, Gatsby’s station wagon with several servants and the West Egg postman, all drenched from the rain—arrived at the cemetery. Just as we walked in, I heard another car arrive; someone was slogging through the wet grass behind us. It turned out to be the man with large owl-like glasses, whom I’d seen admiring Gatsby’s library months earlier. I hadn’t seen or heard from him since, and didn’t even know his name. Rain poured down his spectacles as he wiped them, observing the canvas being rolled off Gatsby’s grave. I tried to remember Gatsby, but he already seemed distant, and I could only note, without bitterness, that Daisy hadn’t sent a flower or a note.

          "text_segment": "One of my most vivid memories is of coming back West from prep school and later from college at Christmas time. Those who went farther than Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o’clock of a December evening, with a few Chicago friends, already caught up into their own holiday gaieties, to bid them a hasty goodbye. I remember the fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This-or-That’s and the chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught sight of old acquaintances, and the matchings of invitations: “Are you going to the Ordways’? the Herseys’? the Schultzes’?” and the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands. And last the murky yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate.\nWhen we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow, began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and the dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild brace came suddenly into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our identity with this country for one strange hour, before we melted indistinguishably into it again.\nThat’s my Middle West—not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede towns, but the thrilling returning trains of my youth, and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a little solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are still called through decades by a family’s name. I see now that this has been a story of the West, after all—Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.\nEven when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware of its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the Ohio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the children and the very old—even then it had always for me a quality of distortion. West Egg, especially, still figures in my more fantastic dreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at once conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging sky and a lustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn men in dress suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles over the side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men turn in at a house—the wrong house. But no one knows the woman’s name, and no one cares.\nAfter Gatsby’s death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted beyond my eyes’ power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line I decided to come back home.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "One of my clearest recollections is returning home to the Midwest from boarding school and later college around Christmas. Those traveling beyond Chicago would gather at the old, dimly lit Union Station at six on a December evening, accompanied by a few Chicago friends already caught up in their own holiday celebrations, for quick goodbyes. I remember the fur coats worn by girls coming back from Eastern schools, the visible vapor from our cold breath as we chatted, and hands waving overhead as we recognized old friends. We'd exchange invitations, asking, “Are you attending the Ordways’ party? The Herseys’? The Schultzes’?” and held our long green tickets tightly in our gloved hands. Finally, the dark yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad looked as festive as Christmas itself parked on the tracks by the gate. When we departed into the winter night and the true snow, our familiar snow, began to stretch alongside us and sparkle against the windows, and the faint lights of small Wisconsin towns drifted past, the air suddenly felt sharply and invigoratingly wild. We inhaled it deeply as we walked back from the dining car through the chilly connections between cars, intensely aware of our connection to this land for one strange hour before we blended back into it unnoticed. That's how I think of my Middle West—not the farmland or the open plains or the forgotten towns settled by Swedes, but the exciting train trips home from my youth, and the streetlights and sleigh bells in the frosty darkness, and the shapes of holly wreaths cast by lighted windows onto the snow. I belong to that environment, made a little serious by the feeling of those long winters, and a little content from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where residences are still referred to by family names even after decades. I now understand that this narrative has been fundamentally a story of the West; Tom, Gatsby, Daisy, Jordan, and I were all originally from the West, and perhaps we shared some inadequacy that made us subtly unable to thrive in Eastern life. Even when the East captivated me the most, even when I was most keenly aware of how it surpassed the bored, scattered, inflated towns beyond the Ohio River, with their endless interrogations that only spared the very young and the very old—even then, it always seemed to have a quality of unreality. West Egg, in particular, still appears in my more bizarre dreams. I envision it like a scene from an El Greco painting: many houses, both ordinary and strange simultaneously, crouching beneath a gloomy, low-hanging sky and a dull moon. In the foreground, four solemn-looking men in formal attire walk along the sidewalk carrying a stretcher bearing a drunken woman in a white evening gown. Her hand, hanging over the side, sparkles coldly with jewels. Solemnly, the men enter a house—the incorrect one. But no one knows the woman’s name, and no one seems to care. After Gatsby’s death, the East felt haunted to me in that manner, distorted beyond my ability to perceive it clearly. So, when the faint smell of burning autumn leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet clothes stiff on the laundry line, I decided to return home.",

Breathing in deeply as we walked back from supper through the chilly vestibules, we felt acutely connected to the land for that brief, strange hour, before blending back into it\nunnoticeably.\n\nThis is what the Midwest means to me—not wheat, prairie, or forgotten towns, but the exhilarating trains of my youth, the lamplight and sleigh bells in the crisp dark, the shadows of holly wreaths cast by glowing windows on snowy lawns. I belong to that world, weighed down a little by those long winters, feeling some pride from growing up in a family house that bears our name for generations. I realize now this has always been a story of the West—Tom, Gatsby, Daisy, Jordan, and myself all came from there, sharing some subtle shortcoming that made us not fully at home in the East.\n\nEven when the East thrilled me, even when I recognized how it surpassed the monotonous, sprawling, bloated towns beyond the Ohio, with their endless probing that spared only children and the old—even then, it seemed somehow warped to me. West Egg, in particular, still appears in my stranger dreams: a nocturnal scene like an El Greco painting—hundreds of houses, familiar yet bizarre, huddling beneath a heavy, somber sky and a dead moon. In the foreground, four solemn men in formal wear carry a stretcher bearing a drunken woman in a white evening gown, her bejeweled hand dangling as they mistakenly bring her to the wrong home. No one knows her name or seems to care.\n\nAfter Gatsby died, the East became this way in my mind—so oddly twisted that I couldn’t adjust to it. So, as autumn arrived, with the scent of burning leaves in the air and the wind snapping damp laundry on clotheslines, I decided it was time to return home."

But I wanted to leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent sea to sweep my refuse away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and around what had happened to us together, and what had happened afterward to me, and she lay perfectly still, listening, in a big chair.\nShe was dressed to play golf, and I remember thinking she looked like a good illustration, her chin raised a little jauntily, her hair the colour of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee. When I had finished she told me without comment that she was engaged to another man. I doubted that, though there were several she could have married at a nod of her head, but I pretended to be surprised. For just a minute I wondered if I wasn’t making a mistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up to say goodbye.\n“Nevertheless you did throw me over,” said Jordan suddenly. “You threw me over on the telephone. I don’t give a damn about you now, but it was a new experience for me, and I felt a little dizzy for a while.”\nWe shook hands.\n“Oh, and do you remember”—she added—“a conversation we had once about driving a car?”\n“Why—not exactly.”\n“You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver? Well, I met another bad driver, didn’t I? I mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride.”\n“I’m thirty,” I said. “I’m five years too old to lie to myself and call it honour.”\nShe didn’t answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously sorry, I turned away.\nOne afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a little from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving sharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as I slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into the windows of a jewellery store. Suddenly he saw me and walked back, holding out his hand.\n“What’s the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me?”\n“Yes. You know what I think of you.”\n“You’re crazy, Nick,” he said quickly. “Crazy as hell. I don’t know what’s the matter with you.”\n“Tom,” I inquired, “what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?”\nHe stared at me without a word, and I knew I had guessed right about those missing hours. I started to turn away, but he took a step after me and grabbed my arm.\n“I told him the truth,” he said. “He came to the door while we were getting ready to leave, and when I sent down word that we weren’t in he tried to force his way upstairs. He was crazy enough to kill me if I hadn’t told him who owned the car. His hand was on a revolver in his pocket every minute he was in the house—” He broke off defiantly. “What if I did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw dust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy’s, but he was a tough one. He ran over Myrtle like you’d run over a dog and never even stopped his car.”\nThere was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it wasn’t true.\n“And if you think I didn’t have my share of suffering—look here, when I went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard, I sat down and cried like a baby. By God it was awful—”\nI couldn’t forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made…\nI shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as though I were talking to a child. Then he went into the jewellery store to buy a pearl necklace—or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons—rid of my provincial squeamishness forever.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Before I left, there was one uncomfortable task I felt I needed to complete, even though it might have been easier to avoid it. However, I wanted to tie up loose ends instead of just hoping the uncaring sea would wash away the debris of my time there. I met with Jordan Baker to discuss what had happened between us and my experiences since then. She remained perfectly still, listening from a large chair.\nShe was dressed for golf, and I recall thinking she looked like a picture, with her chin held slightly defiantly, her hair the color of autumn leaves, and her face the same tanned shade as the fingerless glove on her knee. When I finished speaking, she informed me matter-of-factly that she was engaged to someone else. Although I doubted this, as she could easily have married many men, I acted surprised. For a moment, I questioned if I was making a mistake, but then I quickly reconsidered everything and stood up to say goodbye.\n\"Regardless, you did break things off with me,\" Jordan said abruptly. \"You did it over the phone. I don't care about you anymore, but it was a new sensation for me, and I felt a bit disoriented for a while.\"\nWe shook hands.\n\"Oh, and do you remember,\" she added, \"a conversation we once had about driving?\"\n\"Hmm—not precisely.\"\n\"You said a reckless driver was only safe until she encountered another reckless driver? Well, I met another reckless driver, didn't I? I mean, it was careless of me to misjudge you so completely. I thought you were quite an honest, straightforward person. I thought that was something you secretly took pride in.\"\n\"I'm thirty,\" I replied. \"I'm too old by five years to lie to myself and call it integrity.\"\nShe didn't respond. Feeling angry, still partly in love with her, and deeply regretful, I turned away.\nOne late October afternoon, I encountered Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead of me on Fifth Avenue in his usual sharp, aggressive manner, his arms slightly away from his sides as if ready to confront obstacles, his head constantly turning, adapting to his restless gaze. Just as I slowed down to avoid catching up with him, he stopped and began gazing intently into the windows of a jewelry store. Suddenly, he saw me and walked back, extending his hand.\n\"What's wrong, Nick? Don't you want to shake my hand?\"\n\"No. You know how I feel about you.\"\n\"You're insane, Nick,\" he said quickly. \"Completely out of your mind. I don't understand what's gotten into you.\"\n\"Tom,\" I asked, \"what did you tell Wilson that afternoon?\"\nHe stared at me silently, and I realized my suspicion about those missing hours was correct. I started to leave, but he took a step and grabbed my arm.\n\"I told him the truth,\" he stated. \"He showed up at the door as we were preparing to leave, and when I sent word we weren't home, he tried to force his way upstairs. He was desperate enough to kill me if I hadn't told him who owned the car. His hand was on a gun in his pocket the entire time he was in the house—\" He stopped, speaking defiantly. \"What if I did tell him? That guy had it coming. He deceived you just like he did Daisy, but he was a tough one. He hit Myrtle with his car like you'd hit a dog and didn't even slow down.\"\nThere was nothing I could say, except the single, inexpressible fact that his story was false.\n\"And if you think I didn't suffer—look, when I went to clear out that apartment and saw that awful box of dog biscuits on the side table, I broke down and cried like a baby. My God, it was terrible—\"\nI couldn't forgive him or like him, but I saw that from his perspective, what he had done was completely justified. It was all very reckless and chaotic. Tom and Daisy were thoughtless people—they ruined things and people and then retreated into their wealth or their immense indifference, or whatever held them together, leaving others to clean up the destruction they caused…\nI shook his hand; it seemed pointless not to, as I suddenly felt I was speaking to a child. Then he entered the jewelry store, presumably to buy a pearl necklace or perhaps just cufflinks, free forever from my provincial disapproval.",

I met with Jordan Baker and we skirted around our shared past and what had happened to me since, while she sat quietly in a large chair, attentive and unmoving. She was dressed for golf, and I thought she looked striking, her chin held high, her hair autumn-colored, her face matching her brown glove. When I finished, she told me she was engaged to someone else, though I wasn’t sure I believed her—even if she could have married many men. I acted surprised. For a fleeting moment, I doubted my decision, but reconsidered quickly and moved to leave. \n\nJordan remarked that I had ended things with her over the phone, an experience that had briefly unsettled her, though she claimed not to care now. We shook hands. She brought up an old conversation about bad drivers, reminding me that she had finally encountered one as careless as herself, hinting she was wrong in judging me to be so upright. I responded that at my age, I was too old to deceive myself in the name of honor. She didn’t reply; I left, feeling angry, somewhat in love, and very sorry.\n\nLater, in October, I encountered Tom Buchanan on Fifth Avenue. He was walking with his usual confidence and readiness for confrontation. As I slowed to avoid passing him, he stopped at a jewelry store window and, noticing me, approached with a hand extended. When he asked if I would shake his hand, I replied that I wouldn’t, because of what I thought of him. He dismissed me as crazy, but I pressed him about what he told Wilson that day. From his reaction, I knew my suspicions were correct. As I turned to go, Tom stopped me and explained that Wilson, in a desperate and dangerous state, had confronted them—armed—and that Tom had told him the truth about Gatsby’s car. Tom defended his actions, saying Gatsby deserved his fate, recounting his own distress at Myrtle’s death.\n\nThough I couldn’t forgive or like Tom, I understood that he viewed his actions as justified. Everything seemed muddled and irresponsible. Tom and Daisy were heedless people—they damaged others and then withdrew into their wealth or apathy, leaving others to deal with the consequences. I shook Tom’s hand, feeling it was futile not to, sensing I was dealing with a child. He then went into the store, perhaps to buy jewelry, as I let go of my naive sensitivities for good."

One of the taxi drivers in the village never took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and pointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to East Egg the night of the accident, and perhaps he had made a story about it all his own. I didn’t want to hear it and I avoided him when I got off the train.\nI spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming, dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the music and the laughter, faint and incessant, from his garden, and the cars going up and down his drive. One night I did hear a material car there, and saw its lights stop at his front steps. But I didn’t investigate. Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and didn’t know that the party was over.\nOn the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer, I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more. On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight, and I erased it, drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to the beach and sprawled out on the sand.\nMost of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors’ eyes—a fresh, green breast of the new world. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby’s house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.\nAnd as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy’s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.\nGatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further… And one fine morning—\nSo we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.",

A local taxi driver would invariably pause at the entrance gate when passing by, pointing it out. Perhaps he was the one who transported Daisy and Gatsby to East Egg the evening of the crash, and perhaps he had devised his own account of the incident. I had no desire to hear it and avoided him upon arriving by train. I spent my Saturday evenings in Manhattan, as his vibrant, spectacular parties were so vividly etched in my memory that I could still faintly hear the constant music and laughter emanating from his garden, along with the vehicles moving along his driveway. On one occasion, I did hear a car physically present there and saw its headlights stop at his front steps. However, I didn't look into it. It was likely some final attendee who had been abroad and was unaware the celebration had concluded. On my final night, with my belongings packed and my vehicle sold to the grocer, I returned to gaze upon that vast, chaotic failure of a house one last time. On the white stairway, an vulgar word, scratched there by a young boy using a piece of brick, was starkly visible under the moonlight, and I removed it by scraping my shoe roughly across the stone. Afterward, I ambled down to the shoreline and lay sprawled on the sand. Most of the large houses along the coast were now shut, and there were few lights besides the indistinct, shifting glow of a ferryboat crossing Long Island Sound. As the moon climbed higher, the less significant buildings seemed to fade away until I gradually perceived the ancient island itself, which had once appeared as a fresh, green expanse to the eyes of Dutch sailors—a fertile, burgeoning land of the new world. Its vanished trees, those cleared to make way for Gatsby's mansion, had previously whispered promises to the ultimate and grandest of human aspirations; for a brief, magical instant, humans must have been breathless in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic appreciation they neither comprehended nor sought, facing for the last time in history something equal to their capacity for wonder. And as I sat there contemplating the ancient, unfamiliar world, I recalled Gatsby's sense of marvel when he first spotted the green light at the end of Daisy's pier. He had traveled a considerable distance to reach this blue-tinged lawn, and his aspiration must have seemed so near that success felt almost inevitable. He failed to realize it was already behind him, lost in the vast darkness beyond the city, where the dark fields of the United States stretched out beneath the night sky. Gatsby held faith in the green light, the ecstatic future that continually retreats before us year after year. It eluded us then, but that is unimportant—tomorrow we will strive harder, extend our reach further… And one beautiful morning— So we persist, like boats battling against the current, continuously carried back towards the past.",

One night, I actually heard a car outside and saw its headlights at the front steps, but didn’t check—it was likely a final guest who hadn’t realized the festivities had ended.\n\nOn my last evening, after packing my trunk and selling my car to the grocer, I went over to look at that immense, chaotic house one more time.
