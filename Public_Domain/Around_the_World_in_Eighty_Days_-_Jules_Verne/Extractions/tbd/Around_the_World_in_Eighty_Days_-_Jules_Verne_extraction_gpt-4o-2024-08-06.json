He was known for his love of whist, a card game he played with a quiet intensity that matched his overall demeanor.\n\nIt was during one of these games at the club that a conversation arose about the possibility of traveling around the world in eighty days. The topic was sparked by a newspaper article, and it quickly became a subject of debate among the members. Some argued that it was impossible, while others believed it could be done with the advancements in transportation.\n\nMr. Fogg, who had been listening quietly, suddenly made a bold statement. He declared that it was indeed possible to travel around the world in eighty days, and he was willing to wager a substantial sum of money to prove it. This unexpected challenge set the stage for an extraordinary adventure that would test the limits of time, technology, and human determination.",

Fogg's demeanor and lifestyle were in perfect harmony with the club's ethos, making him a natural member.\n\nDespite his regular attendance, Fogg was not known for engaging in lengthy conversations or forming close friendships with other members. He was a man of few words, preferring to observe and listen rather than participate actively in discussions. His reserved nature and enigmatic personality only added to the air of mystery that surrounded him.\n\nFogg's admission to the club was a testament to his standing in society and his adherence to the values and expectations of a gentleman of his time. It was a place where he could indulge in his love for whist, a card game he played with great skill and concentration. His presence at the club was marked by his quiet confidence and unwavering composure, qualities that would later serve him well in his extraordinary journey around the world.\n\nIn essence, Phileas Fogg's membership in the Reform Club was a reflection of his character—unassuming yet distinguished, methodical yet enigmatic. It was the perfect setting for a man who would soon embark on an adventure that would challenge the very limits of time and space.",

At twenty minutes to six he returned to the reading-room, and for two hours he perused the Pall Mall Gazette. A whist party soon made its appearance, and Phileas Fogg began to play with his usual partners, Flanagan, Fallentin, and Ralph, at twenty minutes past six. The game lasted until midnight, and the stakes were high. Andrew Stuart, one of the players, remarked on the punctuality of Fogg's routine, which led to a conversation about the possibility of traveling around the world in eighty days, a topic that would soon become of great consequence to Fogg."

A thief?” Ralph said incredulously. “That’s hard to believe.”\n\n“Indeed,” Stuart nodded. “But Fix is determined to follow Fogg and see where his journey leads.”\n\n“Well, it seems we have two races on our hands,” Flanagan observed. “One to catch a thief, and another to circle the globe.”\n\n“Indeed,” Stuart agreed. “And both are equally thrilling.”\n\nThe conversation continued, with the gentlemen speculating on the outcome of Fogg’s journey and the fate of the bank robber.

His ability to remain composed under pressure was a key factor in their progress.\n\nNow, as they prepared to continue their adventure, Mr. Fogg's simple affirmation of \"Good\" was enough to reassure his companions that they were on the right track, and that success was within their grasp.",

Do you accept?\"\n\n\"We accept,\" replied Messrs. Stuart, Fallentin, Sullivan, Flanagan, and Ralph, after consulting each other.\n\n\"Good,\" said Mr. Fogg. \"The train leaves for Dover at a quarter before nine. I will take it.\"\n\n\"This very evening?\" asked Stuart.\n\n\"This very evening,\" returned Phileas Fogg. He took out and consulted a pocket almanac, and added, \"As today is Wednesday, the 2nd of October, I shall be due in London, in this very room of the Reform Club, on Saturday, the 21st of December, at a quarter before nine p.m.; or else the twenty thousand pounds, now deposited in my name at Baring's, will belong to you, in fact and in right, gentlemen. Here is a cheque for the amount.\"\n\nA memorandum of the wager was at once drawn up and signed by the six parties. During that evening's whist game, Mr. Fogg was as composed as ever. He did not bet to win, and had only risked half of his fortune, because he foresaw that he might have need of the other half to carry out this difficult, not to say unattainable, project. As for his antagonists, they seemed much agitated; not so much by the value of their stake, as because they had some scruples about betting under conditions so difficult to their friend.\n\nThe clock struck seven, and the party offered to suspend the game so that Mr. Fogg might make his preparations for departure.\n\n\"I am quite ready now,\" was his tranquil response. \"Diamonds are trumps: be so good as to play, gentlemen.\""

As they passed through Sydenham, Passepartout suddenly uttered a cry of dismay.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Mr. Fogg calmly.\n\n\"Alas! In my hurry, I forgot—\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"To turn off the gas in my room!\"\n\n\"Very well, young man,\" returned Mr. Fogg, coolly; \"it will burn—at your expense.\""

Some took sides with Phileas Fogg, but the large majority shook their heads and declared against him; it was absurd, impossible, they declared, that the tour of the world could be made, except theoretically and on paper, in this minimum of time, and with the existing means of travelling. The Times, Standard, Morning Post, and Daily News, and twenty other highly respectable newspapers scouted Mr. Fogg’s project as madness; the Daily Telegraph alone hesitatingly supported him. People in general thought him a lunatic, and blamed his Reform Club friends for having accepted a wager which betrayed the mental aberration of its proposer.\nArticles no less passionate than logical appeared on the question, for geography is one of the pet subjects of the English; and the columns devoted to Phileas Fogg’s venture were eagerly devoured by all classes of readers. At first some rash individuals, principally of the gentler sex, espoused his cause, which became still more popular when the Illustrated London News came out with his portrait, copied from a photograph in the Reform Club.

His servant, Passepartout, was less reserved, and his excitement about the journey was evident to anyone who spoke with him.\n\nAs the days passed, the anticipation grew.

The “Mongolia” plied regularly between Brindisi and Bombay viâ the Suez Canal, and was one of the fastest steamers belonging to the company, always making more than ten knots an hour between Brindisi and Suez, and nine and a half between Suez and Bombay.\nTwo men were promenading up and down the wharves, among the crowd of natives and strangers who were sojourning at this once straggling village—now, thanks to the enterprise of M. Lesseps, a fast-growing town. One was the British consul at Suez, who, despite the prophecies of the English Government, and the unfavourable predictions of Stephenson, was in the habit of seeing, from his office window, English ships daily passing to and fro on the great canal, by which the old roundabout route from England to India by the Cape of Good Hope was abridged by at least a half. The other was a small, slight-built personage, with a nervous, intelligent face, and bright eyes peering out from under eyebrows which he was incessantly twitching. He was just now manifesting unmistakable signs of impatience, nervously pacing up and down, and unable to stand still for a moment. This was Fix, one of the detectives who had been dispatched from England in search of the bank robber; it was his task to narrowly watch every passenger who arrived at Suez, and to follow up all who seemed to be suspicious characters, or bore a resemblance to the description of the criminal, which he had received two days before from the police headquarters at London. The detective was evidently inspired by the hope of obtaining the splendid reward which would be the prize of success, and awaited with a feverish impatience, easy to understand, the arrival of the steamer “Mongolia.”\n“So you say, consul,” asked he for the twentieth time, “that this steamer is never behind time?”\n“No, Mr. Fix,” replied the consul. “She was bespoken yesterday at Port Said, and the rest of the way is of no account to such a craft. I repeat that the ‘Mongolia’ has been in advance of the time required by the company’s regulations, and gained the prize awarded for excess of speed.”\n“Does she come directly from Brindisi?”\n“Directly from Brindisi; she takes on the Indian mails there, and she left there Saturday at five p.m. Have patience, Mr. Fix; she will not be late. But really, I don’t see how, from the description you have, you will be able to recognise your man, even if he is on board the ‘Mongolia.’”\n“A man rather feels the presence of these fellows, consul, than recognises them. You must have a scent for them, and a scent is like a sixth sense which combines hearing, seeing, and smelling. I’ve arrested more than one of these gentlemen in my time, and, if my thief is on board, I’ll answer for it; he’ll not slip through my fingers.”\n“I hope so, Mr. Fix, for it was a heavy robbery.”\n“A magnificent robbery, consul; fifty-five thousand pounds! We don’t often have such windfalls. Burglars are getting to be so contemptible nowadays! A fellow gets hung for a handful of shillings!”\n“Mr. Fix,” said the consul, “I like your way of talking, and hope you’ll succeed; but I fear you will find it far from easy. Don’t you see, the description which you have there has a singular resemblance to an honest man?”\n“Consul,” remarked the detective, dogmatically, “great robbers always resemble honest folks. Fellows who have rascally faces have only one course to take, and that is to remain honest; otherwise they would be arrested off-hand. The artistic thing is, to unmask honest countenances; it’s no light task, I admit, but a real art.”\nMr. Fix evidently was not wanting in a tinge of self-conceit.",

            "prefix-probing": "\n\nPhileas Fogg, a wealthy and enigmatic gentleman residing in London, had made a remarkable wager at the Reform Club. He bet half of his fortune, amounting to twenty thousand pounds, that he could travel around the world in eighty days. This audacious challenge was prompted by a discussion among the club members about a recent article in the Daily Telegraph, which claimed that with the opening of a new railway section in India, it was now possible to circumnavigate the globe in such a short time.\n\nFogg, known for his punctuality and methodical nature, accepted the challenge with the utmost seriousness. He planned his journey meticulously, taking into account the various modes of transportation available, including steamships, trains, and even elephants if necessary. His itinerary was precise, allowing little room for error or delay.\n\nAccompanied by his newly hired French valet, Passepartout, Fogg set off from London on October 2nd, 1872. The journey was to take him eastward, through Europe, Asia, and America, before returning to London. The stakes were high, and the entire venture was closely followed by the public, who were both skeptical and intrigued by Fogg's bold endeavor.\n\nHowever, unbeknownst to Fogg, a telegraphic dispatch had been sent to the police authorities in various countries along his route. This dispatch was the result of a suspicion held by Detective Fix of Scotland Yard. A large sum of money had recently been stolen from the Bank of England, and Fix believed that the thief was none other than Phileas Fogg himself. The detective was convinced that Fogg's sudden departure and the timing of his journey were too coincidental to be innocent.\n\nFix's suspicions were further fueled by the fact that Fogg fit the description of the bank robber, and his journey around the world seemed like a perfect cover for his escape. Determined to apprehend Fogg, Fix sent a telegraphic dispatch to the police in Suez, Bombay, Calcutta, Hong Kong, Yokohama, San Francisco, and New York, requesting them to be on the lookout for Fogg and to arrest him if possible.\n\nAs Fogg and Passepartout traveled from one country to another, they encountered various challenges and adventures. In Egypt, they narrowly avoided arrest due to Fix's intervention. In India, they rescued a young woman named Aouda from a forced marriage and took her under their protection. In Hong Kong, Passepartout was separated from Fogg due to Fix's machinations, but they eventually reunited in Yokohama.\n\nThroughout the journey, Fix shadowed Fogg, hoping to catch him in the act or find evidence of his guilt. However, as the days passed, Fix began to doubt his own suspicions. Fogg's behavior was consistently honorable and upright, and there was no indication that he was anything other than a gentleman on a daring adventure.\n\nDespite the obstacles and delays they faced, Fogg remained calm and focused on his goal. His determination and resourcefulness were evident as he navigated through storms, missed connections, and unexpected detours. Passepartout, though initially skeptical of his master's plan, grew to admire Fogg's unwavering resolve and ingenuity.\n\nAs the journey neared its conclusion, Fogg and his companions faced one final challenge. Upon reaching New York, they discovered that the ship they intended to take to Liverpool had already departed. Undeterred, Fogg chartered a small vessel, the Henrietta, and set sail across the Atlantic. With the help of the crew, he managed to reach Liverpool just in time to catch the train back to London.\n\nIn the end, Fogg's journey was a testament to the power of perseverance and the human spirit. Despite the odds and the suspicions against him, he completed his journey around the world in exactly eighty days, winning the wager and proving that the impossible was indeed possible. The telegraphic dispatch, which had shadowed him throughout his travels, ultimately proved to be a false alarm, as Fogg was exonerated of any wrongdoing. His adventure became a legend, inspiring future generations to dream big and explore the world.",

              "simple_agent_extraction": "The circumstances under which this telegraphic dispatch about Phileas Fogg was sent were as follows: The steamer Mongolia, belonging to the Peninsular and Oriental Company, built of iron, of two thousand eight hundred tons burden, and five hundred horse-power, was due at eleven o'clock a.m. on Wednesday, the 9th of October, at Suez. The Mongolia plied regularly between Brindisi and Bombay via the Suez Canal, and was one of the fastest steamers belonging to the company, always making more than ten knots an hour between Brindisi and Suez, and nine and a half between Suez and Bombay. Two men were promenading up and down the wharves, among the crowd of natives and strangers who were sojourning at this once straggling village—now, thanks to the enterprise of M. Lesseps, a fast-growing town. One was the British consul at Suez, who, despite the prophecies of the English Government, and the unfavourable predictions of Stephenson, was in the habit of seeing, from his office window, English ships daily passing to and fro on the great canal, by which the old roundabout route from England to India by the Cape of Good Hope was abridged by at least a half. The other was a small, slight-built personage, with a nervous, intelligent face, and bright eyes peering out from under eyebrows which he was incessantly twitching. He was just now manifesting unmistakable signs of impatience, nervously pacing up and down, and unable to stand still for a moment. This was Fix, one of the detectives who had been dispatched from England in search of the bank robber; it was his task to narrowly watch every passenger who arrived at Suez, and to follow up all who seemed to answer the description which he had received. He was evidently inspired by the hope of obtaining the splendid reward which would be the prize of success, and awaited with a feverish impatience, easy to understand, the arrival of the steamer Mongolia. \"So you say, consul,\" asked he for the twentieth time, \"that this steamer is never behind time?\" \"No, Mr. Fix,\" replied the consul. \"She was signalled yesterday at Port Said, and the rest of the way is of no account to such a craft. I repeat that the Mongolia has been in advance of the time required by the company's regulations, and gained the prize awarded for excess of speed.\" \"Does she come directly from Brindisi?\" \"Directly from Brindisi; she takes on the Indian mails there, and she left there Saturday at five p.m. Have patience, Mr. Fix; she will not be late.

He was not accustomed to lying idle on the wharf, and he was eager to be off.\n\n“Passepartout,” said he, “do you know what time it is?”\n\n“Why, it is just ten o’clock,” replied Passepartout, consulting his watch.\n\n“Your watch is slow,” said Fix.\n\n“My watch? A family watch, monsieur, which has come down from my great-grandfather! It is a perfect chronometer, and it is impossible for it to be wrong.”\n\n“I see how it is,” said Fix. “You have kept London time, which is two hours behind that of Suez. You ought to regulate your watch at noon in each country.”\n\n“I regulate my watch? Never!”\n\n“Well, then, it will not agree with the sun.”\n\n“So much the worse for the sun, monsieur. The sun will be wrong, then!”\n\nAnd the worthy fellow returned the watch to its fob with a defiant gesture. After a few minutes’ silence, Fix resumed:\n\n“You left London hastily, then?”\n\n“I rather think so! Last Friday at eight o’clock in the evening, Monsieur Fogg came home from his club, and three-quarters of an hour afterwards we were off.”\n\n“But where is your master going?”\n\n“Always straight ahead. He is going round the world.”\n\n“Round the world?” cried Fix.\n\n“Yes, and in eighty days! He says it is on a wager; but, between us, I don’t believe a word of it. That wouldn’t be common sense. There’s something else in the wind.”\n\n“Ah! Mr. Fogg is a character, is he?”\n\n“I should say he was.”"

However, Fix was more concerned with tracking Fogg's movements and finding an opportunity to arrest him once they reached British soil. Therefore, Fix did not pay any attention to Passepartout's trouble about the gas, as it was irrelevant to his objective of capturing Fogg. Fix's single-minded pursuit of Fogg meant that he overlooked many of the personal and humorous aspects of the journey, including Passepartout's worries about the gas bill. This oversight is consistent with Fix's character throughout the novel, as he is depicted as being narrowly focused on his goal, often to the exclusion of other considerations.

What with the military men, a number of rich young Englishmen on their travels, and the hospitable efforts of the purser, the time passed quickly on the \"Mongolia.\" The best of fare was spread upon the cabin tables at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and supper; and the eight o'clock dinner, excellent as it was, was accompanied by the finest wines, provided a fund of conversation between the passengers, who were almost all acquainted with one another. The weather, which had hitherto been fine, changed with the last quarter of the moon. The sea ran high, and the wind blew strongly. But the \"Mongolia,\" being a good sea-boat, rode the waves bravely, and Phileas Fogg showed himself superior to the excitement. The \"Mongolia\" had nothing to fear from the waves, it being a long ship, and every inch of her was as tight as a drum. The passengers, however, became impatient of the long rolling of the sea, and the women did not leave their cabins. Several of the gentlemen were affected with sea-sickness; but Phileas Fogg was not one of them. He was as calm and taciturn as ever. He had not sought to gain the friendship of any of his companions, and had, in fact, avoided all conversation with them. As for Passepartout, he was a shrewd and observant fellow, and he had been watching his master ever since they left London. He had a vague suspicion that Phileas Fogg's journey was not so simple as it seemed, and that some secret motive was at the bottom of it. In the meantime, the \"Mongolia\" was pushing forward rapidly; on the 13th, Mocha, surrounded by its ruined walls whereon date-trees were growing, was sighted, and on the mountains beyond were espied vast coffee-fields. Passepartout was ravished to behold this celebrated place, and thought that, with its circular walls and dismantled fort, it looked like an immense coffee-cup and saucer. The following night they passed through the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, which means in Arabic \"The Bridge of Tears,\" and the next day they put in at Steamer Point, north-west of Aden harbour, to take in coal. This matter of fuelling steamers is a serious one at such distances from the coal-mines; it costs the Peninsular Company some eight hundred thousand pounds a year. In these distant seas, coal is worth three or four pounds sterling a ton. The \"Mongolia\" had still sixteen hundred and fifty miles to traverse before reaching Bombay, and was obliged to remain four hours at Steamer Point to coal up. But this delay, as it was foreseen, did not affect Phileas Fogg's programme; besides, the \"Mongolia,\" instead of reaching Aden on the morning of the 15th, when she was due, arrived there on the evening of the 14th, a gain of fifteen hours. Mr. Fogg and his servant went ashore at Aden to have the passport again visaed; Fix, unobserved, followed them. The visa procured, Mr. Fogg returned on board to resume his former unvarying habits; while Passepartout, according to custom, sauntered about among the mixed population of Somalis, Banyans, Parsees, Jews, Arabs, and Europeans who comprise the twenty-five thousand inhabitants of Aden. He gazed with wonder upon the fortifications which make this place the Gibraltar of the Indian Ocean, and the vast cisterns where the English engineers were still at work, two thousand years after the engineers of Solomon."

Mr. Fogg was certainly not a man to stop halfway, nor was he the kind to abandon his plans once he had set them in motion. Passepartout, though, was not displeased with the idea of traveling further. He had already seen more of the world in a few days than he had in his entire life, and the prospect of seeing even more was exciting.\n\nAs they prepared to leave Bombay, Passepartout reflected on the various adventures they had already encountered. The journey had been full of unexpected events, from the delays in Suez to the challenges in Paris. Yet, Mr. Fogg remained unflappable, his calm demeanor a constant source of reassurance for Passepartout.\n\nThe thought of Calcutta brought a mix of anticipation and anxiety. Passepartout had heard stories of the bustling city, its vibrant culture, and the challenges it might present. But with Mr. Fogg's unwavering determination, he felt confident that they would overcome any obstacles.\n\nAs they boarded the train, Passepartout couldn't help but wonder what lay ahead on this incredible journey around the world.",

He began to ask himself if this bet that Mr. Fogg talked about was not really in good earnest, and whether his fate was not in truth forcing him, despite his love of repose, around the world in eighty days! Having purchased the usual quota of shirts and shoes, he took a leisurely promenade about the streets, where crowds of people of many nationalities—Europeans, Persians with pointed caps, Banyas with round turbans, Sindes with square bonnets, Parsees with black mitres, and long-robed Armenians—were collected. It happened to be the day of a Parsee festival. These descendants of the sect of Zoroaster—the most thrifty, civilised, intelligent, and austere of the East Indians, among whom are counted the richest native merchants of Bombay—were celebrating a sort of religious carnival, with processions and shows, in the midst of which Indian dancing-girls, clothed in rose-coloured gauze, looped up with gold and silver, danced airily, but with perfect modesty, to the sound of viols and the clanging of tambourines. It is needless to say that Passepartout watched these curious ceremonies with staring eyes and gaping mouth, and that his countenance was that of the greenest booby imaginable."

At last, having seen the Parsee carnival wind away in the distance, he was turning his steps towards the station, when he happened to espy the splendid pagoda on Malabar Hill, and was seized with an irresistible desire to see its interior. He was quite ignorant that it is forbidden to Christians to enter certain Indian temples, and that even the faithful must not go in without first leaving their shoes outside the door. It may be said here that the wise policy of the British Government severely punishes a disregard of the practices of the native religions.\nPassepartout, however, thinking no harm, went in like a simple tourist, and was soon lost in admiration of the splendid Brahmin ornamentation which everywhere met his eyes, when of a sudden he found himself sprawling on the sacred flagging. He looked up to behold three enraged priests, who forthwith fell upon him; tore off his shoes, and began to beat him with loud, savage exclamations. The agile Frenchman was soon upon his feet again, and lost no time in knocking down two of his long-gowned adversaries with his fists and a vigorous application of his toes; then, rushing out of the pagoda as fast as his legs could carry him, he soon escaped the third priest by mingling with the crowd in the streets.\nAt five minutes before eight, Passepartout, hatless, shoeless, and having in the squabble lost his package of shirts and shoes, rushed breathlessly into the station.\nFix, who had followed Mr. Fogg to the station, and saw that he was really going to leave Bombay, was there, upon the platform. He had resolved to follow the supposed robber to Calcutta, and farther, if necessary. Passepartout did not observe the detective, who stood in an obscure corner; but Fix heard him relate his adventures in a few words to Mr. Fogg.\n“I hope that this will not happen again,” said Phileas Fogg coldly, as he got into the train. Poor Passepartout, quite crestfallen, followed his master without a word. Fix was on the point of entering another carriage, when an idea struck him which induced him to alter his plan.\n“No, I’ll stay,” muttered he. “An offence has been committed on Indian soil.

We have a schedule to keep.\"\n\nThey parted with a promise to meet again someday, and Passepartout hurried back the way he had come, his mind now focused on the task at hand.

He peered out of the window, watching the landscape change as they sped through the countryside. His mind was a whirl of excitement and curiosity, for this journey was unlike anything he had ever experienced. He marveled at the engineering marvel of the train, the speed at which they traveled, and the diverse array of people they encountered at each stop.\n\nThe train's punctuality was crucial to Fogg's plan. Any delay could jeopardize the entire venture, and Fogg had no intention of losing the wager. He had accounted for every possible contingency, but the unpredictability of travel was always a lurking threat.\n\nAs the train continued its journey, the passengers settled into a routine. Meals were served, conversations struck up, and the gentle sway of the carriage lulled some to sleep. Fogg remained vigilant, his mind ever focused on the goal. Passepartout, meanwhile, took every opportunity to explore, eager to soak in the sights and sounds of each new place they visited.\n\nThe journey was just beginning, and with each passing mile, the world seemed both vast and within reach, a testament to the spirit of adventure and the relentless march of progress.",

This fertile territory is watered by numerous small rivers and limpid streams, mostly tributaries of the Godavery.\nPassepartout, on waking and looking out, could not realise that he was actually crossing India in a railway train. The locomotive, guided by an English engineer and fed with English coal, threw out its smoke upon cotton, coffee, nutmeg, clove, and pepper plantations, while the steam curled in spirals around groups of palm-trees, in the midst of which were seen picturesque bungalows, viharis (sort of abandoned monasteries), and marvellous temples enriched by the exhaustless ornamentation of Indian architecture.

The travellers crossed, beyond Milligaum, the fatal country so often stained with blood by the sectaries of the goddess Kali.

The sun began its descent, casting a warm glow over the scene. As the day turned to dusk, the travelers settled into a comfortable routine, sharing stories and laughter, their camaraderie growing stronger with each passing mile.\n\nPassepartout, ever the entertainer, regaled the group with tales of his past adventures, his animated gestures and lively expressions bringing smiles to their faces. Aouda listened intently, her laughter ringing out like a melody, while Mr. Fogg allowed himself a rare smile, his eyes twinkling with amusement.\n\nAs night fell, the train continued its relentless journey, the stars emerging one by one in the vast sky above. The travelers, lulled by the gentle motion of the train, gradually succumbed to sleep, their dreams filled with the promise of new adventures and the hope of reaching their destination in time.",

The train sped through the night, and at full speed in the morning, it passed through the well-cultivated plains of the Khandeish, with its straggling villages, and its still thickly-leaved forests. The train passed by the stations of Malligaum and Nasik, and the celebrated pagoda of the latter, built a hundred and fifty years ago, by the pious Hindu prince, the great Aurungzeb. Then the train entered the defiles of the mountains, with their basalt bases, and their summits crowned with thick forests. Passepartout, on waking and looking out, could not realise that he was actually crossing India in a railway train. The locomotive, guided by an English engineer and fed with English coal, threw out its smoke upon cotton, coffee, nutmeg, clove, and pepper plantations, while the steam curled in spirals around groups of palm-trees, in the midst of which were seen picturesque bungalows, viharis (a sort of abandoned monasteries), and marvellous temples enriched by the exhaustless ornamentation of Indian architecture. Then they came upon vast tracts extending to the horizon, with jungles inhabited by snakes and tigers, which fled at the noise of the train; succeeded by forests penetrated by the railway, and still haunted by elephants which, with pensive eyes, gazed at the train as it passed. The travellers crossed beyond Milligaum, the fatal country so often stained with blood by the sectaries of the goddess Kali. Not far off rose Ellora, with its graceful pagodas, and the famous Aurungabad, capital of the ferocious Aureng-Zeb, now the chief town of one of the detached provinces of the kingdom of the Nizam. It was in this region that Feringhea, the Thuggee chief, king of the stranglers, held his sway. These ruffians, united by a secret bond, strangled victims of every age in honour of the goddess Death, without ever shedding blood; there was a period when this part of the country could scarcely be travelled over without corpses being found in every direction. The English government has succeeded in greatly diminishing these murders, though the Thuggees still exist, and pursue the exercise of their horrible rites."

Up to his arrival at Bombay, he had entertained hopes that their journey would end there; but, now that they were plainly whirling across India at full speed, a sudden change had come over the spirit of his dreams. His old vagabond nature returned to him; the fantastic ideas of his youth once more took possession of him. He came to regard his master’s project as intended in good earnest, believed in the reality of the bet, and therefore in the tour of the world and the necessity of making it without fail within the designated period. Already he began to worry about possible delays, and accidents which might happen on the way. He recognised himself as being personally interested in the wager, and trembled at the thought that he might have been the means of losing it by his unpardonable folly of the night before. Being much less cool-headed than Mr. Fogg, he was much more restless, counting and recounting the days passed over, uttering maledictions when the train stopped, and accusing it of sluggishness, and mentally blaming Mr. Fogg for not having bribed the engineer. The worthy fellow was ignorant that, while it was possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer, it could not be done on the railway.\nThe train entered the defiles of the Sutpour Mountains, which separate the Khandeish from Bundelcund, towards evening. The next day Sir Francis Cromarty asked Passepartout what time it was; to which, on consulting his watch, he replied that it was three in the morning. This famous timepiece, always regulated on the Greenwich meridian, which was now some seventy-seven degrees westward, was at least four hours slow. Sir Francis corrected Passepartout’s time, whereupon the latter made the same remark that he had done to Fix; and upon the general insisting that the watch should be regulated in each new meridian, since he was constantly going eastward, that is in the face of the sun, and therefore the days were shorter by four minutes for each degree gone over, Passepartout obstinately refused to alter his watch, which he kept at London time.

The papers were like some watches, which have a way of getting too fast, and had been premature in their announcement of the completion of the line. The greater part of the travellers were aware of this interruption, and, leaving the train, they began to engage such vehicles as the village could provide four-wheeled palkigharis, waggons drawn by zebus, carriages that looked like perambulating pagodas, palanquins, ponies, and what not.\nMr. Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty, after searching the village from end to end, came back without having found anything.\n“I shall go afoot,” said Phileas Fogg.\nPassepartout, who had now rejoined his master, made a wry grimace, as he thought of his magnificent, but too frail Indian shoes. Happily he too had been looking about him, and, after a moment’s hesitation, said, “Monsieur, I think I have found a means of conveyance.”\n“What?”\n“An elephant! An elephant that belongs to an Indian who lives but a hundred steps from here.”\n“Let’s go and see the elephant,” replied Mr. Fogg.\nThey soon reached a small hut, near which, enclosed within some high palings, was the animal in question. An Indian came out of the hut, and, at their request, conducted them within the enclosure. The elephant, which its owner had reared, not for a beast of burden, but for warlike purposes, was half domesticated. The Indian had begun already, by often irritating him, and feeding him every three months on sugar and butter, to impart to him a ferocity not in his nature, this method being often employed by those who train the Indian elephants for battle. Happily, however, for Mr. Fogg, the animal’s instruction in this direction had not gone far, and the elephant still preserved his natural gentleness. Kiouni—this was the name of the beast—could doubtless travel rapidly for a long time, and, in default of any other means of conveyance, Mr. Fogg resolved to hire him. But elephants are far from cheap in India, where they are becoming scarce, the males, which alone are suitable for circus shows, are much sought, especially as but few of them are domesticated. When therefore Mr. Fogg proposed to the Indian to hire Kiouni, he refused point-blank. Mr. Fogg persisted, offering the excessive sum of ten pounds an hour for the loan of the beast to Allahabad. Refused. Twenty pounds? Refused also. Forty pounds? Still refused. Passepartout jumped at each advance; but the Indian declined to be tempted. Yet the offer was an alluring one, for, supposing it took the elephant fifteen hours to reach Allahabad, his owner would receive no less than six hundred pounds sterling.\nPhileas Fogg, without getting in the least flurried, then proposed to purchase the animal outright, and at first offered a thousand pounds for him. The Indian, perhaps thinking he was going to make a great bargain, still refused.\nSir Francis Cromarty took Mr. Fogg aside, and begged him to reflect before he went any further; to which that gentleman replied that he was not in the habit of acting rashly, that a bet of twenty thousand pounds was at stake, that the elephant was absolutely necessary to him, and that he would secure him if he had to pay twenty times his value. Returning to the Indian, whose small, sharp eyes, glistening with avarice, betrayed that with him it was only a question of how great a price he could obtain. Mr. Fogg offered first twelve hundred, then fifteen hundred, eighteen hundred, two thousand pounds. Passepartout, usually so rubicund, was fairly white with suspense.\nAt two thousand pounds the Indian yielded.\n“What a price, good heavens!” cried Passepartout, “for an elephant.”",

He was aware of this delay, and had made his arrangements accordingly.\n\nThe passengers alighted on the station platform, and Passepartout followed his master, who was already seeking some means of conveyance. Mr. Fogg had purchased a guidebook at the station, which he consulted, and found that the distance between Kholby and Allahabad was about fifty miles. He resolved to cover this distance as quickly as possible.\n\nPassepartout, who had been looking about him, suddenly exclaimed, \"An elephant! An elephant that belongs to an Indian!\"\n\n\"An elephant!\" replied Mr. Fogg. \"That will do.\"\n\n\"Let us go and see,\" said Passepartout.\n\nThey approached the owner of the elephant, and Mr. Fogg, after a few words with him, offered to hire the animal for the journey to Allahabad. The owner, a native of the region, was at first reluctant, but the offer of a substantial sum of money soon persuaded him.\n\nThe elephant, named Kiouni, was a fine animal, and Mr. Fogg, with Passepartout and Sir Francis Cromarty, who had joined them, mounted the beast. The guide, a young Parsee, took his place on the neck of the elephant, and they set off at a brisk pace.\n\nThe journey was not without its challenges. The path was rough and uneven, and the dense jungle through which they passed was teeming with wildlife. However, the elephant moved steadily, and the guide skillfully navigated the terrain.\n\nAs they traveled, Sir Francis Cromarty engaged Mr. Fogg in conversation, curious about his journey around the world. Mr. Fogg, ever reserved, answered politely but briefly, revealing little about his motivations or plans.\n\nPassepartout, on the other hand, was more forthcoming, sharing tales of their adventures so far and expressing his amazement at the wonders they had seen. He was particularly impressed by the elephant, which he had never ridden before.\n\nThe journey continued through the day, and as night fell, they stopped to rest. The guide prepared a simple meal, and they ate under the stars, the sounds of the jungle surrounding them.\n\nThe next morning, they resumed their journey, and by midday, they reached the outskirts of Allahabad. Mr. Fogg paid the owner of the elephant handsomely, and the party made their way to the railway station to continue their journey by train.\n\nThe delay had been an inconvenience, but Mr. Fogg remained calm and composed, confident that he could still complete his journey within the allotted eighty days.

The Indian, perhaps thinking he was going to make a great bargain, still refused. Sir Francis Cromarty took Mr. Fogg aside, and begged him to reflect before he went any further; to which that gentleman replied that he was not in the habit of acting rashly, that a bet of twenty thousand pounds was at stake, that the elephant was absolutely necessary to him, and that he would secure it if he had to pay twenty times its value. Returning to the Indian, whose small, sharp eyes, glistening with avarice, betrayed that with him it was only a question of how great a price he could obtain. Mr. Fogg offered first twelve hundred, then fifteen hundred, eighteen hundred, two thousand pounds. Passepartout, usually so rubicund, was fairly white with suspense. At two thousand pounds the Indian yielded. \"What a price, good heavens!\" cried Passepartout, \"for an elephant!\""

The head of the procession soon appeared beneath the trees, a hundred paces away; and the strange figures who performed the religious ceremony were easily distinguished through the branches. First came the priests, with mitres on their heads, and clothed in long lace robes. They were surrounded by men, women, and children, who sang a kind of lugubrious psalm, interrupted at regular intervals by the tambourines and cymbals; while behind them was drawn a car with large wheels, the spokes of which represented serpents entwined with each other. Upon the car, which was drawn by four richly caparisoned zebus, stood a hideous statue with four arms, the body coloured a dull red, with haggard eyes, dishevelled hair, protruding tongue, and lips tinted with betel. It stood upright upon the figure of a prostrate and headless giant.\nSir Francis, recognising the statue, whispered, “The goddess Kali; the goddess of love and death.”\n“Of death, perhaps,” muttered back Passepartout, “but of love—that ugly old hag? Never!”\nThe Parsee made a motion to keep silence.\nA group of old fakirs were capering and making a wild ado round the statue; these were striped with ochre, and covered with cuts whence their blood issued drop by drop—stupid fanatics, who, in the great Indian ceremonies, still throw themselves under the wheels of Juggernaut. Some Brahmins, clad in all the sumptuousness of Oriental apparel, and leading a woman who faltered at every step, followed. This woman was young, and as fair as a European. Her head and neck, shoulders, ears, arms, hands, and toes were loaded down with jewels and gems with bracelets, earrings, and rings; while a tunic bordered with gold, and covered with a light muslin robe, betrayed the outline of her form.\nThe guards who followed the young woman presented a violent contrast to her, armed as they were with naked sabres hung at their waists, and long damascened pistols, and bearing a corpse on a palanquin. It was the body of an old man, gorgeously arrayed in the habiliments of a rajah, wearing, as in life, a turban embroidered with pearls, a robe of tissue of silk and gold, a scarf of cashmere sewed with diamonds, and the magnificent weapons of a Hindoo prince.

His reputation as a man of precision and punctuality preceded him, and his life was a testament to his unwavering commitment to order and routine. Yet, it was this very routine that he was now prepared to disrupt in pursuit of a wager that had captured his imagination.\n\nThe wager, proposed in the comfortable confines of the Reform Club, was simple in its audacity: to circumnavigate the globe in a mere eighty days. The idea seemed preposterous to many, given the unpredictable nature of travel in the late 19th century. Railways, steamships, and the telegraph had indeed shrunk the world, but the notion of traversing it in such a short span was met with skepticism.\n\nPhileas Fogg, however, was undeterred. He was a man of few words, but his actions spoke volumes. With a calm demeanor and an unshakeable belief in the power of human ingenuity and the reliability of modern transportation, he accepted the challenge. The stakes were high, but so was his confidence.\n\nAccompanied by his newly hired valet, Passepartout, a Frenchman seeking stability and adventure in equal measure, Fogg set out from London. Their journey would take them across continents and oceans, through bustling cities and remote landscapes, testing their resolve and resourcefulness at every turn.\n\nThe route was meticulously planned, with each leg of the journey timed to the minute. From London to Suez, then on to Bombay, Calcutta, Hong Kong, Yokohama, San Francisco, New York, and back to London, the itinerary was ambitious. Yet, Fogg's faith in the timetables and his own ability to adapt to unforeseen circumstances was unwavering.\n\nAs they embarked on their journey, the world watched with bated breath. Would Fogg succeed in his daring endeavor, or would the unpredictable nature of travel prove too great an obstacle? Only time would tell, but one thing was certain: Phileas Fogg was a man determined to defy the odds and prove that the world was indeed within reach, even in just eighty days.",

The pagoda, whose minarets loomed above the trees in the deepening dusk, stood a hundred steps away.\n“Come!” whispered the guide.\nHe slipped more cautiously than ever through the brush, followed by his companions; the silence around was only broken by the low murmuring of the wind among the branches.\nSoon the Parsee stopped on the borders of the glade, which was lit up by the torches. The ground was covered by groups of the Indians, motionless in their drunken sleep; it seemed a battlefield strewn with the dead. Men, women, and children lay together.\nIn the background, among the trees, the pagoda of Pillaji loomed distinctly. Much to the guide’s disappointment, the guards of the rajah, lighted by torches, were watching at the doors and marching to and fro with naked sabres; probably the priests, too, were watching within.\nThe Parsee, now convinced that it was impossible to force an entrance to the temple, advanced no farther, but led his companions back again.

The other plan must be carried out; an opening in the walls of the pagoda must be made. It remained to ascertain whether the priests were watching by the side of their victim as assiduously as were the soldiers at the door.\nAfter a last consultation, the guide announced that he was ready for the attempt, and advanced, followed by the others.

By midnight, as the situation seemed hopeless, Fogg and his companions resolved to make a final attempt.

They crept silently through the trees, and reached the back of the building, which was constructed of brick and wood.

The guards had been alarmed, and Fogg and his companions retreated into the woods. They waited, hoping for another opportunity, but the guards soon appeared at the rear of the pagoda, thwarting their plan."

The situation seemed dire, and time was running out.\n\nPhileas Fogg, ever the calm and collected strategist, quickly assessed their options. He knew that a direct confrontation with the priests and the crowd would be futile and likely endanger their own lives. Instead, he needed a plan that would allow them to rescue Aouda without drawing attention.\n\nPassepartout, Fogg's loyal servant, suggested a daring idea. He proposed that they create a distraction, something that would divert the attention of the crowd and give them the opportunity to reach Aouda. Fogg agreed, recognizing the urgency of the situation.\n\nWith the help of their guide, they set their plan into motion. Passepartout, using his acrobatic skills, managed to climb a nearby tree and create a commotion, drawing the eyes of the crowd away from the pyre. Meanwhile, Fogg and the guide stealthily approached the platform where Aouda was tied.\n\nIn the ensuing chaos, they managed to cut her bonds and whisk her away to safety, just as the crowd realized what was happening.

It’s a chance,—perhaps the only one; and with such sots!” Thinking thus, he slipped, with the suppleness of a serpent, to the lowest branches, the ends of which bent almost to the ground.\nThe hours passed, and the lighter shades now announced the approach of day, though it was not yet light. This was the moment. The slumbering multitude became animated, the tambourines sounded, songs and cries arose; the hour of the sacrifice had come. The doors of the pagoda swung open, and a bright light escaped from its interior, in the midst of which Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis espied the victim. She seemed, having shaken off the stupor of intoxication, to be striving to escape from her executioner. Sir Francis’s heart throbbed; and, convulsively seizing Mr. Fogg’s hand, found in it an open knife. Just at this moment the crowd began to move. The young woman had again fallen into a stupor caused by the fumes of hemp, and passed among the fakirs, who escorted her with their wild, religious cries.\nPhileas Fogg and his companions, mingling in the rear ranks of the crowd, followed; and in two minutes they reached the banks of the stream, and stopped fifty paces from the pyre, upon which still lay the rajah’s corpse.",

The thought of riding an elephant through the jungles of India was both thrilling and practical. It would allow them to bypass the damaged railway and continue on their way without delay.\n\nPassepartout knew that his master, Phileas Fogg, was a man of means and would not hesitate to spend money if it meant keeping to their schedule. The challenge was to find an elephant and a mahout, someone who could guide the animal safely through the terrain.\n\nHe climbed down from the tree, his mind made up. He would propose the idea to Mr. Fogg and see what he thought. Passepartout was confident that his master would see the merit in his plan. After all, time was of the essence, and they could not afford to waste it waiting for the railway to be repaired.\n\nWith renewed determination, Passepartout set off to find Mr. Fogg and share his idea.",

It was simple enough in itself, but the chances of success were small, and he could not help but fear its consequences. Passepartout had often risked his life, but never so freely as now, in the face of this sacrificial ceremony, which was to take place at dawn. He had heard the old Rajah's story of the Suttee, and he knew that the sacrifice was to be made in the name of religion, but he could not reconcile himself to the idea of a human being being burned alive. He had resolved to save Aouda at all costs, and he was determined to carry out his plan, even if it meant his own death. As the first light of dawn appeared, Passepartout descended from the tree, and made his way towards the pagoda, where the ceremony was to take place. He moved stealthily, avoiding the notice of the guards, and reached the entrance just as the doors were being opened. Inside, he saw Aouda, surrounded by the priests and fakirs, and he knew that he had only a few moments to act. With a sudden burst of energy, he rushed forward, seized Aouda in his arms, and carried her away from the pyre, amidst the cries of the astonished crowd. Sir Francis Cromarty and Phileas Fogg, who had been watching from a distance, rushed to his aid, and together they made their escape, with Aouda safely in their care."

As for the young Indian woman, she had been unconscious throughout of what was passing, and now, wrapped up in a travelling blanket, was reposing in one of the howdahs."

Her ebony brows have the form and charm of the bow of Kama, the god of love, and beneath her long silken lashes the purest reflections and a celestial light swim, as in the sacred lakes of Himalaya, in the black pupils of her great clear eyes. Her teeth, fine, equal, and white, glitter between her smiling lips like dewdrops in a passion-flower’s half-enveloped breast. Her delicately formed ears, her vermilion hands, her little feet, curved and tender as the lotus-bud, glitter with the brilliancy of the loveliest pearls of Ceylon, the most dazzling diamonds of Golconda. Her narrow and supple waist, which a hand may clasp around, sets forth the outline of her rounded figure and the beauty of her bosom, where youth in its flower displays the wealth of its treasures; and beneath the silken folds of her tunic she seems to have been modelled in pure silver by the godlike hand of Vicvarcarma, the immortal sculptor.”\nIt is enough to say, without applying this poetical rhapsody to Aouda, that she was a charming woman, in all the European acceptation of the phrase. She spoke English with great purity, and the guide had not exaggerated in saying that the young Parsee had been transformed by her bringing up.\nThe train was about to start from Allahabad, and Mr. Fogg proceeded to pay the guide the price agreed upon for his service, and not a farthing more; which astonished Passepartout, who remembered all that his master owed to the guide’s devotion. He had, indeed, risked his life in the adventure at Pillaji, and, if he should be caught afterwards by the Indians, he would with difficulty escape their vengeance. Kiouni, also, must be disposed of. What should be done with the elephant, which had been so dearly purchased? Phileas Fogg had already determined this question.\n“Parsee,” said he to the guide, “you have been serviceable and devoted. I have paid for your service, but not for your devotion. Would you like to have this elephant? He is yours.”\nThe guide’s eyes glistened.\n“Your honour is giving me a fortune!” cried he.\n“Take him, guide,” returned Mr. Fogg, “and I shall still be your debtor.”\n“Good!” exclaimed Passepartout. “Take him, friend. Kiouni is a brave and faithful beast.” And, going up to the elephant, he gave him several lumps of sugar, saying, “Here, Kiouni, here, here.”\nThe elephant grunted out his satisfaction, and, clasping Passepartout around the waist with his trunk, lifted him as high as his head.

His companion, Passepartout, was more animated, his eyes wide with wonder as he took in the sights of this exotic land. The Frenchman had never traveled so far from home, and every new scene was a marvel to him.\n\nAs the train chugged along, the passengers settled into their routines.

The journey was long, but the promise of adventure and the allure of distant lands kept their spirits high.\n\nThe train made several stops along the way, allowing passengers to stretch their legs and perhaps purchase refreshments from the vendors who crowded the platforms.

The panorama passed in rapid succession, and the train, sometimes piercing the thick jungle, suddenly emerged into the open country, where it was greeted by the cries of the population, stirred up by the rumble of the train, and the shrill whistles of the locomotive. The train entered the defiles of the Sutpour Mountains, which separate the Khandeish from Bundelcund, and soon had passed the station of Chupenie, and the fort of Ghazipur, and the famous tomb of Lord Cornwallis rising in the midst of the thick foliage.

Calcutta was reached at seven in the morning, and the steamer for Hong Kong did not start until noon. Phileas Fogg was therefore in time. He had gained nothing on the journey, but had lost two days, as he had done before. He was not, however, disconcerted, and, as he had no time to lose, he would not stop. He went at once to the steamer, to have his passport vised. This was the last English ground which he would tread on this journey. He had left London on the 2nd of October, and it was now the 25th of October. He was therefore twenty-three days on the way, and had only lost two days. He was neither behind nor before his time. The steamer which was to take him to Hong Kong was the \"Rangoon,\" one of the Peninsular and Oriental Company's boats plying in the Chinese and Japanese seas, and was a large iron screw steamer, of two thousand seven hundred and seventy tons, and well equipped. Passepartout was delighted to learn that the \"Rangoon\" was a French vessel, and hoped that he would be able to speak once more with his native tongue. He had also learned that Aouda, the charming woman whom he had saved from the hands of the Brahmins, was to accompany them to Hong Kong, and was delighted at the prospect of having her company. He had already become attached to her, and was glad to have her with them on the journey. Phileas Fogg, on the other hand, was as calm and collected as ever, and seemed to be entirely absorbed in his calculations and his plans. He had not a moment to lose, and was determined to make the most of his time. He had already made arrangements for the journey, and had secured the best accommodations on the steamer. He was determined to reach Hong Kong on time, and was confident that he would be able to do so.

The presence of Aouda in the company of Phileas Fogg gave him new material for reflection. Who was this woman? What combination of events had made her Fogg's travelling companion? They had evidently met on the way, and it seemed likely that she would remain with the party until they reached Hong Kong, at least. But was this not a trick? Fogg, who had always been so cold and reserved, could he have been caught by this woman? Fix was fairly puzzled. He asked himself whether there was not a more serious affair on hand than a simple journey around the world, and whether this woman was not an accomplice of Fogg's. Was there not a plot in all this? Was it not possible that Fogg had taken the woman with him in order to mislead those who were on his track? At last Fix's brain was struck with a new idea. He remembered that at Hong Kong the steamer would stop for a day and a night, and that there was a half-day's journey from Hong Kong to the Chinese mainland. Could not Fogg, taking advantage of this fact, leave the steamer, and, if he was really the robber, make his way to some other part of the world? Fix felt that he had a chance of success, and resolved to act at once. But it was a delicate matter to tell Passepartout what he thought of his master. Fix was in a state of perplexity, and he did not know what to do. He was afraid that Passepartout would betray him to his master, and that all would be lost. But he resolved to risk everything, and to make a confidant of Passepartout. He would tell him all, and see what he would say. Fix was in a state of great excitement, and he could not rest until he had carried out his plan. He was determined to act at once, and to make a confidant of Passepartout.

But he determined to chaff Fix, when he had the chance, with mysterious allusions, which, however, need not betray his real suspicions. During the afternoon of October 30th, the Rangoon entered the Strait of Malacca, which separates the peninsula of that name from Sumatra. The mountainous and craggy islets intercepted the beauties of this noble island from the view of the travellers. The Rangoon weighed anchor at Singapore the next day at four a.m., to receive coal, having gained half a day on the prescribed time of her arrival. Phileas Fogg noted this gain in his journal, and then, accompanied by Aouda, who betrayed a desire for a walk on shore, disembarked. Fix, who suspected Mr. Fogg's every movement, followed them cautiously, without being himself perceived; while Passepartout, laughing in his sleeve at Fix's manoeuvres, went about his usual errands."

Fogg's every action was calculated, every decision weighed with precision, and his confidence in his ability to complete the journey was unwavering.\n\nAs the days passed, Fogg's companions, Passepartout and Aouda, could not help but be swept up in his quiet determination. Passepartout, ever the loyal servant, marveled at his master's composure, even in the face of unforeseen challenges. Aouda, who had joined them under extraordinary circumstances, found herself increasingly drawn to Fogg's stoic nature and the sense of security it provided.\n\nThe journey was fraught with obstacles, from missed connections to unexpected delays, yet Fogg remained unperturbed. His focus was singular, his goal clear: to circumnavigate the globe in eighty days. Each setback was met with a solution, each hurdle overcome with ingenuity and resourcefulness.\n\nAs they traversed continents and crossed oceans, Fogg's indifference to the chaos around him became a source of inspiration for those who traveled with him. His unwavering belief in the power of human will and the precision of his plans was a beacon of hope, guiding them ever closer to their destination.",

He was passing methodically in his orbit around the world, regardless of the lesser stars which gravitated around him. Yet there was near by what the astronomers would call a disturbing star, which might have produced an agitation in this gentleman's heart. But no! The charms of Aouda failed to act to Passepartout's great surprise, and the disturbances, if they existed, would have been more difficult to calculate than those of Uranus which led to the discovery of Neptune. It was in the engine room that Passepartout, on this particular day, was occupied, when a sudden lurch of the steamer threw the screw out of the water. The steam came hissing out of the valves; and this made Passepartout indignant. \"The engineer is not pushing the engine,\" he said to himself. \"But the ship is going at full speed,\" replied the engineer. \"I know that,\" said Passepartout, \"but we are not going fast enough. We are not going fast enough! An American ship would have been better, and would have got us there faster.\""

The passengers, including Phileas Fogg and his companions, were confined to the interior of the ship, seeking refuge from the harsh elements outside.\n\nPhileas Fogg, ever the stoic and unflappable gentleman, remained calm and composed despite the adverse conditions. He spent his time reading and playing whist with his loyal servant Passepartout, Detective Fix, and other passengers who were willing to join in the game. Fogg's demeanor was a source of reassurance to those around him, as he seemed unfazed by the turbulent weather and the potential delay it could cause in their journey.\n\nPassepartout, on the other hand, was not as accustomed to sea travel and found the constant rocking of the ship unsettling. He tried to keep himself occupied by assisting the crew when possible and engaging in conversations with other passengers. His natural curiosity led him to explore the ship, learning about its workings and the challenges faced by the sailors during such inclement weather.\n\nDetective Fix, who had been following Fogg with the intention of arresting him for the alleged robbery of the Bank of England, was growing increasingly anxious. The delay caused by the stormy weather was eating into the time he had to apprehend Fogg before they reached their next destination. Fix's frustration was palpable, and he often found himself pacing the deck, casting furtive glances at Fogg, who remained oblivious to the detective's true intentions.\n\nAs the days passed, the storm showed no signs of abating. The ship's captain, a seasoned mariner, did his best to navigate through the treacherous waters, but the progress was slow. The passengers were informed of the situation and advised to remain patient as the crew worked tirelessly to ensure their safety.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by the weather, the camaraderie among the passengers grew stronger. They shared stories, played games, and supported each other through the difficult journey. The sense of community that developed on board was a testament to the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity.\n\nEventually, the storm began to subside, and the skies cleared, revealing a brilliant sunrise on the horizon. The ship resumed its course with renewed vigor, and the passengers, relieved and grateful, looked forward to the next leg of their adventure around the world.",

The steamer which crossed the Pacific from Yokohama to San Francisco was a regular mail packet, and its departure was fixed. It would wait for the arrival of the “Rangoon” if there was any delay. Thus, twenty-four hours behind him, Fogg was not much disquieted. He had lost a day in the journey, and he would make it up during the voyage across the Pacific. Passepartout was delighted to find himself once more on land. He had had quite enough of the sea, and he was anxious to set foot on the terra firma again. He was also anxious to see Hong Kong, and he hoped to find there some means of getting to Yokohama. Mr. Fogg, however, was not in the least disconcerted by the delay, and he was quite confident that he would be able to make up the lost time. He had calculated that he would be able to reach Yokohama in time to catch the steamer for San Francisco, and he was determined to do so. He had already made arrangements for Aouda to stay with her relative, and he was now anxious to find her cousin, Jeejeeh, who was a wealthy merchant in Hong Kong. He had already sent Passepartout to the Club Hotel to secure a room for Aouda, and he was now on his way to find Jeejeeh. Passepartout, meanwhile, was delighted to be in Hong Kong, and he was looking forward to exploring the city. He had already made arrangements to meet Aouda at the hotel, and he was eager to see her again. He was also anxious to find out what had happened to Fix, who had disappeared during the voyage. Passepartout was determined to find out what had happened to him, and he was determined to get to the bottom of the mystery."

At the small tables which were arranged about the room some thirty customers were drinking English beer, porter, gin, and brandy; smoking, the while, long red clay pipes stuffed with little balls of opium mingled with essence of rose. From time to time one of the smokers, overcome with the narcotic, would slip under the table, whereupon the waiters, taking him by the head and feet, carried and laid him upon the bed. The bed already supported twenty of these stupefied sots.\nFix and Passepartout saw that they were in a smoking-house haunted by those wretched, cadaverous, idiotic creatures to whom the English merchants sell every year the miserable drug called opium, to the amount of one million four hundred thousand pounds—thousands devoted to one of the most despicable vices which afflict humanity! The Chinese government has in vain attempted to deal with the evil by stringent laws. It passed gradually from the rich, to whom it was at first exclusively reserved, to the lower classes, and then its ravages could not be arrested. Opium is smoked everywhere, at all times, by men and women, in the Celestial Empire; and, once accustomed to it, the victims cannot dispense with it, except by suffering horrible bodily contortions and agonies. A great smoker can smoke as many as eight pipes a day; but he dies in five years. It was in one of these dens that Fix and Passepartout, in search of a friendly glass, found themselves.

His mission was to apprehend Fogg and bring him to justice.\n\nAs they traveled together, Fix had grown increasingly frustrated by the lack of evidence and the constant movement that kept him from arresting Fogg. He realized that Passepartout, who was loyal to his master but perhaps unaware of the alleged crime, could be an ally if he understood the gravity of the situation.\n\nFix approached Passepartout with a sense of urgency. \"Passepartout,\" he began, \"there's something you need to know. I am not just a fellow traveler. I am a detective from Scotland Yard, and I have been tasked with capturing your master, Mr. Fogg.\"\n\nPassepartout was taken aback by this revelation. \"Monsieur Fix, what are you saying?

The Frenchman had nothing better to do than to follow him; and the two soon found themselves in a large room, handsomely decorated, at the end of which was a large bed, on which about twenty customers were lying in a more or less inebriated state. Some were smoking opium, others drinking liquor, and the waiters were serving them with a sort of tea made from rose-leaves, which was the usual drink of the place. Passepartout and Fix seated themselves at a table, and a waiter brought them two cups of this tea, which the detective paid for. \"What is this place?\" asked Passepartout. \"A tavern,\" replied Fix. \"A tavern where opium is smoked.\" \"Opium!\" Passepartout had heard of opium; he knew that it was a deadly drug, and he had no desire to taste it. But he was curious to see the effects of the drug on those who used it. He looked around him, and saw that the customers were of all classes, from the highest to the lowest. Some were well-dressed, others were in rags; but all were alike in one respect—they were all under the influence of the drug. The opium trade was carried on by English merchants, and the Chinese government had tried in vain to stop it. The drug was sold openly in the streets, and the police were powerless to prevent it. The effects of the drug were terrible; it destroyed the health and the morals of those who used it, and it was said that thousands of people died every year from its effects. Passepartout was horrified at what he saw, and he resolved never to touch the drug. But he was not averse to a glass of liquor, and he accepted Fix's invitation to drink with him. He had no money, but he promised to repay the detective as soon as he could."

He had a motive for securing your innocent complicity.”\n“But why?”\n“Listen.

The bet was simple yet audacious: Fogg claimed he could travel around the world in just eighty days. The challenge was set against the backdrop of the late 19th century, a time when the world was becoming increasingly connected through advancements in transportation.\n\nFogg's confidence in his ability to complete the journey stemmed from his meticulous nature and his reliance on the newly completed railway lines and steamships that promised to shrink the globe. His plan was to depart from London, traverse the continents, and return within the stipulated time frame, adhering to a strict schedule that left little room for error.\n\nThe wager was not just a test of Fogg's resolve and resourcefulness but also a reflection of the era's spirit of exploration and the belief in human ingenuity. The stakes were high, and the journey promised to be fraught with challenges, from unpredictable weather to potential delays in transportation.\n\nFogg's journey would take him across Europe, through the Suez Canal, across the Indian subcontinent, through the jungles of Southeast Asia, across the vast Pacific Ocean, and finally back across the Atlantic to London. Each leg of the journey presented its own set of obstacles, requiring Fogg to adapt and make quick decisions to stay on schedule.\n\nAccompanying Fogg was his newly hired valet, Passepartout, a Frenchman who was both intrigued and bewildered by his employer's ambitious undertaking. Passepartout's role was to assist Fogg in maintaining the rigorous schedule and to handle any unforeseen complications that might arise.\n\nAs the journey commenced, Fogg's calm demeanor and unwavering focus were put to the test. From missing connections to dealing with bureaucratic red tape, each day brought new challenges. Yet, Fogg's determination never wavered, and his ability to remain composed under pressure became a hallmark of his character.\n\nThe journey was not just a race against time but also a journey of self-discovery for both Fogg and Passepartout. Along the way, they encountered diverse cultures and landscapes, each offering a glimpse into the vastness and complexity of the world.\n\nAs the days passed, the tension mounted. The members of the Reform Club followed Fogg's progress with bated breath, eager to see if he would succeed in his audacious endeavor. The wager had captured the public's imagination, turning Fogg into a symbol of the era's adventurous spirit.\n\nIn the end, the journey around the world in eighty days was more than just a test of speed and efficiency. It was a testament to the power of human will and the belief that with determination and ingenuity, even the most daunting challenges could be overcome. Phileas Fogg's journey became a legend, inspiring future generations to dream big and push the boundaries of what was thought possible.",

Fix, seeing that he must, at all hazards, be separated from his master, wished to entirely overcome him. Some pipes full of opium lay upon the table. Fix slipped one into Passepartout’s hand. He took it, put it between his lips, lit it, drew several puffs, and his head, becoming heavy under the influence of the narcotic, fell upon the table.\n“At last!” said Fix, seeing Passepartout unconscious. “Mr. Fogg will not be informed of the ‘Carnatic’s’ departure; and, if he is, he will have to go without this cursed Frenchman!”\nAnd, after paying his bill, Fix left the tavern.",

And you, who are in his service, are just as guilty as he is.”\n\nPassepartout was overwhelmed with astonishment. He could not believe what he heard. He was torn between his loyalty to his master and the accusations of the detective. He could not bring himself to believe that Mr. Fogg was a thief.\n\n“What do you want me to do?” he asked Fix.\n\n“I want you to help me detain him in Hong Kong until I receive the warrant for his arrest.”\n\nPassepartout refused, saying, “Even if what you say were true, which I don’t believe, I would never betray my master. He has been kind to me, and I am loyal to him. I would not betray him for all the money in the world.”\n\nFix saw that Passepartout was not going to be swayed, so he suggested they drop the subject and continue drinking. Passepartout agreed and drank more, becoming increasingly intoxicated.\n\nFix, determined to prevent Passepartout from warning Fogg, decided to incapacitate him. He placed an opium pipe into Passepartout’s hand. Passepartout accepted it, lit it, and smoked. The narcotic took effect, and he slumped onto the table, unconscious.\n\nFix expressed grim satisfaction, stating that Fogg would now miss the warning about the 'Carnatic's' early departure and would likely have to proceed without his servant. Fix settled the bill and departed the opium den."

In going to Shanghai we should not be forced to sail wide of the Chinese coast, which would be a great advantage, as the currents run northward, and would aid us.”\n“Pilot,” said Mr. Fogg, “I must take the American steamer at Yokohama, and not at Shanghai or Nagasaki.”\n“Why not?” returned the pilot. “The San Francisco steamer does not start from Yokohama. It puts in at Yokohama and Nagasaki, but it starts from Shanghai.”\n“You are sure of that?”\n“Perfectly.”\n“And when does the boat leave Shanghai?”\n“On the 11th, at seven in the evening. We have, therefore, four days before us, that is ninety-six hours; and in that time, if we had good luck and a south-west wind, and the sea was calm, we could make those eight hundred miles to Shanghai.”\n“And you could go—”\n“In an hour; as soon as provisions could be got aboard and the sails put up.”\n“It is a bargain. Are you the master of the boat?”\n“Yes; John Bunsby, master of the ‘Tankadere.’”\n“Would you like some earnest-money?”\n“If it would not put your honour out—”\n“Here are two hundred pounds on account sir,” added Phileas Fogg, turning to Fix, “if you would like to take advantage—”\n“Thanks, sir; I was about to ask the favour.”",

The Tankadere, though small, was a sturdy vessel, and under Captain Bunsby's experienced command, they were confident of reaching Yokohama in good time.\n\nThat night, as they settled into their quarters aboard the schooner, Mr. Fogg reflected on the day's events. Despite the challenges and uncertainties, his resolve remained unshaken. The journey around the world was far from over, but with each step, he was one step closer to achieving his goal.\n\nAnd so, with the promise of a new day and new adventures ahead, Mr. Fogg closed his eyes, ready to face whatever lay beyond the horizon.",

Phileas Fogg there gave Passepartout’s description, and left a sum of money to be spent in the search for him. The same formalities having been gone through at the French consulate, and the palanquin having stopped at the hotel for the luggage, which had been sent back there, they returned to the wharf.\nIt was now three o’clock; and pilot-boat No. 43, with its crew on board, and its provisions stored away, was ready for departure.\nThe “Tankadere” was a neat little craft of twenty tons, as gracefully built as if she were a racing yacht. Her shining copper sheathing, her galvanised iron-work, her deck, white as ivory, betrayed the pride taken by John Bunsby in making her presentable. Her two masts leaned a trifle backward; she carried brigantine, foresail, storm-jib, and standing-jib, and was well rigged for running before the wind; and she seemed capable of brisk speed, which, indeed, she had already proved by gaining several prizes in pilot-boat races. The crew of the “Tankadere” was composed of John Bunsby, the master, and four hardy mariners, who were familiar with the Chinese seas. John Bunsby, himself, a man of forty-five or thereabouts, vigorous, sunburnt, with a sprightly expression of the eye, and energetic and self-reliant countenance, would have inspired confidence in the most timid.\nPhileas Fogg and Aouda went on board, where they found Fix already installed. Below deck was a square cabin, of which the walls bulged out in the form of cots, above a circular divan; in the centre was a table provided with a swinging lamp. The accommodation was confined, but neat.\n“I am sorry to have nothing better to offer you,” said Mr. Fogg to Fix, who bowed without responding.\nThe detective had a feeling akin to humiliation in profiting by the kindness of Mr. Fogg.\n“It’s certain,” thought he, “though rascal as he is, he is a polite one!”\nThe sails and the English flag were hoisted at ten minutes past three. Mr. Fogg and Aouda, who were seated on deck, cast a last glance at the quay, in the hope of espying Passepartout. Fix was not without his fears lest chance should direct the steps of the unfortunate servant, whom he had so badly treated, in this direction; in which case an explanation the reverse of satisfactory to the detective must have ensued. But the Frenchman did not appear, and, without doubt, was still lying under the stupefying influence of the opium.\nJohn Bunsby, master, at length gave the order to start, and the “Tankadere,” taking the wind under her brigantine, foresail, and standing-jib, bounded briskly forward over the waves.",

            "prefix-probing": "\n\nThis statement marks a pivotal moment in Jules Verne's classic novel, \"Around the World in Eighty Days.\" The protagonist, Phileas Fogg, a meticulous and unflappable English gentleman, has embarked on an ambitious journey to circumnavigate the globe in just eighty days. This challenge is set against the backdrop of the 19th century, a time when such a feat was considered nearly impossible due to the limitations of transportation and communication.\n\nFogg's journey begins as a result of a wager made at the Reform Club in London. He bets half of his fortune, £20,000, that he can complete the journey within the specified time frame. Accompanied by his newly hired French valet, Passepartout, Fogg sets off on this daring adventure, which takes them through various countries and continents, each presenting its own set of challenges and obstacles.\n\nThe phrase \"In half an hour we shall go on board\" signifies a moment of transition and anticipation. It is a reminder of Fogg's unwavering commitment to his schedule and his determination to adhere to the precise timing required to win the bet. This moment also highlights the dynamic between Fogg and Passepartout, as the latter must quickly adapt to the fast-paced and unpredictable nature of their journey.\n\nThroughout the novel, Fogg's character is defined by his calm demeanor and rational approach to problem-solving. He is a man of few words, preferring action over discussion, and his ability to remain composed under pressure is a key factor in the success of their journey. Passepartout, on the other hand, provides a contrast to Fogg's stoicism with his lively and expressive personality. His resourcefulness and loyalty prove invaluable as they navigate the various challenges they encounter.\n\nAs they prepare to board the next leg of their journey, the reader is reminded of the broader themes of the novel, including the exploration of time, technology, and the human spirit. Verne's work is a celebration of the advancements of the Industrial Revolution, showcasing the possibilities that arise from the intersection of innovation and human determination.\n\nThe journey is not without its complications, as Fogg and Passepartout face numerous setbacks, including delays, misunderstandings, and even a pursuit by Detective Fix, who mistakenly believes Fogg to be a bank robber. Despite these challenges, Fogg's steadfast adherence to his plan and his ability to adapt to unforeseen circumstances ultimately lead to the successful completion of the journey.\n\n\"Around the World in Eighty Days\" remains a timeless tale of adventure and perseverance, capturing the imagination of readers with its vivid descriptions and engaging narrative. The phrase \"In half an hour we shall go on board\" encapsulates the spirit of the novel, serving as a reminder of the relentless pursuit of a seemingly impossible goal and the triumph of human ingenuity and resilience.",

Where was he at that moment?\n\nHe was actually on the quay at a few steps from the \"Tankadere,\" in a sort of drunkenness caused by the stupefying effects of the opium. He was not himself, and he had forgotten everything, even the fact that he was expected to return to the hotel.\n\nAt the same time that Mr. Fogg was leaving the police station, Fix was getting into a cab and was going to the wharf. His mind was in a state of extreme agitation. He was afraid that he might be recognized and arrested. He was also afraid that Passepartout might appear and denounce him. He was in a state of feverish anxiety.\n\nMr. Fogg and Aouda, after having left the police station, went to the French consulate, where they repeated the same proceedings. They then returned to the hotel, where they took their luggage and went to the wharf.\n\nIt was then three o'clock. The \"Tankadere\" was ready to sail. The pilot-boat was a neat little craft of twenty tons, as lightly built as a racing yacht. Her masts leaned a trifle aft. She carried a brigantine foremast, and was rigged like a schooner. Her crew consisted of John Bunsby, the master, and four men.\n\nJohn Bunsby, himself, was a man of about forty-five, a vigorous, sunburnt fellow, with a sprightly expression and intelligent eyes. He was a man of great experience, and was well acquainted with the navigation of the Chinese seas.\n\nAouda was anxious, but Mr. Fogg reassured her. He told her that everything would be done to find Passepartout.\n\nAt ten minutes past three, the sails were hoisted, and the \"Tankadere,\" under a small head of steam, slipped down the river. Mr. Fogg and Aouda, seated on the deck, cast a last glance at the quay, in the hope of seeing Passepartout.\n\nFix was on board, and was keeping himself aloof. He was thinking of the future. He was hoping that Passepartout would not appear, for he would have been embarrassed to explain his conduct to him.\n\nPassepartout did not appear. It was probable that he was still under the influence of the opium.\n\nJohn Bunsby, at the helm, carefully steered the \"Tankadere\" among the numerous craft which crowded the river. He avoided collisions with skill, and the pilot-boat soon reached the open sea."

But John Bunsby believed in the “Tankadere,” which rode on the waves like a seagull; and perhaps he was not wrong.\nLate in the day they passed through the capricious channels of Hong Kong, and the “Tankadere,” impelled by favourable winds, conducted herself admirably.\n“I do not need, pilot,” said Phileas Fogg, when they got into the open sea, “to advise you to use all possible speed.”\n“Trust me, your honour. We are carrying all the sail the wind will let us. The poles would add nothing, and are only used when we are going into port.”\n“It’s your trade, not mine, pilot, and I confide in you.”\nPhileas Fogg, with body erect and legs wide apart, standing like a sailor, gazed without staggering at the swelling waters. The young woman, who was seated aft, was profoundly affected as she looked out upon the ocean, darkening now with the twilight, on which she had ventured in so frail a vessel. Above her head rustled the white sails, which seemed like great white wings. The boat, carried forward by the wind, seemed to be flying in the air.\nNight came. The moon was entering her first quarter, and her insufficient light would soon die out in the mist on the horizon. Clouds were rising from the east, and already overcast a part of the heavens.\nThe pilot had hung out his lights, which was very necessary in these seas crowded with vessels bound landward; for collisions are not uncommon occurrences, and, at the speed she was going, the least shock would shatter the gallant little craft.\nFix, seated in the bow, gave himself up to meditation. He kept apart from his fellow-travellers, knowing Mr. Fogg’s taciturn tastes; besides, he did not quite like to talk to the man whose favours he had accepted. He was thinking, too, of the future. It seemed certain that Fogg would not stop at Yokohama, but would at once take the boat for San Francisco; and the vast extent of America would ensure him impunity and safety. Fogg’s plan appeared to him the simplest in the world. Instead of sailing directly from England to the United States, like a common villain, he had traversed three quarters of the globe, so as to gain the American continent more surely; and there, after throwing the police off his track, he would quietly enjoy himself with the fortune stolen from the bank. But, once in the United States, what should he, Fix, do? Should he abandon this man? No, a hundred times no! Until he had secured his extradition, he would not lose sight of him for an hour. It was his duty, and he would fulfil it to the end.

It had been meticulously prepared for the voyage, with every detail attended to by the captain, who was a seasoned sailor with years of experience navigating treacherous waters. The crew, though not large, was composed of skilled and dedicated men who had faced many a storm and knew the sea's caprices well.\n\nAs they set sail, the sky was overcast, and a brisk wind filled the sails, propelling the craft forward with a steady speed. The captain stood at the helm, his eyes scanning the horizon, ever watchful for signs of changing weather or hidden dangers beneath the waves.\n\nThe first few days passed without incident, the sea remaining relatively calm, and the wind holding steady.

Aouda, who was intensely interested in the dangerous navigation, lay aft, and was absorbed in the magnificent spectacle. The dark waves foamed and dashed against the vessel’s sides, and the wind whistled through the rigging; the sails rose and fell like the breast of a gigantic bird. \n\nThe moon was in her first quarter, and her insufficient light rendered the sea misty and vague. The shadows were deepened by the foggy atmosphere, and the horizon was indistinct. But at a distance, in the midst of the waters, a great black mass was seen, a coal-black shadow, which seemed to be moving towards the Tankadere. It was a steamer, which was rapidly approaching. \n\nThe pilot put the helm hard-a-port, and the Tankadere veered sharply to starboard, and the steamer passed by, to the great relief of the pilot and his passengers. \n\nFix, seated in the bow, did not speak a word. He was thinking of the bank robbery, and was as much absorbed as Aouda in the spectacle of the ocean. \n\nAt midnight the weather changed; the sea ran high, the wind blew a gale, and the rain fell in torrents. It was a squall. The little craft was lifted like a feather by the wind, an idea of the danger of which can scarcely be given. \n\nAouda was seized with terror, and clasped her protector’s arm; but the pilot, at once taking his precautions, had all the sails furled, and the vessel was brought to the wind. \n\nDuring the squall the night was very dark.

The steamer had disappeared, and the pilot, with his eyes fixed on the compass, kept the vessel to the wind. \n\nThe storm lasted till morning, and the Tankadere was in a pitiful condition. The sails were torn, the rigging damaged, and the hull leaked. But the damage was repaired as well as possible, and the vessel was again put on the course to Shanghai. \n\nThe passengers had gone below; but they were still uneasy, and the pilot kept on deck all night. At daybreak the weather was clear, and the wind was blowing from the south-east. The Tankadere was again under full sail, and was making rapid progress. \n\nThe day passed without accident. The pilot, who was familiar with the navigation of these seas, avoided the numerous vessels which passed on the way to Shanghai. \n\nTowards evening the Tankadere was within thirty miles of Shanghai. The night was dark, and the wind was blowing a gale. The pilot, who was on the lookout, saw a light in the distance, and steered towards it. \n\nThe light was that of a steamer, which was coming from Shanghai. The pilot hailed the steamer, and asked for a passage for his passengers. The captain of the steamer consented, and the passengers were transferred to the steamer, which was bound for Yokohama. \n\nThe Tankadere was left to continue her voyage to Shanghai, and the passengers were soon on their way to Yokohama. \n\nPhileas Fogg had won his wager, and had saved Aouda. \n\nFix, who had followed him to the end, was obliged to acknowledge that he had been wrong, and that Phileas Fogg was an honest man. \n\nThe steamer reached Yokohama on the 14th of November, and Phileas Fogg was in time to take the steamer for San Francisco."

Could Passepartout have been detained by the authorities, or had he fallen victim to some unforeseen danger? The thought of losing his trusted valet weighed heavily on him, as Passepartout had become more than just a servant; he was a friend.\n\nDespite his worry, Fogg knew he had to remain focused on the task at hand. The wager to circumnavigate the globe in eighty days was still at stake, and time was of the essence. He resolved to continue with the journey, hoping that Passepartout would find a way to rejoin him.\n\nAs the train sped towards their next destination, Fogg kept a vigilant eye on the passing scenery, his thoughts never straying far from his missing companion.",

Looking at the matter from every point of view, it did not seem to him impossible that, by some mistake, the man might have got on board the \"Carnatic\" at the last moment; and this was also Aouda's opinion, who regretted very much the loss of the worthy fellow to whom she owed so much. They might then find him at Yokohama, for, if the \"Carnatic\" was carrying him thither, it would be easy to ascertain if he had been on board. A brisk breeze arose about ten o'clock; but, though it might have been prudent to take in a reef, the pilot, after carefully examining the heavens, let the craft remain rigged as before. The \"Tankadere\" bore sail admirably, as she drew a great deal of water, and everything was prepared for high speed in case of a gale. Mr. Fogg and Aouda descended into the cabin at midnight, having been already preceded by Fix, who had lain down on one of the cots. The pilot and crew remained on deck all night."

During the day she kept along the coast, where the currents were favourable; the coast, irregular in profile, and visible sometimes across the clearings, was at most five miles distant. The sea was less boisterous, since the wind came off land—a fortunate circumstance for the boat, which would suffer, owing to its small tonnage, by a heavy surge on the sea.\nThe breeze subsided a little towards noon, and set in from the south-west. The pilot put up his poles, but took them down again within two hours, as the wind freshened up anew.\nMr. Fogg and Aouda, happily unaffected by the roughness of the sea, ate with a good appetite, Fix being invited to share their repast, which he accepted with secret chagrin. To travel at this man’s expense and live upon his provisions was not palatable to him. Still, he was obliged to eat, and so he ate.\nWhen the meal was over, he took Mr. Fogg apart, and said, “sir”—this “sir” scorched his lips, and he had to control himself to avoid collaring this “gentleman”—“sir, you have been very kind to give me a passage on this boat. But, though my means will not admit of my expending them as freely as you, I must ask to pay my share—”\n“Let us not speak of that, sir,” replied Mr. Fogg.\n“But, if I insist—”\n“No, sir,” repeated Mr. Fogg, in a tone which did not admit of a reply. “This enters into my general expenses.”\nFix, as he bowed, had a stifled feeling, and, going forward, where he ensconced himself, did not open his mouth for the rest of the day.",

John Bunsby was a careful man, and he knew how to handle his boat. He kept as near the coast as possible, and the \"Tankadere\" was never more than five miles from the shore. The sea was not very rough, and the wind was favourable, so that the little vessel was able to make good progress. The wind, however, began to weaken about noon, and an hour later it fell to a calm. The sails drooped, and the boat was motionless on the water. The pilot raised the poles, but they were of little use, for the wind soon sprang up again, and the sails were once more filled. Phileas Fogg and Aouda were not seasick, and they ate heartily of the provisions which had been brought on board. Fix, however, was not so fortunate.

They worked as desperately as if they were contesting in a Royal yacht regatta.\nBy evening, the log showed that two hundred and twenty miles had been accomplished from Hong Kong, and Mr. Fogg might hope that he would be able to reach Yokohama without recording any delay in his journal; in which case, the many misadventures which had overtaken him since he left London would not seriously affect his journey.\nThe “Tankadere” entered the Straits of Fo-Kien, which separate the island of Formosa from the Chinese coast, in the small hours of the night, and crossed the Tropic of Cancer. The sea was very rough in the straits, full of eddies formed by the counter-currents, and the chopping waves broke her course, whilst it became very difficult to stand on deck.\nAt daybreak the wind began to blow hard again, and the heavens seemed to predict a gale. The barometer announced a speedy change, the mercury rising and falling capriciously; the sea also, in the south-east, raised long surges which indicated a tempest. The sun had set the evening before in a red mist, in the midst of the phosphorescent scintillations of the ocean.\nJohn Bunsby long examined the threatening aspect of the heavens, muttering indistinctly between his teeth.

Look! a typhoon is coming up.”\n“Glad it’s a typhoon from the south, for it will carry us forward.”\n“Oh, if you take it that way,” said John Bunsby, “I’ve nothing more to say.” John Bunsby’s suspicions were confirmed.

Passepartout was a man of action, always ready to assist his master in any way possible.\n\nThe journey had been a whirlwind of events, each more thrilling than the last. From the bustling streets of London to the exotic locales of India and Hong Kong, Fogg and his companions had faced numerous challenges. Yet, Fogg's unyielding determination and meticulous planning had seen them through each obstacle.\n\nAs the Tankadere sailed on, the crew worked diligently, adjusting sails and maintaining the course.

The wind was from the south-east, and it was evident that a typhoon was coming up. John Bunsby, the pilot, said so, and he was not mistaken. At noon, the barometer indicated a state of the atmosphere which was beyond the limits of the scale. In the meantime, the wind had increased, and the waves rose to a frightful height. The tankadere, although it was a good sea-boat, was not large enough to brave such a storm. The crew were seized with a panic, and the pilot was obliged to take the helm himself. The storm, however, did not last long, and the wind veered again to the south-west. The tankadere, now running before the wind, kept up her speed, and John Bunsby was able to keep her on her course. But he was still in great fear of losing the reward of two hundred pounds, for the Carnatic might reach Yokohama before them.

Three hours later, pursued even in his dreams by a fixed idea, the poor fellow awoke, and struggled against the stupefying influence of the narcotic. The thought of a duty unfulfilled shook off his torpor, and he hurried from the abode of drunkenness. Staggering and holding himself up by keeping against the walls, falling down and creeping up again, and irresistibly impelled by a kind of instinct, he kept crying out, “The ‘Carnatic!’ the ‘Carnatic!’”\nThe steamer lay puffing alongside the quay, on the point of starting. Passepartout had but few steps to go; and, rushing upon the plank, he crossed it, and fell unconscious on the deck, just as the “Carnatic” was moving off. Several sailors, who were evidently accustomed to this sort of scene, carried the poor Frenchman down into the second cabin, and Passepartout did not wake until they were one hundred and fifty miles away from China.

Pshaw! Mr. Fogg is no more a robber than I am a murderer.”\nShould he divulge Fix’s real errand to his master? Would it do to tell the part the detective was playing? Would it not be better to wait until Mr. Fogg reached London again, and then impart to him that an agent of the metropolitan police had been following him round the world, and have a good laugh over it?

It was his fault, then, that Mr. Fogg and Aouda had missed the steamer. Yes, but it was still more the fault of the traitor who, in order to separate him from his master, and detain the latter at Hong Kong, had inveigled him into getting drunk! He now saw the detective’s trick; and at this moment Mr. Fogg was certainly ruined, his bet was lost, and he himself perhaps arrested and imprisoned! At this thought Passepartout tore his hair.

The faces of my fellow club members flash before my eyes, their expressions a mix of skepticism and amusement. And then, the image of my loyal servant, Passepartout, comes to mind. His unwavering dedication and resourcefulness have been invaluable throughout this supposed journey.\n\nI remember the various modes of transportation we employed: the steamers, the trains, the elephants, and even the sledge across the snowy plains. Each leg of the journey presented its own set of challenges and adventures, from the bustling streets of Bombay to the serene landscapes of Japan. The encounters with diverse cultures and peoples, the unexpected delays and obstacles, all seem to blur together in a whirlwind of experiences.\n\nBut what of the time? The ticking of the clock, the relentless march of days and hours, always at the forefront of my thoughts. The pressure to meet the deadline, to prove the feasibility of such a feat, weighed heavily upon me. And yet, there was a thrill in the race against time, a sense of purpose and determination that drove me forward.\n\nCould it be that I have truly circumnavigated the globe, or is this merely the product of an overactive imagination fueled by too much drink? The evidence before me is inconclusive, and I find myself questioning the very nature of reality. Perhaps I have been caught in a dream, a fantastical journey that exists only in the realm of my mind.\n\nYet, as I sit here, pondering the possibilities, I cannot shake the feeling that there is more to this than mere fantasy. The memories are too vivid, the emotions too real. Perhaps I have indeed accomplished the impossible, defied the odds, and proven that the world is not as vast and insurmountable as it once seemed.\n\nIn the end, whether this journey was real or imagined, it has left an indelible mark upon me. It has challenged my perceptions, broadened my horizons, and instilled in me a sense of wonder and curiosity about the world. And for that, I am grateful, regardless of the truth of the matter.\n\nWith a sigh, I rise from my seat, determined to face whatever reality awaits me. Whether I have been drunk or dreaming, I am resolved to embrace the adventure of life, wherever it may lead me next. For in the end, it is the journey itself that matters, not the destination.",

At least I have not missed the steamer, which is the most important thing.\" Then, as Fix occurred to him: \"As for that rascal, I hope we are well rid of him, and that he has not dared, as he proposed, to follow us on board the 'Carnatic.' A detective on the track of Mr. Fogg, accused of robbing the Bank of England! Pshaw! Mr. Fogg is no more a robber than I am a murderer. Should I confide in my master, and tell him about that affair? It would do no good, and would make him angry. The gentleman already has enough to worry about. No, I will wait until we get back to London to tell him that a detective has been watching him. I am curious to know how Mr. Fogg will take it then. But at least I have not missed the steamer, which is the most important thing.\" Passepartout got up and proceeded, as well as he could with the rolling of the steamer, to the after-deck. He saw no one who resembled either his master or Aouda. \"Good!\" muttered he; \"Aouda is probably still asleep at this hour. It wouldn't be proper for her to stroll about on deck alone, and as for Mr. Fogg, he is probably in his cabin, as usual.\" Passepartout, having scoured the ship from stem to stern, went down to the saloon. Neither Mr. Fogg nor Aouda was there. Passepartout had only, however, to ask the purser the number of his master's cabin. The purser replied that he did not know any passenger by the name of Fogg. \"I beg your pardon,\" said Passepartout persistently. \"He is a tall gentleman, quiet, and not very talkative, and has with him a young lady—\" \"There is no young lady on board,\" interrupted the purser. \"Here is the list of the passengers; you may see for yourself.\" Passepartout scanned the list, but his master's name was not upon it. All at once an idea struck him. \"Ah! am I on the 'Carnatic'?\" \"Yes.\" \"On the way to Yokohama?\" \"Certainly.\" Passepartout had for an instant feared that he was on the wrong boat; but, though he was really on the 'Carnatic,' his master was not there. He fell thunderstruck on a seat. He saw it all now. He remembered that the time of sailing had been changed, that he should have informed his master of that fact, and that he had not done so. It was his fault, then, that Mr. Fogg and Aouda had missed the steamer. Yes, but it was still more the fault of the traitor who, in order to separate him from his master, and detain the latter at Hong Kong, had inveigled him into getting drunk! He now saw the detective's trick; and at this moment Mr. Fogg was certainly ruined, his bet was lost, and he himself perhaps arrested and imprisoned! At this thought Passepartout tore his hair. Ah, if Fix ever came within his reach, what a settling of accounts there would be!\""

On the branches of the cedars were perched large eagles; amid the foliage of the weeping willows were herons, solemnly standing on one leg; and on every hand were crows, ducks, hawks, wild birds, and a multitude of cranes, which the Japanese consider sacred, and which to their minds symbolise long life and prosperity.\nAs he was strolling along, Passepartout espied some violets among the shrubs.\n“Good!” said he; “I’ll have some supper.”\nBut, on smelling them, he found that they were odourless.\n“No chance there,” thought he.\nThe worthy fellow had certainly taken good care to eat as hearty a breakfast as possible before leaving the “Carnatic;” but, as he had been walking about all day, the demands of hunger were becoming importunate.

The women’s hair was styled in elaborate coiffures, adorned with delicate pins and combs, while the men often sported topknots or shaved heads.\n\nAs he strolled through the bustling streets, Passepartout couldn’t help but notice the harmonious blend of tradition and modernity. Ancient temples stood side by side with new Western-style buildings, and the air was filled with a sense of both reverence and progress.\n\nHe eventually found himself in a quieter part of the city, where the hustle and bustle gave way to serene gardens and tranquil ponds. Here, the cherry blossoms were in full bloom, their delicate petals falling like snowflakes onto the manicured paths. Passepartout paused to take in the beauty of the scene, feeling a sense of peace wash over him.\n\nContinuing his exploration, he came across a small shrine nestled among the trees. Curious, he approached and observed the locals as they performed their rituals, offering prayers and lighting incense. The air was thick with the scent of sandalwood and the soft murmur of chanting.\n\nAs the day wore on, Passepartout realized he had lost track of time. The sun was beginning to set, casting a warm glow over the city and painting the sky in shades of orange and pink. He decided it was time to return to the hotel and share his experiences with Mr. Fogg.\n\nOn his way back, he stopped at a street vendor to purchase a small souvenir—a beautifully crafted paper fan, painted with a scene of Mount Fuji. It would serve as a reminder of his day spent in this enchanting city.\n\nWhen Passepartout finally returned to the hotel, he found Mr. Fogg calmly reading a newspaper in the lounge. Passepartout eagerly recounted his adventures, describing the sights, sounds, and smells of the city with great enthusiasm. Mr. Fogg listened attentively, nodding occasionally, and expressed his satisfaction that Passepartout had enjoyed his time in Japan.\n\nAs they prepared for their next journey, Passepartout felt a renewed sense of excitement and wonder, eager to see what other marvels the world had in store for them.",

              "simple_agent_extraction": "Passepartout wandered for several hours in the midst of this motley crowd, looking in at the windows of the rich and curious shops, the jewellery establishments glittering with quaint Japanese ornaments, the restaurants decked with streamers and banners, the tea-houses, where the odorous beverage was being drunk with \"saki,\" a liquor concocted from the fermentation of rice, and the comfortable smoking-houses, where they were puffing, not opium, which is almost unknown in Japan, but a very fine, stringy tobacco. Then he went on his way, through the streets, now quiet and deserted, and reached the country, where he saw the rice-fields, the camellias, the cherry, plum, and apple trees, which the Japanese cultivate rather for their blossoms than their fruit, and which are protected from the sparrows by means of scarecrows, the eagles perched on the cedars, the herons solemnly standing on one leg among the willows, and the crows, ducks, hawks, wild birds, and cranes, which flocked in the fields. Passepartout admired the sacred birds, which are regarded as emblems of longevity and happiness, and which, according to the Japanese, \"enjoy the privilege of being invisible.\" He was surprised to find that the violets, which he had expected to find fragrant, were without odour, and he was disappointed in his hope of finding something to eat. He had, in fact, eaten heartily before leaving the steamer, but, as he had been walking all day, he was beginning to feel hungry. Night came, and Passepartout returned to the native quarter, where he wandered through the streets, now brilliantly illuminated by the many-coloured lanterns, looking on at the dancers, who were executing skilful steps and bounds, and the astrologers, who were gazing at the stars through their telescopes. He saw the harbour, lit up by the resin torches of the fishermen, who were fishing from their boats. At last, the streets became quiet, and the patrol, in their splendid costumes, and surrounded by their suites, succeeded the bustling crowd. Each time a patrol passed, Passepartout chuckled, and said to himself: \"Good! another Japanese embassy departing for Europe!\""

I can’t sell this costume again for one still more Japanese. I must consider how to leave this country of the Sun, of which I shall not retain the most delightful of memories, as quickly as possible.”\nIt occurred to him to visit the steamers which were about to leave for America. He would offer himself as a cook or servant, in payment of his passage and meals. Once at San Francisco, he would find some means of going on. The difficulty was, how to traverse the four thousand seven hundred miles of the Pacific which lay between Japan and the New World.\nPassepartout was not the man to let an idea go begging, and directed his steps towards the docks. But, as he approached them, his project, which at first had seemed so simple, began to grow more and more formidable to his mind. What need would they have of a cook or servant on an American steamer, and what confidence would they put in him, dressed as he was? What references could he give?\nAs he was reflecting in this wise, his eyes fell upon an immense placard which a sort of clown was carrying through the streets. This placard, which was in English, read as follows:\nACROBATIC JAPANESE TROUPE,\nHONOURABLE WILLIAM BATULCAR, PROPRIETOR,\nLAST REPRESENTATIONS,\nPRIOR TO THEIR DEPARTURE TO THE UNITED STATES,\nOF THE\nLONG NOSES!

He was a man on a mission, and every step he took was calculated and purposeful.\n\nAs he navigated through the throng, his mind was focused on the task at hand. He had embarked on a journey that many deemed impossible, a race against time that required not only meticulous planning but also the ability to adapt to unforeseen challenges. His goal was to circumnavigate the globe in eighty days, a feat that would test the limits of human endurance and ingenuity.\n\nFogg's journey was not just a test of speed but also a testament to the spirit of adventure and the relentless pursuit of a dream. He was accompanied by his loyal servant, Passepartout, whose resourcefulness and quick thinking often proved invaluable in the face of adversity.\n\nAs they moved through the city, Fogg's mind was already several steps ahead, anticipating the next leg of their journey and the obstacles they might encounter. He was a man who thrived on challenges, and the prospect of conquering the world in such a short span of time was a challenge he relished.\n\n\"Onward,\" he thought, as he continued through the bustling streets, his eyes set firmly on the horizon and the promise of adventure that lay beyond.",

Passepartout was amused by the spectacle, and his spirits rose as he watched the antics of the performers.\n\nThe clown, who had been distributing handbills, now approached Passepartout, and handed him one. It was an advertisement for the acrobatic troupe of William Batulcar, which was to give its last performance in Japan before leaving for America. The performance was to take place that very evening, and Passepartout resolved to attend.\n\nHe had no money to pay for a ticket, but he hoped to find some way of getting in.

Well, if I can’t take you as a servant, I can as a clown. You see, my friend, in France they exhibit foreign clowns, and in foreign parts French clowns.”\n“Ah!”\n“You are pretty strong, eh?”\n“Especially after a good meal.”\n“And you can sing?”\n“Yes,” returned Passepartout, who had formerly been wont to sing in the streets.\n“But can you sing standing on your head, with a top spinning on your left foot, and a sabre balanced on your right?”\n“Humph!

The musicians took up a position inside, and were vigorously performing on their gongs, tam-tams, flutes, bones, tambourines, and immense drums.\nThe performance was much like all acrobatic displays; but it must be confessed that the Japanese are the first equilibrists in the world.\nOne, with a fan and some bits of paper, performed the graceful trick of the butterflies and the flowers; another traced in the air, with the odorous smoke of his pipe, a series of blue words, which composed a compliment to the audience; while a third juggled with some lighted candles, which he extinguished successively as they passed his lips, and relit again without interrupting for an instant his juggling. Another reproduced the most singular combinations with a spinning-top; in his hands the revolving tops seemed to be animated with a life of their own in their interminable whirling; they ran over pipe-stems, the edges of sabres, wires and even hairs stretched across the stage; they turned around on the edges of large glasses, crossed bamboo ladders, dispersed into all the corners, and produced strange musical effects by the combination of their various pitches of tone. The jugglers tossed them in the air, threw them like shuttlecocks with wooden battledores, and yet they kept on spinning; they put them into their pockets, and took them out still whirling as before.\nIt is useless to describe the astonishing performances of the acrobats and gymnasts. The turning on ladders, poles, balls, barrels, &c., was executed with wonderful precision.",

His meticulous planning and adherence to a strict schedule were crucial to his success. As he awaited the departure to San Francisco, he reflected on the adventures that had brought him this far.\n\nFogg's journey had begun in London, where he made a wager with members of the Reform Club that he could travel around the world in eighty days. Accompanied by his loyal servant, Passepartout, Fogg embarked on a whirlwind tour that took him across Europe, through the bustling streets of Bombay, and over the vast expanse of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nIn each location, Fogg encountered new cultures and faced unforeseen obstacles. From rescuing the beautiful Aouda from a perilous situation in India to navigating the treacherous waters of the South China Sea, his journey was anything but ordinary. Yet, through it all, Fogg maintained his characteristic calm and resourcefulness.\n\nAs he prepared to board the train to San Francisco, Fogg knew that the American leg of his journey would present its own set of challenges. The vastness of the continent, the unpredictable weather, and the potential for delays weighed on his mind. However, he was confident in his ability to overcome any obstacle that lay ahead.\n\nPassepartout, ever the faithful companion, busied himself with the luggage, ensuring that everything was in order for their departure. His cheerful demeanor and unwavering loyalty provided Fogg with much-needed support and companionship.\n\nWith the train whistle signaling their imminent departure, Fogg took a moment to appreciate the journey thus far. He knew that the road ahead would be difficult, but he was determined to see his wager through to the end. As the train pulled away from the station, Fogg settled into his seat, ready to face whatever challenges awaited him on the way to San Francisco and beyond.",

The audience was a mix of Europeans, natives, Chinese, and Japanese, all eager to witness the spectacle.\n\nInside, the musicians were playing with great energy, setting the stage for the acrobatic feats to follow. The show began with a series of impressive acts, showcasing the agility and skill of the Japanese performers. They manipulated paper butterflies with fans, created smoke calligraphy, juggled lit candles, and performed intricate tricks with spinning tops that seemed to move with a life of their own, producing musical notes as they spun across various surfaces.\n\nThe jugglers interacted with the tops in a seamless display of coordination, while other performers executed gymnastic feats with ladders, poles, and balls, all with remarkable precision. Passepartout, without any rehearsal, was to participate in the grand finale, the 'human pyramid' act, which featured the 'Long Noses of the god Tingou'.

Attired after the fashion of the Middle Ages, they bore upon their shoulders a splendid pair of wings; but what especially distinguished them was the long noses which were fastened to their faces, and the uses which they made of them. These noses were made of bamboo, and were five, six, and even ten feet long, some straight, others curved, some ribboned, and some having imitation warts upon them. It was upon these appendages, fixed tightly on their real noses, that they performed their gymnastic exercises. A dozen of these sectaries of Tingou lay flat upon their backs, while others, dressed to represent lightning-rods, came and frolicked on their noses, jumping from one to another, and performing the most skilful leapings and somersaults.\nAs a last scene, a “human pyramid” had been announced, in which fifty Long Noses were to represent the Car of Juggernaut. But, instead of forming a pyramid by mounting each other’s shoulders, the artists were to group themselves on top of the noses. It happened that the performer who had hitherto formed the base of the Car had quitted the troupe, and as, to fill this part, only strength and adroitness were necessary, Passepartout had been chosen to take his place.\nThe poor fellow really felt sad when—melancholy reminiscence of his youth!—he donned his costume, adorned with vari-coloured wings, and fastened to his natural feature a false nose six feet long. But he cheered up when he thought that this nose was winning him something to eat.\nHe went upon the stage, and took his place beside the rest who were to compose the base of the Car of Juggernaut. They all stretched themselves on the floor, their noses pointing to the ceiling. A second group of artists disposed themselves on these long appendages, then a third above these, then a fourth, until a human monument reaching to the very cornices of the theatre soon arose on top of the noses. This elicited loud applause, in the midst of which the orchestra was just striking up a deafening air, when the pyramid tottered, the balance was lost, one of the lower noses vanished from the pyramid, and the human monument was shattered like a castle built of cards!\nIt was Passepartout’s fault. Abandoning his position, clearing the footlights without the aid of his wings, and, clambering up to the right-hand gallery, he fell at the feet of one of the spectators, crying, “Ah, my master! my master!”",

This peculiar trait was not a natural occurrence but rather an artful illusion created through the use of prosthetics and makeup, designed to captivate and intrigue audiences.\n\nThe exhibition was held in a large, ornately decorated tent, filled with the sounds of exotic music and the scent of incense wafting through the air. The performers, dressed in vibrant, traditional costumes, moved gracefully across the stage, their every gesture and expression carefully choreographed to enhance the mystique of their appearance.\n\nSpectators from all walks of life gathered to witness this unusual spectacle, their curiosity piqued by the promise of something entirely novel and unseen in the Western world. The Long Noses performed a series of acts that combined elements of dance, acrobatics, and storytelling, each routine more elaborate and mesmerizing than the last.\n\nOne of the highlights of the show was a traditional dance that depicted an ancient legend from their homeland, a tale of love and betrayal, courage and redemption. The performers used their elongated noses to great effect, incorporating them into the narrative as symbols of wisdom and power, drawing the audience deeper into the story with each movement.\n\nAs the performance reached its climax, the Long Noses formed a human pyramid, balancing precariously atop one another, their noses pointing skyward like a forest of slender trees. The audience gasped in awe, their applause echoing through the tent as the performers dismounted with practiced ease, bowing deeply to acknowledge the crowd's appreciation.\n\nThe exhibition of the Long Noses was more than just a display of physical prowess and artistic skill; it was a cultural exchange, a glimpse into a world that was both foreign and fascinating. For many in the audience, it was an opportunity to broaden their horizons, to experience the richness and diversity of human expression beyond the familiar confines of their own society.\n\nAs the show came to an end, the performers took their final bows, their faces beaming with pride and satisfaction. The audience rose to their feet, applauding with enthusiasm and admiration, their minds filled with the wonder and mystery of the Long Noses.\n\nIn the days that followed, the exhibition became the talk of the town, with people from all over eager to share their impressions and recount the marvels they had witnessed. The Long Noses had left an indelible mark on the hearts and minds of those who had been fortunate enough to see them, a testament to the enduring power of art to transcend boundaries and unite people in shared wonder.",

He consoled himself with the thought that he was earning his food, but he could not help feeling a little sad. \n\nAnd then, as the pyramid reached its height, he suddenly abandoned his post, and leaped over the footlights, and scrambled into the right-hand gallery.

The “General Grant” passed, on the 23rd of November, the one hundred and eightieth meridian, and was at the very antipodes of London. Mr. Fogg had, it is true, exhausted fifty-two of the eighty days in which he was to complete the tour, and there were only twenty-eight left. But, though he was only half-way by the difference of meridians, he had really gone over two-thirds of the whole journey; for he had been obliged to make long circuits from London to Aden, from Aden to Bombay, from Calcutta to Singapore, and from Singapore to Yokohama. Could he have followed without deviation the fiftieth parallel, which is that of London, the whole distance would only have been about twelve thousand miles; whereas he would be forced, by the irregular methods of locomotion, to traverse twenty-six thousand, of which he had, on the 23rd of November, accomplished seventeen thousand five hundred. And now the course was a straight one, and Fix was no longer there to put obstacles in their way!\nIt happened also, on the 23rd of November, that Passepartout made a joyful discovery. It will be remembered that the obstinate fellow had insisted on keeping his famous family watch at London time, and on regarding that of the countries he had passed through as quite false and unreliable. Now, on this day, though he had not changed the hands, he found that his watch exactly agreed with the ship’s chronometers. His triumph was hilarious. He would have liked to know what Fix would say if he were aboard!\n“The rogue told me a lot of stories,” repeated Passepartout, “about the meridians, the sun, and the moon! Moon, indeed! moonshine more likely! If one listened to that sort of people, a pretty sort of time one would keep! I was sure that the sun would some day regulate itself by my watch!”\nPassepartout was ignorant that, if the face of his watch had been divided into twenty-four hours, like the Italian clocks, he would have no reason for exultation; for the hands of his watch would then, instead of as now indicating nine o’clock in the morning, indicate nine o’clock in the evening, that is, the twenty-first hour after midnight precisely the difference between London time and that of the one hundred and eightieth meridian. But if Fix had been able to explain this purely physical effect, Passepartout would not have admitted, even if he had comprehended it.

Yet, with his characteristic calm and precision, Fogg had managed to keep to his schedule, overcoming obstacles with the help of his loyal servant, Passepartout.\n\nAs they sailed across the Pacific Ocean, Fogg took the opportunity to reflect on the journey thus far. The departure from London had been swift, with Fogg and Passepartout catching the train to Dover and then crossing the English Channel to Calais. From there, they had traveled through France and Italy, reaching Brindisi just in time to catch the steamer to Suez.\n\nIn Egypt, Fogg had encountered the first of many challenges. The Suez Canal, a marvel of modern engineering, had been a crucial link in their journey, allowing them to reach the Red Sea and continue on to Bombay. However, the journey through India had not been without its difficulties. Passepartout's inadvertent entry into a Hindu temple had nearly derailed their plans, but Fogg's quick thinking and resourcefulness had saved the day.\n\nThe journey from Bombay to Calcutta had been another test of their resolve. The railway line was incomplete, forcing them to find alternative means of transportation. It was during this leg of the journey that they had met Sir Francis Cromarty, who had become an invaluable ally. Together, they had navigated the challenges of the Indian subcontinent, including a daring rescue of a young woman named Aouda from a ritual sacrifice.\n\nWith Aouda now accompanying them, the group had continued on to Hong Kong, where they faced yet another setback. Passepartout had been separated from Fogg, leading to a frantic search and a narrow escape from the clutches of Detective Fix, who was determined to arrest Fogg on suspicion of robbery. Despite these challenges, Fogg had managed to board the steamer to Yokohama, where they were reunited with Passepartout.\n\nNow, as they crossed the Pacific, Fogg remained focused on the task at hand. The journey was far from over, and the challenges ahead were daunting. The vast expanse of the United States lay before them, with its own set of trials and tribulations. Yet, Fogg was undeterred. His determination to win the wager and prove the feasibility of his journey was unwavering.\n\nAs the ship sailed steadily towards San Francisco, Fogg knew that time was of the essence.

Fix recognized him at once, and, as he was about to make himself known to him, he was seized with a sudden idea. He would follow Passepartout, and thus learn what Phileas Fogg was doing. It was not difficult to keep Passepartout in sight, for he was walking with the easy gait of a man who was not pressed for time. Fix slipped into the crowd, and followed him at a distance. Passepartout went into a theatre, and Fix, who was not fond of the play, but who was curious to know what was going on, followed him. The detective was not long in ascertaining that the Frenchman was one of the performers in a Japanese troupe, and that he was acting in a play. Fix was astonished, but he was not surprised, for he had already seen Passepartout in a variety of disguises. He was, however, determined to keep an eye on him, and to follow him wherever he went. Passepartout, having finished his performance, left the theatre, and Fix followed him to the quay, where he saw him embark on the General Grant. Fix was now certain that Phileas Fogg was on board the steamer, and he resolved to follow him to America. He was not long in making up his mind, and he at once took passage on the General Grant. He was on board when Phileas Fogg and Aouda arrived, and he was not a little surprised to see Passepartout in his theatrical costume. Fix, however, did not make himself known to him, for he was afraid of being recognized, and he kept out of sight as much as possible. He was, however, determined to follow Phileas Fogg to the end of the world, if necessary, and to arrest him as soon as he set foot on English soil."

San Francisco was no longer the legendary city of 1849—a city of banditti, assassins, and incendiaries, who had flocked hither in crowds in pursuit of plunder; a paradise of outlaws, where they gambled with gold-dust, a revolver in one hand and a bowie-knife in the other: it was now a great commercial emporium.\n",

Some, tightly closed, seemed to disappear suddenly in the midst of the cries—an energetic way, no doubt, of casting a vote. The crowd swayed back, the banners and flags wavered, disappeared an instant, then reappeared in tatters.

It is a marvel of engineering, traversing vast plains, scaling mountain ranges, and bridging mighty rivers. The line is a testament to human ingenuity and determination, connecting the bustling cities of the East with the burgeoning towns of the West.\n\nThe journey across this great expanse is an adventure in itself, offering passengers a glimpse of the diverse landscapes and cultures that make up the United States. From the industrial heartlands of the East, the train speeds through the fertile farmlands of the Midwest, where endless fields stretch to the horizon. As it continues westward, the terrain becomes more rugged, with the majestic Rocky Mountains rising in the distance, their snow-capped peaks a stark contrast to the flatlands left behind.\n\nCrossing the Rockies is a feat of engineering prowess, with the railway winding through narrow passes and over towering trestles. The views from the train are breathtaking, with deep valleys and towering cliffs providing a dramatic backdrop to the journey. Once over the mountains, the train descends into the arid landscapes of the Great Basin, where the vast deserts and salt flats offer a stark beauty of their own.\n\nFinally, the train reaches the lush valleys and rolling hills of California, where the climate is milder and the land is rich with vineyards and orchards. The journey ends in San Francisco, a city of hills and fog, where the Pacific Ocean stretches out to the horizon, a vast expanse of blue that seems to go on forever.\n\nThis transcontinental railway is more than just a means of transportation; it is a symbol of the unity and progress of a nation. It represents the spirit of exploration and the desire to connect distant places, bringing people and ideas together across vast distances. For those who travel its length, it is a journey of discovery, a chance to see the country in all its varied glory, and to experience the thrill of crossing from ocean to ocean.",

This region is known for its agricultural productivity, with vast expanses of farmland dedicated to crops such as fruits, vegetables, and nuts. The climate is typically Mediterranean, with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters, making it ideal for farming.\n\nAs the train travels through this area, passengers can observe the changing landscape, from the bustling urban environment of San Francisco to the more rural and pastoral scenes of the countryside. The journey offers a glimpse into the diverse geography of California, showcasing the transition from coastal cityscapes to inland agricultural heartlands.\n\nThe route between San Francisco and Sacramento is also historically significant, as it follows part of the path of the first transcontinental railroad, completed in the 19th century. This railroad was a monumental engineering feat that connected the eastern United States with the Pacific Coast, facilitating commerce, travel, and the expansion of the American frontier.\n\nIn \"Around the World in Eighty Days,\" the journey through this region would have been a part of Phileas Fogg's ambitious attempt to circumnavigate the globe in a mere eighty days. The novel, written by Jules Verne, captures the spirit of adventure and the technological advancements of the time, highlighting the impact of rail travel on global connectivity.\n\nOverall, the area between San Francisco and Sacramento serves as a vital link in the transportation network of California, bridging the gap between major cities and supporting the state's economy through its agricultural output.",

Outside, the landscape blurred by, a testament to the speed and efficiency of modern travel, yet inside, time seemed to slow as the passengers became engrossed in their shared adventure.\n\nAs the journey progressed, the initial excitement began to give way to a more reflective mood. Some passengers turned their attention to the scenery outside, watching as the world unfolded beyond the windows. Others returned to their books or newspapers, their minds still buzzing with the earlier excitement.\n\nIn the midst of it all, the conductor moved through the car, checking tickets and ensuring that everything was in order. His presence was a reminder of the routine nature of the journey, even as the passengers remained caught up in the extraordinary circumstances that had brought them together.\n\nAs the train approached its next stop, the passengers in car No. 117 began to gather their belongings, preparing to disembark or continue on to their final destinations. The conversations that had filled the car gradually quieted, replaced by the sounds of zippers and rustling bags.\n\nYet, as they prepared to leave, there was a sense that this shared experience had left a lasting impression. For a brief moment, the passengers of car No. 117 had been part of something larger than themselves, a reminder of the unexpected connections that can arise in the most ordinary of circumstances.",

Passepartout took one of the front seats. Neither Mr. Fogg nor Fix cared to attend. At the appointed hour, Elder William Hitch rose, and in an irritated voice, as if he had already been contradicted, said: \"I am going to tell you about the Mormons.\" He then proceeded to relate the history of the religion, beginning with that of Joseph Smith, its founder, and the persecutions which its adherents endured. He declared that the Mormons were the most persecuted sect in the world, and that they had been driven from their homes and forced to seek refuge in the far West. He recounted the martyrdom of Joe and Hiram Smith, the prophets, and the revelations of the Book of Mormon, which was published in 1830. He spoke of the persecutions they had suffered in Missouri and Illinois, and of the exodus to Utah, where the Mormons had founded a new state. He told of the prosperity of the community, which was due to the industry and thrift of its members, and of the persecutions they had again suffered at the hands of the United States government. He concluded by saying that the Mormons were a peaceful and law-abiding people, and that they only asked to be let alone. During the lecture, some of the passengers, not being much interested in the subject, left the car; but others, attracted by the speaker's fervor, remained. Passepartout was among the latter, and listened with all his ears. He was very much interested in the story of the Mormons, and he felt that he had learned something new about the world."

I have neither cards nor partners.”\n“Oh, but we can easily buy some cards, for they are sold on all the American trains. And as for partners, if madam plays—”\n“Certainly, sir,” Aouda quickly replied; “I understand whist. It is part of an English education.”\n“I myself have some pretensions to playing a good game. Well, here are three of us, and a dummy—”\n“As you please, sir,” replied Phileas Fogg, heartily glad to resume his favourite pastime even on the railway.\nPassepartout was dispatched in search of the steward, and soon returned with two packs of cards, some pins, counters, and a shelf covered with cloth.\nThe game commenced. Aouda understood whist sufficiently well, and even received some compliments on her playing from Mr. Fogg. As for the detective, he was simply an adept, and worthy of being matched against his present opponent.\n“Now,” thought Passepartout, “we’ve got him. He won’t budge.”",

He kept thinking of the strange adventure in which he had embarked, and of the consequences which it might have for him. He was worried about the money he had left behind in London, and about the possibility of being dismissed by Mr. Fogg if anything went wrong.\n\nThe train sped on through the night, and Passepartout could hear the rhythmic clatter of the wheels on the tracks. He tried to calm his mind by focusing on the sound, but his thoughts kept returning to the events of the day. He thought about the bet that Mr. Fogg had made, and the incredible journey they were undertaking. He wondered if they would really be able to make it around the world in eighty days.\n\nAs the train continued its journey, Passepartout's thoughts turned to the people they had met along the way. He thought about the detective, Fix, who seemed to be following them, and he wondered what his true intentions were. He also thought about the kind people they had encountered, and the different cultures they had experienced.\n\nDespite his worries, Passepartout felt a sense of excitement about the adventure. He had never imagined that he would have the opportunity to travel the world, and he was determined to make the most of it. He resolved to do everything he could to help Mr. Fogg win the bet, and to ensure that their journey was a success.\n\nAs the night wore on, Passepartout finally began to feel drowsy. He closed his eyes and let the sound of the train lull him to sleep. He dreamed of far-off lands and exciting adventures, and he awoke the next morning feeling refreshed and ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.",

Passepartout sat down beside him, and asked him if he felt any ill effects from the journey. Mr. Fogg replied that he was quite well, and that he hoped to reach New York in time to catch the steamer for Liverpool. Passepartout then asked Fix if he was still determined to arrest Mr. Fogg. Fix replied that he was, but that he would do nothing to prevent Mr. Fogg from reaching Europe. Passepartout was reassured by this, and he resolved to keep a close watch on Fix. Meanwhile, Fix was thinking of a way to keep Mr. Fogg occupied, so that he would not leave the train. He suggested a game of whist, which Mr. Fogg accepted with pleasure. Aouda, who had learned the game in England, agreed to join them, and Fix offered to be the third player. Passepartout procured a pack of cards, and the game began. Mr. Fogg played with his usual skill, and Aouda proved to be a worthy opponent. Fix, too, played well, and the game was closely contested. Passepartout watched the game with satisfaction, feeling that Mr. Fogg was now safely occupied and unlikely to leave the train."

Very well; I will show these people that a Frenchman can be as American as they!”\n“All aboard!” cried the conductor.\n“Yes, all aboard!” repeated Passepartout, and immediately. “But they can’t prevent me from thinking that it would be more natural for us to cross the bridge on foot, and let the train come after!”",

The road here attained the highest elevation of the journey, eight thousand and ninety-two feet above the level of the sea. The travellers had now only to descend to the Atlantic by limitless plains, levelled by nature. A branch of the “grand trunk” led off southward to Denver, the capital of Colorado. The country round about is rich in gold and silver, and more than fifty thousand inhabitants are already settled there.\nThirteen hundred and eighty-two miles had been passed over from San Francisco, in three days and three nights; four days and nights more would probably bring them to New York. Phileas Fogg was not as yet behind-hand.\nDuring the night Camp Walbach was passed on the left; Lodge Pole Creek ran parallel with the road, marking the boundary between the territories of Wyoming and Colorado. They entered Nebraska at eleven, passed near Sedgwick, and touched at Julesburg, on the southern branch of the Platte River.\nIt was here that the Union Pacific Railroad was inaugurated on the 23rd of October, 1867, by the chief engineer, General Dodge. Two powerful locomotives, carrying nine cars of invited guests, amongst whom was Thomas C. Durant, vice-president of the road, stopped at this point; cheers were given, the Sioux and Pawnees performed an imitation Indian battle, fireworks were let off, and the first number of the Railway Pioneer was printed by a press brought on the train. Thus was celebrated the inauguration of this great railroad, a mighty instrument of progress and civilisation, thrown across the desert, and destined to link together cities and towns which do not yet exist. The whistle of the locomotive, more powerful than Amphion’s lyre, was about to bid them rise from American soil.\nFort McPherson was left behind at eight in the morning, and three hundred and fifty-seven miles had yet to be traversed before reaching Omaha. The road followed the capricious windings of the southern branch of the Platte River, on its left bank. At nine the train stopped at the important town of North Platte, built between the two arms of the river, which rejoin each other around it and form a single artery, a large tributary, whose waters empty into the Missouri a little above Omaha.\nThe one hundred and first meridian was passed.",

His eyes were fixed on the passing scenery, but his mind was undoubtedly calculating the time and distance remaining on their journey. Beside him, Passepartout, his loyal valet, was more animated, his eyes wide with wonder at the unfamiliar sights.\n\nThe train descended from the heights, winding its way through the Rocky Mountains, a feat of engineering that was a testament to human ingenuity. The passengers marveled at the views, the sheer cliffs and deep gorges that seemed to stretch endlessly into the horizon.\n\nAs night fell, the train continued its journey, the rhythmic clatter of the wheels on the tracks a soothing lullaby to the weary travelers. The stars above were bright and clear, a celestial map guiding them westward.\n\nIn the dining car, the atmosphere was lively, with passengers sharing stories and laughter over meals. Fogg, however, remained focused, his mind on the task at hand. He knew that every minute counted, and any delay could jeopardize their tight schedule.\n\nPassepartout, ever the social butterfly, engaged in conversation with fellow travelers, his French accent adding a touch of exotic charm to his tales of adventure. He spoke of their travels across Europe and Asia, the wonders they had seen, and the challenges they had faced.\n\nThe train pressed on through the night, crossing the vast plains of Wyoming, a land of open skies and endless possibilities. The journey was far from over, but with each passing mile, they were one step closer to their goal.\n\nAs dawn broke, the train approached the bustling town of Laramie, a hub of activity and commerce. The travelers prepared for the next leg of their journey, their spirits buoyed by the progress they had made.

At this point the travellers were fifty-seven miles from the starting-point in Wyoming, and they descended the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains to the plains of Nebraska. At eight o'clock a.m. the next day, the train stopped at the important town of Cheyenne, which connected with Denver by a branch road, and which is the chief town of the mining region of Colorado. They stopped there for twenty minutes, which was sufficient for Mr. Fogg and his party to purchase a supply of fresh game. The country around was full of wild game, and large herds of buffalo were seen as they passed along. They also saw immense prairies, immense forests, and vast rivers, which were crossed by bridges of great length. The train passed Fort McPherson, and reached North Platte, where it stopped for a few minutes. The town is situated on the river of the same name, and is the point where the two branches of the river unite. The train crossed the one hundred and first meridian, and entered the territory of Nebraska. At noon, the train stopped at Julesburg, on the southern branch of the Platte River. Here was inaugurated, on the 23rd of October, 1867, the Union Pacific Railroad, which unites the Atlantic and Pacific by a continuous line. This was a great event in the history of the United States, and was celebrated by a grand festival, at which General Dodge and Thomas C. Durant, the chief engineers, were present. Speeches were made, and an imitation Indian battle was fought, in which the soldiers of the fort took part. Fireworks were let off, and the first number of the \"Railway Pioneer\" was printed on the train. Thus was celebrated the inauguration of the great transcontinental line, which was to connect the future cities of the Union with the Pacific Ocean. The train continued its course, following the southern branch of the Platte River, and passed Fort Kearney. The next day, at noon, it reached Omaha, the terminus of the Union Pacific Railroad, and the point of junction with the trains of the Chicago and North Western Railway. Here the travellers were to take the train for Chicago, and thence to New York, which was the end of their journey. Mr. Fogg was now only two days behind time, and he hoped to make up the lost time by the speed of the trains on the eastern roads. The train stopped at Omaha for a few hours, and the travellers had time to visit the town, which is the capital of the state of Nebraska. They found it a thriving place, with a population of about thirty thousand inhabitants, and a great centre of trade. They visited the principal buildings, and saw the great bridge over the Missouri River, which connects Omaha with Council Bluffs, in the state of Iowa. This bridge is one of the finest in the world, and is a marvel of engineering skill. The train left Omaha at six o'clock in the evening, and crossed the Missouri River by the bridge. It then entered the state of Iowa, and passed through the towns of Council Bluffs, Des Moines, and Iowa City. The travellers were now in the heart of the great agricultural region of the United States, and they saw immense fields of corn and wheat, and vast herds of cattle and sheep. The train continued its course, and reached Chicago at eight o'clock in the morning. Here the travellers had to change cars, and take the train for New York. They had now only one day more to reach their destination, and Mr. Fogg was confident that he would arrive in time to win his wager. The train left Chicago at nine o'clock, and passed through the towns of South Bend, Toledo, and Cleveland. It then entered the state of Pennsylvania, and passed through the towns of Erie, Buffalo, and Rochester. The travellers were now in the state of New York, and they saw the great lakes, the Niagara Falls, and the Hudson River. The train continued its course, and reached New York at eight o'clock in the evening. Mr. Fogg had won his wager, and had made the tour of the world in eighty days."

The world is a small place, after all.\"\n\nProctor, not one to let go of a grudge easily, continued, \"I suppose you're still on your little adventure, trying to make it around the world in eighty days?\"\n\n\"That is correct,\" Fogg answered simply, his expression unchanged.\n\nProctor laughed, a harsh, mocking sound. \"And do you really think you'll succeed?\"\n\nFogg met his gaze steadily. \"I do.\"\n\nProctor's eyes narrowed. \"Well, I suppose we'll see about that. But remember, Fogg, you still owe me satisfaction for the insult you gave me back in San Francisco.\"\n\nFogg nodded. \"I have not forgotten, Mr. Proctor. I am a man of my word.\"\n\nProctor seemed taken aback by Fogg's calm demeanor, but he quickly recovered. \"Very well, then. I shall hold you to it.\"\n\nWith that, Proctor turned on his heel and walked away, leaving Fogg to ponder the encounter. Passepartout, who had been watching the exchange from a distance, approached his master with concern.\n\n\"Monsieur Fogg,\" he said, \"that man, he is dangerous. You must be careful.\"\n\nFogg nodded. \"I am aware, Passepartout. But we have more pressing matters to attend to. We must focus on reaching New York on time.\"\n\nPassepartout nodded, though he couldn't shake the feeling of unease that had settled over him. He knew his master was a man of honor, but he also knew that Proctor was not to be underestimated.\n\nAs the train continued its journey, Fogg remained deep in thought. He was determined to complete his journey around the world, but he also knew that he could not ignore the challenge that Proctor had issued. It was a matter of honor, and Fogg was not one to back down from such a challenge.\n\nThe encounter with Proctor had been unexpected, but Fogg was not one to be easily rattled. He would face whatever challenges lay ahead with the same calm determination that had brought him this far. The journey was not yet over, and Fogg was resolved to see it through to the end, no matter what obstacles stood in his way.",

Fogg, with his usual calm demeanor, confirmed by playing the ten of spades. Proctor, with a sneer, declared his preference for diamonds and reached for the card, accusing Fogg of being incompetent at whist. Fogg rose, asserting that he might be as skilled as anyone. Proctor, with a belligerent tone, issued a challenge. Aouda, pale with concern, tried to restrain Fogg, while Passepartout prepared to confront Proctor. Fix intervened, reminding Proctor of their previous altercation where Proctor had struck him. Fogg, maintaining his politeness, asserted that this new insult was his affair alone and demanded satisfaction from Proctor. Proctor readily agreed to a duel at Fogg's convenience regarding time, place, and weapon. Despite Aouda and Fix's attempts to prevent the duel, and Passepartout being halted by a sign from Fogg, Fogg and Proctor stepped onto the car platform to arrange the duel. Fogg stated his urgent need to return to Europe and suggested meeting in six months, citing his prior intention to seek Proctor out after finishing business in England. Proctor dismissed this as evasion and demanded the duel happen immediately. When Fogg confirmed he wasn't going to New York or Chicago, Proctor suggested Plum Creek, the next station stop, as a suitable location for a quick revolver duel during the ten-minute halt. Fogg calmly agreed to stop at Plum Creek. Proctor ended the exchange with a threatening remark implying Fogg would not leave Plum Creek."

In making this resolution, Fogg was not merely wagering a sum of money; he was staking his reputation, his honor, and his very way of life.\n\nFogg was a man of habit, a creature of precision and routine. His days were marked by the ticking of the clock, each moment accounted for, each action measured and deliberate. To undertake such a journey was to step into the unknown, to embrace uncertainty and chaos, elements that were anathema to his orderly existence.\n\nYet, in this bold move, Fogg revealed a side of himself that few had ever seen. Beneath the calm, unflappable exterior lay a spirit of adventure, a willingness to challenge the status quo and push the boundaries of what was considered possible. It was a gamble, yes, but one that spoke to a deeper truth about Fogg's character: his unyielding belief in the power of human ingenuity and determination.\n\nAs he set out on this epic journey, Fogg was accompanied by his loyal servant, Passepartout, whose own life was irrevocably changed by this decision. Passepartout, with his wide-eyed wonder and boundless enthusiasm, was the perfect foil to Fogg's stoic demeanor. Together, they would face trials and tribulations, navigating the complexities of foreign lands and cultures, overcoming obstacles that would test their resolve and resourcefulness.\n\nThe journey was fraught with danger and uncertainty. From the bustling streets of London to the exotic locales of India, China, and America, Fogg and Passepartout encountered challenges that would have daunted lesser men. Yet, through it all, Fogg remained steadfast, his eyes fixed on the prize, his mind ever calculating, ever planning.\n\nIn sacrificing himself to this endeavor, Fogg was not merely seeking to win a bet; he was seeking to prove a point. He was challenging the very notion of time and space, defying the limitations that society had placed upon him. In doing so, he was not only testing the limits of human endurance but also redefining what it meant to be a man of the world.\n\nUltimately, Phileas Fogg's journey was not just a race against time; it was a journey of self-discovery, a testament to the power of the human spirit to transcend boundaries and achieve the impossible. In sacrificing himself, Fogg found himself, and in doing so, he left an indelible mark on the world, a legacy that would endure long after the journey was over.",

A high mast was fixed on the frame, held firmly by metallic lashings, to which was attached a large brigantine sail. This mast held an iron stay upon which to hoist a jib-sail.

It followed throughout the right bank of the Platte River. The sledge, shortening this route, took a chord of the arc described by the railway. Mudge was not afraid of being stopped by the Platte River, because it was frozen. The road, then, was quite clear of obstacles, and Phileas Fogg had but two things to fear—an accident to the sledge, and a change or calm in the wind.\nBut the breeze, far from lessening its force, blew as if to bend the mast, which, however, the metallic lashings held firmly. These lashings, like the chords of a stringed instrument, resounded as if vibrated by a violin bow. The sledge slid along in the midst of a plaintively intense melody.\n“Those chords give the fifth and the octave,” said Mr. Fogg.\nThese were the only words he uttered during the journey. Aouda, cosily packed in furs and cloaks, was sheltered as much as possible from the attacks of the freezing wind. As for Passepartout, his face was as red as the sun’s disc when it sets in the mist, and he laboriously inhaled the biting air. With his natural buoyancy of spirits, he began to hope again. They would reach New York on the evening, if not on the morning, of the 11th, and there were still some chances that it would be before the steamer sailed for Liverpool.\nPassepartout even felt a strong desire to grasp his ally, Fix, by the hand. He remembered that it was the detective who procured the sledge, the only means of reaching Omaha in time; but, checked by some presentiment, he kept his usual reserve. One thing, however, Passepartout would never forget, and that was the sacrifice which Mr. Fogg had made, without hesitation, to rescue him from the Sioux. Mr. Fogg had risked his fortune and his life. No! His servant would never forget that!\nWhile each of the party was absorbed in reflections so different, the sledge flew past over the vast carpet of snow. The creeks it passed over were not perceived. Fields and streams disappeared under the uniform whiteness. The plain was absolutely deserted. Between the Union Pacific road and the branch which unites Kearney with Saint Joseph it formed a great uninhabited island. Neither village, station, nor fort appeared. From time to time they sped by some phantom-like tree, whose white skeleton twisted and rattled in the wind. Sometimes flocks of wild birds rose, or bands of gaunt, famished, ferocious prairie-wolves ran howling after the sledge. Passepartout, revolver in hand, held himself ready to fire on those which came too near. Had an accident then happened to the sledge, the travellers, attacked by these beasts, would have been in the most terrible danger; but it held on its even course, soon gained on the wolves, and ere long left the howling band at a safe distance behind.",

The sky above was a pale, wintry blue, with the sun hanging low on the horizon, casting long shadows across the snow.\n\nPhileas Fogg, his eyes fixed ahead, sat with his usual calm demeanor, seemingly unaffected by the cold. Beside him, Passepartout was bundled up in layers of clothing, his face barely visible beneath a thick scarf. He clutched the sides of the sledge, his eyes wide with a mixture of excitement and apprehension.\n\nThe driver, a rugged man accustomed to the harsh conditions of the prairie, urged the dogs on with sharp commands. The team of huskies, their breath visible in the frigid air, pulled the sledge with tireless energy, their paws barely making a sound on the packed snow.\n\nAs they sped across the prairie, the landscape remained unchanged, a vast, white desert with no landmarks to break the monotony. Occasionally, a lone tree or a distant hill would appear on the horizon, only to vanish again as they continued their journey.\n\nDespite the desolation, there was a stark beauty to the scene. The snow sparkled in the sunlight, and the air was crisp and clear. The travelers were alone in this frozen wilderness, with only the sound of the wind and the rhythmic panting of the dogs to accompany them.\n\nAs the hours passed, the sun began to dip lower in the sky, painting the snow in shades of pink and gold. The temperature dropped further, and Passepartout shivered despite his layers of clothing. He glanced at Mr. Fogg, who remained as composed as ever, his eyes scanning the horizon for any sign of their destination.\n\nThe journey across the prairie was a test of endurance, both for the travelers and the dogs. The sledge seemed to fly over the snow, but the cold was relentless, seeping into their bones and sapping their strength. Yet, there was no turning back. They were committed to their course, driven by the urgency of their mission.\n\nAs night fell, the sky turned a deep indigo, and stars began to appear, twinkling like diamonds in the cold, clear air. The moon rose, casting a silvery light over the snow, and the prairie took on an ethereal quality, as if they were traveling through a dream.\n\nFinally, after what seemed like an eternity, a faint glow appeared on the horizon. It was the lights of a distant settlement, a beacon of warmth and civilization in the frozen wilderness. The sight renewed their spirits, and the dogs, sensing the end of their journey, quickened their pace.\n\nWith a final burst of speed, the sledge raced towards the lights, the travelers huddled together against the cold. As they approached the settlement, the sounds of life reached their ears, a welcome contrast to the silence of the prairie.\n\nThey had crossed the vast, frozen expanse, and now, at last, they were nearing their destination, one step closer to completing their incredible journey around the world in eighty days.",

The road, which was marked out by the stakes, was perfectly straight and shorter than the winding railway line which followed the capricious windings of the Platte River. The sledge, carried forward by an irresistible force, was moving at a speed of forty miles an hour. If nothing breaks, said Mudge, we shall get there! Mr. Fogg had made it a point to take the shortest route, and now that the wind was blowing strongly, he was confident of reaching New York in time. The wind was so strong that the metal lashings of the mast vibrated like the strings of a musical instrument, and Mr. Fogg remarked on the musical notes they produced. Aouda, wrapped in her furs, was sheltered from the wind, while Passepartout, with his face reddened by the cold, was beginning to feel hopeful. He was grateful to Fix for having procured the sledge, though he still harbored suspicions about the detective. As the sledge sped across the snow-covered landscape, they passed ghostly trees and encountered wildlife, including birds and howling prairie wolves. Passepartout, ever vigilant, prepared his revolver as the wolves approached, but the sledge, driven by the strong wind, outpaced them, leaving the danger behind."

For those coming from the west, it marks the end of their long trek across the continent, a place where they can finally rest and recuperate before continuing their travels eastward.\n\nThe significance of Omaha and the Pacific Railroad in \"Around the World in Eighty Days\" highlights the transformative power of transportation and the ways in which it reshaped the world during the 19th century.

Going in ballast.\" \"Have you any passengers?\" \"No passengers. Never have passengers. Too much in the way.\" \"Is your vessel a swift one?\" \"Between eleven and twelve knots. The Henrietta, well known.\" \"Will you carry me and three other persons to Liverpool?\" \"To Liverpool? Why not to China?\" \"I said Liverpool.\" \"No!\" \"No?\" \"No. I am setting out for Bordeaux, and shall go to Bordeaux.\" \"Money is no object?\" \"None.\" The captain spoke in a tone which did not admit of a reply. \"But the owners of the Henrietta—\" resumed Phileas Fogg. \"The owners are myself,\" replied the captain. \"The vessel belongs to me.\" \"I will freight it for you.\" \"No.\" \"I will buy it of you.\" \"No.\" Phileas Fogg did not betray the least disappointment; but the situation was a grave one. It was not at New York as at Hong Kong, nor with the captain of the Henrietta as with the captain of the Tankadere. Up to this time money had smoothed away every obstacle. Now money failed. Still, some means must be found to cross the Atlantic on a boat, unless by balloon—which would have been venturesome, besides not being capable of being put in practice. It seemed that Phileas Fogg had an idea, for he said to the captain, \"Well, will you carry me to Bordeaux?\" \"No, not if you paid me two hundred dollars.\" \"I offer you two thousand.\" \"Apiece?\" \"Apiece.\" \"And there are four of you?\" \"Four.\" Captain Speedy began to scratch his head. There were eight thousand dollars to gain, without changing his route; for which it was well worth conquering the repugnance he had for all kinds of passengers. Besides, passengers at two thousand dollars are no longer passengers, but valuable merchandise. \"I start at nine o’clock,\" said Captain Speedy, simply. \"Are you and your party ready?\" \"We will be on board at nine o’clock,\" replied, no less simply, Mr. Fogg. It was half-past eight. To disembark from the Henrietta, jump into a hack, hurry to the St. Nicholas, and return with Aouda, Passepartout, and even the inseparable Fix, was the work of a brief time, and was performed by Mr. Fogg with the coolness which never abandoned him. They were on board when the Henrietta made ready to weigh anchor."

Mr. Fogg, in order not to deviate from his course, furled his sails and increased the force of the steam; but the vessel’s speed slackened, owing to the state of the sea, the long waves of which broke against the stern. She pitched violently, and this retarded her progress.

But Phileas Fogg was a bold mariner, and knew how to maintain headway against the sea; and he kept on his course, without even decreasing his steam. The “Henrietta,” when she could not rise upon the waves, crossed them, swamping her deck, but passing safely. Sometimes the screw rose out of the water, beating its protruding end, when a mountain of water raised the stern above the waves; but the craft always kept straight ahead.\nThe wind, however, did not grow as boisterous as might have been feared; it was not one of those tempests which burst, and rush on with a speed of ninety miles an hour.

The wind, too, had shifted to the south-east, which was a bad direction for the Henrietta. She had to beat against it; and, unfortunately, the steam was not as powerful as the sails. The vessel pitched violently, and this retarded her progress. The storm burst upon her at last. It was a tempest, the wind blew a gale, and the waves rose mountains high. Passepartout was seized with a mortal terror, and clasped his hands, and prayed to Heaven. He was in the habit of praying, sometimes, in the most desperate cases. But Phileas Fogg, with a perfect coolness and composure, kept the Henrietta to the wind, allowing her to drift a little with the force of the waves. A few sails were hoisted, and under the pressure of the wind, the steamer made rapid progress along the coast. The storm, however, did not last long, and the Henrietta resumed her course, so that on the 18th she was within three hundred miles of Liverpool.

Nevertheless he seemed to have decided upon one, for that evening he sent for the engineer, and said to him, “Feed all the fires until the coal is exhausted.”\nA few moments after, the funnel of the “Henrietta” vomited forth torrents of smoke. The vessel continued to proceed with all steam on; but on the 18th, the engineer, as he had predicted, announced that the coal would give out in the course of the day.\n“Do not let the fires go down,” replied Mr. Fogg. “Keep them up to the last. Let the valves be filled.”\nTowards noon Phileas Fogg, having ascertained their position, called Passepartout, and ordered him to go for Captain Speedy. It was as if the honest fellow had been commanded to unchain a tiger. He went to the poop, saying to himself, “He will be like a madman!”\nIn a few moments, with cries and oaths, a bomb appeared on the poop-deck. The bomb was Captain Speedy. It was clear that he was on the point of bursting. “Where are we?” were the first words his anger permitted him to utter. Had the poor man been an apoplectic, he could never have recovered from his paroxysm of wrath.\n“Where are we?” he repeated, with purple face.\n“Seven hundred and seven miles from Liverpool,” replied Mr. Fogg, with imperturbable calmness.\n“Pirate!” cried Captain Speedy.\n“I have sent for you, sir—”\n“Pickaroon!”\n“—sir,” continued Mr. Fogg, “to ask you to sell me your vessel.”\n“No! By all the devils, no!”\n“But I shall be obliged to burn her.”\n“Burn the ‘Henrietta’!”\n“Yes; at least the upper part of her. The coal has given out.”\n“Burn my vessel!” cried Captain Speedy, who could scarcely pronounce the words. “A vessel worth fifty thousand dollars!”\n“Here are sixty thousand,” replied Phileas Fogg, handing the captain a roll of bank-bills. This had a prodigious effect on Andrew Speedy. An American can scarcely remain unmoved at the sight of sixty thousand dollars. The captain forgot in an instant his anger, his imprisonment, and all his grudges against his passenger. The “Henrietta” was twenty years old; it was a great bargain. The bomb would not go off after all. Mr. Fogg had taken away the match.\n“And I shall still have the iron hull,” said the captain in a softer tone.\n“The iron hull and the engine. Is it agreed?”\n“Agreed.”\nAnd Andrew Speedy, seizing the banknotes, counted them and consigned them to his pocket.\nDuring this colloquy, Passepartout was as white as a sheet, and Fix seemed on the point of having an apoplectic fit. Nearly twenty thousand pounds had been expended, and Fogg left the hull and engine to the captain, that is, near the whole value of the craft!

Nevertheless, he seemed to have decided upon one, for that evening he sent for the engineer, and said to him: \"Feed all the fires until the coal is exhausted.\" A few moments after, the funnel of the Henrietta vomited forth torrents of smoke. The vessel continued its course, at full speed, during the whole day. The next morning, the 18th of December, the engineer, as he had predicted, announced that the coal would give out in the course of the day. \"Very well,\" replied Mr. Fogg. \"Keep up the fires to the last. Let the valves be filled.\" Towards noon Phileas Fogg, having ascertained their position, called Passepartout, and ordered him to go for Captain Speedy. It was as if the honest fellow had been commanded to unchain a tiger, and he went to the captain, saying, \"Please, sir, come to Mr. Fogg.\" But the captain had sworn not to set foot on the deck. \"And if your master comes to me,\" said he, \"I'll smash his nose.\" \"Passepartout,\" said Mr. Fogg, \"if you don't go, I'll smash your nose.\" This was a hard blow for Passepartout, who tried to make it easy for the captain. \"Captain,\" he said, \"come, please, come.\" \"No!\" replied the captain. \"I won't come.\" \"Then I shall be obliged to burn your ship,\" said Mr. Fogg. \"Burn my ship!\" cried Captain Speedy. \"Yes,\" replied Fogg. \"The coal has given out, and I must burn the ship to reach Liverpool.\" \"A ship worth fifty thousand dollars!\" \"Here are sixty thousand,\" replied Phileas Fogg, handing the captain a roll of bank-bills. This had a prodigious effect on Andrew Speedy. He seized the money, and, without further word, went below, and began to work at the fires. The Henrietta was now only a piece of iron, and the captain and engineer were working at the fires with a will. Passepartout was amazed, and Fix was stupefied. The banknotes were burning in the furnace, and the ship was moving on."

Having arrived at Liverpool at twenty minutes before twelve on the 21st of December, he had till a quarter before nine that evening to reach the Reform Club, that is, nine hours and a quarter; the journey from Liverpool to London was six hours.\nIf anyone, at this moment, had entered the Custom House, he would have found Mr. Fogg seated, motionless, calm, and without apparent anger, upon a wooden bench. He was not, it is true, resigned; but this last blow failed to force him into an outward betrayal of any emotion. Was he being devoured by one of those secret rages, all the more terrible because contained, and which only burst forth, with an irresistible force, at the last moment? No one could tell. There he sat, calmly waiting—for what? Did he still cherish hope? Did he still believe, now that the door of this prison was closed upon him, that he would succeed?\nHowever that may have been, Mr. Fogg carefully put his watch upon the table, and observed its advancing hands. Not a word escaped his lips, but his look was singularly set and stern. The situation, in any event, was a terrible one, and might be thus stated: if Phileas Fogg was honest he was ruined; if he was a knave, he was caught.\nDid escape occur to him? Did he examine to see if there were any practicable outlet from his prison? Did he think of escaping from it? Possibly; for once he walked slowly around the room. But the door was locked, and the window heavily barred with iron rods. He sat down again, and drew his journal from his pocket.

He had wagered half of his fortune that he could circumnavigate the globe in just eighty days, a feat that seemed impossible to many. Yet, with each passing day, Fogg had defied the odds, overcoming obstacles and delays with a calm determination that inspired admiration and envy in equal measure.\n\nBut now, as he stood on the brink of success, disaster had struck. The loss of his fortune was not just a financial blow; it was a personal defeat, a shattering of the meticulous plans he had laid out with such precision. The journey had been fraught with challenges: missed connections, natural disasters, and even the relentless pursuit of Detective Fix, who had mistakenly believed Fogg to be a bank robber.\n\nDespite these setbacks, Fogg had pressed on, driven by a sense of honor and a desire to prove himself. He had traversed continents, crossed oceans, and braved the unknown, all in the name of a wager that had become much more than a simple bet. It was a testament to human ingenuity and perseverance, a journey that had captured the imagination of the world.\n\nAnd now, at the very moment of triumph, it seemed that fate had dealt him a cruel hand. The gentleman who had risked everything was on the verge of losing it all, and the world watched with bated breath to see what would happen next.",

His friends no longer expected him there. As Phileas Fogg had not appeared in the saloon on the evening before (Saturday, the 21st of December, at a quarter before nine), he had lost his wager. It was not even necessary that he should go to his bankers for the twenty thousand pounds; for his antagonists already had his cheque in their hands, and they had only to fill it out and send it to the Barings to have the amount transferred to their credit.\nMr. Fogg, therefore, had no reason for going out, and so he remained at home. He shut himself up in his room, and busied himself putting his affairs in order. Passepartout continually ascended and descended the stairs. The hours were long for him. He listened at his master’s door, and looked through the keyhole, as if he had a perfect right so to do, and as if he feared that something terrible might happen at any moment. Sometimes he thought of Fix, but no longer in anger. Fix, like all the world, had been mistaken in Phileas Fogg, and had only done his duty in tracking and arresting him; while he, Passepartout. . . . This thought haunted him, and he never ceased cursing his miserable folly.\nFinding himself too wretched to remain alone, he knocked at Aouda’s door, went into her room, seated himself, without speaking, in a corner, and looked ruefully at the young woman.

The ceremony was held in a quaint chapel, adorned with beautiful flowers and filled with the sweet sound of music. As the couple exchanged vows, there was not a dry eye in the room. The reception that followed was a lively celebration, with laughter, dancing, and toasts to the newlyweds' future.

Had he not saved her, and was he not entitled to this honor? The marriage was solemnized at the church of the parish of Marylebone, and certainly, it was a fine wedding. The bride was charming in her bridal costume, and the bridegroom was as happy as if he had won a fortune. Indeed, he had won one! He had gained the heart of a charming woman, who, strange as it may appear, had been made the happiest of women by him. As for Passepartout, he was the happiest of men! All the time he laughed in his sleeve at his success. He had taken his master to the very end of the world, and now he was bringing him back to the domestic hearth, which Phileas Fogg had left to accomplish this journey around the world. But on the day of the wedding, Passepartout was not the only one who was happy. Mrs. Aouda was radiant, and Phileas Fogg was the happiest of men!\""
