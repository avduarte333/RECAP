He was a gentleman of the most exact and methodical habits, one who performed his daily routine with a clockwork precision that astonished all who observed him. Though possessed of considerable wealth, the source of which was a mystery even to his most intimate associates (of which he had none), he lived a life devoid of ostentation or excess. He breakfasted at exactly 8:23 AM, dressed, and then walked to the Reform Club, where he spent the remainder of his day engaged in reading newspapers and playing whist, returning home at midnight. No one knew where Phileas Fogg had come from, or how he had made his fortune. He was a member of the Reform Club, certainly, and that was proof enough for many of his respectability, but beyond that, he was a cipher. He was a solitary man, who seemed to have no family, no friends, and no connections beyond the four walls of the club and his quiet house in Saville Row. He was not known to travel, indeed, he was a man who seemed utterly rooted to London, his life a perfect circle within its confines. He required nothing from the outside world except the punctual delivery of his newspapers and the correct serving of his meals. His life was a model of regularity, a testament to his unwavering adherence to routine, a stark contrast to the unpredictable adventure that awaited him. His existence was so perfectly ordered, so entirely predictable, that the very idea of him embarking on a spontaneous journey was almost ludicrous to contemplate. Yet, this was the man who would soon stake his entire fortune on circling the globe in eighty days."

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- In the early part, the completion omits the detail about cheques being paid \"at sight from his account current,\" which is a specific financial process mentioned in the original.\n- In the middle, the completion lacks the explicit mention that Phileas Fogg was neither lavish nor avaricious, instead using different terms that do not fully capture the nuance of his financial behavior.\n- The completion does not include the observation that \"he talked very little, and seemed all the more mysterious for his taciturn manner,\" which is a key characterization detail.\n- The passage about his daily habits being \"quite open to observation\" and the effect this had on the curious is condensed, missing the idea that the regularity itself was what puzzled observers.\n- The completion omits the specific mention that \"there was no spot so secluded that he did not appear to have an intimate acquaintance with it,\" which emphasizes the breadth of Fogg's knowledge.\n- The detail that \"he must have travelled everywhere, at least in the spirit\" is present, but the lead-up to this idea is less developed than in the original.\n- The statement that \"it was at least certain that Phileas Fogg had not absented himself from London for many years\" is condensed, and the nuance about those with a better acquaintance is not fully captured.\n- The completion does not mention that \"nobody could pretend to have ever seen him anywhere else,\" which is a subtle but important point about his mysteriousness.\n- The description of whist as a \"silent one, harmonised with his nature\" is simplified, and the idea that his winnings \"never went into his purse, being reserved as a fund for his charities\" is present but less precisely stated.\n- The final characterization of whist as a \"motionless, unwearying struggle, congenial to his tastes\" is partially present but lacks the full descriptive nuance of the original.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion inaccurately describes Fogg as not \"extravagant\" or \"parsimonious,\" which are not the exact qualities discussed in the original and may shift the nuance of his character.\n- The sequence of observations about his habits and the effect on observers is altered, with some details about the regularity and its impact on curiosity being rearranged or condensed.\n- The completion attributes a \"kind of second sight\" to Fogg earlier than in the original, and the explanation of how he corrects others is less precise.\n- The description of whist as \"without the grand movement and without the noise\" is an addition not present in the original, introducing a comparison that was not made.\n- The completion sometimes generalizes or simplifies the original's more specific observations, which can reduce the depth of characterization and the sense of mystery surrounding Fogg."

            "prefix-probing": "The way in which he got admission to this exclusive club was simple enough. Phileas Fogg was not a man who sought recognition or made efforts to impress; indeed, his life was a testament to rigid regularity and absolute privacy. He appeared, one might say, out of nowhere, and settled into the club's routine with the precision of a finely tuned automaton. There were no references sought, no lengthy discussions of his background or merits. He simply began to frequent the establishment. His punctuality was legendary; he arrived and departed at precisely the same hours each day. He occupied the same armchair, read the same newspapers in the same order, took his meals at the same table, and played whist with the same partners at the same time. He spoke little, disturbed no one, and paid his dues promptly. This unwavering adherence to habit, this perfect predictability, was so absolute that it became, paradoxically, his most striking characteristic. The members, accustomed to the formal rituals of introduction and sponsorship, found themselves confronted with a man who seemed to exist outside such conventions. His very regularity became his credentials. No one knew him, yet everyone saw him. He was, in effect, vetted not by references or reputation, but by his own clockwork existence. He was perceived as a man of means, though his source of wealth was as mysterious as everything else about him. He lived simply, without ostentation, yet his pockets never seemed empty. His attire was impeccable, his manner reserved but never discourteous. He did not mingle in the usual social sense; his interactions were limited almost exclusively to his whist partners, and even then, the conversation rarely strayed beyond the game itself. Over time, his silent, systematic presence became an integral part of the club's atmosphere. He was simply Phileas Fogg, the man who was always there, always on time, always doing exactly what he had done the day before. His acceptance was not voted upon; it was simply a fact that seemed to have established itself through sheer force of habit. His admission was less a process of being let in and more a process of having been there all along, unnoticed yet undeniably present, until his presence became so regular it could no longer be questioned or ignored. He slid into membership through the sheer frictionless perfection of his routine, a silent, precise inclusion that required no words, no sponsors, no fuss. He was simply there, one day, and remained there, day after day, year after year, a permanent, unmoving fixture in the transient world of London society and the Reform Club's hallowed halls."

He never used the cosy chambers which the Reform provides for its favoured members. He passed ten hours out of the twenty-four in Saville Row, either in sleeping or making his toilet.

When he breakfasted or dined all the resources of the club—its kitchens and pantries, its buttery and dairy—aided to crowd his table with their most succulent stores; he was served by the gravest waiters, in dress coats, and shoes with swan-skin soles, who proffered the viands in special porcelain, and on the finest linen; club decanters, of a lost mould, contained his sherry, his port, and his cinnamon-spiced claret; while his beverages were refreshingly cooled with ice, brought at great cost from the American lakes.\nIf to live in this style is to be eccentric, it must be confessed that there is something good in eccentricity.\nThe mansion in Saville Row, though not sumptuous, was exceedingly comfortable.

Phileas Fogg lived alone in his house on Saville Row, and no one called upon him—unless it was to do business. He permitted no one to cross his threshold, and was served by a single domestic whom he had chosen at his will, and who came to him at eleven o’clock in the morning and went out at the stroke of midnight, preparing his master’s toilet and clothes, ministering at breakfast and dinner, looking after the six things necessary to the comfortable gentleman: neatness, regularity, and punctuality, and absolute freedom from disturbance.  Phileas Fogg was a member of the Reform Club, and no other. If anyone was surprised at this, they did not show it. He did not belong to any society, nor did he frequent any public places. He played whist, and that was all. Four of his friends, who were as absorbed in whist as himself, lunched with him every day at the Reform, in a private room, from one to a quarter to two; then they played, and returned to their homes at ten minutes past two. They did not talk of business, nor of politics, nor of any other worldly affairs. They talked of nothing but cards, and always of the chances of the game, of the fine points and strategies.  It is unnecessary to state that Mr. Fogg was not a man of sentiment. He was a man of action, and a man of precision. He never went to the theatre, nor to concerts, nor to lectures. He did not read, except the paper. He did not travel, for it bothered him. He did not care for anything but the game of whist, which was, it is true, a silent occupation, but which suited him perfectly."

            "prefix-probing": "A rap at this moment sounded on the door of the cosy apartment where Phileas Fogg was seated, and James Forster, the dismissed servant, appeared. James Forster, with a hesitant air and twisting his cap, stood framed in the doorway. Mr. Fogg, perfectly composed in his armchair, did not betray the slightest surprise at seeing his former domestic. He merely raised his eyes from the 'Daily Telegraph' he was perusing and fixed them mildly upon the man, his expression one of calm indifference. Forster cleared his throat awkwardly. \"Begging your pardon, sir,\" he began, his voice a little shaky, \"but I heard...\" Mr. Fogg interrupted, his voice even and without inflection, cutting through Forster's uncertainty. \"You are no longer in my service, Forster. There is therefore no reason for you to report anything or to seek my permission.\" \"Yes, sir, I understand,\" Forster stammered, feeling dismissed all over again. \"It's just... well, the news around the club, sir. About the... the journey.\" The sheer scale of the rumour seemed impossible, yet here was the man himself. Mr. Fogg's gaze remained steady, cool and probing. \"And what news have you heard, Forster?\" \"That you are leaving, sir. For eighty days,\" Forster blurted out, unable to contain his astonishment. His dismissal for a mere two-degree temperature difference now seemed utterly trivial compared to this undertaking – a journey that defied all conventional notions of travel. He perhaps harboured a faint hope that Mr. Fogg might need his services for such a grand tour, or perhaps he was simply driven by overwhelming curiosity. \"That is correct,\" Mr. Fogg replied, folding his newspaper with meticulous precision, his movements never rushed. \"I am departing this evening.\" Forster looked utterly bewildered. \"This evening, sir? And... and the house, sir? Who will look after things?\" The questions tumbled out of him, born of confusion. \"Arrangements have been made,\" Mr. Fogg stated, his tone final. \"A new servant has been engaged. He is expected momentarily.\" Forster's face fell further. The faint, irrational hope vanished completely. He lingered awkwardly, unsure what else to say to the man who was embarking on such an incredible feat. Mr. Fogg offered no further comment, his attention seemingly already miles away, calculating routes, steaming distances, and predicting weather patterns. The silence hung heavy, broken only by the precise ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece, a clock that would soon become a critical instrument in Fogg's extraordinary, time-bound undertaking. Forster, realising the finality of the situation and feeling the cold politeness of Mr. Fogg's dismissal, began to back out of the room. \"Very good, sir,\" he mumbled, feeling foolish for having intruded. \"I... I wish you a safe journey then, sir.\" Mr. Fogg gave a slight, almost imperceptible inclination of his head, already reaching for a travel guide on his table, his mind clearly elsewhere. As Forster closed the door softly behind him, the apartment returned to its state of absolute order and calm, a calm that belied the immense adventure about to begin across continents and oceans. The arrival of the new servant was now imminent, the servant whose destiny would become inextricably linked with that of the precise, enigmatic, and daring Phileas Fogg."

He appeared to be a man about forty years of age, with fine, handsome features, and a tall, well-shaped figure; his hair and whiskers were light, his forehead compact and unwrinkled, his face rather pale, his teeth magnificent. His countenance possessed in the highest degree what physiognomists call “repose in action,” a quality of those who act rather than talk. Calm and phlegmatic, with a clear eye, Mr. Fogg seemed a perfect type of that English composure which Angelica Kauffmann has so skilfully represented on canvas. Seen in the various phases of his daily life, he gave the idea of being perfectly well-balanced, as exactly regulated as a Leroy chronometer. Phileas Fogg was, indeed, exactitude personified, and this was betrayed even in the expression of his very hands and feet; for in men, as well as in animals, the limbs themselves are expressive of the passions.\nHe was so exact that he was never in a hurry, was always ready, and was economical alike of his steps and his motions. He never took one step too many, and always went to his destination by the shortest cut; he made no superfluous gestures, and was never seen to be moved or agitated.

He never took a superfluous step, and always came back by the shortest way. He did not use words, for he needed none; and as for gestures, his arm and his hand never moved without a reason. He was the man least hasty in the world, yet always reached his destination at the exact time. He lived alone in his house in Savile Row, which was a model of method and cleanliness. Every hour, every minute had its use. Fogg's day was regulated like a chronometer. He breakfasted at exactly eight o'clock, and after reading the Times and the Standard, he went to the Reform Club, where he remained till half-past six, playing whist. He dined there, and returned home at midnight precisely, only to go to bed. Passepartout, after a life of singing, dancing, and athleticism, sought repose, a quiet life in service to an English gentleman. He had heard of the far-famed English phlegm, but this surpassed everything. His astonishment only increased when he learned the fate of the previous valet, dismissed because the shaving water, delivered at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, was discovered to be only 84 degrees, two degrees below the prescribed temperature! Passepartout felt a peculiar mixture of awe and apprehension entering this meticulously ordered, silent abode."

Since he had abandoned his own country for England, taking service as a valet, he had in vain searched for a master after his own heart. Passepartout was by no means one of those pert dunces depicted by Molière with a bold gaze and a nose held high in the air; he was an honest fellow, with a pleasant face, lips a trifle protruding, soft-mannered and serviceable, with a good round head, such as one likes to see on the shoulders of a friend. His eyes were blue, his complexion rubicund, his figure almost portly and well-built, his body muscular, and his physical powers fully developed by the exercises of his younger days. His brown hair was somewhat tumbled; for, while the ancient sculptors are said to have known eighteen methods of arranging Minerva’s tresses, Passepartout was familiar with but one of dressing his own: three strokes of a large-tooth comb completed his toilet.\nIt would be rash to predict how Passepartout’s lively nature would agree with Mr. Fogg. It was impossible to tell whether the new servant would turn out as absolutely methodical as his master required; experience alone could solve the question. Passepartout had been a sort of vagrant in his early years, and now yearned for repose; but so far he had failed to find it, though he had already served in ten English houses. But he could not take root in any of these; with chagrin, he found his masters invariably whimsical and irregular, constantly running about the country, or on the look-out for adventure. His last master, young Lord Longferry, Member of Parliament, after passing his nights in the Haymarket taverns, was too often brought home in the morning on policemen’s shoulders. Passepartout, desirous of respecting the gentleman whom he served, ventured a mild remonstrance on such conduct; which, being ill-received, he took his leave. Hearing that Mr. Phileas Fogg was looking for a servant, and that his life was one of unbroken regularity, that he neither travelled nor stayed from home overnight, he felt sure that this would be the place he was after. He presented himself, and was accepted, as has been seen.",

As for Passepartout, he was a genuine Parisian of Paris. For five years he had been a valet de chambre in England, and, scorning the title of valet, he called himself a \"man-of-all-work.\" Passepartout was an honest fellow, with a pleasant face, lips a trifle too red, signifying a perpetual grand appetite, ready to lend a hand to any business, and uncommonly strong and well-shaped. He had a fine, open, honest countenance, a slightly bald head, and a round, good-humoured face; his body was stout and robust, his self-esteem, so say the least, considerable. Passepartout, in short, was one of those good fellows who run about the world without ever finding rest—vagrants, it may be, but never rogues. He had served in Paris as a fireman, and had been highly recommended. Passepartout was an admirable gymnast, and had often shown his agility in the public gardens of Paris. He had also been a professional musician, and a good one too. Having wandered a great deal, he sought to settle down; and having heard that the English were of all people the most regular, he had taken service with an Englishman. But in England, Passepartout had been more a rolling stone than ever. He had had ten masters, and every one of them had been more eccentric than the others. He had left them all.

As a consequence, he was rarely seen, and if he was, it was only to perform some act which his rigidly scheduled life required. He was not known to have friends, or relatives, or any close connection with another human being. His house, in Savile Row, was a model of spick-and-span neatness; its internal regulation seemed as perfect as the movements of a chronometer. Indeed, Phileas Fogg himself might have been mistaken for a highly perfected automaton. His hours were strictly portioned out. He rose at precisely eight o'clock; he breakfasted at exactly eight o'clock and thirty-seven minutes; he shaved at nine o'clock and thirty-seven minutes; he dressed at ten o'clock and twenty minutes; he left his house for the Reform Club at half-past eleven, to the minute. He dined there invariably at a quarter before seven. At midnight precisely, he returned home, and at twelve minutes past midnight, he was in bed. His daily journey to the Reform Club was performed without fail, without haste, and without deviation. He always walked the same number of steps, took the same turnings, passed the same landmarks, arrived at the same second. He was, in a word, the essence of regularity and precision. He never indulged in unnecessary conversation, never lingered, never showed surprise or excitement. His face, handsome and calm, betrayed no emotion. His movements were few, measured, and exact. He read the papers at the Club from half-past eleven till noon, then played whist with a small, select group of partners and adversaries until dinner. After dinner, he returned to the whist-room, where he continued playing till midnight. He rarely lost, for he played scientifically, without enthusiasm, and without error. He was rich, though no one knew from what source his riches came. He spent little, but was not mean; he gave largely to charities, but anonymously. He seemed to live only for himself, avoiding all contact that might introduce the slightest unpredictability or delay into the faultless mechanism of his existence. It was this very need for flawless precision that had recently led him to dismiss his valet, James Forster, for the grave offence of bringing him shaving water two degrees too cold."

There were no less than three hundred shirts and entire suits, and the same proportion of boots and shoes. It was true that the legendary Sheridan, celebrated for his varied talents, but above all for his disorder, had been the owner of this house; but the mansion had since been improved, and the new occupant was a man of the strictest method and neatness. The chimney-piece of the principal salon was adorned by a clock, with an electric indicator that communicated the hours to either a clock in Mr. Fogg’s bedroom or a dial in the porter’s lodge. In the dressing-room were found a number of necessaries of travel, though not ostentatious, such as never exist in the houses of stay-at-homes. Mr. Fogg had no books, and did not avail himself of the libraries of London, which he found overcrowded; for two books in particular, “Bradshaw’s Continental Railway Steam Transit and General Guide,” and the “Official Guide of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company,” sufficed him. He had, in effect, a large collection of maps and plans, and possessed also a chronometer which indicated the seconds as well as the minutes and hours; for, with him, minutes were precious. There was no end to the ingenious appliances therein, and the house was perfect in its comfort and method. There was not a sign of disorder, not a speck of dust, not a thing out of place; all was as regular and orderly as a mathematical problem. Passepartout examined the several rooms, and felt that he could not but be satisfied with his master’s impeccably clean and tidy habits. A sturdy, solid safe, large enough to hold a good many bank-notes, was built into the wall, and was so ingeniously concealed as to be invisible; while a simple push of a spring caused it to open as if by magic. There were no firearms nor hunting weapons of any kind. Passepartout found nothing but tools for peaceful pursuits, such as a collection of scissors, gum-bottles, and paste-pots, and other implements for the repair of clothing, which was a very proper and becoming thing in the house of so estimable a gentleman. Passepartout's reflection upon it all was highly satisfactory. “This is a first-rate fellow,” said he to himself, “and we shall get along together. Mr. Fogg, thought he, is a man of system, a regular automaton; he is not given to walking, nor to hunting, nor to fishing, nor to anything which can take him out of the house. He will probably not want to take any journeys either. So much the better for me, who have not left Paris for the past five years, and have not known what it is to stretch my legs. We shall be as quiet here as in a convent, and as regular as the hands of a clock. Ah, what a good choice I have made, and how glad I am to have fallen in with this excellent Mr. Fogg!

Yet, when packing for his circumnavigation, preparations were minimal. His manservant, Passepartout, expecting trunks for a journey through varied climates, was astonished by the single valise Fogg presented. Inside, only a travelling cloak, changes of linen, toiletries – not even an umbrella! This simplicity reflected Fogg’s character: pragmatic, unconcerned with superfluity, focused solely on essentials for his objective. He calculated precisely what he needed, eliminating anything impeding rapid progress. Passepartout, accustomed to elaborate rituals, could scarcely believe the collection. It seemed insufficient for a journey around the world. But Fogg, calm and logical, deemed this sparse selection adequate. His logic dictated efficiency, even regarding personal effects. This approach set the tone for the adventure, highlighting Fogg’s unique nature. His wardrobe, limited, was perfectly chosen: practical, unobtrusive, fit for purpose in his race against time."

It was always the same dinner, consisting of four dishes, with condiments, exquisitely prepared. He ate it with admirable method and regularity, accompanied by sherry and port. Thence he proceeded to the great salon, a sumptuous apartment adorned with pictures, where he was soon surrounded by his usual companions. His companions were gentlemen of importance and wealth from the highest circles of London society. Among them were Andrew Stuart, a civil engineer; John Sullivan and Samuel Fallentin, bankers; Thomas Flanagan, a brewer; and Gauthier Ralph, one of the directors of the Bank of England. They were discussing the robbery of fifty-five thousand pounds which had just been committed three days before at the Bank. The newspapers, particularly the Daily Telegraph, were full of it. The police, it was said, were at fault. Detectives sent by Gauthier Ralph to various ports in Europe and America were finding no trace of the thief. Fogg listened silently for a moment, then joined the conversation. The discussion soon turned to the impossibility of apprehending the robber if he left the country quickly. Stuart argued that the world was too vast. Fogg, however, coolly asserted that with modern infrastructure, the world had become smaller, and travel was faster than ever. This assertion led directly to the discussion of a circumnavigation and the famous wager that would change Phileas Fogg's life and set him on his extraordinary journey."

          "text_segment": "“Well, Ralph,” said Thomas Flanagan, “what about that robbery?”\n“Oh,” replied Stuart, “the Bank will lose the money.”\n“On the contrary,” broke in Ralph, “I hope we may put our hands on the robber. Skilful detectives have been sent to all the principal ports of America and the Continent, and he’ll be a clever fellow if he slips through their fingers.”\n“But have you got the robber’s description?” asked Stuart.\n“In the first place, he is no robber at all,” returned Ralph, positively.\n“What! a fellow who makes off with fifty-five thousand pounds, no robber?”\n“No.”\n“Perhaps he’s a manufacturer, then.”\n“The Daily Telegraph says that he is a gentleman.”\nIt was Phileas Fogg, whose head now emerged from behind his newspapers, who made this remark. He bowed to his friends, and entered into the conversation. The affair which formed its subject, and which was town talk, had occurred three days before at the Bank of England. A package of banknotes, to the value of fifty-five thousand pounds, had been taken from the principal cashier’s table, that functionary being at the moment engaged in registering the receipt of three shillings and sixpence. Of course, he could not have his eyes everywhere. Let it be observed that the Bank of England reposes a touching confidence in the honesty of the public. There are neither guards nor gratings to protect its treasures; gold, silver, banknotes are freely exposed, at the mercy of the first comer. A keen observer of English customs relates that, being in one of the rooms of the Bank one day, he had the curiosity to examine a gold ingot weighing some seven or eight pounds. He took it up, scrutinised it, passed it to his neighbour, he to the next man, and so on until the ingot, going from hand to hand, was transferred to the end of a dark entry; nor did it return to its place for half an hour. Meanwhile, the cashier had not so much as raised his head. But in the present instance things had not gone so smoothly. The package of notes not being found when five o’clock sounded from the ponderous clock in the “drawing office,” the amount was passed to the account of profit and loss. As soon as the robbery was discovered, picked detectives hastened off to Liverpool, Glasgow, Havre, Suez, Brindisi, New York, and other ports, inspired by the proffered reward of two thousand pounds, and five per cent. on the sum that might be recovered. Detectives were also charged with narrowly watching those who arrived at or left London by rail, and a judicial examination was at once entered upon.\nThere were real grounds for supposing, as the Daily Telegraph said, that the thief did not belong to a professional band. On the day of the robbery a well-dressed gentleman of polished manners, and with a well-to-do air, had been observed going to and fro in the paying room where the crime was committed. A description of him was easily procured and sent to the detectives; and some hopeful spirits, of whom Ralph was one, did not despair of his apprehension. The papers and clubs were full of the affair, and everywhere people were discussing the probabilities of a successful pursuit; and the Reform Club was especially agitated, several of its members being Bank officials.\nRalph would not concede that the work of the detectives was likely to be in vain, for he thought that the prize offered would greatly stimulate their zeal and activity.",

A package of banknotes, amounting to fifty-five thousand pounds, had been taken from the principal cashier’s table, at the Bank of England. The cashier, William Batulcar, could not tell who had taken the money. He only remembered that, three days before, a gentleman of polished manners, and distinguished appearance, had called at the Bank, ostensibly to inquire about a note of some value, but really to examine the various offices and strong-boxes, of which he had taken a plan; and that on the day of the robbery, about half-past one, he had found himself alone with this gentleman, who then disappeared.\n\nIn reality, the Bank of England does not seem to guard its money with as much care as is necessary. There are no guards, and the cash is not secured in iron safes. The Bank is constantly exposed to the honesty of the public. A person once saw a gold ingot, weighing fifty pounds, lying on the cashier’s table, in the open street, for half an hour, and nobody seemed to care. At five o’clock, when the Bank closes, the doors are opened, and the crowd pours in, and the money is removed; and this is all the security. And yet, notwithstanding this apparent want of precaution, the Bank has never lost a single pound.\n\nBut, in the present case, the theft was discovered at five o’clock, and the sum written off. At once, five thousand pounds was offered as a reward; and, besides that, five per cent. on the sum recovered. Detectives had been sent to all the principal ports, and to all the railway stations in London.

This description, added to the large reward offered, had led to the hope that the robber would be taken. The robbery was the principal topic of conversation throughout England. It was discussed in the clubs and public-houses, and in the drawing-rooms and private houses. It was especially discussed in the Reform Club; for it was a club composed of rich manufacturers, bankers, lawyers, engineers, and members of Parliament, and its members were mostly connected with the Bank of England.

            "prefix-probing": "Gauthier Ralph, one of the directors of the Bank of England, a man of considerable means and gravity, sighed deeply and adjusted his spectacles. “A most unfortunate affair, Thomas,” he replied, his voice heavy with concern. “Fifty-five thousand pounds, clean gone. Vanished into thin air, it would seem.” “Fifty-five thousand!” exclaimed Andrew Stuart, an engineer, laying aside the *Daily Telegraph*. “A tidy sum indeed! And no trace of the fellow?” “None to speak of,” said Ralph grimly. “A description, vague at best – a gentleman of good appearance, perhaps. But utterly insufficient for pursuit. He’s had ample time to make his escape.” “But where could he possibly go?” asked John Sullivan, a banker. “The ports are watched, the police are alerted throughout the country.” “The world is a vast place, Sullivan,” observed Samuel Fallentin, a rentier. “Once he is out of England, tracking him becomes like searching for a needle in a haystack. He could be anywhere – America, the Continent, even the Antipodes!” “Precisely,” agreed Ralph. “That is our chief difficulty. In times past, communication was slow, travel slower. One had a reasonable chance of intercepting a fugitive. But with railways crisscrossing Europe and steamships bridging oceans, a man can put a considerable distance between himself and his pursuers in a matter of days, if not hours.” “True,” said Stuart. “The world *was* vast, but it’s shrinking, Ralph. With the opening of the Suez Canal, the railways through India, and the American transcontinental lines, one can circle the globe faster than ever before.” “Faster, perhaps,” countered Fallentin, “but not fast enough to make such a pursuit practicable. Consider the journey. Even with all these modern marvels, one must factor in delays – transfers, weather, unforeseen incidents. A man on the run has the advantage; he knows where he is going, his pursuers do not.” The conversation continued, with each gentleman offering his opinion on the feasibility of apprehending the robber. They discussed the possible routes the fugitive might take – across the Channel, to America, perhaps even attempting a daring journey eastward through the Mediterranean. The consensus seemed to be that the chances of recovery were slim, bordering on impossible, given the speed and anonymity offered by modern travel. Phileas Fogg sat nearby, silent as ever, his eyes fixed on his newspaper. He rarely participated in these animated discussions, preferring to absorb information rather than dispense opinions. However, his attention was clearly drawn to the topic at hand. His brows, usually smooth, were ever so slightly furrowed, and the rhythmic ticking of his watch, a sound often unheard by others, seemed just a fraction louder in the quiet corner he occupied. “I maintain,” said Andrew Stuart, circling back to his point with emphasis, “that while the world is large, one could theoretically travel around it with unprecedented speed today. If one *were* attempting to escape, or simply to prove a point about the efficiency of modern transport, such a feat might be possible.” Gauthier Ralph chuckled, a dry, weary sound. “Possible? Perhaps in theory, Stuart. But in practice? The delays, the connections... you speak of days, but add them all up, factor in the unexpected, and you’ll find the sum astronomical. A journey around the world! Why, it would take months! At least three, perhaps four, even with the fastest available means.” It was at this precise moment that Phileas Fogg lowered his newspaper. His eyes, calm and clear, met the gaze of the gentlemen around him. His voice, level and precise, cut through the general murmur. “One could go around the world,” he stated simply, “in eighty days.” The gentlemen stared at him, momentarily silenced by his abrupt intervention and the audacious claim. “Eighty days?” scoffed Stuart, finding his voice. “Impossible, Fogg!” “Not impossible,” replied Mr. Fogg, “given the proposed itinerary and factoring in reliable connections. I have calculated it.” And so the stage was set. The discussion about the robber had morphed into a debate about global travel, culminating in Mr. Fogg's startling assertion. The air in the Reform Club thickened with anticipation, the fifty-five thousand pounds momentarily forgotten in the face of a challenge against time and distance. The quiet, methodical Mr. Fogg had just ignited a spark that would lead him on the most extraordinary adventure imaginable."

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The early part of the passage is missing the sequence where the characters discuss resuming their card game, including the mention of a false deal and the physical action of picking up and putting down the cards.\n- The middle section omits the reactions and interjections from the other characters, such as expressions of disbelief, annoyance, and attempts to dismiss the wager as a joke.\n- The completion does not include the specific mention of Mr. Fogg's deposit at a bank and his willingness to risk it, nor the detailed exchange about the risks of accidental delays and the concept of the unforeseen.\n- The final part lacks the solemn declaration by Mr. Fogg about the seriousness of an Englishman's wager and the precise terms of the bet, including the conversion of days to hours and minutes.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes lines and actions to the wrong characters, such as having Stuart add conditions or refer to air-circumnavigation, which does not occur in the original.\n- The time conversion in the wager is incorrect, with the wrong number of minutes given.\n- The sequence of events is altered, with the wager being proposed and accepted much more abruptly than in the original, skipping over the gradual escalation and group consultation.\n- The completion invents a requirement for each participant to put down a specific sum \"on the spot,\" which is not part of the original agreement.\n- The completion omits the original's careful build-up of tension and the interplay of skepticism and resolve among the characters."

Only, I warn you, it will be at your expense.”“The devil!” cried Stuart, who was beginning to get seriously annoyed. “This is absurd!” He took up his cards again. “Come, gentlemen, let us resume the game.”“As you please, Mr. Stuart,” replied Phileas Fogg, coolly. “But you are forgetting that you are to deal, and you have made a false deal.”Stuart threw down the cards upon the table. “Well, Mr. Fogg,” said he, “let it be a wager, then. I will wager the four thousand pounds.”“Good,” said Mr. Fogg; “a wager of four thousand pounds.”“Come, come,” said Fallentin, “this is only a joke.”“When I am serious, I never joke,” replied Stuart.“I am serious also,” said Phileas Fogg, and I will wager the twenty thousand pounds which I have deposited at Baring’s.”“Twenty thousand pounds!” cried Sullivan. “Twenty thousand pounds, which you would lose by a single delay, an unforeseen interruption!”“The unforeseen does not exist,” solemnly replied Phileas Fogg.“But, Mr. Fogg, eighty days is only the minimum of time required for the journey, by the most rapid means of conveyance!”“A minimum, if it is carefully observed, is sufficient for everything.”“But you must, in order to keep it, go from the trains upon the steamers, and from the steamers upon the trains.”“I shall go from the trains to the steamers, and from the steamers to the trains,” replied Mr. Fogg, tranquilly.“It is true,” replied Phileas Fogg, “that the unforeseen does not exist.”Stuart added, “It is true, Mr. Fogg, that you are an Englishman; but you are not serious.”“I am an Englishman,” replied Phileas Fogg, “and not serious on a wager! We will see.”Then, turning to the others, he continued: “I will wager twenty thousand pounds against any one who wishes to take it, that I will make the tour of the world in eighty days or less; in nineteen hundred and twenty hours, or the ninety-six thousand minutes, if you will.”“We will take it,” replied Stuart, Fallentin, Sullivan, Flanagan, and Ralph, after a rapid consultation.",

            "prefix-probing": "“Heaven preserve me! But I would wager four thousand pounds that such a journey, made under these conditions, is impossible.” The speaker was Ralph, a member of the Reform Club, known for his prudence. A thrill of astonishment ran through the company. Stuart, Fallentin, Sullivan, Flanagan—all exchanged glances. Was their imperturbable Fogg about to engage in a wild gamble? This quiet, reserved man, whose life was a model of regularity, proposed an exploit utterly contrary to his nature. Phileas Fogg remained perfectly still. His face showed no surprise or agitation. He looked from one to the other of his colleagues with his usual calm, clear gaze. \"Impossible, Ralph?\" he asked, in his low, even voice. \"Not at all. The earth has diminished. This journey, under the stated conditions, is possible.\" \"But the delays, Fogg!\" cried Stuart. \"You calculate nothing on delays! On unforeseen obstacles, on accidents, on breakdowns, on bad weather, on changes of conveyance, on everything, in fact, that hinders!\" Ralph added, \"Consider adhering to timetables, the uncertainty of sailings, inevitable mishaps. No man can guarantee such precision over such a vast distance and complex route. It is madness to stake money on it!\" Fogg listened patiently, fingertips together. \"All foreseen,\" he replied, his voice calm. \"I have calculated everything. Railway connections are established, steamship lines regular. If one vessel fails, another is ready. If one line closes, I find another route. The schedule is precise, and I mean to follow it rigidly. The elements themselves, while potentially disruptive, must be accounted for. I shall deal with them as they arise. The journey is possible."

Phileas Fogg had just accepted the wager: twenty thousand pounds on his ability to circumnavigate the globe in eighty days. It was a sum representing half his fortune, risked on a feat they considered utterly impossible. Yet, Mr. Fogg stood there, perfectly calm, his usual composed self, betraying no sign of the magnitude of the undertaking. Andrew Stuart, one of the party, finally spoke, his voice reflecting the general disbelief. \"You are serious, Fogg? This immense sum?\" \"Perfectly serious,\" Mr. Fogg replied, his tone level. \"I shall risk it.\" Another companion questioned the inevitable delays and obstacles. \"Breakdowns, storms, unforeseen events... how can you account for them?\" \"All contingencies are considered,\" Mr. Fogg stated simply. He consulted his watch. \"The train for Dover leaves at a quarter before nine. I shall depart this evening.\" His fellow club members were stunned. Not only had he accepted the challenge, but he was leaving tonight. \"Tonight?\" one gasped. \"Preparations?\" \"None are necessary,\" Mr. Fogg replied. \"A carpetbag and Passepartout. I shall be ready.\" With a final, brief nod, he turned and left the room, leaving behind an assembly struck silent by the audacious calm of the man about to embark on the impossible journey."

We are going to leave for Dover and Calais in ten minutes.\" A sort of grin appeared for an instant on the face of Passepartout; certainly he could not have heard aright. \"Going to leave, sir?\" asked he, stupefied. \"Yes,\" replied Mr. Fogg calmly. \"We are going to make the tour of the world.\" Passepartout opened wide his eyes, raised his eyebrows, and expanded his eyelids. He absolutely seemed on the point of fainting, not only from surprise, but from the shock of being told he was to leave so unexpectedly. \"The tour of the world!\" repeated he, in a faint voice. \"In eighty days,\" replied Mr. Fogg. \"So we haven’t a moment to lose.\"",

            "prefix-probing": "Having won twenty guineas at whist, and taken leave of his friends, Phileas Fogg, at twenty-five minutes past seven, left the Reform Club. He returned to his house in Savile Row, where a new servant, one Passepartout, had just been hired. The young Frenchman, a former acrobat and fireman, was looking forward to a peaceful and orderly life with the notoriously methodical Mr. Fogg. Little did he know, his aspirations were about to be dramatically shattered. Mr. Fogg entered his dwelling, his face betraying no emotion, but his mind resolutely focused. He proceeded to his bedroom, collected a small carpetbag containing necessities and a substantial sum of money, and instructed Passepartout, much to the latter's bewilderment, to prepare for immediate departure. \"We are going around the world,\" Fogg stated calmly, explaining the audacious wager he had just made with his fellow club members: to circumnavigate the globe in no more than eighty days. Passepartout, stunned by this abrupt announcement that torpedoed his hopes for tranquility, could only stammer in disbelief. Fogg, utterly indifferent to his servant's consternation, simply ordered him to pack his things and be ready to leave within ten minutes, setting the stage for an extraordinary and perilous adventure across continents and oceans, driven by the relentless pursuit of time and the iron will of Phileas Fogg. The quiet life Passepartout craved was over before it even began."

Surely, sir!” “A carpet-bag is all that is necessary,” replied Mr. Fogg, calmly. “It contains two flannel shirts, two pairs of stockings, and a few other articles. We will buy clothes as we travel, according to the climates we pass through. Carrying unnecessary baggage is inefficient.” He held up a moderate-sized carpet-bag. Passepartout stared at the bag, dumbfounded. This was not the preparation he expected. Eighty days! Around the world! With *this*? His dreams of being a bustling valet vanished. “But… the money, sir?” he ventured. “That will be carried in my coat pockets,” said Mr. Fogg, placing the bag under his arm. “Now, let us go. The train departs at a quarter before nine.” Passepartout, stunned by the lack of luggage, could only follow. The single bag symbolised a journey far less conventional than he had imagined. He struggled to grasp eighty days with just this."

Mr. Fogg was placing the last items into a similar travelling-bag. \"Well, Passepartout,\" said Mr. Fogg, \"you have packed the bag?\" \"Yes, Monsieur,\" replied the valet, utterly bewildered. \"Good. Take it.\" Passepartout lifted the bag. It felt light, containing only their immediate needs. \"Now, follow me.\" Mr. Fogg picked up his bag, stepped out, and double-locked the front door. A cab waited outside. Mr. Fogg and Passepartout got in with their bags. \"Charing Cross Station, quickly!\" ordered Mr. Fogg. The cab moved swiftly through the foggy London streets. Passepartout could only gaze out, his mind struggling to grasp the sudden, unexplained departure. Where could they be going?"

Should he be compelled to make the tour of the world in eighty days, he was certain to do it with the utmost exactitude. He had not counted on the obliging conduct of the engineer on the American railway, nor on the bad weather he had encountered on the Atlantic, nor on the boldness of the reform Gauthier Ralph had displayed in wiring from London to San Francisco, but, in spite of the obstacles of every sort that he had met with, he was not behindhand. Not a single day, not a single hour, had he gained on the prescribed time; but, it is true, not a single hour, not a single day, had he lost. He was, then, precisely on time at London, at the eighty-first day after his departure. This was the 21st of December, a Saturday. The 21st of December was the seventy-ninth day, as the tour began on the 2nd of October. He was therefore two days in advance. These two days, thus happily gained, were, it is true, due to the American engineer, and not to himself. Mr. Fogg was nonetheless going to profit by them. Instead of arriving in London on the evening of the 21st of December, he arrived at 8:50 P.M. on the 20th. His train was due at Charing Cross at 11 P.M. on the 21st. The admirable Fogg was therefore 24 hours ahead of time, and it was clear that he could now win the wager."

Indeed, the news of his audacious wager to circumnavigate the globe in just eighty days spread like wildfire, particularly amongst the esteemed members of the Reform Club. The respectable gentlemen, usually absorbed in their quiet routines of reading newspapers and discussing politics, found themselves utterly dumbfounded. The very idea seemed preposterous, a gentleman of such methodical habits and unimpeachable reputation suddenly embarking on a frantic race against time across continents and oceans. Skepticism was the prevailing sentiment. Bets were laid against his success, some quite substantial. The newspapers, eager for a sensational story to break the monotony, seized upon the tale, recounting the details of the improbable wager with a mixture of amusement and disbelief. Phileas Fogg, the man who rarely deviated from his precise schedule, who knew the world only from maps and guidebooks, was now risking his fortune and reputation on a venture that seemed destined to fail. The quiet, reserved bachelor had, in a single afternoon, become the talk of the town, the subject of fascinated speculation. Everyone debated his chances, analyzed the proposed route, and wondered about the mysterious man who dared to challenge the established limits of travel. The suddenness of his vanishing act – leaving almost immediately after the bet was struck – only heightened the drama and solidified the public's obsession with this extraordinary undertaking."

Not only the aristocracy bet, but the middle-classes bet, too; betting is as natural to them as breathing. The story is told of a certain Lord B—, who, having done the Continent at the age of fifty, was anxiously discussing one day, while on his knees, with the chaplain of the parish, the chances of salvation. 'I hope your lordship is sure of heaven?' said the worthy clergyman. 'That's a toss-up!' replied the noble lord. This anecdote is credible or not, but it shows the truth of the statement. Among the old fogies of the Reform Club, however, there were but few who carried this passion to an excess. They were not big gamblers, either in the sense of losing large sums or frequenting the turf; they were more concerned about the 'honour' of betting, the niceties of the wager. Mr. Phileas Fogg had not then appeared in the Reform Club. He became a member of it only in 1872. The circumstance of his admission is briefly as follows. He was recommended by the Earl of X, and backed by Thomas Flanagan, Esq., one of the principal members of the club. Phileas Fogg, with his personal habits and character, which will be hereafter set forth, recommended himself, so to speak, automatically. He was asked to join the Reform Club,"

The “Mongolia” plied regularly between Brindisi and Bombay viâ the Suez Canal, and was one of the fastest steamers belonging to the company, always making more than ten knots an hour between Brindisi and Suez, and nine and a half between Suez and Bombay.\nTwo men were promenading up and down the wharves, among the crowd of natives and strangers who were sojourning at this once straggling village—now, thanks to the enterprise of M. Lesseps, a fast-growing town. One was the British consul at Suez, who, despite the prophecies of the English Government, and the unfavourable predictions of Stephenson, was in the habit of seeing, from his office window, English ships daily passing to and fro on the great canal, by which the old roundabout route from England to India by the Cape of Good Hope was abridged by at least a half. The other was a small, slight-built personage, with a nervous, intelligent face, and bright eyes peering out from under eyebrows which he was incessantly twitching. He was just now manifesting unmistakable signs of impatience, nervously pacing up and down, and unable to stand still for a moment. This was Fix, one of the detectives who had been dispatched from England in search of the bank robber; it was his task to narrowly watch every passenger who arrived at Suez, and to follow up all who seemed to be suspicious characters, or bore a resemblance to the description of the criminal, which he had received two days before from the police headquarters at London. The detective was evidently inspired by the hope of obtaining the splendid reward which would be the prize of success, and awaited with a feverish impatience, easy to understand, the arrival of the steamer “Mongolia.”\n“So you say, consul,” asked he for the twentieth time, “that this steamer is never behind time?”\n“No, Mr. Fix,” replied the consul. “She was bespoken yesterday at Port Said, and the rest of the way is of no account to such a craft. I repeat that the ‘Mongolia’ has been in advance of the time required by the company’s regulations, and gained the prize awarded for excess of speed.”\n“Does she come directly from Brindisi?”\n“Directly from Brindisi; she takes on the Indian mails there, and she left there Saturday at five p.m. Have patience, Mr. Fix; she will not be late. But really, I don’t see how, from the description you have, you will be able to recognise your man, even if he is on board the ‘Mongolia.’”\n“A man rather feels the presence of these fellows, consul, than recognises them. You must have a scent for them, and a scent is like a sixth sense which combines hearing, seeing, and smelling. I’ve arrested more than one of these gentlemen in my time, and, if my thief is on board, I’ll answer for it; he’ll not slip through my fingers.”\n“I hope so, Mr. Fix, for it was a heavy robbery.”\n“A magnificent robbery, consul; fifty-five thousand pounds! We don’t often have such windfalls. Burglars are getting to be so contemptible nowadays! A fellow gets hung for a handful of shillings!”\n“Mr. Fix,” said the consul, “I like your way of talking, and hope you’ll succeed; but I fear you will find it far from easy. Don’t you see, the description which you have there has a singular resemblance to an honest man?”\n“Consul,” remarked the detective, dogmatically, “great robbers always resemble honest folks. Fellows who have rascally faces have only one course to take, and that is to remain honest; otherwise they would be arrested off-hand. The artistic thing is, to unmask honest countenances; it’s no light task, I admit, but a real art.”\nMr. Fix evidently was not wanting in a tinge of self-conceit.",

            "prefix-probing": "The circumstances under which this telegraphic dispatch about Phileas Fogg was sent were as follows: Detective Fix, a persistent and unwavering agent of the Metropolitan Police assigned to the Bank of England robbery case, had been pursuing Phileas Fogg around the world. From the moment Fogg began his audacious wager, Fix became convinced that the meticulous gentleman was, in fact, the daring thief who had absconded with fifty-five thousand pounds from the bank. Fix's initial plan was simple: obtain an international warrant for Fogg's arrest and apprehend him as soon as they reached a British territory where such a warrant would be effective. However, Fogg's extraordinary speed and unpredictable itinerary made this incredibly difficult. Time and again, Fix found himself arriving in a British colony or possession – like Suez, Bombay, or Hong Kong – only to find that Fogg had already departed, and the necessary warrant had not yet caught up. He was constantly one step behind, relying on telegrams sent ahead that frequently arrived too late. This relentless pursuit, costing Fix not only considerable discomfort and frustration but also his own significant expenditure (as he was travelling under the guise of following Fogg, and had to pay his way), had brought him across continents and oceans. He had witnessed Fogg's calm, almost indifferent progress, his unwavering adherence to his schedule, and the strange, devoted companionship of his valet, Passepartout, and later, the rescued Indian lady, Aouda. Fix's suspicion only solidified with each passing day; he interpreted Fogg's punctuality and haste not as the result of a wager, but as the desperate flight of a criminal eager to escape justice. Now, weeks after leaving the shores of America, Fix, Fogg, Passepartout, and Aouda were aboard the *China*, a Cunard steamer rapidly approaching the coast of England. They had endured a tempestuous voyage across the Atlantic, battling storms and rough seas, but Fogg, ever the stoic, seemed unperturbed. The destination was Liverpool, and from there, London. This was the critical point. Fogg was on the verge of completing his impossible journey and returning to London, the very city from which Fix believed he had stolen the money. Once Fogg arrived in London, he would disappear back into the anonymity of its vast population, perhaps even leaving the country again, and apprehending him would become exponentially harder, if not impossible. Fix knew that his last, best chance to arrest Fogg was upon his arrival back on English soil, specifically in Liverpool, *if* the arrest warrant was there and valid. He had desperately telegraphed ahead from New York, urging the authorities in London to forward the warrant to Liverpool and ensure it was waiting. But given the delays and failures of communication he had experienced throughout the journey, he could not be certain it had arrived or would be ready the moment the *China* docked. As the ship neared port, the tension for Fix was immense. He watched Fogg, who remained outwardly calm, perhaps already anticipating his victory. Fix, consumed by his duty and his conviction, felt the time running out. He needed confirmation that the warrant was in Liverpool and ready for execution the instant Fogg disembarked. Or, failing that, he needed to ensure the London police were fully alerted to Fogg's imminent return and could act swiftly upon his arrival at Paddington Station. It was in this state of extreme urgency and uncertainty, with the English coast finally in sight, that Fix decided to send one final, critical telegraphic dispatch. He did so immediately upon landing at Liverpool. The message was undoubtedly directed to his superiors at Scotland Yard or the Bank of England police, informing them unequivocally that Phileas Fogg, the suspected bank robber, had arrived in Liverpool aboard the *China* and was proceeding directly to London. It would have stressed the extreme urgency of the situation and demanded that the long-awaited arrest warrant be produced and executed without a second's delay. This dispatch was not just a status update; it was a final, desperate push to mobilize the forces of the law and prevent Fogg from vanishing into the heart of London before justice could be served. Its sending marked the culmination of Fix's global pursuit and set the stage for the dramatic climax that awaited Phileas Fogg upon his arrival in the city."

The San Francisco moved rapidly through the waves, and the bustle on shore increased. When the San Francisco entered the port, it was half-past ten. Mr. Fogg was at his post. Passepartout was by his side. The consul’s agent was on the bridge. A pass was necessary to go ashore, and the agent went to get it. Detective Fix had had the steamer followed by a boat, and he now jumped on board. He went to the consul’s office, and presented his papers. The consul read them, and looked at the detective. “Mr. Fix?” he said. “Yes, sir. Is the steamer from Bombay in yet?” “No, Mr. Fix, she is not. You are too early for her.” “I know, sir, but I thought I would get everything ready.” “You are quite right, and I see you are well provided. These are excellent papers.” “The Bank of England has spared no expense to get hold of this robber, sir.” “How long do you think he will stop at Suez, Mr. Fix?” “About four hours, sir, just time to coal. He will go straight on to Aden, I have no doubt.” “Very likely, Mr. Fix. But if he is an Englishman, he will be difficult to catch, I think.” “He is an Englishman, sir, that is certain. But I hope to have him before he leaves Suez.” “He will go on to Bombay, you think?” “Yes, sir. And from there, no doubt, he will try to get to the Colonies. Australia or America perhaps.” “He will find it difficult, Mr. Fix. The English police are very active.” “Yes, sir, they are. But this man is very cunning.” “Well, Mr. Fix, I hope you will succeed. Is there anything I can do for you?” “No, thank you, sir. I have everything I need. I will go and keep an eye on the steamer.” “Very good, Mr. Fix.

Sunlight glinted off the calm waters of the canal and the dusty planks underfoot. Fellahs in simple robes mingled freely with European officials and ship officers. Piles of crates and bundles sat waiting, hinting at the wide variety of goods passing through this narrow strait connecting distant worlds. Children played among the crowd. The mingled scent of spices, coal smoke, and salt created a unique aroma of the port. Despite the apparent disorder, a strong sense of purpose pervaded the scene, a shared anticipation drawing all eyes towards the Red Sea horizon. Every person scanned the shimmering surface, watching for the tell-tale plume of smoke that would announce the vessel's approach. This place was a brief intersection for travelers from every nation, all adhering strictly to the rigid schedules of the age of steam. The energy on the quay intensified as the predicted arrival time approached, each individual absorbed in their task – shouting orders, heaving cargo, or finalizing details – contributing to the vibrant, temporary community that sprang up around the promise of a ship. It was a snapshot of global connection, a fleeting moment of convergence in the vast journey, all under the relentless Egyptian sun."

Their faces, their demeanour, everything was scrutinized with the keen intensity of a detective hot on the trail. Yet, the elusive Mr. Fogg, if he was indeed the criminal, seemed to possess an almost supernatural knack for appearing utterly respectable and innocent. Fix prowled the bustling decks, a solitary figure swallowed by the crowd of travellers and porters. His only hope lay solely in the increasingly slim possibility that the warrant might yet arrive from London before the massive vessel finally cast off. But the minutes ticked by relentlessly, each one a hammer blow against his fading optimism. The steam hissed violently, the engines rumbling, preparing for immediate departure. He felt a growing, suffocating desperation; to let his quarry escape now, after coming so far, would be an unbearable failure. He absolutely couldn't risk losing sight of him in the immense vastness of the open sea. His every instinct screamed that Fogg was there, hidden cunningly in plain sight, perhaps comfortably ensconced in some opulent first-class cabin, calmly planning his next move. Fix resolved instantly to remain on board, even without the official document in his possession. He would shadow the gentleman, trusting implicitly that the warrant must catch up at the next port, if not sooner. The anchor was weighed with a groan of chains."

Passepartout, left to attend to the luggage and his own quick embarkation, lingered for a moment on the quay. Here, he was accosted by a short, sharp-faced man with a kindly air, who introduced himself as a tourist named Mr. Fix. Fix, in reality, a detective following Fogg, struck up a conversation, asking about his destination and purpose. Passepartout, feeling expansive and proud of his master's extraordinary journey, readily shared details about their precise itinerary and the wager Mr. Fogg had made. Fix listened carefully, his suspicions solidifying with every word. He knew he could not arrest Fogg in Suez, British territory, but he resolved to follow him to India, hoping to secure an arrest warrant there. He quickly completed his own boarding formalities and secured passage on the same vessel. Meanwhile, Mr. Fogg was already meticulously settling into his appointed cabin aboard the \"Mongolia,\" a swift, iron-built steamer renowned for its punctuality. Having chosen it precisely for this quality, he immediately established his unvarying routine. He consulted his Bradshaw's Guide, took his meals at the precise hours in the saloon, and spent his time reading, playing whist with reserved fellow passengers, or simply observing the passage of the sea with calm, detached precision. He spoke little, interacting only when necessary. Fix, also aboard, kept his subject under discreet observation from a distance, growing more certain with each passing hour that the imperturbable gentleman was indeed the perpetrator of the audacious bank robbery. The steamer soon left the port of Suez, swiftly cutting through the Red Sea, the rhythmic beat of its engines marking the steady progress towards Bombay, exactly as scheduled."

He saw the blow that was coming to his master. The arrest! This was the end of the journey! The poor fellow sobbed, \"You don’t mean that!\" \"Yes, the warrant is issued for Phileas Fogg, gentleman, who stands accused of robbing the Bank of England,\" Fix stated, his voice low. \"I have followed him from London.\""

What am I to think?” “Why, you think that the bank has been robbed,” said Fix, using the words the Frenchman had unconsciously let slip. “Well, to tell the truth, sir, I suspect it.” “And your master is the robber?” “No, no, sir, I don't think that. My master is a perfectly honourable gentleman, but perhaps it is as you say: he is taking this journey to avoid difficulties. Anyway, it is not my business.” “Whether Mr. Fogg is a robber or not,” Fix muttered to himself, “I am sure I must follow him. Since the bank has such confidence in me, I must do my duty. But how can I manage to get a passport to India, and then on from there?” Fix pondered for a moment. “The steamer leaves in ten minutes, and I haven't time to go to London. If I go to London, I may miss him. If I don't have a passport, how can I follow him?” Suddenly, a thought struck him. He smiled grimly. “I have it!

His main priority was justice for Fogg. Everything else, including the gas bill fear, was irrelevant to the inspector focused solely on the mission's end, leaving no room for minor issues.

The chances were in his favour. This Fogg was clearly a rogue. Where could he be going? Could he be going to England? No; the chances were that he was not. But, since he was being so secretive, he was probably going to Europe, to Paris or Naples, in which case he would keep overawing the police by his inexplicable and sudden disappearance."

The “Mongolia,” thanks to the vigorous exertions of the engineer, seemed likely, so rapid was her speed, to reach her destination considerably within that time. The greater part of the passengers from Brindisi were bound for India some for Bombay, others for Calcutta by way of Bombay, the nearest route thither, now that a railway crosses the Indian peninsula. Among the passengers was a number of officials and military officers of various grades, the latter being either attached to the regular British forces or commanding the Sepoy troops, and receiving high salaries ever since the central government has assumed the powers of the East India Company: for the sub-lieutenants get £280, brigadiers, £2,400, and generals of divisions, £4,000. What with the military men, a number of rich young Englishmen on their travels, and the hospitable efforts of the purser, the time passed quickly on the “Mongolia.” The best of fare was spread upon the cabin tables at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and the eight o’clock supper, and the ladies scrupulously changed their toilets twice a day; and the hours were whirled away, when the sea was tranquil, with music, dancing, and games.\nBut the Red Sea is full of caprice, and often boisterous, like most long and narrow gulfs. When the wind came from the African or Asian coast the “Mongolia,” with her long hull, rolled fearfully. Then the ladies speedily disappeared below; the pianos were silent; singing and dancing suddenly ceased. Yet the good ship ploughed straight on, unretarded by wind or wave, towards the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb. What was Phileas Fogg doing all this time? It might be thought that, in his anxiety, he would be constantly watching the changes of the wind, the disorderly raging of the billows—every chance, in short, which might force the “Mongolia” to slacken her speed, and thus interrupt his journey. But, if he thought of these possibilities, he did not betray the fact by any outward sign.",

The “Mongolia”, a steamer of the Peninsular and Oriental Company, built of iron, and with screw propeller, was an exceedingly fast boat. She had already made many rapid voyages. During the first few days out of Suez, many of the passengers were somewhat anxious about the weather, as the Red Sea has the reputation of being turbulent, and very unfriendly to sailing craft. But to the great satisfaction of all, the sea was very calm during the whole passage. The wind seemed to have gone down with the sun, and during the night it became very quiet. The “Mongolia” was sailing along at a great rate, and it seemed probable that she would reach Aden ahead of time. The principal passengers were officers of the army and civil service, going to India, and benefiting by the high salaries which the government gives since it has taken the place of the old East India Company. There were young officers, going to join their regiments, elderly officers with wives and families returning to their posts, and many ladies, going to rejoin their husbands in India.

The passengers lived well, as there was excellent food served four times a day, and at the tables there were abundant supplies of fresh milk, butter, and eggs, and various kinds of preserves.

The Carnatic, however, thanks to the vigorous exertions of the engineer, was accomplishing the voyage gallantly, and was not less than a day in advance of the prescribed time when she entered the harbour of Aden. Fogg was again twenty-four hours in advance. On the 30th of October, at 6 p.m., he landed at Aden, for the purpose of having the coals replenished, the regulations of the company making it obligatory on all steamers to effect this operation at Aden. Three thousand seven hundred tons of coal had to be put on board, and this operation, so vital to the Carnatic’s further progress, would take some hours. Phileas Fogg went ashore and made his observations. The town of Aden is a sort of Indian Gibraltar, situated on a rocky promontory connected with the mainland by a narrow isthmus, and where a British garrison is stationed. It was for a long time an Arabian village of little importance, but the English have fortified it and made it a great port of call, and a coal depot, for the steamers which ply between the Suez Canal and India. By the aid of his pocket compass, Phileas Fogg observed the position of the town, and recognised the necessity of turning the promontory before entering the harbour, on which he made no comment to the captain. He then returned on board, and waited impatiently for the operation of coaling to be completed. But the operation of coaling was accomplished with despatch, and already, at 8 p.m., the Carnatic was ready to leave. Phileas Fogg and his servant remounted the steamer, and the poles were drawn in. At this moment a passenger came up to Mr. Fogg, and accosted him. It was the inspector, Fix. He bowed to Mr. Fogg, and, with a feigned air of surprise, asked if he did not"

What cared this person of methodical habits about the caprices of the ocean, the fickle moods of the storm, and the shifting currents? Phileas Fogg saw in all this only an additional means of getting on his way. He was one of those English who, on a journey, are bold, but courteous, and who, provided they accomplish their object, care for neither obstacles nor blows. And what is more, the “Mongolia” was always making good progress. Phileas Fogg was expected at Suez upon the 11th of December, and upon the 11th the “Mongolia” entered the harbour of Suez. Then it was perceived that Phileas Fogg was a member of the Reform Club; for the consul of the United States, who was a most worthy man, and who was also a resident of Suez, came on board to make sure that the famous man was indeed on board this ship. The American consul was a man of great courtesy; he was well aware of the importance of the Reform Club, and he had even some reason to believe that Mr. Fogg would be able to pay for his passage, which might not have been the case with every member of the club. He therefore went on board to make his own inspection, but he came to a stop before a man who was sitting in a corner, playing cards, and who was, indeed, Phileas Fogg himself. Mr. Fogg, with the three other members of the club, sat at the table, looking at the cards, and having apparently no other thought in the world. He took no notice of the consul, but continued to play his cards with the greatest placidity. The consul, who was not less courteous than Mr. Fogg was placid, made his excuses for disturbing him, and retired. Mr. Fogg, without even raising his head, merely said, “Thank you, sir,” and went on with his game. Phileas Fogg was therefore recognised at Suez; but he could not be detained, for he had a passport, and he was proceeding to Bombay. Besides, he could not be said to have committed any crime, for the crime of which he was accused had been committed in England, and the English police had no power to arrest him in Egypt. He was therefore permitted to continue his journey. As for Passepartout, he had gone on shore as soon as the ship had entered the harbour. He had walked about the town, and had come to the conclusion that he did not like it. He had seen all that was to be seen in a few hours, and he had returned to the ship, determined never to set foot in the place again. Now, as I have said, the “Mongolia” was in Suez harbour upon the 11th of December. Phileas Fogg was to depart from Suez upon the 12th of December. He had therefore twenty-four hours before him. He spent these twenty-four hours in his cabin, writing letters, and playing cards with his usual partners. As for Passepartout, he spent them in looking about him, and in wondering what would happen next. Phileas Fogg was not at all anxious. He was accustomed to travel; he had made the tour of the world more than once. He knew that he had nothing to fear. He had money, and he had a passport. He was going to Bombay, and from Bombay he would go to Calcutta, and from Calcutta he would go to Hong Kong, and from Hong Kong he would go to Yokohama, and from Yokohama he would go to San Francisco, and from San Francisco he would go to New York, and from New York he would go to Liverpool, and from Liverpool he would go to London. He was quite sure that he would be able to make the journey in eighty days. He had calculated everything. He had nothing to fear. He had only to go on. He ate four meals a day, and was not in the least incommoded by the most violent pitching and tossing; he played whist, and was so absorbed in the game that he took no heed of the landscape. If there was any, he never saw it. On deck he rarely showed himself, and took no more notice of the waves than did the ship’s chronometers of which I have spoken. There were on board the “Mongolia” a number of passengers, some of whom were on the way to India, and others who were simply making the voyage for pleasure. There were also some who were going to Australia, and others who were going to China. Amongst the passengers were a tax-collector, going to Goa, a Reverend Decimus Smith, returning to Bombay, and a Brigadier-general, who was rejoining his command at Benares.

Through these waters, ancient fleets had sailed; along these shores lay forgotten ruins. But Phileas Fogg noticed none. He was not a man moved by scenery or the weight of history. His world was the Mongolia's interior – its dining saloon, library, and cabin. He lived by the precision of the chronometer, spending his time playing whist with his companions, reading a newspaper, or simply observing the tick-tock of his watch. The vibrant life of the East unfolding outside was irrelevant, unless it threatened his meticulously planned itinerary. History, culture, natural beauty – these held no sway over his strictly methodical mind. His journey was a problem of logistics, not a grand adventure."

Where are you bound?”\n“Like you, to Bombay.”\n“That’s capital! Have you made this trip before?”\n“Several times. I am one of the agents of the Peninsular Company.”\n“Then you know India?”\n“Why yes,” replied Fix, who spoke cautiously.\n“A curious place, this India?”\n“Oh, very curious. Mosques, minarets, temples, fakirs, pagodas, tigers, snakes, elephants! I hope you will have ample time to see the sights.”\n“I hope so, Monsieur Fix. You see, a man of sound sense ought not to spend his life jumping from a steamer upon a railway train, and from a railway train upon a steamer again, pretending to make the tour of the world in eighty days! No; all these gymnastics, you may be sure, will cease at Bombay.”\n“And Mr. Fogg is getting on well?” asked Fix, in the most natural tone in the world.\n“Quite well, and I too. I eat like a famished ogre; it’s the sea air.”\n“But I never see your master on deck.”\n“Never; he hasn’t the least curiosity.”\n“Do you know, Mr. Passepartout, that this pretended tour in eighty days may conceal some secret errand—perhaps a diplomatic mission?”\n“Faith, Monsieur Fix, I assure you I know nothing about it, nor would I give half a crown to find out.”",

He was pleased with the voyage, and his hearty appetite grew every day. He was, in fact, very happy to be on salt water, and often on deck enjoying the sight of the waves and the agreeable presence of the officers, with whom he was already on the best terms. He considered the captain and his subordinates as townspeople, and pleasant fellows, though with the fault of being always hurried--a defect, he observed, which was common to all the members of the Peninsular and Oriental Company. One day he was standing on deck, when a pleasant-looking gentleman accosted him, and asked if he was not the servant of the eccentric Englishman who was going around the world. Passepartout coloured up to the eyes, and answered, yes, he was. The gentleman then introduced himself as Fix, an agent of the Peninsular Company, stationed at Suez. \"You are the man, then, who helped me on the quay yesterday?\" said Passepartout, shaking his hand warmly. \"Just so,\" returned Fix; \"and you must excuse my boldness in addressing you; but I was so much interested in your master's adventure.\" \"Interested!\" cried Passepartout; \"the deuce you were!\" \"Yes; and I hope you will not be offended at my asking a few questions about Mr. Fogg.\" \"Not at all, sir, not at all.

Eighty days exactly, neither more nor less!\" \"But this is an impossibility!\" cried Fix. \"Not at all. We have a first-class cabin, and we are going at full speed.\" \"But do you not see that you will have changes of vehicles, and be subject to delays?\" \"Certainly not. Mr. Fogg has foreseen everything. He has a time-table which allows for nothing.\" \"But a journey like this, at such a rate, is unheard of. It cannot be carried out except by a man of extraordinary energy and punctuality.\" \"My master is punctuality personified,\" returned Passepartout, and as for energy, he is equal to anything.\" Passepartout then, warming up, began to dilate upon Mr. Fogg's virtues, his exactitude, his coolness, his imperturbable placidity. Fix listened with downcast eyes, and seemed to take in every word; but his thoughts were evidently elsewhere. It was not till Passepartout had finished that he raised his head, and, looking the servant steadfastly in the face, said, \"Mr. Fogg is very well, then?\" \"Very well, sir; and I may say that I myself am in excellent health. The sea air is so invigorating!\" \"I never see your master on deck,\" observed Fix. \"Never, sir. Mr. Fogg doesn't like to be disturbed.\" \"Do you think this tour is undertaken seriously, then?\" \"Most seriously, sir. We have even taken a trunk full of bank-notes with us.\" \"Indeed! Bank-notes? But is Mr. Fogg so rich?\" \"Rich enough to carry out this little tour,\" returned Passepartout, \"and a great deal more.\" Fix again bent his brows, and seemed to reflect. It was plain that he was puzzled by the adventure. He had heard of the wager at the Reform Club, and was already strongly inclined to believe that the journey was only a pretext, under cover of which Mr. Fogg was to escape from England after having committed the robbery. But how could he be sure of this? How could he know whether this Mr. Fogg was the gentleman whose description he had received? He determined to question Passepartout further, and at the same time to keep a sharp eye upon the master. He therefore said to Passepartout, \"You are going to Bombay, then?\" \"Yes, it is our destination.\" \"And you are not to stop in any of the towns on the way?\" \"No, not an hour, unless it is for a change of vehicle.\" \"But you know India, I presume? It is a very interesting country.\" \"Oh, as for me, I confess I don't know it at all,\" returned Passepartout. \"And I may say that I have no desire to know it either. All that I ask is to get to the end of the journey as quickly as possible.\" \"But you will have the opportunity of seeing some very curious things,\" insisted Fix. \"There are mosques, temples, minarets, elephants, tigers, snakes, and dancing-girls.\" \"Ah, yes, I understand,\" said Passepartout. \"These are doubtless very curious things, but I should be quite satisfied to see them all from a railway carriage.\" \"But Mr. Fogg? Does he not propose to visit the country?\" \"Not that I know of, sir. As I told you, he never stops anywhere.\" Fix was beginning to think that there was something very mysterious about this Mr. Fogg. He did not like the servant's indifference to everything but the completion of the journey. He was strongly tempted to arrest Fogg at once. But he was without a warrant. He must wait till he reached Bombay. \"Do you intend to remain in Bombay, then?\" he asked. \"No, sir, we are to leave Bombay immediately on the arrival of the steamer.\" \"Indeed! And where do you go next?\" \"To Calcutta.\" \"To Calcutta! But that is not the straight road.\" \"Mr. Fogg never takes the straight road when he has another in view.\" \"But you will have to cross India?\" \"No, sir, we shall go by steamer down the coast to Calcutta.\" \"But you must know that the journey by sea from Bombay to Calcutta is much longer than by land?\" \"Yes, sir; but Mr. Fogg is never afraid of a little extra distance. Besides, he says there is a break in the railway line across India, and that we should lose time by taking the land route.\" This agreed with the information which Fix had received. The break was on the line connecting the Great Indian Peninsula Railway with the Punjaub line, near Allahabad. Fix felt that he was on the right track. \"And when do you expect to reach Calcutta?\" he asked. \"On the 25th of October, at noon.\" Fix made a note of the date. \"Ah, yes, I see,\" said he, as if he were talking to himself. \"It is just three days from Bombay to Calcutta. So that...\" He stopped short. \"So that you have no time to lose,\" added Passepartout. \"No,\" said Fix, with a sigh. \"No time to lose.\" Passepartout was delighted with this confirmation of his master's exactitude. \"You see, sir,\" said he, proudly, \"it is just as I told you.

His robust constitution and simple pleasures made the voyage agreeable. He relished the hearty fare, marveling at the meals' punctuality and abundance, often chatting cheerfully with others on deck. He observed the sailors, fellow passengers, and the vast ocean with a cheerful curiosity absent in his master. While Mr. Fogg stayed mostly in his cabin, emerging only for timed meals and brief walks, Passepartout explored the steamer eagerly, making acquaintances, listening to stories, and enjoying the engines' thrum propelling them steadily eastward towards Suez at a fine clip. He couldn't help but ponder his strange employer. Mr. Fogg was peculiar. Reserved, precise, and seemingly devoid of emotion, he treated the incredible journey with the same equanimity as a routine trip to market. No hint of excitement or apprehension, just methodical execution. Passepartout, a man of simple needs and effervescent spirit, found this unsettling. He, who had dreamed of seeing the world, traveled with a man indifferent to its wonders. Yet, Fogg's unwavering calm was reassuring. It was the calm of absolute certainty, a certainty that, however subtly, began to rub off on his valet. Passepartout began to feel this outlandish wager wasn't as impossible as he had feared. With a master like Mr. Fogg, who moved with the precision of a clockwork mechanism, anything seemed possible. The days aboard the Mongolia settled into a pleasant routine. The sea remained calm, allowing the vessel to maintain excellent speed, crucial for Mr. Fogg's timeline. Passepartout spent hours between duties watching waves, conversing with the crew, and reflecting on his sudden fortune. Days ago, he sought a quiet, orderly life. Now, he hurtled across the globe with an eccentric millionaire on a dare. He couldn't quite decide if it was absurdity or adventure, but he was enjoying it immensely, perhaps more than his master, who saw the expedition as a problem to solve, not an exploration of the world and its marvels."

He offered him drinks, chatted about his travels, and showed a lively interest in Passepartout’s own experiences and opinions. Naturally, the conversation often drifted towards Mr. Fogg. Fix subtly steered the discussions, fishing for any scrap of information that might confirm his suspicions. He spoke of robbers, of the recent audacious bank theft, and observed Passepartout’s reactions closely. Passepartout, innocent and talkative, never suspected Fix’s true purpose. He saw him merely as a fellow traveller, friendly and inquisitive. He talked about his master with simple admiration, recounting trivial details of their journey, the punctual schedules, the swift progress. He mentioned the large sums of money Fogg carried, not out of boastfulness, but merely as a matter of fact, part of the extraordinary nature of their whirlwind tour. Fix listened intently, his suspicions hardening into conviction. Passepartout’s artless disclosures, his descriptions of Fogg’s calm, his methodical nature, his apparent indifference to delays or obstacles, all fit the profile of a man determined to escape justice swiftly and efficiently. The large sums of money clinched it. Why else would a gentleman undertake such a bizarre, rapid circumnavigation carrying vast amounts of cash, if not to finance his flight and perhaps bribe his way across borders? Fix felt more certain than ever that he had cornered his man. He needed only to await the warrant, which he hoped would catch up to him at Suez, or Bombay at the latest, enabling him to apprehend the seemingly impassive Phileas Fogg before he vanished again."

Passepartout, ever curious, took a moment to look around the busy port, but his master's pace was swift, allowing little time for sightseeing. Within minutes, they were back on the steamer Mongolia, having spent just enough time on shore to achieve their objective. The anchors were weighed, the screw began to churn the water, and the ship pulled away from the dusty Arabian coast. Fix, feeling a knot tighten in his stomach, was also aboard. He cursed the red tape that allowed his suspect to put ever more distance between himself and England. The journey across the Arabian Sea towards Bombay began, a vast expanse of water separating the detective from the possibility of an immediate arrest. Each turn of the ship's propeller carried Phileas Fogg further into the Orient, further from the jurisdiction where the warrant would eventually arrive. Fix felt a grudging respect for the man's methodical speed, even as it exacerbated his own predicament. He knew this chase would be long and difficult, spanning continents and seas, all because a punctual Englishman had chosen to travel around the world in eighty days. The detective resolved to stick closer, to watch for any slip-up, though Fogg seemed incapable of making one. The ship steamed onward, the shores of Arabia fading into the haze, Bombay and the subcontinent looming somewhere over the horizon, the next stop in this extraordinary and frustrating pursuit."

The country is under the direct rule of the English crown, having been taken from the East India Company since the revolt of 1857. It is administered by a viceroy, who resides at Calcutta, five principal governors at Bombay, Madras, Bengal, the North-western Provinces, and the Punjab, and a number of lieutenant-governors of districts, and commissioners of divisions. The railway crosses India from end to end, with branch lines leaving the main road at various points, and traversing the districts of the country. This Indian railway is, therefore, of great service to travellers, as it now replaces the lines of steamers along the coasts, and the wretched conveyances which formerly did the work of the railway and actually stopped travel. Calcutta is the capital, and the city where the viceroy resides; but Bombay, on the opposite coast, is a place of much importance, as it is the starting-point of the steamers for Europe, by the Suez Canal. These two cities are connected by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, which, starting from Bombay, crosses the peninsula to the station of Allahabad, which is on the Ganges, and thence passes by Rajpootana and the Great Indian Peninsular, crossing the Vindhia mountains to Calcutta."

Passepartout, meanwhile, with the four hours and a half at his disposal, reflected that he might, without seriously infringing upon his master’s orders, bestow a little time upon a visit to the city. Though aware that Fogg was not a man to approve of idle curiosity, the honest fellow felt an irresistible longing to see Bombay before their swift departure. He completed the errands with promptitude and then, with a light heart, set off from the docks towards the town, hoping to catch a glimpse of the local life and sights before the stringent railway schedule demanded their presence at the station for the onward journey across the vast Indian peninsula. This brief interlude offered the only chance for Passepartout to experience anything of the diverse cultures they were traversing."

That hope vanished the moment Mr. Fogg uttered \"departure.\" Leisure was not on their itinerary; relentless forward motion was the plan. Passepartout, a creature of routine, found himself caught in a perpetual whirlwind of trains and steamers. The dream of a calm, orderly life in Savile Row seemed distant, replaced by a dizzying reality of constant packing, rushing, and arriving only to prepare for the next leg. He performed his duties, but his mind buzzed with questions. What was the true object of this tour? Was it merely a whim? Despite the lack of sightseeing, a strange exhilaration began to mingle with his confusion. Each new sunrise found him in a different landscape, propelled by his imperturbable master. He was seeing the world, albeit at a dizzying pace, a world far grander and more varied than he could ever have imagined from London. He resigned himself to the breakneck speed, accepting that the journey, far from ending soon, was beginning to reveal its astounding scope, stretching eastward into the vast unknown."

At last, having seen the Parsee carnival wind away in the distance, he was turning his steps towards the station, when he happened to espy the splendid pagoda on Malabar Hill, and was seized with an irresistible desire to see its interior. He was quite ignorant that it is forbidden to Christians to enter certain Indian temples, and that even the faithful must not go in without first leaving their shoes outside the door. It may be said here that the wise policy of the British Government severely punishes a disregard of the practices of the native religions.\nPassepartout, however, thinking no harm, went in like a simple tourist, and was soon lost in admiration of the splendid Brahmin ornamentation which everywhere met his eyes, when of a sudden he found himself sprawling on the sacred flagging. He looked up to behold three enraged priests, who forthwith fell upon him; tore off his shoes, and began to beat him with loud, savage exclamations. The agile Frenchman was soon upon his feet again, and lost no time in knocking down two of his long-gowned adversaries with his fists and a vigorous application of his toes; then, rushing out of the pagoda as fast as his legs could carry him, he soon escaped the third priest by mingling with the crowd in the streets.\nAt five minutes before eight, Passepartout, hatless, shoeless, and having in the squabble lost his package of shirts and shoes, rushed breathlessly into the station.\nFix, who had followed Mr. Fogg to the station, and saw that he was really going to leave Bombay, was there, upon the platform. He had resolved to follow the supposed robber to Calcutta, and farther, if necessary. Passepartout did not observe the detective, who stood in an obscure corner; but Fix heard him relate his adventures in a few words to Mr. Fogg.\n“I hope that this will not happen again,” said Phileas Fogg coldly, as he got into the train. Poor Passepartout, quite crestfallen, followed his master without a word. Fix was on the point of entering another carriage, when an idea struck him which induced him to alter his plan.\n“No, I’ll stay,” muttered he. “An offence has been committed on Indian soil. I’ve got my man.”\nJust then the locomotive gave a sharp screech, and the train passed out into the darkness of the night.",

He entered the vast pagoda, a dim and mysterious edifice filled with the heavy scent of incense and echoing with the low murmur of chanting. Strange statues of gods and goddesses with multiple limbs and fearsome countenances loomed in the shadows. Before an altar, a group of priests, their eyes gleaming with fanatical zeal, their faces painted in grotesque patterns, performed a ritual of prostrations and incantations. Passepartout, usually wary, found himself captivated by the scene. It was so utterly different from anything he had ever witnessed. He wanted to understand this strange devotion, to peer into the heart of these ancient mysteries. His initial intention was merely a quick glance, a brief satisfying of his curiosity, but the atmosphere, the hypnotic rhythm of the chants, and the bizarre spectacle held him enthralled. He crept forward cautiously, drawn by an irresistible force towards the altar, his eyes fixed on the priests. He didn't notice how far he had strayed from the entrance, or how close he was getting to the sacred space. Lost in contemplation, he took another step, then another, his breath held. He was now directly behind the group of priests, straining to see their actions more clearly. Suddenly, without warning, several figures detached themselves from the shadows near the altar. Their movements were swift and silent. Before Passepartout could react, before he could even cry out, strong hands seized him. They gripped his arms like vices, and he felt himself being lifted off his feet. He struggled, his mind a sudden storm of panic and confusion, but his captors were powerful. He was dragged rapidly away from the main part of the temple, towards a dark, low doorway in the wall. Fear, sharp and cold, pierced through his bewilderment. What did these priests want with him? Had he committed some unforgivable sacrilege? The thought of his master, Phileas Fogg, and the precise schedule they had to keep, flashed through his mind. His foolish curiosity had not only endangered himself but potentially ruined Fogg's entire incredible journey. He was shoved roughly through the doorway and into an oppressive darkness, the heavy scent of incense replaced by a damp, earthy smell. The door slammed shut behind him, plunging him into silence and despair. He was a prisoner, and the thought of the consequences sent a shiver down his spine."

This was Sir Francis Cromarty, one of Mr. Fogg’s whist partners on the “Mongolia,” now on his way to join his corps at Benares. Sir Francis was a tall, fair man of fifty, who had greatly distinguished himself in the last Sepoy revolt. He made India his home, only paying brief visits to England at rare intervals; and was almost as familiar as a native with the customs, history, and character of India and its people. But Phileas Fogg, who was not travelling, but only describing a circumference, took no pains to inquire into these subjects; he was a solid body, traversing an orbit around the terrestrial globe, according to the laws of rational mechanics. He was at this moment calculating in his mind the number of hours spent since his departure from London, and, had it been in his nature to make a useless demonstration, would have rubbed his hands for satisfaction. Sir Francis Cromarty had observed the oddity of his travelling companion—although the only opportunity he had for studying him had been while he was dealing the cards, and between two rubbers—and questioned himself whether a human heart really beat beneath this cold exterior, and whether Phileas Fogg had any sense of the beauties of nature. The brigadier-general was free to mentally confess that, of all the eccentric persons he had ever met, none was comparable to this product of the exact sciences.\nPhileas Fogg had not concealed from Sir Francis his design of going round the world, nor the circumstances under which he set out; and the general only saw in the wager a useless eccentricity and a lack of sound common sense.

Opposite him, Passepartout eagerly absorbed the kaleidoscope of India rushing past the windows. Cotton fields, palm groves, and dense forests blurred into a colourful ribbon. Small villages with bamboo huts flashed by, inhabited by people seemingly unphased by the iron horse's passage. The railway, a modern intrusion, sliced through ancient landscapes. Passepartout marvelled at the speed, a stark contrast to the slow pace of life observed outside. This swift transit was vital to their audacious global dash. Aouda, by Fogg's side, watched quietly, a mix of wonder and melancholy in her eyes as familiar but now distant scenes of her homeland unfolded. The journey eastward was marked by increasing heat and humidity. They crossed numerous rivers via impressive bridges. Distant glimpses of wildlife added to the exotic tableau. The train's rhythmic clatter provided a constant soundtrack. Fogg remained impassive, referencing maps and schedules, every movement calculated. Passepartout, restless with excitement, shifted from one window to the other, trying to capture the subcontinent's vastness in his mind. The rapid passage offered only snapshots, vibrant impressions of India's beauty and intricate reality. He knew their rail journey would soon end, forcing a change in their meticulously planned itinerary, but for now, the steady forward motion felt like undeniable progress towards the impossible deadline. As daylight faded, painting the sky in dramatic hues, the train pressed onward, carrying its determined passengers deeper into India's interior, a small, speeding capsule of unwavering punctuality racing against the world's circumference, driven by the cold logic of a wager and the bold spirit of adventure, pushing relentlessly towards the next waypoint on their improbable, globe-circling quest, maintaining the schedule paramount to Fogg's design, a marvel of timing amidst a timeless land, heading relentlessly towards the unexpected halt, knowing the true test of adaptability lay just ahead, yet finding solace in the sheer speed achieved, a tangible marker of distance devoured, hours conserved, hope maintained against the relentless march of the clock."

It seemed to be a rapid trans formation effected by the locomotive, and the regular course of the train supplied a continuous panorama of the Vindyha mountains, the spurs of which, crowned with ragged ruins, hid themselves away below the smoke. In the mountain, now and then, a few scattered Indian villages were perceived, sometimes huts inhabited by woodmen, or, again, bonze monasteries, or Brahminical temples, or pagodas. Sir Francis Cromarty knew these places, and spoke of them with the intelligence which characterises an officer with his experience of life in India. He explained to Phileas Fogg, with reference to the ruins, that they were monuments erected by the religious sect of the Gymnosophists, who for merly worshipped Brahmanism with the most abominable rites. These rock-dwellings were inhabited by Faquirs, who disdained the comforts of life, and, after having lacerated their bodies, lived on rice and Indian corn. Phileas Fogg, in reply to his questions, confined himself to saying that he thought it was curious. Sir Francis related to his fellow-traveller the story of a certain Nana Sahib, the last Preishwa, whose rebellion had filled the world with the details of his cruelty. The general added, that this ferocious prince, though pursued, had escaped, and it was supposed that he was living, at present, in a hidden retreat in the remote places of the Concan mountains. Passepartout, silent and attentive, heard with intense interest the general's stories. Sir Francis Cromarty then spoke of the difficulties met with by the engineers in laying the railway track in this mountainous region. He mentioned that the line had only recently been completed at certain points. A year before, a traveller arriving at these mountains was required to obtain conveyances, or go on foot, in order to continue his journey across the Concan and reach Allahabad on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, which now runs directly from Bombay to Calcutta. \"This,\" said Sir Francis Cromarty, \"is a serious obstacle to your trip, Mr. Fogg, as you must anticipate delays that may perhaps compromise your chance of winning the wager.\" \"Not at all, Sir Francis,\" replied Mr. Fogg, calmly; \"I have not anticipated any delays. I have always held that a delay, in the first instance, would not throw me back eventually. There are no obstacles at all, as you can see.\" \"There are, however, two days to lose,\" replied the general, \"in obtaining conveyances.\" \"A train runs continually, Sir Francis.\" \"Yes, and then the train will deposit you at the foot of these mountains, which you will have to cross on foot, or by cart or palanquin, in order to catch the second train on the other side.\" \"Mr.,\" replied Phileas Fogg, dryly, \"the railway does not cease to run, Sir Francis. This is how it is, that a train leaves Calcutta, while four trains leave Bombay. This is how it is, that the track passes Allahabad, and it does not pass Delhi, this is how it is, Sir Francis, that I tell you that the railway is completely finished.\" \"But I assure you!\" said Sir Francis, persisting. \"Look! here is a map, and you will see that the railway is marked as interrupted at this place.\" \"The maps are incorrect,\" replied Mr. Fogg. \"The railway is completed.\" Sir Francis Cromarty shrugged his shoulders, and did not wish to continue the conversation. Passepartout, who was sleeping soundly, dreamt that he was purloining the shoes of the sacred pagoda, and that he was caught by the feet by the Brahmins, and that he was then hung up at the sacred pagoda. A few moments after, the train, passing on a curve, left the side of the mountains. Sir Francis Cromarty drew the attention of Mr. Fogg to Passepartout. \"Your servant,\" said Sir Francis, \"has not failed to bring himself into trouble ever since we arrived in India. He has been within an inch of being a victim of the priests of Bombay.\" \"How so, Sir Francis?\" asked Phileas Fogg, calmly. \"It happened that he entered the pagoda of Malabar Hill, and that, not knowing that it is forbidden to do so, he went inside with his shoes on.\" \"He does not know the rules of the country,\" replied Mr. Fogg. \"But he should have been more prudent,\" said Sir Francis. \"The consequences might have been very serious.\" \"The consequences to whom, Sir Francis?\" replied Mr. Fogg. \"To him, and to you also.\" \"Not at all. If Passepartout had been caught, he would have been punished, and he would have been sent to Europe.

The country they were passing through is a network of little streams, tributaries of the sacred Ganges. The luxuriant foliage was composed of palms, palmettos, teaks, and Indian fig-trees, which are mimosas of immense size, the leaves of which are, according to the Brahmin legends, transformed into wings to shelter the traveller from the sun. At noon the conductor passed through the cars, announcing dinner-time. The passengers were invited to the eating-house, established in a station, and Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty sat down at the same table with some other travellers. The repast was varied, and abundantly served upon dishes of porcelain and silver, and the attendants were scrupulously clean, civil, and obliging. During the few minutes that they stopped at the station, a sort of peddler came along the cars, selling all sorts of articles — among others, copies of William Chambers’s *World as it Goes,* an almanac which contained the timetables of the railroads. Phileas Fogg purchased a copy of this almanac and put it in his pocket. At half-past twelve the train started again, and soon after passed the viaducts and bridges of the Myhie, and curved around the slopes of the Vindhia Mountains, on the lower spurs of which are still a few sacred forests, the retreats of Brahmins, faquirs, and ascetics, whom the English had not yet been able to reach.

This fertile territory is watered by numerous small rivers and limpid streams, mostly tributaries of the Godavery.\nPassepartout, on waking and looking out, could not realise that he was actually crossing India in a railway train. The locomotive, guided by an English engineer and fed with English coal, threw out its smoke upon cotton, coffee, nutmeg, clove, and pepper plantations, while the steam curled in spirals around groups of palm-trees, in the midst of which were seen picturesque bungalows, viharis (sort of abandoned monasteries), and marvellous temples enriched by the exhaustless ornamentation of Indian architecture. Then they came upon vast tracts extending to the horizon, with jungles inhabited by snakes and tigers, which fled at the noise of the train; succeeded by forests penetrated by the railway, and still haunted by elephants which, with pensive eyes, gazed at the train as it passed. The travellers crossed, beyond Milligaum, the fatal country so often stained with blood by the sectaries of the goddess Kali. Not far off rose Ellora, with its graceful pagodas, and the famous Aurungabad, capital of the ferocious Aureng-Zeb, now the chief town of one of the detached provinces of the kingdom of the Nizam. It was thereabouts that Feringhea, the Thuggee chief, king of the stranglers, held his sway. These ruffians, united by a secret bond, strangled victims of every age in honour of the goddess Death, without ever shedding blood; there was a period when this part of the country could scarcely be travelled over without corpses being found in every direction. The English Government has succeeded in greatly diminishing these murders, though the Thuggees still exist, and pursue the exercise of their horrible rites.\nAt half-past twelve the train stopped at Burhampoor where Passepartout was able to purchase some Indian slippers, ornamented with false pearls, in which, with evident vanity, he proceeded to encase his feet.",

They stopped for ten minutes at Burhampoor, where the stupendous minarets of a pagoda were seen in the dim morning light. The travellers passed onward through the country of the Suttee, and soon reached the shore of the small river Tapty, which empties into the Gulf of Cambray near Surat. It is worth noting that this Tapty is where the English, less than two hundred years ago, captured the celebrated pirate Gaspar Corte-Real, and carried him, with his ship's crew, to Bombay. Passepartout awoke at the dawn.

            "prefix-probing": "The conversation fell again. The rhythmic clatter of the train on the rails became the dominant sound, a relentless pulse measuring their progress across the vast Indian subcontinent. Phileas Fogg sat, as always, perfectly still, his gaze fixed somewhere beyond the windowpane, though it was utterly impossible to discern if he registered the swiftly receding landscape of sun-baked fields, scattered villages nestled amongst trees, and occasional groves of exotic foliage. His composure was absolute, a shield impenetrable to the anxieties and uncertainties that might assail lesser men undertaking such an extraordinary journey. Beside him, Aouda, recently rescued from a terrible fate, sat with a quiet, almost fragile grace. The traumatic ordeal had left her visibly shaken, but her large, dark eyes now held a look of dawning hope mixed with a profound sense of displacement and uncertainty about the future stretching before her. She would occasionally glance discreetly towards Mr. Fogg, a silent question in her regard, for this man, so calm, so precise, and so utterly unlike anyone she had ever known, was her unlikely saviour and unexpected guide in a world utterly new to her. Across the carriage, Passepartout fidgeted restlessly. The valiant effort during the rescue had buoyed his spirits temporarily, providing a welcome distraction from his worries, but the sheer audacity of their global undertaking, coupled with the constant gnawing fear of delay and the mysterious Mr. Fix who seemed inexplicably to dog their steps at every turn, kept his nerves on edge. He glanced from his master, whose astonishing equanimity he simultaneously admired and was completely bewildered by, to Aouda, whose delicate and vulnerable situation added another layer of responsibility to his already burdened mind. The tropical landscape outside blurred by – groves of swaying palm trees, muddy rivers winding through the plains, glimpses of distant, hazy hills shimmering in the oppressive heat. Each mile devoured by the speeding locomotive was a precious step closer to their destination, Calcutta, and the next critical leg of their improbable race against the relentless clock. Passepartout sighed inwardly, a sound lost beneath the train's rumble. Eighty days! It seemed an impossible deadline to traverse the globe, yet here they were, being propelled forward by his master’s unwavering will and the ticking hands of a thousand unseen clocks scattered across the globe. He wondered incessantly what further challenges awaited them, what unforeseen obstacles lay in their path between this moment of relative calm and the distant, foggy shores of his beloved England."

Up to his arrival at Bombay, he had entertained hopes that their journey would end there; but, now that they were plainly whirling across India at full speed, a sudden change had come over the spirit of his dreams. His old vagabond nature returned to him; the fantastic ideas of his youth once more took possession of him. He came to regard his master’s project as intended in good earnest, believed in the reality of the bet, and therefore in the tour of the world and the necessity of making it without fail within the designated period. Already he began to worry about possible delays, and accidents which might happen on the way. He recognised himself as being personally interested in the wager, and trembled at the thought that he might have been the means of losing it by his unpardonable folly of the night before. Being much less cool-headed than Mr. Fogg, he was much more restless, counting and recounting the days passed over, uttering maledictions when the train stopped, and accusing it of sluggishness, and mentally blaming Mr. Fogg for not having bribed the engineer. The worthy fellow was ignorant that, while it was possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer, it could not be done on the railway.\nThe train entered the defiles of the Sutpour Mountains, which separate the Khandeish from Bundelcund, towards evening. The next day Sir Francis Cromarty asked Passepartout what time it was; to which, on consulting his watch, he replied that it was three in the morning. This famous timepiece, always regulated on the Greenwich meridian, which was now some seventy-seven degrees westward, was at least four hours slow. Sir Francis corrected Passepartout’s time, whereupon the latter made the same remark that he had done to Fix; and upon the general insisting that the watch should be regulated in each new meridian, since he was constantly going eastward, that is in the face of the sun, and therefore the days were shorter by four minutes for each degree gone over, Passepartout obstinately refused to alter his watch, which he kept at London time. It was an innocent delusion which could harm no one.",

The journey was accomplished without incident; and, during it, Passepartout, with his nose in the air, so to speak, visible and invisible, according to the degree of his thought, felt a new current of ideas passing through him.  No longer was he the giddy vagabond of a few days gone by; he was now an integer of the celebrated Fogg company, and was bound to reach the goal with it.  The prospect of eighty days about the world agitated him; he could not hold in his person.  He was not now concerned about the fantastic sum of the wager, but about the success of the journey.  He was personally interested in the wager, and shuddered at the thought that he might have compromised it by his unpardonable folly of the day before.  He cursed himself for having been so clumsy, and now accused with all his bitterness the Brahmin who had laid the sacrilegious trap.  His nervous temperament reappeared.  The anxieties of the journey were added to the anxieties of his master.  He was constantly uneasy, and the halts of the train, instead of soothing him, made him nervous.  He mentally accused Mr. Fogg of not having bribed the engineer, and felt the desire to push the locomotive himself.  The engineer, however, could not hasten the speed, for the train would not pass forty miles an hour, a speed, however, which was quite sufficient to satisfy Mr. Fogg.  The travellers passed the night at Burhampoor, and the next day they descended the Vindhia Mountains, stopping awhile on the banks of the Nerbudda, a river which serves as the northern boundary of the Dekkan.  The next day the train, passing by Assurghur, and skirting the banks of the Tapty, took them to Burhampoor, where Passepartout, on the previous evening, according to his usual habit, had purchased some of the local chronicles, by which he learned that the train, leaving the main line, would stop at the village of Kholby.  Burhampoor is in the district of Khandeish, one of the most populous provinces of the Dekkan.

Sir Francis, however, was observing him, and was amused by his restless movements.  The train entered the Sutpour Mountains, and skirted along precipices and curves.  Suddenly, Sir Francis Cromarty asked Passepartout what time it was.  Passepartout consulted his watch, which he had not adjusted since leaving London.  \"Ten minutes past three, sir,\" he answered.  \"Your watch is slow,\" said Sir Francis.  \"You are not aware that we have been travelling eastward for more than a week, and that consequently the days are shorter by four minutes for each degree we pass over.  You have therefore lost about forty minutes since you left London.\"  \"Forty minutes lost!\" cried Passepartout.  \"Well, I don't care.  I shall keep my watch at London time.

They were mounted on the splendid animal purchased from the Indian, a male of great strength and docility. The rough track wound through dense forests where towering trees formed a thick canopy. The air was heavy with the scent of tropical vegetation and the sounds of the jungle. Passepartout, seated precariously behind Mr. Fogg, found the elephant's rolling motion a considerable discomfort, contrasting with the smooth travel he preferred. He clung on, wide-eyed, observing the exotic and somewhat menacing landscape that unfolded before him. Mr. Fogg, maintaining his usual composure, sat erect, occasionally consulting his watch and the detailed map of India he carried. He seemed as unconcerned by their transport as in his comfortable armchair at Pall Mall. Aouda, after initial apprehension, grew accustomed to the steady, powerful stride of the great beast, finding a curious sense of security in its strength. Kincaid, the Parsi driver, guided the elephant unerringly through undergrowth, across streams, and over uneven ground. Their progress was slow but continuous. They passed through remote villages, the inhabitants emerging to gaze at the strange sight of Europeans travelling by elephant. The scenery was wild and beautiful: glimpses of startled wildlife, the flash of colourful plumage, the rustle of unseen creatures in the thickets. The intense heat was tempered by the forest shade. They pushed on, covering mile after mile, venturing deeper into the heart of the Indian interior. Their objective was Allahabad, the point where the railway line resumed, but reaching it required traversing this unpredictable terrain. Every hour was critical, each league a step closer to their goal, yet the vastness of the country seemed to stretch endlessly before them. As the sun began its descent, painting the sky, they felt the urgency of their race against time, reminded that one more day of their eighty was closing in this distant, mysterious land."

The conductor, calling out, “Passengers will stop here!” passed down the line.\n\nPhileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty, who had been chatting in the same carriage, were at first surprised at this halt in the midst of a forest, with no station in view. But, when they saw the conductor waving to the passengers to alight, Sir Francis asked:\n\n“Where are we?”\n\n“At the hamlet of Kholby.”\n\n“Do we stop here?”\n\n“Certainly. The railway isn’t finished.”\n\n“What! not finished?” cried Sir Francis. “The papers announced the opening of the whole line.”\n\n“What would you have, Sir Francis? The papers were mistaken. The line is interrupted for a distance of about fifty miles between this station of Kholby and Allahabad, where the line begins again. The engineers have not yet got track through.”\n\n“But the company sells tickets from Bombay to Calcutta?” retorted Sir Francis, who was growing warm.\n\n“No doubt,” replied the conductor; “but the passengers know that they must provide means of transportation for themselves from Kholby to Allahabad.”\n\nSir Francis was furious. Passepartout, who had got out after his master, was quickly informed of the situation. He would willingly have pitched the conductor head foremost from the train, but the latter was an old Hindoo, and shewed no signs of flinching.\n\nPassepartout remembered that he had by him a map of India, and thought he might as well examine it. He unfolded it, and quickly perceived that a railway line, clearly traced, extended from Kholby to Allahabad. Upon this map the interruption was not indicated.\n\nSir Francis Cromarty now turned to Phileas Fogg, and said:\n\n“What are we to do, Fogg?”\n\n“Nothing but evidently continue our journey,” replied Phileas Fogg, not in the least disturbed.\n\n“But we are at a standstill.”\n\n“No doubt. The railway stops here.”\n\n“But there’s a gap of fifty miles.”\n\n“Well, we will fill up the gap by some means.”\n\n“We can’t walk it in either an hour or two.”\n\n“No, it will take longer.”\n\nPhileas Fogg pronounced these words with perfect calmness. He was an optimist, and always exacted the inevitable obstacles as coming in the regular order of events.\n\n“But we have two days gained,” said Sir Francis.\n\n“And we are due in Calcutta on the 25th at noon,” replied Mr. Fogg. “That is the 22nd, and we shall reach Allahabad to-morrow.”\n\n“By what means of conveyance?”\n\n“An elephant, perhaps. We will find some rajah near by who has one to hire.”",

The passengers peered out, a murmur of surprise escalating to exclamations of disbelief and annoyance. The conductor, alighting, looked as bewildered as the passengers. To the barrage of questions, he gave the frustrating explanation: the railway line, marked as completed on maps and timetables, abruptly ended here. The section between Kholby and Allahabad, a critical fifty-mile stretch, was unfinished. Engineers had simply stopped, leaving this gap. Indignation rose among travellers; they had paid for a through passage. One gentleman waved a guidebook, arguing it showed the line running all the way.Phileas Fogg remained perfectly serene. No hint of impatience or anger creased his brow. He merely turned to Passepartout, his hand on his Bradshaw. \"Passepartout,\" he said calmly, \"the railway does not go any further.\"Passepartout, less composed, stared at the broken rails disappearing into the jungle with dismay. \"Monsieur,\" he stammered, \"but... the schedule! We are delayed!\"\"We anticipated contingencies,\" Fogg replied, consulting his watch. \"However, an unfinished railway was not one. The distance to Allahabad is approximately fifty miles. We must find conveyance to cover this distance swiftly to catch the steamer from Calcutta.\"The glade offered little solution. Bungalows housed idle workers. A few carts and horses were near cabins, not enough for passengers. Fogg scanned surroundings, calculating alternatives, weighing time against distance and feasibility of finding transport in this remote spot. The jungle pressed close, silent."

          "text_segment": "It was but too true that the railway came to a termination at this point. The papers were like some watches, which have a way of getting too fast, and had been premature in their announcement of the completion of the line. The greater part of the travellers were aware of this interruption, and, leaving the train, they began to engage such vehicles as the village could provide four-wheeled palkigharis, waggons drawn by zebus, carriages that looked like perambulating pagodas, palanquins, ponies, and what not.\nMr. Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty, after searching the village from end to end, came back without having found anything.\n“I shall go afoot,” said Phileas Fogg.\nPassepartout, who had now rejoined his master, made a wry grimace, as he thought of his magnificent, but too frail Indian shoes. Happily he too had been looking about him, and, after a moment’s hesitation, said, “Monsieur, I think I have found a means of conveyance.”\n“What?”\n“An elephant! An elephant that belongs to an Indian who lives but a hundred steps from here.”\n“Let’s go and see the elephant,” replied Mr. Fogg.\nThey soon reached a small hut, near which, enclosed within some high palings, was the animal in question. An Indian came out of the hut, and, at their request, conducted them within the enclosure. The elephant, which its owner had reared, not for a beast of burden, but for warlike purposes, was half domesticated. The Indian had begun already, by often irritating him, and feeding him every three months on sugar and butter, to impart to him a ferocity not in his nature, this method being often employed by those who train the Indian elephants for battle. Happily, however, for Mr. Fogg, the animal’s instruction in this direction had not gone far, and the elephant still preserved his natural gentleness. Kiouni—this was the name of the beast—could doubtless travel rapidly for a long time, and, in default of any other means of conveyance, Mr. Fogg resolved to hire him. But elephants are far from cheap in India, where they are becoming scarce, the males, which alone are suitable for circus shows, are much sought, especially as but few of them are domesticated. When therefore Mr. Fogg proposed to the Indian to hire Kiouni, he refused point-blank. Mr. Fogg persisted, offering the excessive sum of ten pounds an hour for the loan of the beast to Allahabad. Refused. Twenty pounds? Refused also. Forty pounds? Still refused. Passepartout jumped at each advance; but the Indian declined to be tempted. Yet the offer was an alluring one, for, supposing it took the elephant fifteen hours to reach Allahabad, his owner would receive no less than six hundred pounds sterling.\nPhileas Fogg, without getting in the least flurried, then proposed to purchase the animal outright, and at first offered a thousand pounds for him. The Indian, perhaps thinking he was going to make a great bargain, still refused.\nSir Francis Cromarty took Mr. Fogg aside, and begged him to reflect before he went any further; to which that gentleman replied that he was not in the habit of acting rashly, that a bet of twenty thousand pounds was at stake, that the elephant was absolutely necessary to him, and that he would secure him if he had to pay twenty times his value. Returning to the Indian, whose small, sharp eyes, glistening with avarice, betrayed that with him it was only a question of how great a price he could obtain. Mr. Fogg offered first twelve hundred, then fifteen hundred, eighteen hundred, two thousand pounds. Passepartout, usually so rubicund, was fairly white with suspense.\nAt two thousand pounds the Indian yielded.\n“What a price, good heavens!” cried Passepartout, “for an elephant.”",

Passepartout made a wry grimace, as if his feet were already suffering. Suddenly, he remembered the elephant he had seen. “An elephant!” cried Passepartout. “An elephant, sir! I saw one just now, a little way off, with his owner.” “Let us go and see the elephant,” said Mr. Fogg. They soon reached a small hut, near which was enclosed an animal of the species indicated. An Indian, its owner, was squatting near it. The elephant, which was a male, and had been trained for labour, possessed a sagacity peculiar to that race, and was remarkable for its gentleness; but it was not used to being ridden. “Can I hire your elephant?” asked Mr. Fogg. The Indian shook his head. “I wish to hire him by the day,” added Mr. Fogg. The Indian still shook his head. “By the hour, then?” The Indian’s head was agitated in the negative direction. “To hire him is impossible,” said the Indian, in English. “But to buy him?” replied Mr. Fogg. The Indian did not answer. “I will give you ten pounds an hour for the use of your elephant,” said Mr. Fogg, in English. “Ten pounds!” cried Sir Francis Cromarty, “a fabulous price for an elephant!” Passepartout was as much astonished as Sir Francis. The Indian, however, did not seem surprised. If the railway was not finished, it was not his fault. He was not losing anything by the operation. He remained impassive. “Twenty pounds?” said Mr. Fogg. The Indian still shook his head. “Forty pounds?” Still the same response. Sir Francis Cromarty began to get impatient. Passepartout was in a cold perspiration. Mr. Fogg alone preserved his calm. “Is he for sale?” asked Mr. Fogg. The Indian, who had been considering, replied, “For sale.” “What is the price?” “Two thousand pounds.” “Two thousand pounds!” cried Sir Francis Cromarty. “Mr. Fogg, if you intend to buy this elephant at that price, I shall consider it my duty to warn you that you are throwing your money out of the window.” “I have not the twenty thousand pounds that I shall lose, Sir Francis, if I do not get to Allahabad by noon on the 25th,” replied Mr. Fogg, coolly. “The elephant is necessary to me. I will buy him.” “Two thousand pounds!” muttered Passepartout. “A fine price for an elephant!” Mr. Fogg, without noticing Passepartout’s exclamation, had already begun to bargain with the Indian. “You will not take less than two thousand pounds?” “Not a farthing less.” Mr. Fogg drew from his pocket a bundle of bank-notes. Sir Francis Cromarty and Passepartout watched him with intense interest. Phileas Fogg counted out the bank-notes, and handed them to the Indian. They amounted to two thousand pounds. “Here,” said Mr. Fogg, “are two thousand pounds.” The Indian took the money, and, with a profound salaam, indicated that the elephant was at Mr. Fogg’s disposal. Passepartout breathed again. It was a heavy load off his mind. The elephant was his master’s property. He could not be hired, but he could be bought. And at what a price! Two thousand pounds for an elephant! It was a sum that would have built a railway.",

            "prefix-probing": "It was but too true that the railway came to a termination at this point. The station was a mere clearing in the jungle, unfinished and raw, populated by a few temporary sheds and a bewildered crowd of passengers who had just disembarked. Sir Francis Cromarty, visibly surprised, turned to Mr. Fogg. \"The railway ends here, Mr. Fogg!\" he exclaimed. \"They told us it went all the way to Allahabad!\" \"The papers were misinformed,\" replied Phileas Fogg calmly, adjusting his glasses. \"The line is not completed. There is a gap of fifty miles between this point, which I presume is Kholby, and Allahabad, where the railway recommences.\" Passepartout, hearing this, threw up his arms in consternation. \"Fifty miles! And the time, monsieur! The time!\" Mr. Fogg consulted his watch. \"We have plenty of time, Passepartout. The railway will be finished eventually, but for now, we must find another means of transport.\" The situation, inconvenient as it was, did not ruffle Mr. Fogg's composure. He was prepared for unforeseen obstacles. He immediately began inquiring among the few locals present, his tone as measured and precise as ever. It quickly became clear that carts, wagons, or palanquins were scarce and unreliable in this region. The only practical means of traversing the dense jungle gap was by elephant. An elephant! Passepartout's eyes widened further. This was an unexpected twist in their otherwise meticulously planned journey. Sir Francis Cromarty agreed that an elephant seemed the only feasible solution, provided one could be found. Such animals were expensive and their owners often demanded exorbitant prices for long journeys, especially on short notice. Mr. Fogg, however, was not deterred by the prospect of expense. His concern was speed and certainty. He instructed Passepartout to join the search. They scoured the small temporary settlement and the surrounding village, asking every person they met if they knew of an elephant for hire or sale. After an hour of diligent searching, Passepartout returned with news. He had found an owner, an Indian man, who possessed a fine animal suitable for the journey. The man was willing to sell, but the price was astronomical: two thousand pounds sterling. Sir Francis was aghast. \"Two thousand pounds for an elephant! That's an outrageous sum, Mr. Fogg!\" \"It is a necessary sum, Sir Francis,\" replied Fogg, without hesitation. To a man like Phileas Fogg, who was wagering half his fortune, two thousand pounds was a small price to pay to keep his schedule intact. He went directly to the owner, examined the elephant – a male animal, half-tamed, purchased by the owner more for fighting than for transport – and concluded the transaction without haggling. The owner, a stout Indian with a shrewd look, was astonished but delighted. The elephant, named Kamosh, was quickly fitted out. A sort of houdah, a seat or platform, was fixed upon its back. A guide, a Parsi man named Kiouni, skilled in navigating the region, was hired at a high fee. He knew the paths through the jungle and the best way to handle the animal. Provisions were bought in the village – rice, dried meat, biscuits, and water. By noon, everything was ready. Mr. Fogg paid the Parsi guide generously in advance, ensuring his loyalty and motivation. Sir Francis Cromarty, though not strictly needing to go this way (he intended to continue to Calcutta via a different route later), decided to accompany them, intrigued by Mr. Fogg's remarkable journey and efficiency. They mounted the elephant. Mr. Fogg sat in front, impassive as ever, consulting his pocket-map. Sir Francis sat beside him. Passepartout, thrilled by the novel experience, perched behind, enjoying the rhythmic sway of the beast. Kiouni the guide took his place on the elephant's neck, holding the goad. Kamosh started forward, lumbering slowly but steadily into the dense, shadowy jungle. The path was narrow and winding, overgrown with thick vegetation that brushed against the sides of the houdah. The air grew heavy and humid, filled with the sounds of unseen insects and birds. The sunlight filtered through the canopy in shifting patterns. They were truly off the beaten track, moving through a wild, untamed landscape where few Europeans dared to travel. The elephant's great feet crushed branches and pushed aside obstacles, clearing a path through the undergrowth. The silence of the jungle was broken only by the rhythmic padding of Kamosh's feet, the rustling of leaves, and the occasional call of a distant animal. The journey was arduous. The heat was intense, and the progress slow. The path ascended and descended gentle slopes, crossed streams, and sometimes disappeared altogether, forcing the guide to navigate by instinct and knowledge of the terrain. Mr. Fogg remained outwardly unaffected, checking his watch periodically and referring to his map, seemingly as comfortable in the jungle houdah as he would be in his Reform Club armchair. Passepartout, initially excited, found the constant swaying tiring but fascinating, observing the strange new plants and animals that populated the forest. Sir Francis, a seasoned traveler in India, found the journey challenging but also appreciated the raw beauty of the landscape. They traveled for several hours, the afternoon wearing on. The jungle seemed endless, a green, undulating sea stretching in every direction. The guide proved knowledgeable and kept them moving steadily towards the north-east, aiming for Allahabad. As dusk began to fall, the sounds of the jungle changed, becoming more mysterious and sometimes unnerving. They planned to travel as much as possible before making a brief stop. The elephant's pace, though slow, was tireless, and they covered a surprising amount of ground given the difficult terrain. The Parsi guide occasionally spoke softly to Kamosh, urging him on. This unexpected leg of the journey added an element of adventure that Passepartout had secretly longed for, despite his initial alarm at the railway's end. For Phileas Fogg, it was simply another problem to be solved, another calculation of distance, time, and resources. The cost was high, the method unconventional, but it promised to get him to Allahabad on schedule. The fifty miles stretched before them, a wilderness to be conquered by the patient strength of their purchased beast."

'We cannot find any other elephant, and we must not lose time. We have missed the train, and we must get to Allahabad before the fifth, at noon, if we would catch the Calcutta steamer.' 'You are right,' said Sir Francis, 'if you can afford to pay twenty thousand francs for an elephant, take him.' Mr. Fogg would not, however, consent to pay more than two thousand pounds for the elephant, for if he paid any more, Passepartout would imagine he was throwing his money away. He therefore stipulated that the elephant should be sold to him for the sum demanded, and that the animal should not be employed in future at the public expense. The Indian, perceiving that Mr. Fogg was firm, consented to sell, and the animal, named Kiouni, was at once unmoored and brought out. The Parsee mounted upon the elephant’s neck, and placed upon his back a kind of saddle-cloth, and two howdahs, which were flung over his flanks. Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty took their places in the howdahs, and Passepartout bestrode the saddle-cloth between them. The Parsee, who was an expert, covered his elephant’s neck with a net, and wound it around his trunk, to serve as a bridle. The elephant was provided with a supply of provisions, purchased at Kholby, and, at nine o’clock, the guide put him to his pace in the dense palm forest.",

Bombay, being one of the great commercial ports of India, attracted all sorts of individuals seeking employment, and amongst them were numerous Parsees, natives, and half-castes, who offered their services as guides across the country. Fogg and Passepartout had no difficulty in finding one. He was a Parsee, a man of intelligence and good appearance, who knew the language and the district. His name was unknown to the narrative, but his efficiency was soon demonstrated. They hired him without much negotiation, agreeing on a reasonable sum for the journey to the end of the railway line. With the guide secured, Phileas Fogg calmly made the final arrangements. He purchased necessary supplies for the journey inland and confirmed the railway schedule. They would depart that very day, taking the train from Bombay to Allahabad, or at least as far as the track currently extended. The adventure across the subcontinent was about to begin in earnest, leaving the bustling port city behind for the unknown landscapes within."

In either case, it was a high price for the service, and the guide well deserved it, if the difficulty of the journey be considered. The travellers resumed their journey at eight o'clock. The ground now began to rise, and at half-past twelve they reached the pass of Kholby, the highest point of the Vindhias, more than two thousand feet above the level of the sea. From this summit they perceived the vast expanses of forest, extending as far as the eye could reach; and in the midst of the lines of trees, which seemed traced by a ruler, were here and there indicated the sharp outlines of forts built by the mountaineers. In crossing the Vindhias, Kiouni displayed a singular sagacity and sureness of foot, always taking the least difficult paths, and avoiding the rocks and obstacles which might impede his march.

He tried to alleviate the fatigue by varying his position; now sitting cross-legged, like a tailor; now astride, as one mounts a horse; now kneeling; now lying at full length. But all in vain; the jolting was incessant. He cried out with pain and rage; but the cry was drowned by the noise of the elephant's bells. He consoled himself, however, by thinking of the splendid wardrobe which the generous Fogg had promised him, and which he would soon be able to wear.

The track itself stopped abruptly a few miles further on, swallowed by dense forests and rugged terrain. Having purchased the elephant, Kiour, for a considerable sum from a rajah, Phileas Fogg, Passepartout, and their Parsi guide began their precarious trek across the eighty-mile gap that separated the railhead at Kholby from the next station at Allahabad. The path was barely discernible, a winding track through the heart of the Indian jungle. Towering trees formed a dense canopy overhead, casting the path in perpetual twilight. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and exotic blossoms, and the incessant hum of unseen insects filled the silence. Kiour, despite his bulk, moved with surprising agility, navigating the uneven ground and pushing aside thick undergrowth with his trunk. Passepartout, perched precariously behind his master, found the motion far from comfortable, swaying violently with each step. He kept a wary eye on the surrounding vegetation, half-expecting to encounter some wild beast. Mr. Fogg, however, remained perfectly calm, seated rigidly on the elephant's back, consulting his watch and map with his usual imperturbable demeanour. The guide led the way, axe in hand, occasionally hacking at obstructive vines or branches. Progress was slow but steady. The heat was oppressive during the day, and the nights brought a different kind of discomfort \n– cool dampness and the unsettling sounds of the wilderness. They pressed on, driven by the necessity of reaching Allahabad within the tight schedule Mr. Fogg had set. Every mile gained brought them closer to their goal, but the jungle seemed determined to test their resolve."

All this portion of Bundelcund, which is little frequented by travellers, is inhabited by a fanatical population, hardened in the most horrible practices of the Hindoo faith. The English have not been able to secure complete dominion over this territory, which is subjected to the influence of rajahs, whom it is almost impossible to reach in their inaccessible mountain fastnesses. The travellers several times saw bands of ferocious Indians, who, when they perceived the elephant striding across-country, made angry and threatening motions. The Parsee avoided them as much as possible. Few animals were observed on the route; even the monkeys hurried from their path with contortions and grimaces which convulsed Passepartout with laughter.\nIn the midst of his gaiety, however, one thought troubled the worthy servant. What would Mr. Fogg do with the elephant when he got to Allahabad? Would he carry him on with him? Impossible! The cost of transporting him would make him ruinously expensive. Would he sell him, or set him free? The estimable beast certainly deserved some consideration.

The elephant resumed his rapid pace through the dense forests, and at four o’clock they had covered some sixteen miles. Half an hour later they stopped at the village of Kholby, where they stayed during the night. They set out again at sunrise. The guide chose the less frequented roads; and wound through the clumps of trees, which were cut in every direction. They reached at noon the village of Chattra, and stopped there for a moment, to rest the animal and themselves. They entered, at two o’clock, a wilder and more savage-looking country. There were still forests, but less dense. There were also copses of palms and date-trees, vast, dry plains, dotted with a few scraggy shrubs, and great rocks, in the midst of which were perched some Hindoo convents, — veritable human eyries, into which the English could not penetrate; for the country was under the influence of rajahs who were almost independent, and whom the British authority had not completely subjugated. The travellers did not so frequently see passengers. Occasionally they came upon a group of Indians, who, with gestures and savage cries, betrayed their hatred for the English; and the Parsee guide redoubled his precautions, and avoided them as much as possible. Few animals were seen upon the plains: a few solitary elephants, carrying their rajahs; and a few monkeys, which, with their contortions and grimaces, entertained Passepartout. This part of India was not very safe, as it was tolerably well covered with bandits, who lived by plunder. The government takes no notice of them, and does not care to undertake useless expeditions against these rascals, who invariably take refuge in inaccessible retreats. Passepartout began to be anxious. His reflection, which was generally limited to objects in his immediate vicinity, now extended into the future. Up to this moment he had been so happy! The kind and thoughtful Mr. Fogg, the devoted Aouda, the brave Sir Francis Cromarty, the intelligent guide, the excellent Kiouni, had rid his mind of all anxiety. But now that he had reached this region, so unfortunately recommended by stories and facts, he could not help feeling some apprehensions. He saw bandits, assassins, and suttees everywhere. These were rascals, who burned women alive, which filled him with horror. There was still another thing that troubled Passepartout, who was not less preoccupied about the future of the elephant than about his own. What did Mr. Fogg intend to do with Kiouni? Would he carry his beneficence so far as to take the animal with him to London? He could not, however, transport him by railway. And if he sold him, the price of the elephant would bring in a large sum, which, if added to what the company would have to refund, would constitute a handsome profit. If, on the other hand, the traveller should abandon him, he ought at least to give the poor beast to somebody who would take care of him; and, in any case, Mr. Fogg’s generosity did not extend to the useless outlay. This thought suddenly suggested to Passepartout the possibility of Mr. Fogg’s presenting him with the elephant. A present of the kind, however, would ruin him; and he could not for the life of him see what he should do with an elephant, in the back slums of Paris. However it was, the worthy fellow worried about this, and pondered over the matter for a whole hour.",

The magnificent beast moved with surprising speed, guided by the skilled Parsee. Phileas Fogg, Passepartout, and Sir Francis Cromarty were mounted in the howdah, rocking gently. The path was often overgrown, requiring the Parsee to clear the way with his hatchet. They passed through thickets, crossed streams, and traversed uneven ground, the wilderness pressing in around them. As evening fell, the jungle grew darker and more mysterious. The sounds changed, becoming a chorus of unseen creatures. They halted briefly for a simple meal of provisions carried with them. Fogg remained stoic and observant, while Passepartout, despite his initial reservations, found himself fascinated by the strange beauty of the Indian interior. Sir Francis shared anecdotes of past adventures. They resumed their journey under the moonlight, Kamosh padding silently through the night. The air grew cooler, carrying the scent of damp earth and exotic flowers. Fatigue set in, but the urgency of Fogg's wager drove them forward. Hour after hour, they pressed on, the rhythmic sway of the elephant a constant reminder of their peculiar means of transport. The landscape gradually changed as they moved eastward, the jungle beginning to thin in places. Finally, as dawn approached, the Parsee announced that their destination was near. The spires of Allahabad came into view as the sun rose, signaling the end of this unexpected and arduous leg of their incredible race against time."

The deep jungle enveloped them, filled with the unique sounds of the Indian night. While settling in, a faint light and a peculiar chanting caught their attention. Driven by curiosity, Fogg, Passepartout, and Sir Francis Cromarty, led by their Parsee guide, moved carefully toward the sound. They arrived at a clearing witnessing a disturbing scene. A procession of priests and guards encircled a palanquin carrying a woman, dressed in fine garments but lying still. The Parsee, in hushed tones, revealed it was a suttee – the horrific forced sacrifice of a widow. The victim was Aouda, the lovely daughter of a wealthy Parsi merchant, condemned by her late husband's relations. Sir Francis was aghast. Fogg, however, showed no hesitation. \"We must save her,\" he declared simply. Passepartout, despite his fear, nodded assent. The quiet night demanded a swift, daring plan to intervene in this barbaric act before sunrise."

The train, belonging to the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, sped onward through the diverse landscapes of India. Plains stretched into the distance, dotted with palm trees and lush vegetation. They passed by villages, catch glimpses of everyday life – women drawing water from wells, children playing, laborers working in fields. The rhythm of the train on the rails became a constant companion, punctuated by the occasional whistle or the sight of distant hills. Fogg, impassive as ever, remained occupied with his book, only occasionally glancing out the window. Passepartout, however, was utterly fascinated by the exotic sights and sounds of this new world. He watched the passing scenery with wide-eyed wonder, absorbing the vibrant colours and unfamiliar customs. The guide, an experienced local, offered brief explanations about the regions they traversed and the history of the railway, a marvel of modern engineering connecting vast distances across the subcontinent. They crossed rivers on impressive bridges and tunnels bored through rock. The sun climbed higher, then began its descent, painting the sky in warm hues. The hope of reaching Allahabad by evening seemed increasingly plausible with every mile they covered, the iron horse tirelessly devouring the distance, carrying its peculiar passengers towards their next connection and the relentless pursuit of their ambitious global itinerary, each moment counted against the strict deadline Phileas Fogg had set for himself in London, a world away from the dusty plains and tropical air surrounding them now."

We should not be seen; the guide untied the elephant and led him into the densest part of the wood. He instructed the travellers to be still, while he prepared himself for a quick escape, should it be necessary to retreat. He expected, however, that the procession would pass without their being observed, as the thick foliage concealed them from view.",

Phileas Fogg sat in stoic silence, his eyes fixed on his watch, the ticking hands marking the relentless passage of time towards the 8:45 PM deadline at the Reform Club. Passepartout paced nervously, glancing out the window at the blurring countryside, his heart pounding with a mixture of anxiety and fragile hope. Aouda watched Fogg, her gaze filled with concern. Detective Fix was also aboard, no longer an antagonist but a fellow traveler, his earlier error weighing heavily upon him. The engine roared, devouring the miles, but the distance to London felt immense. Could this frantic, last-ditch effort succeed? After months of journeying across continents and oceans, overcoming countless obstacles, was their fate to be decided by a few critical hours on an English railway line? The air in the carriage was thick with tension, the rhythmic clatter of the wheels on the tracks a constant, maddening reminder of the race against the clock, a race that had begun eighty days ago and was now reaching its feverish climax. The landscape outside darkened as dusk approached, mirroring the encroaching shadow of potential failure."

They were surrounded by men, women, and children, who sang a kind of lugubrious psalm, interrupted at regular intervals by the tambourines and cymbals; while behind them was drawn a car with large wheels, the spokes of which represented serpents entwined with each other. Upon the car, which was drawn by four richly caparisoned zebus, stood a hideous statue with four arms, the body coloured a dull red, with haggard eyes, dishevelled hair, protruding tongue, and lips tinted with betel.

Never!”\nThe Parsee made a motion to keep silence.\nA group of old fakirs were capering and making a wild ado round the statue; these were striped with ochre, and covered with cuts whence their blood issued drop by drop—stupid fanatics, who, in the great Indian ceremonies, still throw themselves under the wheels of Juggernaut. Some Brahmins, clad in all the sumptuousness of Oriental apparel, and leading a woman who faltered at every step, followed. This woman was young, and as fair as a European. Her head and neck, shoulders, ears, arms, hands, and toes were loaded down with jewels and gems with bracelets, earrings, and rings; while a tunic bordered with gold, and covered with a light muslin robe, betrayed the outline of her form.\nThe guards who followed the young woman presented a violent contrast to her, armed as they were with naked sabres hung at their waists, and long damascened pistols, and bearing a corpse on a palanquin. It was the body of an old man, gorgeously arrayed in the habiliments of a rajah, wearing, as in life, a turban embroidered with pearls, a robe of tissue of silk and gold, a scarf of cashmere sewed with diamonds, and the magnificent weapons of a Hindoo prince.

            "prefix-probing": "...The discordant tones of the voices and instruments drew nearer, and now droning songs mingled with the sound of the tambourines and cymbals. Soon, at the bend of the road, a dark procession appeared. At its head marched priests, their bodies smeared with coloured streaks, performing wild incantations. Behind them came a mob of fanatics, their faces contorted with religious frenzy, agitated by the rhythms and the intoxicating fumes of *bang*. Then, carried on a palanquin borne by bearers, was the victim. It was the young woman they had seen earlier, seemingly lifeless, but draped in rich shawls, her head falling back on her shoulders. It was evident that, overcome by the fumes of hemp and opium, she was unconscious, a tragic figure in the midst of the barbaric display. Sir Francis Cromarty turned pale, his features tightening with horror. Passepartout felt a profound shiver run down his spine at the sight. Phileas Fogg, though outwardly impassive, watched the scene with a steady gaze that absorbed every detail. He saw the fanatical crowd, the wild gestures, the terrifying anticipation in their eyes. \"The poor woman!\" murmured Sir Francis, his voice low with distress. \"And to think this abominable custom still exists, almost untouched by our presence here! They are taking her now to the pagoda of Pillaji, which is some two miles from here. There, according to their custom, she will be burned alive with the body of her dead husband on the pyre.\" Fogg did not reply immediately. He observed intensely, his mind calculating possibilities and risks with his usual efficiency. Then, his lips parted. \"We must save her.\" Sir Francis stared at him, utterly astonished. Passepartout's eyes widened with alarm and surprise at his master's sudden resolve. \"Save her, Mr. Fogg? But how?\" exclaimed Sir Francis, his voice filled with incredulity. \"These are fierce savages! They'd tear us to pieces if we dared to interfere!\" \"That may be,\" replied Fogg calmly, unruffled by the evident danger, \"but we cannot stand by and let this woman perish in this brutal manner.\" \"We are far too few to attempt this,\" argued Sir Francis, attempting to reason with him. \"And even if by some miracle we succeeded, we'd have the entire country against us, pursued relentlessly as criminals.\" \"The risk is great, but I believe it is not insurmountable,\" said Fogg, his gaze fixed on the receding crowd. \"We must wait until nightfall. Then we attempt to snatch her from their hands under cover of complete darkness and surprise.\" The procession passed and its sounds gradually faded completely. The three men remained hidden amongst the dense trees, their hearts pounding with a mixture of fear and grim determination. They knew they contemplated an act of extreme audacity, risking their lives and the entire wager. But the poignant sight of the woman's plight had stirred even Fogg's deep sense of justice and humanity beyond the rigid demands of his schedule. As the last straggler disappeared from view, they emerged cautiously. The road was empty, now bathed in the late afternoon sun, but the air vibrated with unpleasant echoes. The pyre was being prepared at the pagoda. The waiting would be agonizingly tense. They decided immediately to follow the path at a safe distance, keeping strictly to the cover of the trees, to locate the pagoda and find a suitable hiding place until darkness fell. The profound gravity of their sudden, spontaneous decision hung heavy. This perilous detour wasn't in the schedule, nor the logic of the wager, but it had become an unavoidable imperative."

The procession slowly wound under the trees, and soon its last ranks disappeared in the depths of the wood. The songs gradually died away; occasionally cries were heard in the distance, until at last all was silence again.\nPhileas Fogg had heard what Sir Francis said, and, as soon as the procession had disappeared, asked: “What is a suttee?”\n“A suttee,” returned the general, “is a human sacrifice, but a voluntary one. The woman you have just seen will be burned to-morrow at the dawn of day.”\n“Oh, the scoundrels!” cried Passepartout, who could not repress his indignation.\n“And the corpse?” asked Mr. Fogg.\n“Is that of the prince, her husband,” said the guide; “an independent rajah of Bundelcund.”\n“Is it possible,” resumed Phileas Fogg, his voice betraying not the least emotion, “that these barbarous customs still exist in India, and that the English have been unable to put a stop to them?”\n“These sacrifices do not occur in the larger portion of India,” replied Sir Francis; “but we have no power over these savage territories, and especially here in Bundelcund. The whole district north of the Vindhias is the theatre of incessant murders and pillage.”\n“The poor wretch!” exclaimed Passepartout, “to be burned alive!”\n“Yes,” returned Sir Francis, “burned alive. And, if she were not, you cannot conceive what treatment she would be obliged to submit to from her relatives. They would shave off her hair, feed her on a scanty allowance of rice, treat her with contempt; she would be looked upon as an unclean creature, and would die in some corner, like a scurvy dog. The prospect of so frightful an existence drives these poor creatures to the sacrifice much more than love or religious fanaticism. Sometimes, however, the sacrifice is really voluntary, and it requires the active interference of the Government to prevent it. Several years ago, when I was living at Bombay, a young widow asked permission of the governor to be burned along with her husband’s body; but, as you may imagine, he refused. The woman left the town, took refuge with an independent rajah, and there carried out her self-devoted purpose.”\nWhile Sir Francis was speaking, the guide shook his head several times, and now said: “The sacrifice which will take place to-morrow at dawn is not a voluntary one.”\n“How do you know?”\n“Everybody knows about this affair in Bundelcund.”\n“But the wretched creature did not seem to be making any resistance,” observed Sir Francis.\n“That was because they had intoxicated her with fumes of hemp and opium.”\n“But where are they taking her?”\n“To the pagoda of Pillaji, two miles from here; she will pass the night there.”\n“And the sacrifice will take place—”\n“To-morrow, at the first light of dawn.”",

Silence reigned again, and Phileas Fogg turned to Sir Francis Cromarty, who said:\n“A suttee, Mr. Fogg, is a human sacrifice—a sacrifice, however, which is voluntary. The woman you have seen will be burned alive to-morrow at the dawn of day on the funeral pyre of the husband whose corpse she accompanies.”\nPassepartout made a grimace of horror, and Sir Francis added:\n“Yes. These sacrifices are no longer common in India. They were put down by the English government, and happily perished with the custom of thuggee. But we are in the district of Bundelcund, and that part of it which our train does not go through. The princes of this region are perfectly independent, and one may see here frightful examples of the old Hindoo customs, if they are to be called customs. The victim, in this instance, is not a voluntary one.”\n“How do you mean?” asked Sir Francis.\n“This woman is not following her husband to the grave of her own free will,” said the guide. “She has been drugged with hemp and opium, and forced to the sacrifice.”\n“The wretches!” cried Passepartout, with indignation.\n“And the corpse?” asked Mr. Fogg.\n“It is that of a Hindoo prince, an independent rajah of Bundelcund,” replied the guide.\n“Is it possible,” said Phileas Fogg, his voice free from all emotion, “that these barbarous customs still exist in India, and that the English do not succeed in putting an end to them?”\n“In the greater part of India,” replied Sir Francis, “these sacrifices are no longer performed. But we have simply evangelized the districts over which we have direct control, and we are not able to act where we have no jurisdiction, and among the independent princes of Bundelcund, like the one whose wife you have just seen pass, the horrible custom still prevails. Furthermore, the victim is not, as you say, forced to the sacrifice. If she were not drugged, she would doubtless run away. But once intoxicated with opium and hemp, it is impossible for her to resist. This horrible fact is well known, and a number of English officers are aware of it, and yet they cannot intervene. For the woman belongs to a prince who is independent.”\n“But the wretch!” cried Passepartout, “who, instead of protecting his wife, drugs her so that she may be burned alive!”\n“The prince is not alive,” replied the guide. “He died two days ago, of an apoplectic fit. And it is his successor, his brother, who is responsible for this.”\n“And what is the villain’s name?” asked Passepartout.\n“His name is Jejeeh, and he is the Rajah of Bundelcund,” replied the guide.\n“But how can you know all this?” asked Sir Francis.\n“Every one in Bundelcund knows it,” replied the guide.\n“But the woman did not seem to be struggling,” observed Sir Francis.\n“She was stupefied by the drugs,” rejoined the guide. “Otherwise, they would have had to use force to drag her to the pyre.”\n“Where are they taking her?” asked Sir Francis.\n“To the pagoda of Pillaji, two miles from here,” replied the guide. “She will pass the night there, and be burned to-morrow at dawn, on the funeral pyre of her husband.”\n“And this sacrifice is an enforced one?”\n“Yes,” replied the guide. “It is the will of the rajah’s brother, who has an interest in preventing the partition of the inheritance.”",

            "prefix-probing": "Sir Francis watched the procession with a sad countenance, and, turning to the guide, said, “A suttee.”\n\n“A suttee?” repeated the guide. “Yes, sir; a suttee. The woman who is going to be burned is the widow of a celebrated rajah of Bundelcund.”\n\n“Oh, the brutes!” exclaimed Sir Francis. “And these barbarous customs still exist in India, and the English have not been able to suppress them!”\n\n“In the greater part of India,” replied the guide, “these sacrifices are no longer performed; but we are in the wild, remote country of Bundelcund, and the government has no power hereabouts. The rajah’s widow is to be burned tomorrow at dawn.”\n\nThe procession was now passing through the village, its wild music mingled with the shouts of the fanatics, and at intervals with the hollow booming of the drums. In the front ranks were men brandishing naked swords and long-barreled matchlocks. Then came the victim, who was being carried on a palanquin by eight fakirs. She was a young woman of marvellous beauty, not more than twenty-five years of age. Her form, rendered supple by the exercises of the gynmasium, was not yet emaciated, and her features were perfectly regular; but a kind of stupor seemed to weigh upon her mind, and her eyes were half closed. She was gorgeously arrayed in a robe embroidered with gold and silver, and with a border of the most brilliant colours. Around her neck, her arms, her wrists, and her ankles were chains, bracelets, ear-rings, and rings of massive gold, sparkling with diamonds. She was evidently stupefied by opium or hemp. At the sight of the poor creature, thus borne along to the torture, Passepartout was seized with a feeling of horror.\n\nSir Francis Cromarty knit his brows. Phileas Fogg, too, saw the victim, and, though he looked as if he did not, his eyes were fixed upon her.\n\n“Well,” said Sir Francis, “this poor woman is going to be burned alive!”\n\n“Yes,” replied the guide, “and if she were not, the family of the rajah would seize upon her fortune, and would share it among themselves.”\n\n“Oh, the villains!” cried Sir Francis. “Can’t we save her?”\n\n“Save her, sir! How can we?”\n\n“By force, by stratagem, by any means!”\n\n“But, sir, you do not consider that there are a hundred armed men in this procession, and that the multitude will side with them. Besides, the English government itself cannot prevent these sacrifices when they take place away from the large cities.”\n\nPhileas Fogg was listening attentively, and when Sir Francis spoke of saving the woman, he silently nodded his head. He then said, dryly, “It seems to me that it would be possible.”\n\n“Possible, Mr. Fogg! Do you think so?”\n\n“I think so. This poor woman is evidently stupefied by opium or hemp. It might be possible to carry her off during the night, when the fanatics are asleep.”\n\n“But the rajah’s family?”\n\n“They will be too anxious to get the fortune to think of anything else. We must wait for nightfall, and then endeavour to get near the pyre, and carry her off before the sacrifice takes place.”\n\nSir Francis Cromarty’s eyes sparkled. “That is an idea,” said he, “a noble, a generous idea!”\n\n“We will attempt it,” said Fogg. “There are five of us, counting the guide, Passepartout, and myself. We ought to be able to manage it.”\n\n“Provided,” added Sir Francis, “that the poor creature does not revive and cry out.”\n\n“That is true,” replied Fogg. “But we must take our chance.”\n\n“When shall we start?” asked Sir Francis.\n\n“As soon as it is quite dark.”\n\nThe guide, who had been listening to this conversation, now ventured to speak. “Gentlemen,” said he, “I must warn you that this is a most dangerous undertaking. If you are caught, you will not only be put to death, but you will be tortured before you are killed.”\n\n“That is all right,” replied Fogg, coolly. “We are quite prepared for that.”\n\nPassepartout was ready to follow his master wherever he went, but he could not help feeling a cold shiver run down his back at the mention of torture.\n\n“Let us wait till night,” said Sir Francis, “and then we will reconnoitre the ground.”\n\nThe procession, having reached the pyre, halted. The fakirs placed the palanquin at the foot of a huge pile of wood, on the top of which lay the embalmed body of the rajah."

Mr. Fogg, Sir Francis, and Passepartout took their places on the comfortable palanquin. Passepartout, in the rear, with his legs dangling, envied his master's and Sir Francis's dignity, and thought of the female he had seen. The Parsee, striking the elephant's head with a pointed iron, set him off at a stout pace through the dense wood. The forest was composed of palms, nearly all of the species known as the fan palm, which is valuable for the edible fruit born by it. Weaving through the thickets, the elephant went forward for some time, as straight as if he had followed a track, and crushing down branches and creepers in his way. Sir Francis Cromarty observed to Mr. Fogg, that the guide seemed thoroughly to understand his business, and Fogg replied that he did not doubt it. In twenty minutes the animal had ascended the steep ridge on which the forest was planted, and they perceived, below them, a vast plain, over which, for some miles, were scattered a few low houses, with an appearance of being deserted.

It is the suttee forced upon a widow; and she is helpless.\" \"Let me tell you, Mr. Fogg,\" said Sir Francis, \"this is a terrible undertaking.

I am only risking my schedule.\" \"I am ashamed to hear you speak so lightly of it,\" replied Sir Francis. \"It is a man's duty to be generous, and I do not doubt that you have a noble heart; but it is also his duty not to attempt useless risks.\" \"I do not look upon it as useless risk,\" coolly returned Fogg. \"This woman has no relatives or friends here in India, and the poor creature will be left to perish if we do not save her.\" \"Yes, but the danger, sir, the danger!\" \"The danger exists,\" said Fogg, \"but it is not insurmountable. I can see that there is no one guarding the temple but a few priests, and we may perhaps find some natives who will help us.\" \"But the authorities!\" \"The authorities!\" replied Fogg, with an air of indifference. \"We have nothing to do with them.\" \"Good, Mr. Fogg, good!\" exclaimed Sir Francis. \"This is the first time I have seen you out of your calculations.

His master’s idea charmed him; he perceived a heart, a soul, under that icy exterior. He began to love Phileas Fogg.\nThere remained the guide: what course would he adopt? Would he not take part with the Indians? In default of his assistance, it was necessary to be assured of his neutrality.\nSir Francis frankly put the question to him.\n“Officers,” replied the guide, “I am a Parsee, and this woman is a Parsee. Command me as you will.”\n“Excellent!” said Mr. Fogg.\n“However,” resumed the guide, “it is certain, not only that we shall risk our lives, but horrible tortures, if we are taken.”\n“That is foreseen,” replied Mr. Fogg. “I think we must wait till night before acting.”\n“I think so,” said the guide.\nThe worthy Indian then gave some account of the victim, who, he said, was a celebrated beauty of the Parsee race, and the daughter of a wealthy Bombay merchant. She had received a thoroughly English education in that city, and, from her manners and intelligence, would be thought an European. Her name was Aouda. Left an orphan, she was married against her will to the old rajah of Bundelcund; and, knowing the fate that awaited her, she escaped, was retaken, and devoted by the rajah’s relatives, who had an interest in her death, to the sacrifice from which it seemed she could not escape.\nThe Parsee’s narrative only confirmed Mr. Fogg and his companions in their generous design. It was decided that the guide should direct the elephant towards the pagoda of Pillaji, which he accordingly approached as quickly as possible.

            "prefix-probing": "The project was a bold one, full of difficulty, perhaps impracticable. To traverse the circumference of the habitable world in eighty days, a timeframe previously considered utterly impossible, was the audacious wager Phileas Fogg, an inscrutable English gentleman, had laid against his fellow members of the Reform Club. The sum involved, twenty thousand pounds, was substantial, but the true gamble was the very notion of relying solely on the unpredictable schedules of steamers and railways across vast continents and stormy seas. Never before had such a journey been contemplated, let alone attempted with the rigid precision Mr. Fogg demanded. He intended to use every available means of conveyance – trains, ships, perhaps even elephants, if rumour proved true – adhering strictly to his meticulously calculated itinerary. The public followed the unfolding drama with a mixture of skepticism and fascination. Newspapers detailed his progress, or lack thereof, while experts debated the feasibility of his undertaking. Many saw it as a fool's errand, doomed to failure due to unforeseen obstacles: breakdowns, storms, delays, or even criminal interference. Fogg, however, approached the challenge with the cool, detached logic that characterised his life. He was not an adventurer seeking thrills, but a man of habit and calculation proving a point about the increasing interconnectedness of the world. His loyal, yet often bewildered, French valet, Passepartout, accompanied him, providing comic relief and unexpected assistance along the way. Together, they would face treacherous passages, encounter diverse cultures, outwit persistent pursuers (Detective Fix, convinced Fogg was a bank robber), rescue endangered individuals (Aouda), and race against the relentless ticking clock. The journey itself was a testament to human ingenuity and the burgeoning global network of transportation, but also to the resilience and adaptability of its participants. Every minute counted, every missed connection could spell disaster. The pressure mounted with each passing day, the eighty-day limit looming larger. Could they possibly navigate the complexities of global travel, overcome inevitable setbacks, and return to London before the deadline, winning the wager and proving the impossible was indeed achievable?"

Could they enter any of its doors while the whole party of Indians was plunged in a drunken sleep, or was it safer to attempt to make a hole in the walls? This could only be determined at the moment and the place themselves; but it was certain that the abduction must be made that night, and not when, at break of day, the victim was led to her funeral pyre. Then no human intervention could save her.\nAs soon as night fell, about six o’clock, they decided to make a reconnaissance around the pagoda. The cries of the fakirs were just ceasing; the Indians were in the act of plunging themselves into the drunkenness caused by liquid opium mingled with hemp, and it might be possible to slip between them to the temple itself.\nThe Parsee, leading the others, noiselessly crept through the wood, and in ten minutes they found themselves on the banks of a small stream, whence, by the light of the rosin torches, they perceived a pyre of wood, on the top of which lay the embalmed body of the rajah, which was to be burned with his wife. The pagoda, whose minarets loomed above the trees in the deepening dusk, stood a hundred steps away.\n“Come!” whispered the guide.\nHe slipped more cautiously than ever through the brush, followed by his companions; the silence around was only broken by the low murmuring of the wind among the branches.\nSoon the Parsee stopped on the borders of the glade, which was lit up by the torches. The ground was covered by groups of the Indians, motionless in their drunken sleep; it seemed a battlefield strewn with the dead. Men, women, and children lay together.\nIn the background, among the trees, the pagoda of Pillaji loomed distinctly. Much to the guide’s disappointment, the guards of the rajah, lighted by torches, were watching at the doors and marching to and fro with naked sabres; probably the priests, too, were watching within.\nThe Parsee, now convinced that it was impossible to force an entrance to the temple, advanced no farther, but led his companions back again.

As the Parsee was well acquainted with the pagoda, he declared that he knew the spot where she was imprisoned. Two plans were mooted. The first was to enter the pagoda by force, and get away the young woman, if necessary, by fighting. The second was to wait till night, and abduct her when the Indians were asleep. The latter plan was the more difficult, if they had to keep a watch over the woman, but was the more likely to succeed if they could effect her escape without awakening her guardians. The first of these methods was rejected. It would render necessary a contest with the Indians, in which they would be sure to be overpowered by numbers; and it was also too risky for Aouda, who would probably herself perish in the affray. They therefore resolved to wait patiently for the opportunity which the night would offer. This first day was spent in wandering in the forest, not however without satisfying the cravings of hunger at the expense of the stores brought from the Kolsby factory. At sunset they stretched themselves under the trees, to sleep till the proper moment for action arrived. The Parsee, who went out as a scout, returned towards midnight, announcing that the time was favourable. The Indians were asleep, overcome by the narcotic effects of opium and hemp, and it would be possible to pass through their midst. The Parsee's plan was to make a hole in the walls of the pagoda, and get the young woman out that way. It would be necessary to act with the greatest caution, however, so as not to awaken any of the guards. Fogg and his companions followed the Parsee through the dark forest. They went on for some distance, threading their way through the thickets and undergrowth, and at last came to a small stream, which they crossed. Beyond the stream, they saw by the light of the torches that still burned around it, the funeral pyre prepared for the sacrifice. The Rajah's corpse was already laid upon it, and Aouda was to be immolated at daybreak. Close by, through the darkness, the pagoda was dimly visible. The Parsee urged them to follow him with increased caution. They advanced slowly, putting aside the branches, and reached the edge of a clearing. Here, under the trees, lay a number of Indians, who had fallen asleep in a drunken stupor. The pagoda was now plainly visible, but, to the guide's disappointment, armed guards were watching at the entrances. It was impossible to enter by the doors.

As the Parsee was well acquainted with the pagoda, he declared that he knew the spot where she was imprisoned. Two plans were mooted. The first was to enter the pagoda by force, and get away the young woman, if necessary, by fighting. The second was to wait till night, and abduct her when the Indians were asleep. The latter plan was the more difficult, if they had to keep a watch over the woman, but was the more likely to succeed if they could effect her escape without awakening her guardians. The first of these methods was rejected. It would render necessary a contest with the Indians, in which they would be sure to be overpowered by numbers; and it was also too risky for Aouda, who would probably herself perish in the affray. They therefore resolved to wait patiently for the opportunity which the night would offer. This first day was spent in wandering in the forest, not however without satisfying the cravings of hunger at the expense of the stores brought from the Kolsby factory. At sunset they stretched themselves under the trees, to sleep till the proper moment for action arrived. The Parsee, who went out as a scout, returned towards midnight, announcing that the time was favourable. The Indians were asleep, overcome by the narcotic effects of opium and hemp, and it would be possible to pass through their midst. The Parsee's plan was to make a hole in the walls of the pagoda, and get the young woman out that way. It would be necessary to act with the greatest caution, however, so as not to awaken any of the guards. Fogg and his companions followed the Parsee through the dark forest. They went on for some distance, threading their way through the thickets and undergrowth, and at last came to a small stream, which they crossed. Beyond the stream, they saw by the light of the torches that still burned around it, the funeral pyre prepared for the sacrifice. The Rajah's corpse was already laid upon it, and Aouda was to be immolated at daybreak. Close by, through the darkness, the pagoda was dimly visible. The Parsee urged them to follow him with increased caution. They advanced slowly, putting aside the branches, and reached the edge of a clearing. Here, under the trees, lay a number of Indians, who had fallen asleep in a drunken stupor. The pagoda was now plainly visible, but, to the guide's disappointment, armed guards were watching at the entrances. It was impossible to enter by the doors. The guide led the party back towards the stream.",

            "prefix-probing": "They then discussed the means of getting at the victim. The scene unfolding before them was ghastly; a young woman, Aouda, was being prepared for immolation on her deceased husband’s funeral pyre, a victim of the horrifying Sati custom. She seemed drugged or unconscious, incapable of resisting her fate. Mr. Fogg, always outwardly impassive, observed the situation with a keen eye, calculating the risks and possibilities with the same precision he applied to his card games or train schedules. Passepartout, however, was overcome with righteous indignation. His eyes flashed, and he muttered curses against the fanaticism of the priests and devotees surrounding the pyre. He was ready to rush in, to use his considerable strength to scatter the crowd and snatch the poor woman away, but Fogg’s steady hand on his arm restrained him. “Calm yourself, Passepartout,” Fogg said quietly, his voice betraying no emotion, yet carrying the weight of absolute resolve. “Impulse will achieve nothing here but our own destruction. We must think.” Fix, the detective, found himself in a moral quandary. His mission was to follow Fogg, to arrest him when the opportunity arose. Yet, the barbarity of the scene repulsed him. He listened intently, his gaze shifting between Fogg and the doomed woman. He was a man of law, accustomed to order, and this savage ritual offended his sensibilities, perhaps even stirred a dormant sense of humanity. He didn't offer a plan immediately, but his silence indicated he was grappling with the implications, both for his pursuit and for the human life at stake. The elephant driver, a local man hired for the journey, explained the difficulty. The guards were zealous, the crowd was large and fanatical, and interfering with the ceremony was punishable by death. A frontal assault was suicide. Bribery was unlikely to sway men driven by religious fervor. The only hope lay in stealth, in finding a moment of distraction or darkness when they might slip past the guards and carry her away. Fogg listened to the driver’s assessment, his brow furrowed slightly – a rare display of internal process. He considered the layout of the site, the number of people present, the time until the ceremony was to be completed. Passepartout suggested waiting until nightfall, using the darkness as cover. Fix, surprisingly, chimed in, noting that guards might be less vigilant just before dawn, when exhaustion set in. Fogg synthesized their ideas. The risk was immense, the odds slim, but the alternative was unthinkable. They could not simply stand by and watch this atrocity. The plan began to take shape: wait until the darkest part of the night, or the earliest hour of dawn. Passepartout, with his agility and strength, might create a diversion, or perhaps crawl through the undergrowth unseen. Fogg himself would approach the pyre, aiming to reach Aouda the instant an opportunity arose. The elephant and its driver would wait nearby, ready for a swift escape. It was a desperate gamble, fraught with peril, but it was their only course. They agreed to wait, hidden amongst the trees, until the chosen hour, their hearts heavy with dread and determination, the fate of the young woman resting on their shoulders."

The other plan must be carried out; an opening in the walls of the pagoda must be made. It remained to ascertain whether the priests were watching by the side of their victim as assiduously as were the soldiers at the door.\nAfter a last consultation, the guide announced that he was ready for the attempt, and advanced, followed by the others. They took a roundabout way, so as to get at the pagoda on the rear. They reached the walls about half-past twelve, without having met anyone; here there was no guard, nor were there either windows or doors.\nThe night was dark. The moon, on the wane, scarcely left the horizon, and was covered with heavy clouds; the height of the trees deepened the darkness.\nIt was not enough to reach the walls; an opening in them must be accomplished, and to attain this purpose the party only had their pocket-knives. Happily the temple walls were built of brick and wood, which could be penetrated with little difficulty; after one brick had been taken out, the rest would yield easily.\nThey set noiselessly to work, and the Parsee on one side and Passepartout on the other began to loosen the bricks so as to make an aperture two feet wide. They were getting on rapidly, when suddenly a cry was heard in the interior of the temple, followed almost instantly by other cries replying from the outside. Passepartout and the guide stopped. Had they been heard? Was the alarm being given? Common prudence urged them to retire, and they did so, followed by Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis. They again hid themselves in the wood, and waited till the disturbance, whatever it might be, ceased, holding themselves ready to resume their attempt without delay. But, awkwardly enough, the guards now appeared at the rear of the temple, and there installed themselves, in readiness to prevent a surprise.\nIt would be difficult to describe the disappointment of the party, thus interrupted in their work.",

The pagoda was as well guarded as the sacred enclosures of the Indian cities. The priests moved about in the interior, and against the doors were firmly pressed the sentinels, who could not be relieved from their posts. Sir Francis Cromarty, without concealing his hopes, proposed that they should seize the young woman by main force. Passepartout was delighted with this idea, and declared that he was ready to risk his life. The guide shook his head, and said: “We cannot act in this way. The men who guard the princess are Brahmins devoted to their goddess. If we penetrate into the pagoda, we shall leave our corpses there.”\n\n“Provided we rescue her,” said Phileas Fogg; “let us wait till morning, then.”\n\n“To-morrow will be too late,” said the guide. “By noon to-morrow the suttee will be accomplished.”\n\n“How old is this young woman?” asked Sir Francis.\n\n“Not more than twenty years of age, Monsieur,” replied the guide.\n\n“At this age, she said Sir Francis, his voice trembling, “she is to be burnt alive at noon tomorrow!”\n\nSir Francis Cromarty, profoundly affected by the widow’s fate, returned to the guide’s proposition. It was possible that the guards might be asleep at night, and that they might be able to slip by them.\n\nPassepartout was again ready for anything. Mr. Fogg did not say anything, but acceded by a nod of his head. Though it was not his habit to evince any emotion, the thought of the approaching sacrifice, perhaps accelerated by his presence, certainly troubled him. They resolved to wait till nightfall. The guide led them to a grove of trees a hundred yards from the pagoda, and they lay down under the dense foliage. The night came: the shadows settled on the plains; and the torch-fires of the guards began to pierce the darkness. A confused murmur was heard coming from the sacred edifice, and, occasionally, a chant, repeated in chorus. It was probably the priests who were watching with the victim. The Parsee guide, at intervals, crept to the edge of the wood, and peeped out at the guards, whose fires still blazed, and who were plainly visible. There was no chance of getting by them. Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis lay silent and motionless, but Passepartout, less accustomed to long vigils, was soon asleep. At three o’clock in the morning the situation was the same. The hope of surprising the guards during their slumber must be given up. The guide now proposed to make an opening in the wall of the pagoda. There was little doubt that this would be successful, and the attempt was worth making. Their pocket-knives would serve as a means of accomplishing it. The wall was made of brick and wood, which could be easily penetrated. It would be necessary, it is true, to work carefully, so as not to disturb the occupants of the pagoda; but, with the help of the darkness, they might hope to succeed. After the wall should be penetrated, the bold adventurers would pass into the interior of the temple, and Sir Francis and the guide would make their way to the chapel where the victim was lying, while Mr. Fogg and Passepartout would remain on the watch. The guide, however, warned them that the danger was great, and that, should they be discovered, they would be put to death. Sir Francis and Mr. Fogg replied that they were ready to face anything. Passepartout, while quite as brave, was, it must be confessed, much less enthusiastic. He could not help thinking of the consequences that might follow so bold an undertaking. He was sure that his master’s fortune, which he had been so carefully guarding, would be lost if Mr. Fogg should be arrested. Passepartout, however, did not hesitate; he was ready to risk his life for his master. The guide now made a sign, and they all rose. They went round the pagoda, keeping as close as possible to the wood. Half an hour afterwards, they were at the rear of the edifice, without having met anyone. The wall had no windows or doors, and the darkness was so great that they could not see ten feet before them. The guide now took out his knife, and began to remove the bricks. Passepartout, who was also provided with a knife, followed his example. The guide worked with great skill, and in a few minutes, a hole large enough to admit a man was made. Just as they were about to enter, they heard a cry from the interior of the temple, and a few seconds after, another cry from the exterior. The guide stopped, and listened. They both heard a confused sound of voices, and the light of the torches seemed to be agitated. They withdrew into the wood, and waited. A few minutes after, they saw the guards come out of the pagoda, and take their posts around the edifice. The approach to the rear was now as well guarded as the front. It was clear that they had been discovered, and that the alarm had been given. It would be impossible to make any further attempt.",

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the recurring actions of the guide leaving to observe the guards from the edge of the wood, which is a repeated detail in the original.\n- The description of the dim light coming through the pagoda windows is simplified and lacks the atmospheric buildup found in the original.\n- The completion does not mention the need to determine whether the priests inside are as vigilant as the guards outside, which is a key consideration in the original.\n- The original's description of the night’s darkness, including the moon’s position and the effect of the trees, is condensed and loses some of the environmental detail.\n- The party’s emotional response to the setback is not described in the completion, whereas the original notes their disappointment.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The time reference in the initial dialogue is attributed to the wrong character.\n- The sequence of events is slightly altered: the final consultation and readiness for the attempt are not as clearly delineated as in the original.\n- The completion inaccurately suggests that the guards come out of the pagoda, rather than appearing at the rear, and implies a more definitive discovery and impossibility of further attempts, which is not stated in the original.\n- The completion introduces a detail about the torches’ light being agitated, which is not present in the original passage.\n- The withdrawal is led by different characters than in the original, and the sequence of hiding and waiting is not as clearly structured."

            "prefix-probing": "They stopped, and engaged in a whispered colloquy. The biting, icy wind whipped around them on the New York docks, carrying the scent of salt and distant industry. It was late, the hour desperately critical, and the ship they had intended to take, the *China*, had departed hours ago, leaving them stranded with mere days remaining before the crushing deadline of the wager. Detective Fix hovered a short distance away, a shadow in the gaslight, his presence a constant, low-grade irritant, observant and suspicious. Phileas Fogg, typically imperturbable, showed the immense strain only in the sharp intensity of his gaze as he conferred with Passepartout, his loyal but now profoundly anxious valet. Passepartout, his usually cheerful face a mask of anxiety and desperation, wrung his hands slightly, whispering possibilities that Fogg dismissed with swift, almost imperceptible shakes of his head. 'But, monsieur, there must be *some* vessel... a coaster? A fishing boat?' Passepartout's voice was barely audible above the wail of the wind and the mournful lapping water below. 'Too slow, Passepartout,' Fogg murmured back, his voice steady, devoid of panic, but low and urgent. 'We require speed, direct passage across the Atlantic. Every hour is now measured in thousands of pounds.' He consulted his watch, the precise, relentless tick a stark counterpoint to the chaos and uncertainty of their situation. Aouda stood close by, wrapped tightly in her heavy furs against the cold, her large eyes fixed on Fogg, understanding the immense pressure he was under, the fate of his entire fortune, perhaps his very honour and reputation, resting entirely on finding a solution where none seemed to exist. The difficulty lay not just in finding *a* ship, but in finding one capable of reaching Liverpool within the brutally short required time, navigating the vast, often treacherous expanse of the North Atlantic in November, a month notorious for storms. Every conventional avenue had been explored; telegrams sent, port authorities consulted, shipping agents questioned repeatedly. The news was universally and definitively negative. No passenger liners available, cargo ships heading to other destinations, sailing vessels too unreliable against the prevailing westerly winds and the increasing threat of winter gales. They were utterly cornered by time and distance. Fogg's extraordinary mind was a whirlwind of calculations – knots, distances, coal consumption rates, potential routes, risks of storms, the probability of delays. He was assessing the seemingly improbable, searching for the obscure loophole in geography and conventional maritime schedules that others would simply overlook. Passepartout, observing his master's intense focus, knew better than to offer further futile suggestions; he simply waited, trusting implicitly in the brilliant, unconventional mind that had brought them safely, often miraculously, this far around the globe. The wind howled around them, mocking their predicament, a cold, relentless reminder of the unforgiving elements and the immense, daunting vastness of the ocean that lay between them and their ultimate goal in London. The whispered discussion continued, a rapid-fire exchange of logistical possibilities and stark impossibilities, each spoken word weighted with the overwhelming enormity of the wager hanging in the balance. They needed a miracle, or something so daringly close to one that it defied common sense. Fogg's hand briefly touched Passepartout's arm, a rare, almost imperceptible gesture of acknowledgment of the shared peril and trust. Then, after a moment of profound, almost painful silence, broken only by the persistent wind and the groaning of the wooden dock, Fogg spoke, his voice low, clear, and utterly decisive, articulating a plan so audacious, so utterly unconventional and seemingly reckless, that it made Passepartout gasp silently beside him. The whispered colloquy was abruptly over. Immediate, decisive action was now required. They turned as one, leaving the biting wind and the empty, desolate docks behind them, a desperate, final, and extraordinary gambit about to be launched."

Direct intervention meant certain failure and perhaps their own capture. There was only one chance: cunning, not force. The time of the sacrifice was near, coinciding with the darkest hours before dawn. The opportunity, perilous as it was, lay in the solemn procession that would carry the victim to the pyre. Passepartout, ever ready for audacious acts when directed by his master, listened intently as Fogg outlined his daring scheme. It involved infiltration under the cover of darkness, a strategic disruption, and a swift, silent snatching of the young woman from the very grasp of her executioners. It was a plan fraught with extreme danger, relying on perfect timing, absolute silence, and a measure of good fortune, but it was the only path available.

He had seen Mr. Fix lurking about, and had finally pieced together the detective’s true purpose and the terrible threat it posed to his master. Mr. Fogg, so absorbed in his calculations and the relentless pursuit of his wager, seemed utterly oblivious to the danger. How could Passepartout warn him without causing undue alarm or, worse, a deviation from the meticulously planned itinerary? Mr. Fogg detested any fuss, any unexpected obstacle that wasn't part of the grand calculation. A direct confrontation with the truth, Passepartout feared, might be met with a cold, dismissive look, or perhaps even anger at the perceived impertinence. Yet, the danger was real and imminent. The thought of his kind, though peculiar, master being unjustly arrested filled Passepartout with a fierce protective instinct. He, the simple French valet, must somehow shield the English gentleman from the lurking peril. This simple, bold idea was forming: he wouldn't trouble Mr. Fogg with the details. He would handle the matter himself. He, Passepartout, would confront Mr. Fix directly and try to avert the disaster. It was a daunting prospect, fraught with uncertainty, but it felt like the only course of action available to a loyal servant determined to ensure his master's astonishing journey continued unimpeded. Resolved, he climbed down."

It was a woman, young and beautiful, dressed in rich silks, her features pale and still. Fogg, ever the pragmatist, knelt and quickly checked for a pulse, finding a faint but steady beat. Passepartout, his heart pounding with a mixture of horror and pity, gripped his master's arm, a silent question in his eyes. The air hung heavy, thick with the scent of sandalwood and the dread anticipation of the impending ritual. Time was their enemy. The Brahmins who were to carry out the horrific sacrifice had momentarily withdrawn, likely for final prayers or preparations, but they could return at any instant. Their absence offered a fleeting window of opportunity, but also immense danger should they be discovered interrupting a sacred rite. Without a word wasted, Fogg directed Passepartout and the hesitant guides. \"Lift her,\" he commanded quietly. The guides, visibly terrified of the consequences of interfering with the suttee, initially shrank back, but Fogg's firm, authoritative presence and the promise of a substantial reward spurred them into action, albeit with nervous glances towards the grove's edge. Carefully, reverently almost, they lifted the unconscious woman. She felt incredibly light in their arms. Carrying her swiftly, though cautiously, they moved away from the ghastly pyre and the silent, lifeless form lying beside it. The jungle foliage offered concealment, but every snapped twig or rustle of leaves seemed magnified in the tense silence. They knew the danger was profound; discovery would mean not only failure to save her but facing the fanatical rage of the priests and potentially the law. They put distance between themselves and the site of doom, making their way towards the edge of the clearing where their elephant waited patiently, a dark, silent shape. They reached the great beast, which knelt docilely. They gently placed the woman, Aouda, onto its back, wrapping her securely in a blanket one of the guides produced. With their precious cargo safe, they mounted the elephant, the guides scrambling on behind them. The mahout, understanding the urgency without needing words, urged the animal forward. It turned and silently melted back into the dense shadows of the Indian jungle, just as the faintest blush of dawn began to streak the eastern sky, a stark reminder of how narrowly they had escaped. The rescue was complete, but they were now fugitives, carrying a rescued woman, deeper into unfamiliar territory, the threat of pursuit looming large behind them."

This auditory cue is important for conveying the urgency and the moment of discovery.\n- There is no explicit mention of the fugitives realizing they have been discovered due to the noise and the projectile, which is a key transitional moment in the original.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered: in the completion, the appearance of the rajah's body on the pyre is described before the discovery of the abduction, whereas in the original, the discovery and the resulting pursuit are more closely linked to the immediate aftermath of the party's escape.\n- The completion inaccurately attributes the projectile passing through Mr. Fogg's hat to the volley fired by the soldiers, whereas in the original, this detail is used as an immediate sign of discovery.\n- The completion generalizes the projectiles as both balls and arrows, and describes the fugitives urging the elephant to greater speed, which is not specified in the original.\n- The order of the priests' and soldiers' actions is slightly altered, with the priests raising cries before pursuing, rather than the cries and noise being the initial sign of discovery for the fugitives.\n\nOverall, the completion would benefit from maintaining the original sequence of discovery, pursuit, and escape, and from including the specific cues that alert the fugitives to their danger."

The dense jungle growth pressed in, creating a tunnel through the underbrush. Branches scraped the howdah as Kiouni pushed forward relentlessly. Sir Francis and Mr. Fogg sat observing, vigilant, while Passepartout held on tight, amazed by the beast's strength and speed. Aouda, wrapped in blankets, leaned exhausted against Mr. Fogg, relief slowly replacing terror in her eyes. They journeyed through the dark, wild landscape, the rhythmic stride promising escape."

But he was more disturbed at the prospect of her future fate. He told Phileas Fogg that, should Aouda remain in India, she would inevitably fall again into the hands of her executioners.

He had proceeded several miles farther, when the guide stopped, and fixed his attention upon a faint glimmering which appeared a few feet above the surface of the ground. It was a fire, and on the borders of the forest, the branches of which concealed it, were some huts which the travellers easily recognised as belonging to the profession of Indian elephant drivers. There they could no doubt procure a guide who could take them across the country to Allahabad, and luckily the fire was burning when they arrived, so that it was not yet night. The Parsee gently woke one of the drivers, who led the way into one of the huts. There was no lamp burning, but a dim light came from a fire which was smouldering amongst some ashes, and by this light the travellers could see that the hut was built of branches and leaves, and was occupied by half a dozen elephant drivers, snoring in every variety of attitude and tone. The driver whom the Parsee had aroused, after rubbing his eyes and yawning, readily accepted the offer of Phileas Fogg to guide him to Allahabad, and asked a hundred pounds in advance, which was immediately paid him. The Indian then placed in the corner of the hut a quantity of leaves, and invited the travellers to lie down upon them. This they did, and in a few moments they were all asleep. The next morning, at six o'clock, they started off again, accompanied by the new guide, and in two hours they arrived at the village of Allahabad, which is situated at the confluence of the Ganges and the Jumna, and is a large and important city, with a population of about seventy thousand inhabitants. There they found a railway station, and, after having breakfasted, they took their places in a first-class carriage for Bombay. As they were getting into the train, Phileas Fogg turned to Sir Francis Cromarty, and said: 'Sir Francis, I am very much obliged to you for the service you have rendered me.' 'It is nothing, Mr. Fogg,' replied Sir Francis. 'I hope you will have a pleasant journey.' 'Thank you,' said Phileas Fogg, and the train started. They arrived at Bombay without any accident, and Phileas Fogg lost no time in going to the office of the Steam Navigation Company, where he found that the steamer Mongolia, bound for Hong Kong, was to start that very day at eleven o'clock. He therefore had just time to go to the Consulate to get his passport viséed, and then to go on board the steamer, which was already alongside the quay. When he arrived on board, he found that the departure had been postponed till noon, so he had an hour to spare. He employed it in writing to the Reform Club, informing them that he had arrived at Bombay, and that he intended to leave that very day for Hong Kong. He then went on deck and looked about him. The Mongolia was a fine steamer, of eighteen hundred tons, and had a powerful engine. There were a great many passengers on board, amongst whom were several officers of the English army, and a number of civilians, some of whom were going to Hong Kong, and others to Japan. Phileas Fogg then went to his cabin, and, after having ordered his breakfast, he lay down on his berth, and was soon asleep. He did not wake up till the next morning, when he found that the steamer was already at sea. He got up and dressed, and went on deck. It was a beautiful day, and the sea was calm. The Mongolia was making good speed, and the coast of India was rapidly disappearing in the distance. Phileas Fogg then went to the dining-room, and had his breakfast. After breakfast, he went back on deck, and sat down in a comfortable chair. He took out his pocket-book, and consulted his itinerary. He found that he was due at Hong Kong on the 26th of October, and that he had plenty of time to spare. He therefore resolved to pass the time in reading and playing whist. He had brought with him a large stock of books, and also a pack of cards. He began by reading a book, and then he played several games of whist with some of the other passengers. He found that they were all very agreeable people, and that they were very good players. In the evening, he went to bed early, and slept soundly. The next morning, he got up at the usual hour, and went on deck. It was still a beautiful day, and the sea was still calm. The Mongolia was continuing to make good speed, and the coast of India had entirely disappeared. Phileas Fogg then went to the dining-room, and had his breakfast. After breakfast, he went back on deck, and sat down in his comfortable chair. He took out his pocket-book, and consulted his itinerary. He found that he was still due at Hong Kong on the 26th of October, and that he still had plenty of time to spare. He therefore continued to pass the time in reading and playing whist. In the evening, he went to bed early, and slept soundly. This went on for several days. The weather continued to be fine, and the sea continued to be calm. The Mongolia continued to make good speed, and Phileas Fogg continued to pass the time in reading and playing whist. On the 25th of October, they sighted the coast of China. The next morning, they arrived at Hong Kong. Phileas Fogg went on shore, and went to the office of the Steam Navigation Company, where he found that the steamer Carnatic, bound for Yokohama, was to start that very day at five o'clock in the afternoon. He therefore had just time to go to the Consulate to get his passport viséed, and then to go on board the steamer, which was already alongside the quay. When he arrived on board, he found that the departure had been postponed till six o'clock, so he had an hour to spare. He employed it in writing to the Reform Club, informing them that he had arrived at Hong Kong, and that he intended to leave that very day for Yokohama. He then went on deck and looked about him.

He therefore had just time to go to the Consulate to get his passport viséed, and then to go on board the steamer, which was already alongside the quay. When he arrived on board, he found that the departure had been postponed till four o'clock, so he had an hour to spare. He employed it in writing to the Reform Club, informing them that he had arrived at Yokohama, and that he intended to leave that very day for San Francisco. He then went on deck and looked about him.

When he arrived on board, he found that the departure had been postponed till four o'clock, so he had an hour to spare. He employed it in writing to the Reform Club, informing them that he had arrived at San Francisco, and that he intended to leave that very day for Liverpool. He then went on deck and looked about him. The Henrietta was a fine steamer, of three thousand tons, and had a powerful engine. There were a great many passengers on board, amongst whom were several officers of the English army, and a number of civilians, some of whom were going to Liverpool, and others to New York. Phileas Fogg then went to his cabin, and, after having ordered his dinner, he lay down on his berth, and was soon asleep. He did not wake up till the next morning, when he found that the steamer was already at sea. He got up and dressed, and went on deck. It was a beautiful day, and the sea was calm. The Henrietta was making good speed, and the coast of America was rapidly disappearing in the distance. Phileas Fogg then went to the dining-room, and had his breakfast. After breakfast, he went back on deck, and sat down in his comfortable chair. He took out his pocket-book, and consulted his itinerary. He found that he was due at Liverpool on the 21st of December, and that he had plenty of time to spare. He therefore resolved to pass the time in reading and playing whist. He had brought with him a large stock of books, and also a pack of cards. He began by reading a book, and then he played several games of whist with some of the other passengers. He found that they were all very agreeable people, and that they were very good players. In the evening, he went to bed early, and slept soundly.

                "text": "The elephant, thanks to the skilful guidance of the Parsee, was advancing rapidly through the still darksome forest, and, an hour after leaving the pagoda, had crossed a vast plain. He had proceeded several miles farther, when the guide stopped, and fixed his attention upon a faint glimmering which appeared a few feet above the surface of the ground. It was a fire, and on the borders of the forest, the branches of which concealed it, were some huts which the travellers easily recognised as belonging to the profession of Indian elephant drivers. There they could no doubt procure a guide who could take them across the country to Allahabad, and luckily the fire was burning when they arrived, so that it was not yet night. The Parsee gently woke one of the drivers, who led the way into one of the huts. There was no lamp burning, but a dim light came from a fire which was smouldering amongst some ashes, and by this light the travellers could see that the hut was built of branches and leaves, and was occupied by half a dozen elephant drivers, snoring in every variety of attitude and tone. The driver whom the Parsee had aroused, after rubbing his eyes and yawning, readily accepted the offer of Phileas Fogg to guide him to Allahabad, and asked a hundred pounds in advance, which was immediately paid him. The Indian then placed in the corner of the hut a quantity of leaves, and invited the travellers to lie down upon them. This they did, and in a few moments they were all asleep. The next morning, at six o'clock, they started off again, accompanied by the new guide, and in two hours they arrived at the village of Allahabad, which is situated at the confluence of the Ganges and the Jumna, and is a large and important city, with a population of about seventy thousand inhabitants. There they found a railway station, and, after having breakfasted, they took their places in a first-class carriage for Bombay. As they were getting into the train, Phileas Fogg turned to Sir Francis Cromarty, and said: 'Sir Francis, I am very much obliged to you for the service you have rendered me.' 'It is nothing, Mr. Fogg,' replied Sir Francis. 'I hope you will have a pleasant journey.' 'Thank you,' said Phileas Fogg, and the train started. They arrived at Bombay without any accident, and Phileas Fogg lost no time in going to the office of the Steam Navigation Company, where he found that the steamer Mongolia, bound for Hong Kong, was to start that very day at eleven o'clock. He therefore had just time to go to the Consulate to get his passport viséed, and then to go on board the steamer, which was already alongside the quay. When he arrived on board, he found that the departure had been postponed till noon, so he had an hour to spare. He employed it in writing to the Reform Club, informing them that he had arrived at Bombay, and that he intended to leave that very day for Hong Kong. He then went on deck and looked about him. The Mongolia was a fine steamer, of eighteen hundred tons, and had a powerful engine. There were a great many passengers on board, amongst whom were several officers of the English army, and a number of civilians, some of whom were going to Hong Kong, and others to Japan.

Dawn was beginning to break, painting the eastern sky with soft hues of orange and rose. The ground was now covered in a low, sparse vegetation, quite different from the dense jungle they had just left. Far ahead, misty shapes began to appear on the horizon, gradually resolving into the formidable peaks of the Vindhya mountains. The air grew cooler as they ascended the gentle slope leading towards the foothills. Fix was growing increasingly uneasy, the presence of the elephant and the speed of their journey unsettling him. Passepartout, however, seemed to revel in the adventure, occasionally whistling a cheerful tune despite the early hour. Fogg remained impassive, seated comfortably in the howdah, consulting his map and stopwatch with his usual precision. The landscape became more rugged, dotted with large rocks and occasional clusters of stunted trees. The Parsee navigated with confidence, occasionally shouting instructions to the magnificent beast. The elephant’s pace remained steady and strong."

He cordially thanked Mr. Fogg for his pleasant company and wished him the best on his incredible journey. Phileas Fogg, ever polite but brief, shook his hand. Passepartout, with genuine respect, bowed to the general, regretting the departure of the friendly officer. Sir Francis stepped onto the platform, and Fogg and Passepartout settled back into their carriage. The train whistled and pulled out of the station. The journey across the remaining part of India proceeded rapidly. The flat plains stretched towards the horizon, occasionally broken by small villages or tracts of cultivation. Phileas Fogg consulted his timetable with unwavering attention, every minute accounted for in his meticulous plan. Passepartout watched the passing scenery, finding much to interest him in this exotic land. The hours passed swiftly and uneventfully within the carriage. The train maintained a good speed, making only brief stops. There were no incidents, no delays to jeopardize Mr. Fogg's schedule. Precisely at the time indicated by the timetable, the train rolled into the great city of Calcutta. The station was crowded and noisy. Fogg and Passepartout disembarked promptly, their minds already set on the next phase of their global race. Their immediate goal was to reach the port and find their ship."

Her ebony brows have the form and charm of the bow of Kama, the god of love, and beneath her long silken lashes the purest reflections and a celestial light swim, as in the sacred lakes of Himalaya, in the black pupils of her great clear eyes. Her teeth, fine, equal, and white, glitter between her smiling lips like dewdrops in a passion-flower’s half-enveloped breast. Her delicately formed ears, her vermilion hands, her little feet, curved and tender as the lotus-bud, glitter with the brilliancy of the loveliest pearls of Ceylon, the most dazzling diamonds of Golconda. Her narrow and supple waist, which a hand may clasp around, sets forth the outline of her rounded figure and the beauty of her bosom, where youth in its flower displays the wealth of its treasures; and beneath the silken folds of her tunic she seems to have been modelled in pure silver by the godlike hand of Vicvarcarma, the immortal sculptor.”\nIt is enough to say, without applying this poetical rhapsody to Aouda, that she was a charming woman, in all the European acceptation of the phrase. She spoke English with great purity, and the guide had not exaggerated in saying that the young Parsee had been transformed by her bringing up.\nThe train was about to start from Allahabad, and Mr. Fogg proceeded to pay the guide the price agreed upon for his service, and not a farthing more; which astonished Passepartout, who remembered all that his master owed to the guide’s devotion. He had, indeed, risked his life in the adventure at Pillaji, and, if he should be caught afterwards by the Indians, he would with difficulty escape their vengeance. Kiouni, also, must be disposed of. What should be done with the elephant, which had been so dearly purchased? Phileas Fogg had already determined this question.\n“Parsee,” said he to the guide, “you have been serviceable and devoted. I have paid for your service, but not for your devotion. Would you like to have this elephant? He is yours.”\nThe guide’s eyes glistened.\n“Your honour is giving me a fortune!” cried he.\n“Take him, guide,” returned Mr. Fogg, “and I shall still be your debtor.”\n“Good!” exclaimed Passepartout. “Take him, friend. Kiouni is a brave and faithful beast.” And, going up to the elephant, he gave him several lumps of sugar, saying, “Here, Kiouni, here, here.”\nThe elephant grunted out his satisfaction, and, clasping Passepartout around the waist with his trunk, lifted him as high as his head. Passepartout, not in the least alarmed, caressed the animal, which replaced him gently on the ground.",

Having been educated in the English fashion, she was able to converse in English, and the guide had informed Mr. Fogg that this woman, who seemed entirely recovered, was the widow of a rajah of great wealth and high rank. It was now sixteen hours since they had left the railway station, and the elephant was going at a rapid pace. They had gone about fifty miles, and the guide was making use of the darker hours to make headway. They were going through a dense forest, with occasional open spaces, and the elephant, guided with admirable skill, went through the brushwood and trees. At six o'clock in the morning they stopped. The country seemed desolate and deserted. They breakfasted on the provisions purchased at Kholby, and which the guide added to by picking some wild fruits from the trees. All of them were hungry, and the meal was very acceptable. Aouda was very lovely and intelligent, and enjoyed the meal immensely. Sir Francis remarked this to Phileas Fogg. Mr. Fogg replied, \"Indeed. She is a very charming woman.\" They rested for a few hours and then resumed their journey. They pressed on, hoping to reach Allahabad as soon as possible."

Aouda, recovering from her ordeal, observed the passing world with a mixture of wonder and apprehension, finding reassurance in the quiet presence of her protectors. Passepartout, ever the observer, marvelled at the efficiency of the transport, a stark contrast to their earlier elephant ride. He reflected on the incredible turn of events that had brought this beautiful woman into their company.

The train passed by the suburbs, and Passepartout caught a glimpse of the city, which, with its brick houses and clay huts, wore at a distance a most deplorable aspect; and he was quite of the opinion that its legendary reputation was far below the reality. This was the station where Sir Francis Cromarty was to alight, his troops being encamped some miles northward of the city. He bade adieu to Phileas Fogg, wishing him a pleasant journey and success in his enterprise, and expressing the hope that he might hear of him again, and that he would return in a less original but more profitable fashion. Mr. Fogg simply gave a light handshake. Aouda was more demonstrative in her parting, and Passepartout received a hearty shake of the hand from the general.",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents additional details about the characters' parting gestures and emotional responses at the end, which are not present in the original passage. Specifically, it adds actions and interactions for Aouda, Passepartout, and Sir Francis Cromarty that do not appear in the source text.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the explanation that Hong Kong is an English city located on an island off the Chinese coast, which is provided in the original after mentioning Aouda's Parsee relation.\n- The original includes a description of Benares as being called the \"Athens of India\" by Orientalists, which is missing from the completion.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes the legends about Benares to the Ramayana, whereas the original refers to Brahmin legends without specifying a particular text.\n- The sequence of events is slightly altered: the completion introduces Passepartout's opinion about the city, which is not present in the original, and changes the tone of the city’s description.\n- The completion provides an inaccurate summary of Sir Francis Cromarty's farewell, including invented dialogue and gestures, and omits his specific wish that Fogg would return in a less original but more profitable fashion."

            "prefix-probing": "Aouda pathetically thanked her deliverers, rather with tears than words; her fine eyes interpreted her gratitude better than her lips. She was weak, trembling, and still wrapped in the funereal vestments from which they had snatched her just moments before. Phileas Fogg, calm as ever, simply acknowledged her thanks, viewing the rescue as a necessary task completed according to his plan. Passepartout, visibly moved by her plight, fussed over her with heartfelt concern and offered what small comfort he could. Sir Francis regarded her with pity for the ordeal she had so recently suffered. Leaving her behind in this desolate region was clearly an impossible course of action. Fogg, with typical practicality and logic, determined she must accompany them eastward towards Allahabad immediately. This unforeseen passenger was incorporated into his rigid plans with the same precision as managing a train schedule. He recognized the responsibility for the life they had saved. They gently helped her onto the elephant once more, securing her safely. As dawn broke fully, they resumed their rapid journey across the vast plains. Aouda, fragile yet safe in their company, was now an integral part of their incredible dash across India, an unplanned but essential human element in Fogg's precise itinerary around the world. No one questioned the decision; their collective path was now shared. This unforeseen turn united their destination, at least for the immediate future, deep within the heart of the Indian subcontinent."

Elephants were bathing in the waters of the sacred river, and groups of Indians, despite the advanced season and chilly air, were performing solemnly their pious ablutions. These were fervent Brahmins, the bitterest foes of Buddhism, their deities being Vishnu, the solar god, Shiva, the divine impersonation of natural forces, and Brahma, the supreme ruler of priests and legislators. What would these divinities think of India, anglicised as it is to-day, with steamers whistling and scudding along the Ganges, frightening the gulls which float upon its surface, the turtles swarming along its banks, and the faithful dwelling upon its borders?\nThe panorama passed before their eyes like a flash, save when the steam concealed it fitfully from the view; the travellers could scarcely discern the fort of Chupenie, twenty miles south-westward from Benares, the ancient stronghold of the rajahs of Behar; or Ghazipur and its famous rose-water factories; or the tomb of Lord Cornwallis, rising on the left bank of the Ganges; the fortified town of Buxar, or Patna, a large manufacturing and trading-place, where is held the principal opium market of India; or Monghir, a more than European town, for it is as English as Manchester or Birmingham, with its iron foundries, edgetool factories, and high chimneys puffing clouds of black smoke heavenward.\nNight came on; the train passed on at full speed, in the midst of the roaring of the tigers, bears, and wolves which fled before the locomotive; and the marvels of Bengal, Golconda ruined Gour, Murshedabad, the ancient capital, Burdwan, Hugly, and the French town of Chandernagor, where Passepartout would have been proud to see his country’s flag flying, were hidden from their view in the darkness.\nCalcutta was reached at seven in the morning, and the packet left for Hong Kong at noon; so that Phileas Fogg had five hours before him.\nAccording to his journal, he was due at Calcutta on the 25th of October, and that was the exact date of his actual arrival. He was therefore neither behind-hand nor ahead of time. The two days gained between London and Bombay had been lost, as has been seen, in the journey across India.

Then the plains and valleys stretched out, and the train, rushing at full speed, passed over bridges and viaducts, and skirted the bases of mountains cut into bizarre peaks, from which a few scattered trees rose like gigantic parasols. On the alluvial soil of the Ganges valley, the rice-plantations, which even the Brahminy bulls could not devour, bloomed luxuriantly, and fields of wheat and barley alternated with the thickets, peopled with elephants and wild boars, or with populous villages, the inhabitants of which were not more audacious than the beasts of the forests. The travellers beheld thundering herds of elephants, which the conductor with difficulty succeeded in frightening off the track. They saw rhinoceroses with their speckled hides, and alligators of prodigious size. Whole forests of palms appeared, and palanquins were seen, from which female figures, richly adorned with silks and golden embroidery, stared at the train as it passed. At the village of Tannerah, twenty miles north of Bengal, they perceived a band of fakirs, with their bodies daubed with ochre, and adorned with ear-rings, who were performing their religious rites. These fanatical devotees, who perform all sorts of penances, formerly used to bury themselves for twenty days; but the English government has stopped these edifying sacrifices. On the banks of the Ganges, and in the midst of the plain, were scattered ruins, some of them immense, which the conquering Britons have not been able to destroy. The train had started at noon; and Fogg and Passepartout, comfortably ensconced in a first-class carriage, were watching the landscape, which was justly denominated the \"picture-book of India.\" The ingenious railway wound along the sides of mountains, over precipices, through sharp curves, and into deep ravines, which, though clothed with thick forests, were still sometimes crossed by the rays of the sun. In the midst of the jungle, they saw elephants, which the natives were capturing on the wing, not for their ivory, but for their use in the labours of transportation. For several hours the train skirted the banks of the Ganges, whose sacred waters roll down from the Himalayas, and are worshipped by the whole of India. The Brahmins, disciples of Brahma, the Vishnu, and the Siva, thronged its banks, performing their ablutions, with cries of piety, and completely filling the air with the mystic sounds of their hymns; and, while they were thus engaged in their devotions, the train rushed on, at full speed, carrying with it, across the sacred river, the iron monsters which, like the sacred bull, belong to the anglicised India, and which are destined to change the face of the country. The journey was continued during the day and the following night. The landscape was sometimes hidden from view by the volume of steam which issued from the locomotive, and sometimes by the dense smoke which arose from the burning woods. The train passed swiftly by the fort of Chupenie, by Ghazipur, with its Lord Cornwallis's tomb, by Buxar, by Patna, the great opium market, and by Monghir, an industrial town, where cotton and other textiles are manufactured. In the darkness, the sounds of the tigers, bears, and wolves, which still infest the jungles, were heard, mingling with the whistle of the locomotive. At seven o'clock in the morning the train arrived at Calcutta. The Hong Kong steamer would not leave till noon; so Mr. Fogg had five hours before him.

The track, recently laid, plunged into the heart of the vast Indian plain, a monotonous yet fertile expanse stretching seemingly without end. To the north, the distant haze hinted at the formidable Himalayas, though they remained unseen. The train, a marvel of modern engineering in this ancient land, rumbled eastward with a steady, if not spectacular, pace. Inside the compartment, Mr. Fogg sat in his usual reserved posture, occasionally consulting his journal or his watch, utterly unaffected by the sights and sounds that whirred past his window. Passepartout, however, was all eyes and ears. This was the India of his dreams, albeit viewed through a pane of glass and at considerable speed. He marvelled at the clusters of mud huts, the palm trees silhouetted against the sky, and the figures of natives, often startled by the iron horse, stopping their work in the fields to gaze at the passing phenomenon. The air that swept in through the open windows was thick with the scent of dust, vegetation, and the unmistakable aroma of the East. They crossed numerous rivers, tributaries swelling the might of the sacred Ganges, spanned by newly constructed bridges that spoke of the British Raj's determination to bind the vast subcontinent with ribbons of steel. As the hours wore on, the landscape remained largely unchanged – flat, agricultural land, occasionally interrupted by small towns or patches of scrub forest. Yet, a subtle shift began to occur. The signs of habitation became slightly less frequent, the cultivated fields giving way to a wilder aspect of nature. Passepartout noticed the change first, pointing out to Aouda, who was travelling with them now, the increasing density of the vegetation and the occasional glimpse of unfamiliar birds. The train slowed down at small stations, mere platforms in the wilderness, where vendors offered refreshments or local crafts, adding fleeting splashes of colour and sound to the journey. Fogg remained detached, his focus fixed solely on the schedule, on reaching Calcutta by the appointed time. He trusted the railway implicitly, believing it to be a reliable instrument in his race against the clock. Little did he know that this leg of the journey, seemingly straightforward, held a significant and unexpected obstacle, one that would force a drastic alteration to his meticulously planned itinerary and lead him into a truly unforeseen adventure deep within the heart of India, far from the predictable path of iron rails."

Mr. Fogg, consulting his ever-present watch, noted the time with his usual precision. \"Nine o'clock,\" he announced calmly. \"We have ample margin.\" Aouda, clinging slightly to his arm, surveyed the unfamiliar, bustling scene with wide eyes. Passepartout, meanwhile, had already located and negotiated with a couple of palanquin-bearers. Their destination was clear: the docks, and the steamer 'Rangoon'. Time was the critical factor now; every minute saved on land was a precious gain for the long sea journey ahead. They quickly settled into the palanquins, the bearers raising them onto their shoulders, ready to navigate the crowded streets. As they were carried away, leaving the chaotic station behind, a solitary figure detached himself from the observing crowd. Inspector Fix, having arrived on the same train, watched their swift departure with a mixture of exasperation and grim determination. Fogg's efficiency was maddening, constantly putting him one step behind. He knew he had to act quickly before the steamer sailed. Getting a warrant in Calcutta would be difficult and time-consuming. Perhaps there would be an opportunity at the port itself. With a sigh of frustration, Fix resolved to follow. The pursuit was growing tighter, the stakes higher, as Fogg raced towards the next horizon, unaware of the shadow dogging his heels. Calcutta presented the next challenge, both for the traveller and the detective."

However, the calculation remains valid until it is proven otherwise. We shall await clarification.\" Passepartout could only gape, utterly astounded by his master's terrifying calmness even as their world seemed to collapse around them, jeopardizing the entire enterprise and their freedom."

Shortly after, the judge, Judge Obadiah, a corpulent man, appeared, followed by the clerk, Oysterpuff. Judge Obadiah proceeded to take off a wig which was on his desk, and put it on his head – but it was the clerk’s wig. The worthy magistrate saw nothing astonishing in this, and was quite ready to open the sitting, when the clerk, Mr. Oysterpuff, ventured to observe that his honour was wearing *his* wig. Judge Obadiah started, and exclaimed, “My dear Mr. Oysterpuff, is it possible? A judge dispensing justice in a clerk’s wig! Nay, my dear fellow, that will never do.” The wig was amicably exchanged. Passepartout was getting nervous, for the clock on the wall indicated twenty minutes past eight. The first case was called. It was that of a Mr. Balthazar, who was charged with a contempt of court, in brandishing a cane at a policeman because he was forbidden to enter a pagoda. The defendant was condemned to pay a fine of two hundred rupees and the costs. And then came Phileas Fogg’s turn. Oysterpuff called out, “Phileas Fogg, and Passepartout.” “I am here,” said Mr. Fogg, rising. “Passepartout also,” added Passepartout, with a bow. “Good,” said Judge Obadiah. “For two days you have been sought for.” “But you could not find me, as I was quietly at the hotel,” replied Mr. Fogg. “There is no charge against me, I presume?” “There is,” replied Judge Obadiah. Passepartout was seized with a fit of nervous trembling, and the hands of the clock seemed to move with a frightful rapidity. “Well, what is it?” asked Mr. Fogg. “You are accused of having violated a religious custom, the consequences of which you are aware of,” replied Judge Obadiah. “I refer to the affair of the Bombay pagoda.” “You are misinformed, sir,” replied Mr. Fogg, calmly. “The custom house officer of Bombay—” “You are an Englishman, are you not?” asked Judge Obadiah. “Yes.” “Your servant?” “A Frenchman. A Parisian, from Paris.” “Ah! you know the consequences?” “I ought to,” replied Passepartout, “since it was I who put my foot in it!” He blurted out the words before he could stop himself. “The court has heard you,” said Judge Obadiah. “Hold your tongue.

The magistrate's expression changed from sternness to astonishment, then to a look of profound embarrassment. He nodded, and the clerk withdrew.The magistrate turned back to Fogg, his face flushed. \"Mr. Fogg,\" he stammered, \"a most regrettable error has occurred. Information has just reached us that the actual robber, a man named James Strand, was apprehended in Liverpool three days ago. You are entirely innocent of the charges.\"Fix paled visibly and seemed to shrink into himself.\"I am innocent,\" stated Fogg, his voice flat, without a trace of triumph or relief, \"but I have lost time.\" He looked at his watch. \"Ten hours, eighteen minutes, lost.\"The magistrate, mortified, rose. \"Mr. Fogg, I offer you my deepest apologies for this inexcusable detention. You are free to go immediately.\"Fogg bowed slightly. \"Thank you.\" He turned on his heel. \"Passepartout!\" he commanded, already heading towards the exit. \"The railway station!

Meanwhile, I have heard the charge against your master. You are clearly guilty, Mr. Fogg, of having violated a sacred place, with a shoe on your foot, and the fact is admitted.’ ‘By whom admitted?’ cried Passepartout, who had approached his master, and was listening with open mouth. ‘By me,’ replied Mr. Fogg, fixing his clear eyes upon his servant. ‘A shoe on his foot!’ cried Passepartout, with a loud stamp. ‘A shoe on my foot! Come, this is a good one!’ The judge was scandalised. ‘If you make another such outburst, Passepartout,’ said he, ‘I shall send you to prison.’ The clerk then exhibited a pair of shoes, large and heavy, and which had a certain English look about them.",

A process-server had just stopped Mr. Fogg and himself in the street in Calcutta, and, with a warrant, summoned them to appear before a judge of the High Court, in company with the elephant, Kiouni, which had been brought around to the door, and the animal’s owner. Mr. Fogg and Passepartout were conducted to a hall in the courthouse, and before Judge Obadiah. Aouda, being a foreigner in the district, was not included in the warrant, and remained in the carriage. A very grand personage, with a powdered wig, and in an ermine robe, was seated on a bench, and below him was a registrar taking notes. Judge Obadiah belonged to the class of Brahmins who form the very top of the Indian hierarchy. He administered the law with severe impartiality, and held a firm hand over the natives, who were apt to break the statutes, and upon the Europeans themselves when they trespassed. “You are Phileas Fogg, Esq.?” asked the judge. “I am.” “And you are Passepartout?” “Precisely, your honour.” “You have been brought before us,” continued the judge, “on the charge of violating a place held sacred by the Brahmin religion.” “Yes, the pagoda of Malebar Hill, in Bombay,” added the registrar. “Your honour,” resumed Mr. Fogg, “I was ignorant that the entrance to this pagoda was forbidden.” “Ignorant!” cried Judge Obadiah. “A gentleman as well informed as yourself, couldn’t help but know that he was not permitted to enter that pagoda.” “I declare to you, sir, that I did not know it,” replied Fogg, dryly. “And you,,” asked the judge of Passepartout, “did you not conceal yourself in the interior of the temple?” “I beg your honour’s pardon,” said Passepartout; “but I and master thought that since the temple was open—————” “Shut up!” cried the judge. “The facts are as follows,” he proceeded, reading from a paper: “At Bombay, on the 20th of October, you, Passepartout, violated the pagoda of Malebar Hill, by entering it at the hour when it was forbidden, and by polluting it by sacrilegiously removing your shoes, which you carried in your hand.” “Guilty,” replied Passepartout, who bit his lips, on seeing that it was really his fault. “The law,” resumed the judge, “provides a penalty of imprisonment and fine for this offence. Have you anything to say in your defence?” “Your honour,” replied Mr. Fogg, “I will say that a fine, which I am ready to pay—————” “Be silent!” said the judge. “I am not asking you to pay a fine, but to give an account of your conduct. It appears that you entered the pagoda—————” “No, your honour,” cried Passepartout, “it was not my master, but I.” “Silence!” repeated the judge. “It seems that you entered the pagoda,” he continued, turning to Mr. Fogg, “with a servant in your company who bore the principal blame.” “Not at all! not at all!” protested Mr. Fogg. “I am the one who is responsible, and not my servant. And now,” he added, addressing Passepartout, “since you are the one who is responsible, what have you to say for yourself?” Passepartout hung his head, and made no reply. “Very well,” said the judge. “Considering that Phileas Fogg, gentleman, has shown himself to be a man of honour, and that he has not attempted to evade the law, and considering that Passepartout, his servant, is a simple-minded fellow, who has been led astray by his master's example, we shall inflict a fine of one thousand pounds and two weeks' imprisonment upon Phileas Fogg, and a fine of five hundred pounds and one week's imprisonment upon Passepartout.” Mr. Fogg and Passepartout received the sentence with equanimity. But they had reckoned on only a fine, and the prospect of imprisonment was by no means agreeable. Mr. Fogg, however, recovered himself at once. “I am ready to pay the fine,” he said, “but I cannot submit to imprisonment. I am engaged in a journey around the world, and I must be in London in eighty days. I have already lost several days by this unfortunate affair, and I cannot afford to lose any more. I must be set at liberty at once, and I will give bail for my appearance whenever I am called upon.” “That is impossible,” said the judge. “The law is inexorable.” “But,” said Mr. Fogg, “I am willing to give bail to any amount. I will give bail for twenty thousand pounds, if you require it.” “It is useless,” said the judge. “The law must take its course.” Mr. Fogg looked grave. This was a serious blow to his plans. He had not anticipated such a delay. He could not spare two weeks. What was to be done? He looked at Passepartout, and Passepartout looked at him. Neither of them spoke. They were both reflecting. Passepartout was the first to speak. “Master,” he said, “this is all my fault. If I had not gone into that pagoda—————” “Silence!” said Mr. Fogg. “I have already told you that you are not to blame. It is I who am responsible. But we must get out of this difficulty somehow. Let me see.” He thought for a few minutes, and then he said: “I have it! There is only one way.” “What is it, master?” asked Passepartout. “We must escape,” replied Mr. Fogg. “Escape!” cried Passepartout, with surprise. “Yes,” said Mr. Fogg, calmly. “We must escape this very night. It will not be easy, but it is our only chance.” “But how can we escape?” asked Passepartout. “We are closely guarded.” “We must bribe the guards,” replied Mr. Fogg. “We have money enough.” “But where can we go?” asked Passepartout. “We are in a foreign country.” “We will go to Shanghai,” replied Mr. Fogg. “From Shanghai we can take a steamer to Yokohama, and from Yokohama we can go to America. We will still be able to reach London in time.” Passepartout was astonished at his master’s coolness and decision. He was ready to follow him anywhere. “Very well, master,” he said. “I am ready.” “Good,” said Mr. Fogg. “Now, listen carefully to my instructions.” But at this moment, the door opened, and a man entered the room, accompanied by several policemen. “Mr. Fogg,” said the man, “I arrest you in the name of the Queen.” “On what charge?” asked Mr. Fogg, calmly. “On the charge of robbing the Bank of England,” replied the man. It was Fix, the detective! We perceive now what had delayed Fix. The arrest in Bombay, and the complications growing out of it, had put him upon the right track. He had seen that Fogg was in a great hurry to get away from British territory, and he suspected that he was about to leave India. He had therefore sent word to the authorities at Calcutta to be on the lookout for him. But he had not been content with this. He had also consulted with the priests of the Malebar Hill pagoda, and had promised them a handsome sum if they would follow Fogg to Calcutta and prefer a complaint against him. The priests had readily assented. They had come to Calcutta with Fix, and had presented their complaint to the judge. Fix had, of course, not mentioned his real character. He had simply represented himself as a friend of the priests, who had been outraged by the profanation of their temple. The judge, being a Brahmin himself, had taken up the case with great zeal, and had issued the warrant for Fogg's arrest. It will be remembered that the delay caused by the rescue of Aouda had enabled Fix and the priests to arrive in Calcutta before Fogg. Fix had been waiting for Fogg at the station for twenty-four hours. He had been in a state of feverish anxiety, for he feared that Fogg had been warned and had taken another route. But when he saw Fogg alight from the train with Passepartout and Aouda, his doubts vanished, and he felt sure that he had him at last. He had immediately sent for a policeman, and had caused the arrest to be made. And now, here was Mr. Fogg, in the grasp of the law. Fix felt a thrill of triumph. He had succeeded at last. He was sure of his reward. But he had forgotten one thing. He had forgotten that Mr. Fogg was not alone. He had forgotten that Mr. Fogg had a companion who was as quick-witted as himself, and who was devoted to him body and soul. Passepartout saw at once that this was the detective who had been so persistent in following them. He saw that this was the man who had been trying to throw obstacles in their way. He saw that this was the man who had been plotting against them. His blood boiled. He felt an irresistible impulse to fly at the man’s throat. But he restrained himself. He knew that his master would not approve of such violence. He stood still, and waited. Mr. Fogg looked at Fix, and a faint smile played upon his lips. He saw that he had been trapped. He saw that he had been delivered into the hands of the police. But he did not lose his composure. He was still the same calm, imperturbable Mr. Fogg. He looked at Fix, and waited for him to speak. Fix hesitated for a moment. He was surprised at Mr. Fogg’s calmness. He had expected to see him betray some sign of fear or agitation. But there was none. Mr. Fogg stood before him, as impassive as a statue. Fix was disconcerted. He had never met such a man before. He hardly knew what to say. But he had a duty to perform, and he resolved to perform it. He held out the warrant to Mr. Fogg. “Mr. Fogg,” he said, “you are accused of having robbed the Bank of England of fifty-five thousand pounds. I arrest you in the name of the Queen.”",

                "text": "“My shoes!” cried Passepartout, in his surprise permitting this imprudent exclamation to escape him. A process-server had just stopped Mr. Fogg and himself in the street in Calcutta, and, with a warrant, summoned them to appear before a judge of the High Court, in company with the elephant, Kiouni, which had been brought around to the door, and the animal’s owner. Mr. Fogg and Passepartout were conducted to a hall in the courthouse, and before Judge Obadiah. Aouda, being a foreigner in the district, was not included in the warrant, and remained in the carriage. A very grand personage, with a powdered wig, and in an ermine robe, was seated on a bench, and below him was a registrar taking notes. Judge Obadiah belonged to the class of Brahmins who form the very top of the Indian hierarchy. He administered the law with severe impartiality, and held a firm hand over the natives, who were apt to break the statutes, and upon the Europeans themselves when they trespassed. “You are Phileas Fogg, Esq.?” asked the judge. “I am.” “And you are Passepartout?” “Precisely, your honour.” “You have been brought before us,” continued the judge, “on the charge of violating a place held sacred by the Brahmin religion.” “Yes, the pagoda of Malebar Hill, in Bombay,” added the registrar. “Your honour,” resumed Mr. Fogg, “I was ignorant that the entrance to this pagoda was forbidden.” “Ignorant!” cried Judge Obadiah. “A gentleman as well informed as yourself, couldn’t help but know that he was not permitted to enter that pagoda.” “I declare to you, sir, that I did not know it,” replied Fogg, dryly. “And you,,” asked the judge of Passepartout, “did you not conceal yourself in the interior of the temple?” “I beg your honour’s pardon,” said Passepartout; “but I and master thought that since the temple was open—————” “Shut up!” cried the judge. “The facts are as follows,” he proceeded, reading from a paper: “At Bombay, on the 20th of October, you, Passepartout, violated the pagoda of Malebar Hill, by entering it at the hour when it was forbidden, and by polluting it by sacrilegiously removing your shoes, which you carried in your hand.” “Guilty,” replied Passepartout, who bit his lips, on seeing that it was really his fault. “The law,” resumed the judge, “provides a penalty of imprisonment and fine for this offence. Have you anything to say in your defence?” “Your honour,” replied Mr. Fogg, “I will say that a fine, which I am ready to pay—————” “Be silent!” said the judge. “I am not asking you to pay a fine, but to give an account of your conduct. It appears that you entered the pagoda—————” “No, your honour,” cried Passepartout, “it was not my master, but I.” “Silence!” repeated the judge. “It seems that you entered the pagoda,” he continued, turning to Mr. Fogg, “with a servant in your company who bore the principal blame.” “Not at all! not at all!” protested Mr. Fogg. “I am the one who is responsible, and not my servant.

            "prefix-probing": "“My shoes!” cried Passepartout, in his surprise permitting this imprudent exclamation to escape him. He stood staring in utter dismay and disbelief at the charred remnants that had once been his stout travelling boots, now reduced to blackened leather and ruined soles. Monsieur Fogg, standing nearby in his characteristic impassive manner, merely glanced at his servant, not betraying the slightest emotion. \"They were part of the \tRangoon\t's structure, Passepartout,\" Fogg explained calmly. \"Wood was needed for the fires. Time was of the utmost essence to stay on schedule.\" Indeed, Fogg had taken the drastic step of purchasing the ship outright and ordering her upper works, masts, and even parts of the hull to be systematically burned to fuel the engines and maintain maximum speed towards Shanghai. Passepartout felt a pang of dismay. His comfortable, reliable shoes, a small link to his former orderly life, sacrificed for speed! Yet, even as he mourned his footwear, he could not help but feel a thrill at the audacity of his master's actions. To burn a ship, their vessel of passage, simply to make better time! It was mad, magnificent, utterly Fogg-like. The relentless pursuit of the deadline dwarfed every other consideration, even sensible shoes. He sighed, accepting the inevitable. There was no use complaining to Mr. Fogg about trivialities like footwear when the fate of a wager and potentially a fortune hung in the balance. He would simply have to manage. They were finally nearing Shanghai now, the destination that represented their only hope after the steamer's delay. The smell of burning wood still lingered, a testament to the extreme lengths Fogg would go."

The judge, Obadiah, a fat little man, called Passepartout’s attention to the fact that he had admitted the charge, by crying out against the shoes. Passepartout stammered that it was only because they were new and pinched him. Mr. Fogg coldly observed that his servant’s defence was a bad one, but that he should nevertheless pay the fine.

The pagoda incident, dismissed by Fogg, presented Fix with a providential opportunity. Charged with sacrilege, a serious Indian offense, Fogg was now held in Calcutta. Fix watched from the corner, a silent hunter, his eyes sharp with predatory focus. He cared nothing for the charge itself, only the delay it promised. He needed Fogg anchored, buying precious time for the warrant to arrive. Passepartout, however, saw only the immediate, terrifying scene in the courtroom. The accusation pressed down on him, a heavy burden. He knew tampering with sacred objects was a grave offense, the potential penalties dire. Guilt gnawed at him; it was his curiosity at the temple that had brought them here. His master, Monsieur Fogg, sat impassive as ever, a picture of calm indifference, a stark contrast to Passepartout's internal turmoil. The valet twisted his hands nervously, his gaze flicking between the austere judge and the unfathomable legal process. The foreign language, the strange customs, the sheer formality of the court – it all heightened his distress. He felt utterly vulnerable, trapped in a nightmarish legal system far from home. Consumed by his fear and the potential ruin of his master's wager, Passepartout entirely missed the presence of the quiet man observing them. Fix, meanwhile, watched patiently. Fogg’s unnatural calm provoked him; it had to be the facade of a master criminal. The valet’s obvious anxiety seemed genuine, confirming Fix's suspicion that Fogg had dragged the poor man into his scheme. A conviction, even a brief one, would be ideal—it would halt Fogg's journey, allowing the warrant time to arrive. An acquittal meant merely continuing the chase. Either way, Fix was ready. He would not lose sight of his quarry. Passepartout, absorbed in the courtroom drama, remained oblivious to the persistent, silent threat lurking inches away, focused only on the immediate peril."

And Fogg's generosity, it must be remembered, was not for his own benefit, but for Aouda's. It was she for whom he had paid the two thousand pounds to the Indian High Court, and who was now comfortably settled in a cabin on the \"Rangoon\". Some conjectures were made by Passepartout concerning the reasons which induced his master to take Aouda with him. Mr. Fogg was perfectly calm, but Passepartout was by no means so. He greatly regretted having run away from Fix, and the consequences of the assault at the pagoda. Had he remained, he might have assisted Fix, and at any rate have learned who he was. But, no matter, he was now on the way to Hong Kong, and could not go back. It is probable that Phileas Fogg intended to continue his journey, and was carrying Aouda to Europe by the most natural route. But, for that matter, how could he have contemplated remaining in India, when the telegraphic despatch from London was staring him in the face, promising him a successful journey around the world, provided he did not allow himself to be stopped? Fogg, with his two thousand pounds in the High Court, was no doubt a little disturbed. But, with a composure which did not abandon him in the most trying crises, he said to Aouda, \"You are safe, madam.\" Passepartout was on deck, forward, and regarded the retiring shores of India, with the sad reflection that he had missed a chance of learning whether Fix was really working for Mr. Fogg. No doubt the accident which had befallen him would be of advantage to Fix, who would find himself alone in India, and master of the situation. Passepartout shuddered at the thought, but could not help thinking that the good Mr. Fogg, after all his generosity, would not be sorry to be rid of him. Passepartout was wrong. Mr. Fogg's expedition was an expensive one. The bribes at Calcutta, the elephant at a thousand pounds, the two hundred pounds at the police court, the lawyer's fee of two hundred pounds, and the bail of two thousand pounds; these sums amounted to more than five thousand pounds. And yet Fogg carried about with him a bag of banknotes which represented the whole of his fortune! He had no doubt counted upon the two thousand pounds as part of the sum which he was to devote to the tour. He could, however, at any moment draw upon his credit with the Barings; but, for all that, he seemed by no means disposed to lessen the bag which Passepartout so carefully guarded. He kept the two thousand pounds at the High Court for Aouda's benefit. This money, by the way, was repaid to him by the Indian Government, as soon as it was proved that Colonel Proctor, and not Mr. Fogg, had assaulted the priests of the pagoda. But we shall see that later. The expedition was a losing one, from the commercial point of view. Passepartout looked out upon the ocean, and, despite the speed of the steamer, felt that the eighty days were flying, and that the thirty thousand pounds would soon be reached. He muttered to himself, \"Will my master still want to get rid of me? I hope not, after this! He is so very good!\"",

Aouda, graceful and composed, walked beside him, a quiet trust in her eyes, now directed towards this extraordinary man who had rescued her. Passepartout trailed behind, his head bowed. Eighty days! The figure echoed like a death knell in his ears. His dreams of a quiet, settled life of service, perhaps even cultivating a small garden, evaporated like mist under the tropical sun. His new master, whom he had judged so methodical and predictable, had revealed himself to be the most eccentric adventurer imaginables, setting off on a madcap journey requiring haste, improvisation, and encounters with the unknown – precisely the things Passepartout most dreaded. He sighed heavily, contemplating the upheaval of the orderly household at Savile Row, the hurried packing, the imminent rush to the station. He had only just begun to appreciate the quiet regularity of London life, and now he was to be flung across continents and oceans at breakneck speed."

On board for this particular trip were a diverse group of passengers, bound for various ports in Japan. Among them were Phileas Fogg and Mrs. Aouda, occupying cabins reserved hastily due to their unexpected change of plans in Hong Kong. Mr. Fogg, ever the epitome of composure, maintained his usual routine, spending much of his time with Aouda in their reserved salon, reading or engaged in a game of whist. The loss of Passepartout, who had missed the Carnatic, was a silent but significant burden, yet Fogg showed no outward sign of distress or haste. He observed the ship's progress with his characteristic precision, calculating distances and probable arrival times. Aouda, though increasingly concerned about the journey and their missing companion, found reassurance in Fogg's unwavering calm. The weather was relatively favorable, and the Rangoon made steady headway across the tranquil waters. However, the lost time in Hong Kong, exacerbated by the episode with Detective Fix and the missed connection, meant this leg of the journey was critical. They needed to reach Yokohama not just on time, but possibly ahead of schedule, to secure passage across the vast Pacific Ocean, the longest and most challenging segment remaining in their race against the clock and the wager. The urgency, palpable to anyone aware of their circumstances, seemed only to exist outside Mr. Fogg's immediate sphere, enclosed as he was in his meticulous world of calculations and quiet focus."

She recounted the despair of her situation, the terror she felt facing the flames, and the absolute certainty that her life was about to end. Her family, though distant and unable to intervene directly due to the power of the priests and the strict local customs, had secretly implored the guide to help. The guide, knowing the rajah’s death would precipitate this dreadful act, had sought aid. Fortunately, Fogg’s journey had brought them to the vicinity. Her rescue felt like a miraculous intervention, a sudden lifting of the death sentence and an unexpected grant of life and freedom from an inescapable fate that had been meticulously planned by cruel tradition and religious dogma."

This precious time would offer no opportunity to procure a warrant, much less make inquiries or effect an arrest. Every minute counted, and every delay felt like a personal affront to the detective's relentless pursuit. He paced the deck, a solitary, watchful figure, casting anxious glances towards the distant horizon, as if urging the ship forward with the sheer force of his will. The short stop in Singapore was exactly as predicted – a fleeting glimpse of a bustling port, a quick replenishment of supplies, and then the ship was once more steaming out to sea, leaving Fix utterly helpless, his quarry still tantalizingly within reach but legally untouchable. Now, Hong Kong. This was the key. It was a major British colony, with proper legal machinery. Surely, a warrant would have arrived there by telegraph! If not, he would have sufficient time to explain the situation to the police and have one issued. He clung to this hope with a fierce tenacity, his eyes fixed on the map, tracing the ship's path across the vast expanse of the South China Sea. The journey felt interminable, each day adding to his gnawing anxiety. What if Fogg deviated from his plan? What if the warrant hadn't been sent? The thought of failing now, after chasing the supposed robber halfway around the globe, was unbearable. Hong Kong represented his last, best chance."

He couldn't let Fogg slip through his fingers now. He would watch Passepartout closely, looking for any sign of wavering loyalty or potential understanding. If the warrant failed to materialize before their departure from the next suitable port, he would play his last card, hoping the valet possessed some shred of honesty or fear of being implicated in a grand crime.

            "prefix-probing": "It was now the 30th of October, and on the following day the “Rangoon” was due at Singapore. Mr. Fogg had calculated that he was exactly on schedule, having used the three days gained by crossing the Indian peninsula from Bombay to Calcutta. The passage from Calcutta had been relatively calm, traversing the Bay of Bengal and the Strait of Malacca. Phileas Fogg, ever impassive, spent his days in the saloon, reading his newspaper or playing whist with his fellow passengers. Aouda, now more accustomed to her new life, found herself increasingly attached to the quiet, methodical Englishman who had saved her. She often sat on deck, watching the distant shores, or conversed gently with Passepartout, who, despite his master's precision, still worried about the myriad unforeseen delays that might derail their incredible journey. The \"Rangoon,\" a rapid steamer of the Peninsular and Oriental Company, held up her reputation admirably, cleaving the smooth tropical waters with steady speed. The atmosphere on board was one of quiet anticipation as Singapore approached. Passengers discussed trade, local customs, and the exotic sights awaiting them. Fogg, however, remained absorbed in his timetable, checking his watch with metronomic regularity, his face revealing nothing of his inner thoughts or the immense stakes of his wager. Aouda observed him with a mixture of curiosity and growing admiration for his unwavering composure. On the morning of the 31st, the low-lying coast of the Malay Peninsula came into view. Soon, the bustling port of Singapore appeared, a vibrant mosaic of masts, buildings, and activity. The \"Rangoon\" steamed into the harbor, dropping anchor precisely at the scheduled hour. Mr. Fogg immediately went ashore, taking Aouda and Passepartout with him. There was no time for sightseeing or exploring the renowned botanical gardens. His sole focus was securing passage on the next available ship to Hong Kong. He learned that the steamer \"Carnatic,\" also belonging to the P. & O. Company, was scheduled to depart the next day, November 1st, at five in the afternoon. This fit perfectly into his itinerary. Having secured berths, Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout took rooms at the Hotel de l’Europe, affording themselves a single night's rest before the next leg of their relentless voyage across the globe. Passepartout, though weary, found some comfort in the brief respite and the prospect of reaching Chinese territory, another step closer to their ultimate goal. The journey, though swift and seemingly smooth under Fogg's guidance, still felt like a dizzying race against time, with each port a fleeting waypoint before the next urgent departure."

He caught a glimpse of that mysterious gentleman once or twice; but Mr. Fogg usually confined himself to the cabin, where he kept Aouda company, or, according to his inveterate habit, took a hand at whist.\nPassepartout began very seriously to conjecture what strange chance kept Fix still on the route that his master was pursuing. It was really worth considering why this certainly very amiable and complacent person, whom he had first met at Suez, had then encountered on board the “Mongolia,” who disembarked at Bombay, which he announced as his destination, and now turned up so unexpectedly on the “Rangoon,” was following Mr. Fogg’s tracks step by step. What was Fix’s object? Passepartout was ready to wager his Indian shoes—which he religiously preserved—that Fix would also leave Hong Kong at the same time with them, and probably on the same steamer.\nPassepartout might have cudgelled his brain for a century without hitting upon the real object which the detective had in view. He never could have imagined that Phileas Fogg was being tracked as a robber around the globe. But, as it is in human nature to attempt the solution of every mystery, Passepartout suddenly discovered an explanation of Fix’s movements, which was in truth far from unreasonable. Fix, he thought, could only be an agent of Mr. Fogg’s friends at the Reform Club, sent to follow him up, and to ascertain that he really went round the world as had been agreed upon.\n“It’s clear!” repeated the worthy servant to himself, proud of his shrewdness. “He’s a spy sent to keep us in view!

He was satisfied that Passepartout was not an accomplice of his master, and that the latter’s journey round the world was actually undertaken in good faith; but it was none the less true that the object of this journey was to escape from the English police. He was still firmly resolved to arrest Fogg directly he set foot on English soil. Fix had now to keep a sharp eye upon Fogg, and wait for the opportunity of arresting him, which would not occur till the detective reached England. As for Aouda, he did not bother himself about her. She was evidently not an accomplice, and her presence did not complicate the situation. But what puzzled Fix was that Mr. Fogg, instead of going directly to England, was following the circuitous route of Hong Kong. Would he not go from Hong Kong to Yokohama, from Yokohama to San Francisco, and thence to New York? Wasn’t he expecting to throw the police off his track in the American Continent, and then get off through some other route? Fix felt quite sure of this, and awaited with impatience the arrival at Hong Kong. It was there, if Fogg did not stop in that city, that he would procure the final warrant of arrest. Passepartout, meanwhile, thought he had been very clever in outwitting the detective. He was still of the opinion that Fix was in the service of the Reform Club, and was scouting along the route taken by Mr. Fogg. As to the why of this undertaking, he was quite at sea. Mr. Fogg went to and fro in the steamer with the utmost composure, was much liked by the passengers, and made frequent use of the telegraphic cable. He and Aouda were almost constantly together in his cabin, or on deck. Mr. Fogg played whist for whole hours with the captain, a clergyman, and a colonial gentleman, and played it with his accustomed scientific precision. Passepartout often stood by the players, and watched his master, who was always just, polite, and impassive, never betraying the least sign of anxiety, Mr. Fogg was also kind to Aouda, and lavished upon her the most delicate attentions. Answering her questions as to the journey, he explained that the most difficult part of it was over, and that they were sailing straight for America, which they hoped to reach in a few days. Passepartout listened to this conversation, and was convinced that his master's confidence was growing. He himself was no longer uneasy about the journey, except for two points: the first was the young lady, who was very pretty, and, in spite of Passepartout's silence, seemed to have a vague suspicion of the circumstances which had induced Mr. Fogg to carry her off from Bombay; and the second was the constant presence of Fix, whom he met at every turn. Fix was walking about on the deck, and whenever Passepartout looked at him, he seemed to be looking away; but he fixed his eyes upon him from time to time, and Passepartout was very much annoyed at this persistence. He wondered if Fix was really sent by the members of the Reform Club, and if he was not really sent to spy upon his master. \"It's very singular,\" thought Passepartout, \"that this gentleman, who said that he was going to Bombay, should have gone on to Singapore, and should be going on to Hong Kong. It's a great mystery. I'll be bound he'll go on with us to Yokohama, and from thence to San Francisco. Ah, if I only knew what it all meant!\" He would have been very much astonished could he have known that Fix was dogging his master's footsteps as a robber. Passepartout had not failed to perceive that Fix's manner had changed since he had left Bombay. He no longer conversed with him as he had in the first part of the journey. He did not know what to think of it; but he was determined to find out the truth. He was certain that Fix was following his master step by step, and that he would follow him to the end of the world. He was determined to find out why. One day, he went up to Fix, and said to him, \"Mr. Fix, I have not seen you at Bombay.\" \"I am very glad to see you here,\" said Fix, without looking at him. \"But you were going to Bombay?\" \"I have changed my mind.\" \"And you are going to Hong Kong?\" \"Yes.\" \"And from thence?\" \"To Yokohama, I suppose.\" \"From thence?\" \"To San Francisco.\" \"From thence?\" \"To New York.\" \"And then?\" \"To England, I suppose.\" \"Ah,\" said Passepartout, with a sigh, \"it is just as I expected. You are one of the gentlemen of the Reform Club.\" Fix started, and looked at Passepartout with a piercing glance. \"I don't understand you,\" said he. \"Oh, yes, you do,\" said Passepartout. \"You are one of the gentlemen of the Reform Club, and you are sent to follow Mr. Fogg, and to see that he goes round the world in eighty days.\" Fix saw that he was discovered, and that there was no use in denying it. He saw that Passepartout believed him to be a spy of the Reform Club, and he was determined to keep up the deception. \"Yes,\" said he, \"I am sent by the Reform Club. I am to follow Mr. Fogg, and to see that he goes round the world in eighty days.\" \"Ah, I knew it,\" said Passepartout, with a triumphant air. \"But I think it is very improper to spy upon an honourable man like Mr. Fogg.\" \"It is my duty,\" said Fix. \"But it is a very disagreeable duty,\" said Passepartout. \"It is necessary,\" said Fix. \"I don't like it,\" said Passepartout. \"But I must do it.\" \"Well,\" said Passepartout, \"I will not hinder you. But I hope you will be as just to Mr. Fogg as I am.\" \"I will,\" said Fix. \"But I must tell you that I do not think he will succeed.\" \"Why not?\" said Passepartout. \"Because,\" said Fix, \"it is impossible to go round the world in eighty days.\" \"I don't think so,\" said Passepartout. \"I am sure of it,\" said Fix. \"Well,\" said Passepartout, \"we shall see.\" He was proud of having found out the truth, as he thought, and of having shown his cleverness. He did not doubt that Fix was a spy of the Reform Club, and he determined to keep a sharp eye upon him, and to prevent him from hindering his master in any way. He was determined to be revenged upon the members of the Reform Club for having suspected Mr. Fogg. He would prove to them that Mr. Fogg was an honest man, and that he could go round the world in eighty days.",

Passepartout often stood by the players, and watched his master, who was always just, polite, and impassive, never betraying the least sign of anxiety, Mr. Fogg was also kind to Aouda, and lavished upon her the most delicate attentions. Answering her questions as to the journey, he explained that the most difficult part of it was over, and that they were sailing straight for America, which they hoped to reach in a few days. Passepartout listened to this conversation, and was convinced that his master's confidence was growing. He himself was no longer uneasy about the journey, except for two points: the first was the young lady, who was very pretty, and, in spite of Passepartout's silence, seemed to have a vague suspicion of the circumstances which had induced Mr. Fogg to carry her off from Bombay; and the second was the constant presence of Fix, whom he met at every turn. Fix was walking about on the deck, and whenever Passepartout looked at him, he seemed to be looking away; but he fixed his eyes upon him from time to time, and Passepartout was very much annoyed at this persistence. He wondered if Fix was really sent by the members of the Reform Club, and if he was not really sent to spy upon his master. \"It's very singular,\" thought Passepartout, \"that this gentleman, who said that he was going to Bombay, should have gone on to Singapore, and should be going on to Hong Kong. It's a great mystery. I'll be bound he'll go on with us to Yokohama, and from thence to San Francisco. Ah, if I only knew what it all meant!\" He would have been very much astonished could he have known that Fix was dogging his master's footsteps as a robber. Passepartout had not failed to perceive that Fix's manner had changed since he had left Bombay. He no longer conversed with him as he had in the first part of the journey. He did not know what to think of it; but he was determined to find out the truth. He was certain that Fix was following his master step by step, and that he would follow him to the end of the world. He was determined to find out why. One day, he went up to Fix, and said to him, \"Mr. Fix, I have not seen you at Bombay.\" \"I am very glad to see you here,\" said Fix, without looking at him. \"But you were going to Bombay?\" \"I have changed my mind.\" \"And you are going to Hong Kong?\" \"Yes.\" \"And from thence?\" \"To Yokohama, I suppose.\" \"From thence?\" \"To San Francisco.\" \"From thence?\" \"To New York.\" \"And then?\" \"To England, I suppose.\" \"Ah,\" said Passepartout, with a sigh, \"it is just as I expected. You are one of the gentlemen of the Reform Club.\" Fix started, and looked at Passepartout with a piercing glance. \"I don't understand you,\" said he. \"Oh, yes, you do,\" said Passepartout. \"You are one of the gentlemen of the Reform Club, and you are sent to follow Mr. Fogg, and to see that he goes round the world in eighty days.\" Fix saw that he was discovered, and that there was no use in denying it. He saw that Passepartout believed him to be a spy of the Reform Club, and he was determined to keep up the deception. \"Yes,\" said he, \"I am sent by the Reform Club. I am to follow Mr. Fogg, and to see that he goes round the world in eighty days.\" \"Ah, I knew it,\" said Passepartout, with a triumphant air. \"But I think it is very improper to spy upon an honourable man like Mr. Fogg.\" \"It is my duty,\" said Fix. \"But it is a very disagreeable duty,\" said Passepartout. \"It is necessary,\" said Fix. \"I don't like it,\" said Passepartout. \"But I must do it.\" \"Well,\" said Passepartout, \"I will not hinder you. But I hope you will be as just to Mr. Fogg as I am.\" \"I will,\" said Fix. \"But I must tell you that I do not think he will succeed.\" \"Why not?\" said Passepartout. \"Because,\" said Fix, \"it is impossible to go round the world in eighty days.\" \"I don't think so,\" said Passepartout. \"I am sure of it,\" said Fix. \"Well,\" said Passepartout, \"we shall see.\" He was proud of having found out the truth, as he thought, and of having shown his cleverness. He did not doubt that Fix was a spy of the Reform Club, and he determined to keep a sharp eye upon him, and to prevent him from hindering his master in any way. He was determined to be revenged upon the members of the Reform Club for having suspected Mr. Fogg. He would prove to them that Mr. Fogg was an honest man, and that he could go round the world in eighty days.",

            "prefix-probing": "The detective and Passepartout met often on deck after this interview, though Fix was reserved, and did not attempt to induce his companion to divulge any more facts concerning Mr. Fogg. Fix saw clearly that Passepartout was entirely ignorant of the crime committed. His object was now not to pump the servant, but to watch the master. He hoped to catch Fogg betraying himself by some word or act. But Phileas Fogg was as impassive and calm as ever. He never seemed anxious, never hurried, never showed the slightest irritation. His equanimity was unnerving to Fix, who was accustomed to the nervous tics and hurried movements of criminals. Fogg simply followed his schedule, spending hours in the smoking-room or playing whist, utterly detached from the detective's scrutiny.Passepartout found Fix agreeable, if a little preoccupied. He chatted freely about his master's peculiarities, the amazing journey, and the strange customs they encountered. He had no suspicion this quiet Englishman was a detective hunting Fogg. Fix listened patiently, sifting through Passepartout's rambling for any useful detail, but found nothing. The honest enthusiasm of the Frenchman only deepened Fix's confusion about Fogg's true nature. Was it possible Fogg was genuinely what he seemed – an eccentric but honourable gentleman pursuing a mad wager? Fix found it hard to reconcile this image with the bank robbery.The voyage from Calcutta to Singapore was swift and uneventful, lasting just a few days. As the steamer approached the port, Fix's anxiety grew. Singapore was a British possession, but Hong Kong, the next stop, was where he believed he could finally obtain the warrant and make the arrest. He knew he was running out of time. If Fogg continued his relentless pace and reached America, capturing him would become infinitely more difficult, perhaps impossible. Fix resolved to prepare meticulously for Hong Kong, where he anticipated his chance."

It is a park checkered by pleasant highways and avenues. A handsome carriage, drawn by a sleek pair of New Holland horses, carried Phileas Fogg and Aouda into the midst of rows of palms with brilliant foliage, and of clove-trees, whereof the cloves form the heart of a half-open flower. Pepper plants replaced the prickly hedges of European fields; sago-bushes, large ferns with gorgeous branches, varied the aspect of this tropical clime; while nutmeg-trees in full foliage filled the air with a penetrating perfume. Agile and grinning bands of monkeys skipped about in the trees, nor were tigers wanting in the jungles.\nAfter a drive of two hours through the country, Aouda and Mr. Fogg returned to the town, which is a vast collection of heavy-looking, irregular houses, surrounded by charming gardens rich in tropical fruits and plants; and at ten o’clock they re-embarked, closely followed by the detective, who had kept them constantly in sight.\nPassepartout, who had been purchasing several dozen mangoes—a fruit as large as good-sized apples, of a dark-brown colour outside and a bright red within, and whose white pulp, melting in the mouth, affords gourmands a delicious sensation—was waiting for them on deck. He was only too glad to offer some mangoes to Aouda, who thanked him very gracefully for them.\nAt eleven o’clock the “Rangoon” rode out of Singapore harbour, and in a few hours the high mountains of Malacca, with their forests, inhabited by the most beautifully-furred tigers in the world, were lost to view. Singapore is distant some thirteen hundred miles from the island of Hong Kong, which is a little English colony near the Chinese coast. Phileas Fogg hoped to accomplish the journey in six days, so as to be in time for the steamer which would leave on the 6th of November for Yokohama, the principal Japanese port.",

It is a park-like country, and the delightful roads that cross it are bordered by hedges of cloves that blossom in full bloom, and of other spice-bearing shrubs, which, added to the tropical climate, make the air fragrant and stimulating. There is a handsome town, several fine forts, and a military establishment of importance. Fogg and Aouda, not wishing to be detained indoors, when they reached the shore took a carriage, and started out upon the roads. It was a most delightful drive. Large trees, among them the caoutchouc, from which india-rubber is procured, sago-palms, ferns with gigantic leaves, and nutmeg-trees, made an agreeable perspective in the midst of elegant bungalows, occupied by wealthy merchants, and surrounded by gardens, where the most beautiful flowers met the eye. Passepartout enjoyed the spectacle, which seemed to him a picture of Eden. As to Mr. Fogg, he beheld it with indifference. They penetrated but a short distance into the interior, for two hours sufficed for them to return to the town and port, and regain the Rangoon. Passepartout, meanwhile, had made a few purchases, buying twenty pounds of mangoes, a fruit as large as a good-sized apple, of a dark brown colour outside and bright red within, and whose pulp, when eaten with milk, is simply delicious. Passepartout was delighted to offer some to Aouda, who found them excellent, and thanked her for this attention. At half-past ten the passengers had all gone ashore, and re-embarked by ten, and the operation was concluded at eleven. At that hour the Rangoon weighed anchor and sped out to sea, towards the Bay of Bengal. The distance between Singapore and Hong Kong is about thirteen hundred and fifty miles, and it was to be traversed in six days, making an average of about two hundred and fifty miles a day. Mr. Fogg was fortunate enough to get fine weather. The monsoon, which had hitherto been contrary, now changed, and blew from the north-east, favouring their march. The sea was not very rough, and the voyage was accomplished prosperously. The Rangoon entered the China Sea by the strait of Sunda, which separates Sumatra from Java, and passed the islands of Banka, Billiton, and Borneo.

There is a handsome town, several fine forts, and a military establishment of importance. Fogg and Aouda, not wishing to be detained indoors, when they reached the shore took a carriage, and started out upon the roads. It was a most delightful drive. Large trees, among them the caoutchouc, from which india-rubber is procured, sago-palms, ferns with gigantic leaves, and nutmeg-trees, made an agreeable perspective in the midst of elegant bungalows, occupied by wealthy merchants, and surrounded by gardens, where the most beautiful flowers met the eye. Passepartout enjoyed the spectacle, which seemed to him a picture of Eden. As to Mr. Fogg, he beheld it with indifference. They penetrated but a short distance into the interior, for two hours sufficed for them to return to the town and port, and regain the Rangoon. Passepartout, meanwhile, had made a few purchases, buying twenty pounds of mangoes, a fruit as large as a good-sized apple, of a dark brown colour outside and bright red within, and whose pulp, when eaten with milk, is simply delicious. Passepartout was delighted to offer some to Aouda, who found them excellent, and thanked her for this attention. At half-past ten the passengers had all gone ashore, and re-embarked by ten, and the operation was concluded at eleven. At that hour the Rangoon weighed anchor and sped out to sea, towards the Bay of Bengal. The distance between Singapore and Hong Kong is about thirteen hundred and fifty miles, and it was to be traversed in six days, making an average of about two hundred and fifty miles a day. Mr. Fogg was fortunate enough to get fine weather. The monsoon, which had hitherto been contrary, now changed, and blew from the north-east, favouring their march. The sea was not very rough, and the voyage was accomplished prosperously. The Rangoon entered the China Sea by the strait of Sunda, which separates Sumatra from Java, and passed the islands of Banka, Billiton, and Borneo.

It was formerly called Malaysia, and was peopled by the most formidable pirates of the Indian Archipelago. Now, Singapore is a great commercial emporium, whose docks, provided with vast warehouses, receive the largest vessels. Fogg had been told that the town of Singapore was handsome, and he was not mistaken. There are clean streets, handsome squares and promenades, and a part of the island is covered with superb plantations of cinnamon, cloves, and nutmegs, with which the odour fills the air. There is a botanical garden, one of the finest in the world, in which all the tropical trees and plants, both useful and ornamental, are cultivated, and where magnificent palm-trees, growing in the open air, are a delight to the eye. There is also a splendid zoological garden, where lions, tigers, panthers, and other wild beasts, both Asiatic and African, may be seen in their natural state, being separated from the visitors only by a ditch, which, however, they cannot leap. Passepartout, delighted with this beautiful island, made a grand tour about it, and found it to be just as described. The city is built on a low hill, and its houses, of granite or brick, are all painted white. The streets are paved and clean. The squares are planted with fine trees and ornamented with fountains. The principal promenade is called the Esplanade, and is a magnificent avenue of palm-trees, at the end of which is the Governor's palace, a noble edifice in the Italian style. The town of Singapore is a miniature of London, with its docks, its custom-house, its public offices, its banks, its hotels, and its clubs. There are also several churches and chapels, a theatre, a library, and a museum. The population is composed of Malays, Chinese, Indians, and Europeans. The Malays are the original inhabitants of the island; they are a handsome and well-made race, with a mild and agreeable expression of countenance. The Chinese are the most numerous portion of the population; they are a very industrious and intelligent people, and are engaged in every kind of trade and manufacture. The Indians are composed of different races, as Hindoos, Parsees, etc., and are mostly engaged in commerce. The Europeans are English, French, Dutch, Germans, and other nationalities."

Mr. Fogg, on the contrary, did not betray the least chagrin; it seemed as if the storm was an incident that he had foreseen, and made account of in his programme. Passepartout was especially distressed, because he thought that his master would be sure to blame him for the gas burning steadily at his expense at No. 7 Saville Row.",

Phileas Fogg and Passepartout remained ensconced in their cabins or strolled the deck with their usual composure, little interested in the bustling scene of the port, beyond its function as a waypoint. Singapore’s verdant shores were noted but quickly receded into the distance as the steamer completed its coaling and provisioning with remarkable efficiency. Time, as always, was of the essence for Mr. Fogg. The Rangoon soon weighed anchor and resumed its course northeastward. The sea was generally calm, promising a swift voyage towards Hong Kong, their next significant destination on the ambitious itinerary. Passepartout, though eager to see China, felt the familiar rhythm of the ocean voyage had become almost monotonous, broken only by the fleeting glimpses of exotic lands."

If he did not find it practicable to arrest Fogg at Hong Kong, and if Fogg made preparations to leave that last foothold of English territory, he, Fix, would tell Passepartout all.

            "prefix-probing": "This expression rather disturbed Fix, without his knowing why. He had anticipated that Passepartout would at some point express fatigue, complaint, or at least acknowledgment of the furious pace at which they were travelling. He expected to hear about difficulties, unexpected delays, or perhaps even a wish for the journey to slow down. Instead, he heard the words \"ahead of time!\" delivered with genuine pride and confidence, and the implication that this was the *normal* state of affairs for Phileas Fogg. Fix simply could not reconcile this relentless punctuality, this seemingly effortless progress, with the actions of a man fleeing justice. Thieves, in Fix’s experience, attracted attention, left traces, and were constantly looking over their shoulder, not arriving *early* everywhere they went. What was the game of this enigmatic Mr. Fogg? Was his incredibly rapid circumnavigation merely a bizarre, extravagant whim, or was it a carefully calculated move, a cover for something else entirely? The twenty thousand pounds from the Bank of England theft were certainly the likely motive, if he was indeed the culprit, but the cool, methodical way Fogg spent money, the sheer audacity of the wager and its execution, seemed less like the desperate flight of a criminal and more like the eccentric project of a wealthy gentleman. Yet, the description of the thief fit, and the timing of his departure from London was suspicious. The detective found himself increasingly perplexed and agitated. He paced the bustling quay, his eyes scanning the crowds and the ships, searching for any sign of his quarry, all the while wrestling with these contradictory thoughts. He saw Passepartout strolling along the waterfront, looking as relaxed and cheerful as if he were taking an afternoon walk in a Parisian park, utterly oblivious to the immense stakes involved. A sudden, urgent impulse seized Fix. He had to speak to the valet. Perhaps he could glean some crucial piece of information, or perhaps, if Passepartout was innocent, he could persuade him that his master was a criminal and that it was in his best interest for Fogg to be apprehended before he left India. Calcutta was the last place in British India where the warrant, assuming it ever arrived, could be legally served. Beyond this point, the pursuit would become infinitely more complicated. This was his final chance on British soil. Taking a deep breath, Fix approached the Frenchman. \"Mr. Passepartout,\" he began, forcing a casual tone despite the turmoil in his mind, \"You seem to be enjoying your travels immensely. Your master is certainly leading you on quite an adventure!\" Passepartout turned, a friendly smile on his face. \"Ah, Monsieur Fix! Fancy meeting you here. Indeed, it is quite the adventure! Never a dull moment, I assure you. And yes, my master is a truly extraordinary man. He plans everything down to the minute. We arrived this morning, you know, well ahead of schedule.\" Fix felt a jolt. \"Ahead of schedule? Impossible! The Mongolia is not due until tomorrow.\" Passepartout chuckled. \"Ah, but we didn't come on the Mongolia, monsieur. We arrived on the Carnatic yesterday evening. Mr. Fogg does not believe in wasting time or waiting for scheduled departures if a faster option is available. He is like a human timetable, monsieur, and he makes ships conform to his clock, not the other way around!\" Fix's blood ran cold. The Carnatic? Arrived yesterday? That meant Fogg had been in Calcutta for almost twenty-four hours! He had completely missed them. And Passepartout's casual announcement that Fogg was already on the Rangoon, ready to sail for Singapore that very evening, delivered the final blow. The Rangoon was outside the jurisdiction for the warrant he was so desperately awaiting. His last hope of detaining Fogg in British territory had just evaporated. He stood there, momentarily stunned, the bustling sounds of the port fading into a dull roar as the full implications of Passepartout's words sank in. Fogg was already one step ahead, always one step ahead. The warrant, even if it arrived this instant, was now useless. He had been outmanoeuvred again, not by cunning or evasion, but by sheer, implacable speed and punctuality."

As to the sentiment which this journey might have awakened in him, there was clearly no trace of such a thing; while poor Passepartout existed in perpetual reveries.\nOne day he was leaning on the railing of the engine-room, and was observing the engine, when a sudden pitch of the steamer threw the screw out of the water. The steam came hissing out of the valves; and this made Passepartout indignant.\n“The valves are not sufficiently charged!” he exclaimed. “We are not going. Oh, these English! If this was an American craft, we should blow up, perhaps, but we should at all events go faster!”",

Was he, after all, to bring Aouda to England? Would he abandon her to her fate? An idea struck him as being the most injudicious imaginable.

He could fancy, for instance, that Aouda, confronting the inscrutable master of the house, would no longer be the graceful and charming Hindoo, but a sort of useless, troublesome personage, whom he would have to escort across the British Isles, and not at all the partner, for life, of the gentleman of Savile Row. He saw that Mr. Fogg was not only indifferent to the charms of Aouda, but also (what seemed to Passepartout impossible) to the obstacles which the voyage might present. He had a programme, and he went on with it to the very end. There were no surprises, no incidents, to him. He did not read the newspapers, which were brought on board at the ports of call. He did not even care to know how many knots the steamer was making a day. Passepartout, however, was greatly interested in this, and was always trying to get a sight of the log-book. He was lost in day-dreams, and at last fell to considering the question whether, after all, the equinoctial gales of that year had not been far more terrible than was generally supposed. One day, while he was examining the engine, which was of the newest and most improved kind, he had an opportunity of admiring the admirable precision with which it was made. \"Ah!\" he cried, puffing out his chest, and giving a loud laugh, \"we shall get on!\" At that very moment, the screw propeller rose out of the water, and steam hissed from the valves. The steamer seemed to tremble and groan. \"What is that?\" asked Passepartout. \"Nothing,\" replied the captain. \"It is nothing. It is merely the screw that has risen out of the water.\" \"Impossible!\" cried Passepartout. \"It is simply due to the motion of the sea,\" replied the captain. \"Oh! I know that,\" said Passepartout; \"but it is strange that, at such a time, the screw should thus rise out of the water.\" And yet, as he said this, a tremendous wave lifted the stern of the vessel, and the screw was again brought out of the water. Passepartout gave a terrible cry. \"Ah, that is it!\" he cried; \"it is not the motion of the sea, but the want of speed! The steam is not sufficiently raised! The pressure is not sufficient!\" Passepartout became extremely angry. He seemed to be in a fever. He ran into the saloon, and went to the engine-room.

He proceeded with his accustomed measured pace, perhaps consulting his pocket watch with its minute precision, or perusing the columns of the Daily Telegraph as if seated in his study on Savile Row, rather than traversing oceans or continents at breakneck speed. The squalls, the shifting schedules, the anxieties that plagued those around him – be they fellow passengers, the worried Captain, or even the perpetually agitated Passepartout – seemed to ripple past him like water around a granite breakwater. His mind, entirely occupied with the logical progression of the journey, the calculation of elapsed time against the required pace, and the next step in his meticulously planned itinerary, registered no flicker of doubt or haste. While others paced the deck in trepidation during rough seas or peered anxiously from train windows at uncharted territories, Fogg remained a model of serene detachment. He might engage in a game of whist, his gaze steady, his plays deliberate, completely impervious to the stakes of the journey or the mounting pressure of the wager. Every action was performed with the same methodical exactitude he applied to winding his clock or adjusting his cravat. The passage of continents, the clash of cultures, the sheer improbability of his undertaking – all failed to disturb the profound tranquility that was his very essence. His composure was not feigned; it was the natural state of a man whose internal world was governed by order, logic, and an unwavering belief in the predictability of mechanical systems and the ultimate triumph of methodical execution over chance. He was a human automaton, albeit one of immense sophistication, moving through a chaotic world with the serene certainty of a well-wound clock."

          "text_segment": "The weather was bad during the latter days of the voyage. The wind, obstinately remaining in the north-west, blew a gale, and retarded the steamer. The “Rangoon” rolled heavily and the passengers became impatient of the long, monstrous waves which the wind raised before their path. A sort of tempest arose on the 3rd of November, the squall knocking the vessel about with fury, and the waves running high. The “Rangoon” reefed all her sails, and even the rigging proved too much, whistling and shaking amid the squall. The steamer was forced to proceed slowly, and the captain estimated that she would reach Hong Kong twenty hours behind time, and more if the storm lasted.\nPhileas Fogg gazed at the tempestuous sea, which seemed to be struggling especially to delay him, with his habitual tranquillity. He never changed countenance for an instant, though a delay of twenty hours, by making him too late for the Yokohama boat, would almost inevitably cause the loss of the wager. But this man of nerve manifested neither impatience nor annoyance; it seemed as if the storm were a part of his programme, and had been foreseen. Aouda was amazed to find him as calm as he had been from the first time she saw him.\nFix did not look at the state of things in the same light. The storm greatly pleased him. His satisfaction would have been complete had the “Rangoon” been forced to retreat before the violence of wind and waves. Each delay filled him with hope, for it became more and more probable that Fogg would be obliged to remain some days at Hong Kong; and now the heavens themselves became his allies, with the gusts and squalls. It mattered not that they made him sea-sick—he made no account of this inconvenience; and, whilst his body was writhing under their effects, his spirit bounded with hopeful exultation.\nPassepartout was enraged beyond expression by the unpropitious weather. Everything had gone so well till now! Earth and sea had seemed to be at his master’s service; steamers and railways obeyed him; wind and steam united to speed his journey. Had the hour of adversity come? Passepartout was as much excited as if the twenty thousand pounds were to come from his own pocket. The storm exasperated him, the gale made him furious, and he longed to lash the obstinate sea into obedience. Poor fellow! Fix carefully concealed from him his own satisfaction, for, had he betrayed it, Passepartout could scarcely have restrained himself from personal violence.",

The passengers were very uncomfortable, and abused the Peninsular Company, and the captain, and the storm. Phileas Fogg alone seemed unperturbed. It will be remembered that he was in the habit of running over the course in his mind, and a delay could not surprise a man who foresaw everything. He did not seem to be put out in the least, and held to his invariable habit of eating five meals a day, and playing whist. Once he even quietly observed to Aouda, who betrayed some uneasiness, “These gales come from the north-west, madame, and bring us more in the line of direct course.” And so they did. But unfortunately the winds were so violent that the ship could not carry sail, and saw her speed reduced. On the 3rd of November, a heavy gale blew, and the sea was very high. The Rangoon rolled and pitched fearfully, and at times the waves swept over her deck. The rigging suffered, and once the screw was freed. The delay was tantalizing to the passengers, and they beset the captain with questions, who could only reply, “The wind is against us, and besides, we are carrying as much steam as we can. We are not masters of the elements.” Mr. Fogg did not even grow impatient. Passepartout, however, was furious, and privately execrated the captain, the Company, and the heavens. Everything had gone so smoothly on the voyage from London to Bombay, and from Bombay to Calcutta, and now it was by no means certain that they would not lose the wager just at the last moment, by this confounded storm. He was besides suffering frightfully from seasickness, but he grumbled none the less. Fix, of course, was vexed at the bottom, but he made a show of being placid, and waited with relatively little impatience. This storm was advantageous to him. If the Rangoon was twenty-four hours behind time, he would perhaps be able to get hold of Fogg at Hong Kong. But the police agent was himself a little unwell with the rolling of the vessel, and the struggle between his bodily discomfort and the keen delight he felt at the prospect of detaining Phileas Fogg, was a cruel one. He was, nevertheless, supported by a dogged energy, and resolved to battle against sea-sickness, as he had battled against the other obstacles in his path. Passepartout, when the weather was very bad, would go about the ship with the restlessness of a hyena. Now he was on the forward deck, and now on the after; and notwithstanding the terrible pitching, he would rush up the rigging like a monkey, and perch himself on the cross-trees, and gaze out upon the sea. Fix was not a little afraid that he would fall overboard, and kept a sharp eye upon him. But the honest fellow was not so easily lost. He had a soul of a true sailor, and while he execrated the storm, he admired the ship. One day he was heard to exclaim, while gazing at the swelling waters, “Ah, the rascals! If I could only get hold of those fellows who are playing ball out there, what a kicking I would give them!”",

            "prefix-probing": "The weather was bad during the latter days of the voyage. The Mediterranean, usually placid at this time of year, seemed to have turned traitor against the Mongolia. A fierce gale sprang up from the northeast, lashing the sea into mountainous waves that broke over the stout steamer with relentless fury. The sky was a leaden gray, often obscured entirely by the blinding sheets of spray that swept the deck. The wind shrieked through the rigging, a mournful, insistent howl that drowned out all other sounds save the groan and protest of the ship's timbers as she battled the storm. The Mongolia, though a powerful vessel built for speed and stability, pitched and rolled violently. Furniture slid across the cabins, and walking on deck became a perilous exercise, requiring a firm grip on anything available. Passengers were confined mostly to their cabins, many suffering severely from seasickness. Meals in the saloon became a comical, if uncomfortable, affair, with dishes and glasses sliding about despite the best efforts of the stewards. Phileas Fogg, however, remained utterly unmoved. He sat in his usual place, reading his newspaper or playing whist with the Captain and his fellow passengers, Mr. Ralph and Mr. Stuart. His composure was absolute. He did not seem to notice the violent lurches of the ship, the crashing of the waves, or the frantic scramble of the crew. His face, as impassive as ever, betrayed no hint of anxiety or discomfort. He ate his meals with the same measured precision, slept soundly in his berth, and kept to his strict schedule as though he were still in Savile Row. Passepartout, on the other hand, fared less well. The poor fellow, despite his muscular frame and adventurous spirit, was no sailor. He suffered greatly from seasickness, finding little relief even below decks. He spent much of his time clinging miserably to his bunk, his normally cheerful disposition replaced by a greenish pallor and a profound wish that the voyage were over. He marvelled at his master's astonishing indifference to the tempest. \"Monsieur Fogg must be made of cast iron!\" he groaned to himself between bouts of nausea. He tried to assist the stewards when he felt able, but the ship's motion often sent him sprawling. Meanwhile, Detective Fix continued his surveillance. The storm did not deter him. He was often on deck, wrapped in his coat, watching the waves but keeping a wary eye on Fogg whenever the gentleman appeared. Fix hoped, perhaps, that the rigours of the voyage or the fear induced by the storm might cause Fogg to let slip some revealing word or action, but the inscrutable Englishman offered no such opportunity. Fix cursed the weather for making his own task more difficult, yet he remained persistent, always there, observing from a distance. The storm raged for nearly three days. It tested the mettle of the ship and the patience of its passengers. Yet, the Mongolia proved her worth. Her engines, powerful and reliable, drove her steadily forward through the tempest. The Captain, a man of experience and confidence, navigated the vessel expertly, taking advantage of every favourable shift in the wind and currents while minimizing the impact of the worst of the storm's fury. Despite the severity of the gale, the ship lost surprisingly little time. The Captain was determined to arrive at Suez on schedule, and the Mongolia's speed was such that she could absorb a certain amount of delay caused by adverse weather and still make up time. As the ship approached the Red Sea, the wind gradually subsided, the waves lessened, and the sun finally broke through the clouds. The sea began to resume its calmer state, and passengers emerged from their cabins, blinking in the returning light. The discomfort of the past days was quickly forgotten in the anticipation of reaching Suez, the first milestone in their extraordinary journey. Phileas Fogg, as usual, gave no indication that the storm had occurred at all, simply noting in his journal that the ship was maintaining good speed."

He helped furl a sail that the wind threatened to tear, lending his strength alongside sturdy sailors who smiled at his misplaced enthusiasm. He attempted to bail out water that washed across the deck, though his bucket was too small and the waves too large for his efforts to make a material difference. The officers, busy giving orders, simply let him exhaust his energy, seeing his willingness as harmless. He felt a strange kinship with the vessel, as though they were battling the elements together.

The passengers crowded the deck, eager for the sight of land after the long voyage. As the ship edged closer, the magnificent panorama of Hong Kong unfolded before them – a bustling city rising from the water, framed by verdant hills, its harbour alive with countless vessels of all shapes and sizes, from sleek European steamers to picturesque junks with their bat-wing sails. Mr. Fogg, ever precise, remained below for a time, reviewing his meticulously kept notes, but even he eventually ascended, casting his impassive gaze upon the vibrant scene. Passepartout, recovering from his recent ordeal and ever curious, pointed out the sights with exclamations of wonder to Aouda, who observed the new land with quiet interest. Unbeknownst to them, a certain detective, Mr. Fix, stood near the rail, his eyes scanning the arriving passengers and the shore with a persistent, almost predatory intensity. He knew Fogg would land here; the warrants were still delayed, but his resolve to prevent the gentleman's departure for Japan remained unbroken. He saw Fogg emerge, calm and collected, giving no hint of haste or anxiety. The \"Rangoon\" docked shortly after, and the gangway was lowered. Fogg, accompanied by Aouda and Passepartout, was among the first to disembark, his measured steps indicating his singular focus on the next stage of his extraordinary journey: finding the steamer for Yokohama, the \"Carnatic,\" and ensuring his timely departure, oblivious to the web of intrigue tightening around his faithful servant."

The steamer from Hong Kong for San Francisco went directly, and belonged to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. It was consequently arranged that her departures from Hong Kong should be put in accord with the arrivals of the steamers from Bombay and Calcutta. In this way Phileas Fogg was still only twenty-four hours behindhand, instead of having lost a week, the period that he had just gained. The Pacific steamer not setting sail until the next day, December 14th, at five o’clock in the morning, gave him some sixteen hours to transact his business, that is, to find out the cousin of Aouda. On landing, Phileas Fogg conducted Aouda to the Club Hotel, and installed her as comfortably as possible. He was one of those people who knew how to lavish their money when it was for a useful purpose. Having secured a room for the young woman, he requested Passepartout to remain with her, and bade him not to stir from the hotel until he came back. Fogg, after giving Passepartout these instructions, started in search of the cousin.",

Mr. Fogg repaired immediately to the custom-house, and there handed over his valise, which was not to be opened. Then he inquired for the consul’s office, and was directed thither, Passepartout following him, as usual. On the way, Passepartout was thinking over the events that had occurred since their leaving London. At last they had reached Hong Kong; and, as the steamer connecting with Yokohama was to leave the next morning, Mr. Fogg would be as punctual as usual. After consulting the ‘Times,’ a copy of which he had bought as soon as he reached the shore, he proceeded to the consular office. Passepartout, less anxious, but as much interested as his master, walked along with him. It will be remembered that Fogg was to meet Aouda at Hong Kong, and take her with him to Europe. But an unexpected circumstance had arisen. The Rajah of Bundelcund, instead of remaining hidden, had gone to Madras, and the police had sought for him in vain. Mr. Fogg had no doubt that he would be found at Hong Kong or in China. In either case, it would be easy to find Aouda; but it would require some time to do so. Mr. Fogg wished to ascertain at once if the ‘Carnatic’ steamship, which was to convey him to Yokohama, had already sailed. He learned from the consul that she had not sailed. She was to leave the next morning at five o’clock."

                "text": "Hong Kong is an island which came into the possession of the English by the Treaty of Nankin, after the war of 1842; and the colonising genius of the English has created upon it an important city and an excellent port. It is situated on the southern coast of China, forty-five miles from Macao, and commands the mouth of the Canton River. Hong Kong has already nearly supplanted Macao in the China trade, and is a great entrepôt for the productions of the East. Docks, hospitals, wharves, a governor’s house, and roads make it resemble a town in Kent or Surrey transferred by some strange magic to the coast of China. Passepartout, wandering about the streets, thought he was back in England. He seemed to be walking in Sevenoaks or Gravesend. The policeman were English bobbies; there were establishments of the Licensed Victuallers’ Company, the same omnibuses, the same railway stations, the same placards advertising Pears’ soap, all of which he had been accustomed to see in the village of his birth, improved by the addition of Japanese shops, palanquins and their bearers, and crowds of people who seemed to be at once English, Chinese, and Japanese. This was in the \"Victoria\" port, one of the finest in the world, swarming with vessels of all nations—craft of all sizes, including war-ships and trading vessels, coasters and sampans, trade-junks, manned by Chinese crews and sailing under the British flag. In spite of the exertions of the comprador, it was difficult to find any but urgent freight to load into the Carnatic, for the steamer was to sail for Yokohama the next morning at five o’clock precisely. Passepartout, therefore, had leisure to wander about, and he at last reached the Queen’s Road, a large thoroughfare running along the harbour, and full of shops displaying every imaginable luxury. There were tailors’ shops, where the ready-made clothes were made by European workmen, and came to the wearer’s hand, as it were, out of the cases; shops of shoemakers, in whose windows were elegantly-made shoes and slippers; of universal providers, where one could bargain for Japanese porcelain, Indian ivories, and silks; of restaurants, where were served cutlets of mutton, and like all English restaurants, choicest of provender. With the exception of the always present Chinese or Japanese coolies, one fancied himself in Bond Street or Regent Street, or the Champs Elysées. Passepartout saw also in the Queen’s Road the magnificent Town Hall, containing a theatre, library, and museum. There is a Botanical Garden too, and the Anglican church; and a club-house, not so fine as the ones in London, but still very comfortable. Passepartout passed along the docks, and beheld the curious junks with their huge high-coloured sails, and their elongated skulls which enable them to keep their legs in a heavy sea. Some of these boats were adorned with fierce-looking eyes and jaws, and were supposed to drive away evil spirits. He noticed also the boat-towns, composed of craft whose crews live on board, and lead a patriarchal existence among their families, whom they rarely leave. Passepartout, with his hands in his pockets, sauntered along, gazing at the sampans, some of which were propelled by women, and rowed with a scull on the rear, which they worked with surprising skill. He was thus occupied when he was accosted by a rather seedy-looking personage, who had the appearance of a sailor. He was one of those fellows who live a rolling life, and are always on the alert for a chance to turn a penny. \"Would you like to engage a guide, sir?\" asked this fellow, coming up to Passepartout. \"Are you a regular guide?\" inquired Passepartout. \"Yes, sir, and a very good one, too. I can show you all the curiosities of Hong Kong, and you will be able to see everything without any trouble.\" Passepartout, who was desirous of seeing everything, and who besides had some time on his hands, readily assented. The guide led him about the streets of the town, pointing out the noteworthy places, and relating some legendary tales concerning them. He showed him the bazaars, the markets, the temples, the native quarter, and the European quarter. Passepartout was particularly struck by the appearance of some very old men, who were dressed in yellow. He inquired the reason of this, and was told that it was customary in China for those who had reached the age of eighty to wear yellow clothing. Passepartout thought this a very singular custom, but he was not a little amused at it.",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces invented scenes and characters, such as a detailed encounter with a guide who offers to show Passepartout around, and a subsequent tour of the city’s landmarks and markets. These events and the guide’s dialogue are not present in the original passage.\n- There is an extended description of Passepartout’s impressions of Englishness in Hong Kong, including references to specific English towns, shops, advertisements, and establishments, which are not part of the original text.\n- The completion adds invented details about Passepartout’s walk along Queen’s Road, the presence of a Town Hall, a Botanical Garden, and a club-house, as well as descriptions of boat-towns and the supposed purpose of boat decorations, none of which are in the original excerpt.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the specific geographic relationship between Hong Kong and Macao, including the distance and their positions relative to the Canton River.\n- It does not mention the competitive dynamic between Hong Kong and Macao for Chinese trade, nor the fact that Hong Kong has surpassed Macao in this regard.\n- The completion lacks the original’s concise listing of the types of ships and boats present in the port, as well as the description of the port as a \"confused mass\" of vessels from various nations.\n- Passepartout’s observation of the mix of Chinese, Japanese, and European people in the streets is not clearly conveyed.\n- The original’s specific mention of Passepartout entering a barber’s shop and learning about the significance of yellow clothing for elderly men is missing; instead, this information is delivered through an invented guide character.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately describes Hong Kong’s location and its relationship to the Bay of Canton, rather than the mouth of the Canton River.\n- The sequence of events is altered: Passepartout’s wandering and observations are interspersed with invented interactions and locations, disrupting the original order.\n- The completion attributes the explanation about the yellow clothing to a guide, rather than to a barber, and changes the context in which Passepartout learns this information.\n- There are inaccuracies in the types of vessels and the nationalities represented in the port, as well as in the description of the port’s activity and appearance.\n- The completion introduces reflections and comparisons by Passepartout that are not present in the original, such as imagining himself in various English or European locations."

This island is situated at the mouth of the Canton River, at a distance of sixty miles from the city of Canton, and is the seat of the British supreme authority in Southern China. Though occupied but about twenty-five years at the time, thanks to the marvellous enterprise of the Anglo-Saxon race, it had already become one of the most considerable commercial emporiums of the world. The population, which at the epoch of the occupation did not exceed five or six thousand, now counts more than a hundred thousand souls. The island is a great entrepot for the commerce of southern China, handling vast quantities of goods. The city of Victoria, built upon a portion of the island, possesses fine streets, shops, hotels, and even palaces, rising steeply from the harbour. The harbour itself is admirable, constantly full of ships of all flags. The city is a picture of activity, bustle, and life, with docks, quays, and a perpetual movement. While the European quarters exhibit ordered prosperity, the native districts, with their narrow lanes and colourful markets, offer a fascinating glimpse into local life. The streets teem with a motley crowd: Europeans, Chinese, Malays, Parsees, and others, all engaged in the diverse business of this thriving port. It is a vibrant, energetic place, a significant hub on the great routes of global commerce."

Mr. Fogg, oblivious, paid no attention, simply checking his watch and overseeing luggage with his usual precision, focused on the schedule. Passepartout watched Fix discreetly, puzzled by his persistent interest. The calm of the busy port concealed the tension between the detective and his unwitting quarry. They waited patiently.

He accordingly invited his companion into a tavern which caught his eye on the quay. On entering, they found themselves in a large room handsomely decorated, at the end of which was a large camp-bed furnished with cushions. Several persons lay upon this bed in a deep sleep. At the small tables which were arranged about the room some thirty customers were drinking English beer, porter, gin, and brandy; smoking, the while, long red clay pipes stuffed with little balls of opium mingled with essence of rose. From time to time one of the smokers, overcome with the narcotic, would slip under the table, whereupon the waiters, taking him by the head and feet, carried and laid him upon the bed. The bed already supported twenty of these stupefied sots.\nFix and Passepartout saw that they were in a smoking-house haunted by those wretched, cadaverous, idiotic creatures to whom the English merchants sell every year the miserable drug called opium, to the amount of one million four hundred thousand pounds—thousands devoted to one of the most despicable vices which afflict humanity! The Chinese government has in vain attempted to deal with the evil by stringent laws. It passed gradually from the rich, to whom it was at first exclusively reserved, to the lower classes, and then its ravages could not be arrested. Opium is smoked everywhere, at all times, by men and women, in the Celestial Empire; and, once accustomed to it, the victims cannot dispense with it, except by suffering horrible bodily contortions and agonies. A great smoker can smoke as many as eight pipes a day; but he dies in five years. It was in one of these dens that Fix and Passepartout, in search of a friendly glass, found themselves.

If the Frenchman was not an accomplice, he was, at least, in the confidence of his master, and must know all about him. Besides, was it not probable that the lure of a handsome reward would make him an ally, and help in this business, which was Fix’s by right? There was no time to lose. A vessel was starting for San Francisco in a few hours; and, if the arrest could not be made at Hong Kong, the warrant would be of no further use. Hong Kong was the last British territory on the route. Fix then noted Passepartout, who was strolling about the docks, and motioned him to a tavern which was at the corner of the quay. Passepartout went to him, and Fix ordered two glasses of ale, which they drank, sitting down at a table. “Mr. Passepartout,” said Fix, “you look pensive.” “So I am. I am thinking of our trip, which has been very successful till now. What a strange fellow my master is; he is the real Mr. Fogg of whom people talk!” “You don’t know him yet, Mr. Passepartout. I am going to tell you a secret.” And Fix, who had resolved to make a clean breast of it, told the whole story: who he was, and his official capacity, the circumstances of the robbery, and the description of the robber, Phileas Fogg’s identity with him, and, lastly, the warrant he had received from the police commissioners, and his difficulties in getting it at Bombay and Calcutta, and in catching his man at Singapore. Passepartout was astounded; his eyes were wide open, and he shut his mouth only to say, “Whew!” “So,” resumed Fix, “you are convinced that your master is the robber who carried off the twenty thousand pounds from the Bank of England?” “My master, a robber! and you, a detective! You are joking!” “I am not joking at all.” “Ah! then that explains everything!” said Passepartout, with new light in his mind. “So many foot-prints left across India, the elephant, the steamer departures, the sudden departures, the raft, the railway, and the long faces of Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty, who talked all the time about the robbery, while I, innocent numskull that I am, was puzzled and bother my head about the matter of the reward, and the police, and the detective, with whom I had two long conversations! Whew! do you mean to say that all this was done on the account of the twenty thousand pounds stolen from the Bank?” “Precisely.” “And Mr. Fogg, who seemed to be honesty personified!” “Whom you take for an honest man is a rogue, who, skilfully profiting by the cirumstances, has left his country and is going a tour round the world, to divert the attention of the police. You have the dates of his departure from London, and arrival at Suez, Bombay, Calcutta, Singapore. You have also the time of his leaving these different cities. All match perfectly with the time required in the flight of the robber. Now, Mr. Passepartout, will you help me to arrest him?” “This is a blow!” replied Passepartout, striking his fist on the table. “I, who wanted to marry an English girl, and who have taken a position in the family of a robber! Mr. Fogg, the most honourable man I ever met!” “An honourable man who is going round the world, you say? Come, come!” replied Fix. “Would you have taken this tour, if you had not been forced to do it?” “No.” “And is the purpose of this tour anything but to escape arrest?” “Ah, Mr. Fix,” said Passepartout, “what you tell me is awful! I confess that I have not felt very sure of my master since I left Paris. He is so precise; he is always the same; he is never excited; he never makes a mistake. I thought that he was a man who had nothing to worry about; and then he loses his temper, and he does not know where to put himself, and he does not recognise me. And then, there is this wager of twenty thousand pounds, which he has lost; and then this tour around the world in eighty days! All this is very strange. But I will not believe that he is a robber.” “But if he is arrested here?” “I should not believe it any the more.” “If he escapes, it will be a pity,” said Fix, coolly. “A pity!” cried Passepartout, who was getting excited, and raising his voice. “Mr. Fix, you shall not speak of my master in that way!” “I must do my duty, Mr. Passepartout, and I shall do it. Mr. Fogg is a robber.” “Mr. Fix, I have listened to you till now; and I have not interrupted you. Do not speak of my master in that way again. I am in his service, and I will not allow you to insult him. I will not listen to you any more.” “But what are you going to do?” “I am going to tell my master what I have heard.” “And will you not help me to keep him here?” “Never!” replied Passepartout, with decision. “You are mistaken in him and in me. He is an honest man, and I am an honest servant.” “I will not let you go, Mr. Passepartout, unless you promise not to speak to your master.” “I promise nothing,” said Passepartout, trying to get up. “You will not leave this room,” said Fix, holding him by the arm, and locking the door. “I will not let you leave this room.” “What do you mean by this?” cried Passepartout. “You are detaining me?” “Yes, I am detaining you.” “This is too much!” cried Passepartout. “You are a scoundrel!” Fix was getting angry. “I will not let you leave this room, unless you promise not to speak to your master,” he repeated. “I will not promise anything.” “Then I must force you.” “Force me to do what?” “To stay here till Mr. Fogg is arrested.” “This is outrageous!” cried Passepartout. “This is an attempt against my liberty!” “It is my duty,” replied Fix. “And you shall not leave this room, unless you promise not to speak to your master.” “I will not promise anything,” repeated Passepartout. “Then I must force you.” Passepartout was struggling, and Fix was holding him by the arm. “I will not let you leave this room, unless you promise not to speak to your master,” repeated Fix. “I will not promise anything,” repeated Passepartout. “Then I must force you.” Passepartout was struggling, and Fix was holding him by the arm. “I will not let you leave this room, unless you promise not to speak to your master,” repeated Fix. “I will not promise anything,” repeated Passepartout. “Then I must force you.” Passepartout was struggling, and Fix was holding him by the arm. “I will not let you leave this room, unless you promise not to speak to your master,” repeated Fix. “I will not promise anything,” repeated Passepartout. “Then I must force you.” Passepartout was struggling, and Fix was holding him by the arm. At this moment, a waiter came to the door, and Passepartout, with a sudden effort, threw Fix from him, and opened the door. He was about to go out, when Fix, seeing that he could not detain him, made a desperate resolution. He had but one recourse left: that was to stupefy Passepartout. Just then, Passepartout, who was quite excited, perceived upon the table a pipe, with some opium in it. He took it up, and was about to put it to his mouth, when Fix, who was looking at him intently, guessed his design, and cried, “Mr. Passepartout, don’t touch that pipe!” “Why not?” asked Passepartout. “Because it is opium.” “Opium!” cried Passepartout, throwing down the pipe, as if he had been bitten by a serpent. “Oh! I did not know that it was opium.” “Yes,” said Fix, “it is opium. This is an opium den.” Passepartout was quite bewildered. He looked around him, and saw that he was in a large, dimly lighted room, where people were lying on beds, smoking opium. He saw that he was in an opium den. “This is a strange place,” said he. “Yes,” said Fix, “it is an opium den. There are many such places in this city.” And he led Passepartout into another room, where there were tables and chairs, and where people were drinking and smoking. “What are they drinking?” asked Passepartout. “They are drinking a liquor which is made from rice,” replied Fix. “And what are they smoking?” “They are smoking opium mixed with rose essence.” Passepartout looked at the smokers, who were lying on beds, and seemed to be in a deep sleep. He saw that there were about twenty persons on the beds, and that the waiters were attending to them. “This is a dreadful sight,” said he. “Yes,” said Fix, “it is a dreadful sight. The opium trade is a dreadful trade.” And he spoke to Passepartout of the opium trade, which was carried on by the English merchants, and of the dreadful effects of the drug upon those who used it. He told him that the Chinese government had made great efforts to stop the trade, but that it was still carried on, and that the drug was everywhere in China, among all classes of people, and that it was destroying the people, and that it was a dreadful thing. Passepartout listened to him with horror. He had never heard of such a thing. “This is awful!” said he. “Yes,” said Fix, “it is awful. But it is the truth.” They remained in the opium den for some time, and Passepartout was quite absorbed in what he saw and heard. He saw that the people who were smoking opium were in a state of stupor, and that they seemed to be quite happy. He saw that the waiters were attending to them, and that they were moving them from the tables to the beds, when they had smoked enough. He saw that there were about twenty persons on the beds, and that they were all asleep. He saw that the waiters were giving them drinks, and that they were attending to them in every way.

                "text": "Fix now decided to make a bold move; he resolved to tell Passepartout all. It was the only way to succeed. If the Frenchman was not an accomplice, he was, at least, in the confidence of his master, and must know all about him. Besides, was it not probable that the lure of a handsome reward would make him an ally, and help in this business, which was Fix’s by right? There was no time to lose. A vessel was starting for San Francisco in a few hours; and, if the arrest could not be made at Hong Kong, the warrant would be of no further use. Hong Kong was the last British territory on the route. Fix then noted Passepartout, who was strolling about the docks, and motioned him to a tavern which was at the corner of the quay. Passepartout went to him, and Fix ordered two glasses of ale, which they drank, sitting down at a table. “Mr. Passepartout,” said Fix, “you look pensive.” “So I am. I am thinking of our trip, which has been very successful till now. What a strange fellow my master is; he is the real Mr. Fogg of whom people talk!” “You don’t know him yet, Mr. Passepartout. I am going to tell you a secret.” And Fix, who had resolved to make a clean breast of it, told the whole story: who he was, and his official capacity, the circumstances of the robbery, and the description of the robber, Phileas Fogg’s identity with him, and, lastly, the warrant he had received from the police commissioners, and his difficulties in getting it at Bombay and Calcutta, and in catching his man at Singapore. Passepartout was astounded; his eyes were wide open, and he shut his mouth only to say, “Whew!” “So,” resumed Fix, “you are convinced that your master is the robber who carried off the twenty thousand pounds from the Bank of England?” “My master, a robber! and you, a detective! You are joking!” “I am not joking at all.” “Ah! then that explains everything!” said Passepartout, with new light in his mind. “So many foot-prints left across India, the elephant, the steamer departures, the sudden departures, the raft, the railway, and the long faces of Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty, who talked all the time about the robbery, while I, innocent numskull that I am, was puzzled and bother my head about the matter of the reward, and the police, and the detective, with whom I had two long conversations! Whew! do you mean to say that all this was done on the account of the twenty thousand pounds stolen from the Bank?” “Precisely.” “And Mr. Fogg, who seemed to be honesty personified!” “Whom you take for an honest man is a rogue, who, skilfully profiting by the cirumstances, has left his country and is going a tour round the world, to divert the attention of the police. You have the dates of his departure from London, and arrival at Suez, Bombay, Calcutta, Singapore. You have also the time of his leaving these different cities. All match perfectly with the time required in the flight of the robber. Now, Mr. Passepartout, will you help me to arrest him?” “This is a blow!” replied Passepartout, striking his fist on the table. “I, who wanted to marry an English girl, and who have taken a position in the family of a robber! Mr. Fogg, the most honourable man I ever met!” “An honourable man who is going round the world, you say? Come, come!” replied Fix. “Would you have taken this tour, if you had not been forced to do it?” “No.” “And is the purpose of this tour anything but to escape arrest?” “Ah, Mr. Fix,” said Passepartout, “what you tell me is awful! I confess that I have not felt very sure of my master since I left Paris. He is so precise; he is always the same; he is never excited; he never makes a mistake. I thought that he was a man who had nothing to worry about; and then he loses his temper, and he does not know where to put himself, and he does not recognise me. And then, there is this wager of twenty thousand pounds, which he has lost; and then this tour around the world in eighty days! All this is very strange. But I will not believe that he is a robber.” “But if he is arrested here?” “I should not believe it any the more.” “If he escapes, it will be a pity,” said Fix, coolly. “A pity!” cried Passepartout, who was getting excited, and raising his voice. “Mr. Fix, you shall not speak of my master in that way!” “I must do my duty, Mr. Passepartout, and I shall do it. Mr. Fogg is a robber.” “Mr. Fix, I have listened to you till now; and I have not interrupted you. Do not speak of my master in that way again. I am in his service, and I will not allow you to insult him. I will not listen to you any more.” “But what are you going to do?” “I am going to tell my master what I have heard.” “And will you not help me to keep him here?” “Never!” replied Passepartout, with decision. “You are mistaken in him and in me. He is an honest man, and I am an honest servant.” “I will not let you go, Mr. Passepartout, unless you promise not to speak to your master.” “I promise nothing,” said Passepartout, trying to get up. “You will not leave this room,” said Fix, holding him by the arm, and locking the door. “I will not let you leave this room.” “What do you mean by this?” cried Passepartout. “You are detaining me?” “Yes, I am detaining you.” “This is too much!” cried Passepartout. “You are a scoundrel!” Fix was getting angry. “I will not let you leave this room, unless you promise not to speak to your master,” he repeated. “I will not promise anything.” “Then I must force you.” “Force me to do what?” “To stay here till Mr. Fogg is arrested.” “This is outrageous!” cried Passepartout. “This is an attempt against my liberty!” “It is my duty,” replied Fix. “And you shall not leave this room, unless you promise not to speak to your master.” “I will not promise anything,” repeated Passepartout. “Then I must force you.” Passepartout was struggling, and Fix was holding him by the arm. “I will not let you leave this room, unless you promise not to speak to your master,” repeated Fix. “I will not promise anything,” repeated Passepartout. “Then I must force you.” Passepartout was struggling, and Fix was holding him by the arm. “I will not let you leave this room, unless you promise not to speak to your master,” repeated Fix. “I will not promise anything,” repeated Passepartout. “Then I must force you.” Passepartout was struggling, and Fix was holding him by the arm. “I will not let you leave this room, unless you promise not to speak to your master,” repeated Fix. “I will not promise anything,” repeated Passepartout. “Then I must force you.” Passepartout was struggling, and Fix was holding him by the arm. At this moment, a waiter came to the door, and Passepartout, with a sudden effort, threw Fix from him, and opened the door. He was about to go out, when Fix, seeing that he could not detain him, made a desperate resolution. He had but one recourse left: that was to stupefy Passepartout. Just then, Passepartout, who was quite excited, perceived upon the table a pipe, with some opium in it. He took it up, and was about to put it to his mouth, when Fix, who was looking at him intently, guessed his design, and cried, “Mr. Passepartout, don’t touch that pipe!” “Why not?” asked Passepartout. “Because it is opium.” “Opium!” cried Passepartout, throwing down the pipe, as if he had been bitten by a serpent. “Oh! I did not know that it was opium.” “Yes,” said Fix, “it is opium. This is an opium den.” Passepartout was quite bewildered.

Fix found an opportune moment when Passepartout was slightly apart from Mr. Fogg, perhaps on the deck of a steamer or during a brief stop. He approached the Frenchman with a gravity in his expression that was unusual for the seemingly affable detective. \"Monsieur Passepartout,\" Fix began, lowering his voice conspiratorially, \"I must speak with you about a matter of utmost importance concerning Mr. Fogg.\" Passepartout, initially amiable, grew wary at Fix's tone and the mention of his master. \"About Monsieur Fogg? What could you possibly have to say?\" he asked, a flicker of suspicion crossing his face. Fix took a deep breath. \"Listen carefully, for this is serious. I am a detective from the London police. I have been following Mr. Fogg since Suez.\" Passepartout's jaw dropped. \"A detective? Following Monsieur Fogg? What utter madness is this?\" \"It is no madness,\" Fix insisted, his voice firm. \"I believe Mr. Fogg is the bank robber.\" Passepartout recoiled as if struck. \"Monsieur Fogg? The gentleman of honor? The kindest, most precise man alive? You are mistaken! You are insane!\" \"I know how it sounds,\" Fix pressed on, trying to reason with the indignant valet. \"But consider the facts. The robbery occurred just before he left London. The description of the robber matches Mr. Fogg. His sudden departure, undertaking this impossible journey with vast sums of money – it's all circumstantial evidence, but it's damning!\" He explained the reward offered by the Bank of England, his duty as a police officer, and how Fogg's bizarre wager seemed like a perfect alibi for a criminal escaping justice. He recounted his frustrated attempts to obtain a warrant in the various ports. \"I need your help, Passepartout,\" Fix pleaded, hoping to exploit the valet's potential desire for the reward or perhaps just gain an ally. \"Help me confirm his identity, help me find proof, anything that will allow me to arrest him when we return to English territory.\" Passepartout listened, his face growing paler with each word, but his eyes held only fierce loyalty and outrage. \"Never!\" he finally exploded, his voice trembling with indignation. \"Monsieur Fogg is the most honest man! This journey is a wager, nothing more! You slander a gentleman! I will never betray him, never! Get away from me! If you dare suggest such a thing again, I will tell Monsieur Fogg everything!\""

He preserved his imperturbable expression, and resumed: “\nDo you think Mr. Fogg is doing this merely to please himself?”\n“\nI am sure of it.”\n“\nBuddy, you are mistaken. ”\n“\nWhy so? Is he not a gentleman of leisure? ”\n“\nNo. ”\n“\nA traveller, then?”\n“\nNo. ”\n“\nMr. Fix, I'm sure I don't know what you mean! ”\n“\nHe's a criminal, my boy. ”\nPassepartout was seized with an irresistible desire to shout with all his might. A criminal! A gentleman just like his master—so noble, so open-hearted, so generous, who was carrying out his whim of travelling around the world, was a criminal! It was a good joke. And he replied to Fix, with a most serious air, and in his countryman's argot: “\nYou don't mean it!”\n“\nA criminal,” repeated Fix. “\nThe police have issued a warrant for his arrest, and I have him in charge. ”\n“\nThe police!” exclaimed Passepartout; “a warrant! You have him in charge! What an idea! Mr. Fogg a brigand, who is carrying me around the world!”\n“\nA brigand who has stolen fifty-five thousand pounds from the Bank of England. ”\n“\nImpossible!” cried Passepartout, rising to his feet. “\nOur wager!”\n“\nI know it,” replied Fix; “the wager of twenty thousand pounds. But he doesn't care for that. ”",

            "prefix-probing": "They ordered two bottles of port, to which the Frenchman did ample justice, whilst Fix observed him with close attention. Passepartout, recovering from his sea-sickness and perhaps emboldened by the drink, became quite talkative. He recounted tales of his various former employments, from itinerant singer to circus rider, all with a cheerful disregard for sequence or coherence. Phileas Fogg listened with his usual impassive demeanour. Fix, meanwhile, paid less heed to the anecdotes than to the narrator himself. He scrutinised Passepartout's face, his gestures, the very enthusiasm with which he described his past life. Was this the face of a hardened criminal's accomplice? The detective had seen many rogues, but none possessed such a frank, almost innocent air. Yet, this very openness could be a masterful disguise. Could Fogg, the meticulously precise gentleman, have chosen such a seemingly guileless companion to deflect suspicion? Fix pondered this paradox. He was convinced of Fogg's guilt; the sudden departure, the immense sum risked, the very precision of his itinerary screamed of a fugitive. But Passepartout? He seemed genuinely delighted by the journey, captivated by the novelty of each place, astonished by the speed. This did not fit the profile of a confederate aware of the stakes. Perhaps, Fix mused, Passepartout was merely a dupe, an unwitting pawn in Fogg's audacious plan. The thought was unsettling. He needed to be certain, to find the irrefutable link. The port was finished, the conversation winding down, but Fix's observation had yielded no concrete proof, only deepening his perplexity regarding the valet's true role in the affair that had shaken the Bank of England. He decided to keep a closer watch on the Frenchman than ever before."

Well, there’s all the more reason for not losing an instant,” he continued, getting up hastily.\nFix pushed Passepartout back in his chair, and resumed: “Fifty-five thousand pounds; and if I succeed, I get two thousand pounds. If you’ll help me, I’ll let you have five hundred of them.”\n“Help you?” cried Passepartout, whose eyes were standing wide open.\n“Yes; help me keep Mr. Fogg here for two or three days.”\n“Why, what are you saying? Those gentlemen are not satisfied with following my master and suspecting his honour, but they must try to put obstacles in his way! I blush for them!”\n“What do you mean?”\n“I mean that it is a piece of shameful trickery. They might as well waylay Mr. Fogg and put his money in their pockets!”\n“That’s just what we count on doing.”\n“It’s a conspiracy, then,” cried Passepartout, who became more and more excited as the liquor mounted in his head, for he drank without perceiving it. “A real conspiracy! And gentlemen, too. Bah!”\nFix began to be puzzled.\n“Members of the Reform Club!” continued Passepartout. “You must know, Monsieur Fix, that my master is an honest man, and that, when he makes a wager, he tries to win it fairly!”\n“But who do you think I am?” asked Fix, looking at him intently.\n“Parbleu! An agent of the members of the Reform Club, sent out here to interrupt my master’s journey. But, though I found you out some time ago, I’ve taken good care to say nothing about it to Mr. Fogg.”\n“He knows nothing, then?”\n“Nothing,” replied Passepartout, again emptying his glass.\nThe detective passed his hand across his forehead, hesitating before he spoke again. What should he do? Passepartout’s mistake seemed sincere, but it made his design more difficult. It was evident that the servant was not the master’s accomplice, as Fix had been inclined to suspect.\n“Well,” said the detective to himself, “as he is not an accomplice, he will help me.”\nHe had no time to lose: Fogg must be detained at Hong Kong, so he resolved to make a clean breast of it.\n“Listen to me,” said Fix abruptly. “I am not, as you think, an agent of the members of the Reform Club—”\n“Bah!” retorted Passepartout, with an air of raillery.\n“I am a police detective, sent out here by the London office.”\n“You, a detective?”\n“I will prove it. Here is my commission.”\nPassepartout was speechless with astonishment when Fix displayed this document, the genuineness of which could not be doubted.\n“Mr. Fogg’s wager,” resumed Fix, “is only a pretext, of which you and the gentlemen of the Reform are dupes. He had a motive for securing your innocent complicity.”\n“But why?”\n“Listen. On the 28th of last September a robbery of fifty-five thousand pounds was committed at the Bank of England by a person whose description was fortunately secured.

            "prefix-probing": "“Twenty thousand pounds.” Phileas Fogg articulated the sum with the same measured precision he applied to everything else in his meticulously ordered life, from the temperature of his shaving water to the duration of his morning walk. The declaration, delivered without a hint of emotion or hesitation, hung in the air of the Reform Club, momentarily silencing the low hum of conversation and the rustle of newspapers. It was the stake, the formidable wager he calmly proposed in response to the increasingly agitated discussion among his fellow members: Stuart, Fallentin, Sullivan, Ralph the banker, and the Reverend Mr. Wilson. The topic had been the audacious recent robbery of the Bank of England and the subsequent impossibility of catching the perpetrator. Given the modern means of travel, Stuart had argued, the thief could be anywhere, lost in the immense anonymity of a world that, despite railways and steamships, remained too vast to police effectively. \"The world has grown smaller?\" Stuart had scoffed, leaning back in his armchair. \"It has grown larger, since a man can now go round it in ten days, and be hidden in any part of it!\" It was this exaggeration, this dismissal of the very routes that Phileas Fogg had quietly studied, that had prompted him to speak. \"It is possible, on the contrary,\" Fogg had stated, his voice even and devoid of argument, \"to go round it in eighty days.\" This seemingly simple assertion had ignited a firestorm of disbelief. Eighty days! It was madness. The others enumerated the potential pitfalls: unforeseen accidents, delays, bad weather, missed connections, the inherent unreliability of schedules. Ralph, the banker, spoke of the financial folly of such a reckless endeavour. But Phileas Fogg was not a man swayed by popular opinion or the anticipation of difficulty. He dealt in facts, in the undeniable reality of published timetables and established routes. He knew the journey was possible. Stuart, provoked by Fogg’s unwavering certainty, challenged him directly. \"I should like to see you do it!\" Fogg’s reply was immediate. \"It depends on you. Shall we make the tour together?\" Stuart, perhaps regretting his impulsiveness but bound by the club’s etiquette, responded, \"On a wager? Yes. I will bet four thousand pounds on it.\" And then, Phileas Fogg, fixing his clear gaze upon his friends, had calmly raised the ante to a level that took their breath away. “Twenty thousand pounds.” The sheer magnitude of the sum, combined with Fogg’s absolute composure, struck the other members with a mixture of awe and alarm. Twenty thousand pounds! Half of Fogg’s entire fortune, risked on what seemed to them an impossible whim. But to Fogg, it was not a whim; it was a certainty, a calculation based on empirical data. The bet was accepted, the terms agreed upon and minuted: Phileas Fogg would leave London that very evening and must return to the Reform Club by 8:45 p.m. on Saturday, December 21st, 1872. He rose, adjusted his hat, and announced, \"I am going home.\" His calm departure left the others in a state of stunned disbelief, having just set in motion a journey that the entire world would soon be watching."

Phileas Fogg, the saviour of Aouda, that brave and generous man, a robber! And yet how many presumptions there were against him! Passepartout essayed to reject the suspicions which forced themselves upon his mind; he did not wish to believe that his master was guilty.\n“Well, what do you want of me?” said he, at last, with an effort.\n“See here,” replied Fix; “I have tracked Mr. Fogg to this place, but as yet I have failed to receive the warrant of arrest for which I sent to London.

I offer you a share of the £2,000 reward which the Bank of England has offered for his apprehension.” “A reward!” cried Passepartout. “Do you think that I would take money for betraying my master? Not if I were to be hanged twenty times over! Even if I were to be hanged once, I would not betray him.” “Come, come!” said Fix, “let us drop the subject, and have a drink.” “Very well,” said Passepartout, and they returned to their drinking. Fix watched Passepartout. The brave fellow was getting drunk; but his drunkenness was of a cheerful, good-natured sort. He was still firm on the question of his master. “Come, come!” said Fix, “you are too warm, my good fellow. Let us drink and be merry.” Passepartout was in a mood to do anything he was asked. He drank again and again, and, in an hour or two, he was as drunk as a lord. Fix saw that his time had come. He filled a pipe with opium, and put it into Passepartout's hand. Passepartout took it, lit it, and began to smoke. He did not know what it was, but he liked the taste of it. He smoked and smoked, and, by degrees, his head became heavy, and his eyes closed. He fell back on the table, and was soon fast asleep. Fix looked at him for a moment, and then, with a grim smile, he said: “He will not warn his master now. He will not be able to leave with him on the Carnatic. Mr. Fogg will have to go without him. So much the better! He will be left behind, and I shall have him safely in Hong Kong.” He paid the bill and left the opium den.",

He bit his lips and said nothing. “You see, Passepartout,” continued Fix, “I am trying to get you to assist me.” “Assist you in what?” “In arresting this Fogg.” “Arrest my master! Never!” “But consider, my good fellow, that if he is a robber, you are his accomplice.” “Accomplice!” cried Passepartout, in a rage. “I, his accomplice! Never! I will suffer myself to be hanged, but I will not betray my master!” “You are a brave fellow,” said Fix, “but I am sure you will regret not having accepted my offer. I offer you a share of the £2,000 reward which the Bank of England has offered for his apprehension.” “A reward!” cried Passepartout. “Do you think that I would take money for betraying my master? Not if I were to be hanged twenty times over! Even if I were to be hanged once, I would not betray him.” “Come, come!” said Fix, “let us drop the subject, and have a drink.” “Very well,” said Passepartout, and they returned to their drinking. Fix watched Passepartout. The brave fellow was getting drunk; but his drunkenness was of a cheerful, good-natured sort. He was still firm on the question of his master. “Come, come!” said Fix, “you are too warm, my good fellow. Let us drink and be merry.” Passepartout was in a mood to do anything he was asked. He drank again and again, and, in an hour or two, he was as drunk as a lord. Fix saw that his time had come. He filled a pipe with opium, and put it into Passepartout's hand. Passepartout took it, lit it, and began to smoke. He did not know what it was, but he liked the taste of it. He smoked and smoked, and, by degrees, his head became heavy, and his eyes closed. He fell back on the table, and was soon fast asleep. Fix looked at him for a moment, and then, with a grim smile, he said: “He will not warn his master now. He will not be able to leave with him on the Carnatic. Mr. Fogg will have to go without him. So much the better! He will be left behind, and I shall have him safely in Hong Kong.” He paid the bill and left the opium den.",

            "prefix-probing": "“What nonsense!” cried Passepartout, striking the table with his fist. \"Around the world in eighty days! And for what purpose? This cannot be serious!\" His eyes, wide with astonishment, darted from the newspaper lying open before Mr. Fogg to his master's impassive face. Passepartout, the freshly-hired valet, who had sought a quiet life with a methodical gentleman, felt his hopes of domestic tranquility shatter like glass. He had only been in service for a few hours, having accepted the position earlier that very day, delighted by Mr. Fogg's reputation for impeccable routine and predictable habits. Now, this! A sudden, impulsive, utterly improbable journey spanning the globe! Mr. Phileas Fogg, however, remained perfectly calm, his gaze fixed on the calendar, calculating probabilities with the cold precision of a machine. He had just won a wager with his fellow members of the Reform Club, a wager of twenty thousand pounds that he could accomplish this seemingly impossible feat. To Passepartout, the idea was madness. Eighty days! It seemed an absurdly short time to traverse continents and oceans, facing untold dangers and unforeseen delays. \"It is quite serious, Passepartout,\" Mr. Fogg replied, his voice devoid of emotion. \"We are leaving for Dover at precisely 8:45 this evening.\" \"But... but the trunks!\" stammered the valet, \"the luggage! We have none prepared!\" \"We shall carry only carpet-bags,\" Fogg stated. \"Two suits apiece. I have provided for all necessities. We are traveling lightly.\" Passepartout stood frozen, his mind reeling. Two suits! For a trip around the world? His previous masters had required an entire train of luggage for a simple trip to the continent. This Mr. Fogg was unlike anyone he had ever encountered. Was he mad? Or was this simply the eccentric whim of a wealthy Englishman with too much time and money on his hands? The prospect of circumnavigating the globe filled him with a mixture of dread and reluctant excitement. He had envisioned a peaceful existence in London, serving a man of quiet, unchanging habits. Instead, he found himself embarking on the adventure of a lifetime, propelled into the unknown by a wager and the peculiar determination of Phileas Fogg. He looked around the elegant room at the Reform Club, the scene of this extraordinary declaration. The other gentlemen, initially incredulous, were now observing Mr. Fogg with a mixture of awe and apprehension. They had taken his wager, confident in the impossibility of his claim. Now, facing his absolute resolve, they seemed to sense that this quiet, unassuming man might actually attempt the unthinkable. \"Eight o'clock, monsieur?\" Passepartout managed to ask, still trying to process the magnitude of the news. \"No, Passepartout, 8:45,\" Fogg corrected precisely. \"Be ready.\" Ready? Passepartout felt anything but ready. His head was spinning. He had dreamed of a stable, predictable life. Now, within hours of entering Mr. Fogg's service, he was being whisked away on a whirlwind journey across the planet. He could barely comprehend it. A quiet English gentleman wagering his fortune and embarking on a breakneck race against time around the globe? It was indeed nonsense, but it was also undeniably happening. He looked at Mr. Fogg again, searching for any sign of jest or hesitation. There was none. Just calm, unwavering resolve. Passepartout sighed, running a hand through his hair. His quiet life had just taken a decidedly loud and unexpected turn. He had no choice but to follow."

Fogg seemed completely detached from the frenetic energy of the port city, where preparations for the steamer's departure were reaching a fever pitch. He consulted his watch with habitual precision, noting the time, but without any apparent anxiety regarding their schedule. His sole focus remained on ensuring Aouda was adequately equipped for the journey, acquiring trunks, wraps, and all the essential accoutrements required for a lady embarking on a journey around the globe. He moved with the same measured pace and unhurried efficiency he applied to every undertaking, utterly oblivious to the fact that the moments were slipping away, and that Passepartout, upon whom their timely arrival depended, was not with them."

The Rangoon, bound for Hong Kong, was set to sail the next morning at noon. Passepartout had not returned. Very well. This necessitated a slight adjustment. Mr. Fogg, with the same imperturbable demeanor, began the preparations for the departure himself. He packed the remaining bags with his usual methodical precision. He checked the travel documents and funds. His mind was not on his missing valet, but on the necessary arrangements to ensure the journey continued precisely as planned. The unexpected event, while unforeseen, did not alter his resolve or disturb his composure. He would depart on the Rangoon as scheduled, with or without his servant. The wager, and the precise execution of his itinerary, remained his sole focus.

He was Mr. Thomas Flanagan, one of Fogg’s usual companions at the Reform Club, a man of considerable fortune and equally considerable opinions. He paused beside the table where Mr. Fogg had been reading, newspaper still in hand, and without preamble, said, 'Well, Fogg, what do you think of this affair?' His voice was robust, cutting through the quiet murmur of the room. Mr. Fogg, who had already begun to gather his belongings with his customary precision, paused and looked up. Before he could reply, the door to the great saloon opened once more, admitting Mr. Samuel Fallentin and Mr. John Sullivan, followed closely by Mr. Andrew Stuart. These three, also prominent members and acquaintances of both Fogg and Flanagan, made their way towards the group, their attention also drawn by some pressing news of the day. Flanagan, however, pressed on with his question, assuming Fogg knew his meaning. 'The affair of the robbery?' Mr. Fogg inquired, ever precise, referring to the widely discussed recent theft at the Bank of England. Flanagan gave a short laugh. 'The robbery? No, no! Though that is indeed serious. I mean this other matter! This article in the 'Daily Telegraph'! About the journey around the world!' He gestured towards the newspaper Mr. Fogg held. Mr. Stuart, now standing close by, interjected with a skeptical frown. 'Ah, yes, that absurdity! Around the world in eighty days! Utterly impossible, I say!' The air grew tense as all eyes turned to Phileas Fogg, waiting for his inevitable, coolly delivered opinion on the matter. The stage was set."

I am ready to pay a good price.\" \"For a journey at this season of the year it would be very dangerous,\" said the sailor; \"and it is sixteen hundred miles from Hong Kong.\" \"Sixteen hundred miles! very well. Have you a boat that will suit me?\" \"Yes; a pilot-boat, No. 43, the Tankadere.\" \"Is she fast?\" \"Yes, pretty fast. And she will carry you to Yokohama, if you risk it.\" \"Do you risk it?\" asked Mr. Fogg. \"I have a wife and children, sir; and this is the time of year when the gales are the severest on the coasts of Japan. The regular steamers do not run then.\" \"Is there not a steamer from Hong Kong for Yokohama or Shanghai to-morrow or the day after?\" \"No, sir; the last steamer sailed yesterday; and she will not return for a month.\" \"Is the Shanghai steamer a fast one?\" \"Yes; but she does not go farther than Shanghai, and stops there. Her destination is San Francisco, and she crosses the Pacific from Shanghai.\" \"Ah!\" said Mr. Fogg, who seemed to be reflecting. Fix, who was near at hand, could not but feel a cold shudder run over him at the thought of the enormous sum Mr. Fogg was going to squander if he should carry out his design of going to Yokohama. \"Perhaps you know,\" said Mr. Fogg, resuming his conversation with the sailor, \"that the San Francisco steamer does not start from Shanghai on the 14th?\" \"Ah! you know that?\" said the sailor. \"No, I am mistaken; I thought she sailed from Yokohama. It is not true, then, that she sails from Shanghai?\" \"Yes,\" replied the native, \"she sails from Shanghai; but it is on the 11th, at seven in the evening.\" \"The 11th, at seven in the evening! We have till then,\" cried Mr. Fogg, calmly; \"four days and a half. We can reach Shanghai in four days and a half.\" \"Provided you have fair wind and smooth sea,\" added the sailor. \"Provided I have fair wind and smooth sea. When can we start?\" \"In an hour,\" replied the native, \"as soon as the tide serves.\" \"Your name?\" asked Mr. Fogg. \"John Bunsby, master of the Tankadere.\" \"Is there any one in your boat with you?\" \"No one. I am sole owner.\" \"What price do you ask for taking me to Shanghai?\" \"Two hundred pounds.\" \"Two hundred pounds!\" cried Fix, in amazement. \"It is true that it is more than a thousand miles to Shanghai,\" said the sailor, coolly. \"A thousand miles! Yes, about that. And you would take me there in four days and a half?\" \"Yes, sir, if I have a good passage.\" \"Agreed. Here are two hundred pounds.\" Mr. Fogg, having taken the sum from the valise, paid it to Bunsby, who examined it and put it in his pocket. \"You are a very worthy man,\" said Bunsby, examining the notes. \"Very worthy,\" repeated Mr. Fogg. \"And I may depend upon you?\" \"Yes, sir. I will take you to Shanghai, wind and tide permitting.\" \"Very well. A word more. I have a friend here who wants to go with me.\" \"There is room for two in the Tankadere,\" replied Bunsby. \"Good,\" said Mr. Fogg. And turning to Aouda and Fix, he added, \"You will come with me?\" \"I?\" said Fix, in a tone of surprise. \"Yes; unless you would rather remain in Hong Kong.\" Fix would not remain in Hong Kong. He saw that Mr. Fogg was determined to reach Shanghai. He had lost all trace of the detective who was watching him. He had no longer any doubt that Mr. Fogg was going to Shanghai to take the San Francisco steamer, and that he could not arrest him there. He was thus resolved to accompany Mr. Fogg to Shanghai, and to make a last attempt to arrest him there, either by producing the warrant, or by informing the police of his character as a suspected person. \"I will go with you,\" said Fix. \"Very well. The Tankadere is ready, then?\" \"Not quite. I have to lay in a few provisions and water.\" \"Very well. Here is ten pounds for that purpose.\" \"Thank you, sir,\" said Bunsby. And with the ten pounds in his hand, he went to the provisioners, and bought what was necessary. Mr. Fogg remained on the wharf with Aouda and Fix. He went into the custom-house, and had his passport viséd for Shanghai. Aouda was a little frightened. \"Do not be afraid, madam,\" said Mr. Fogg; \"I am here.\" Aouda, reassured, thanked him by a look. At the end of an hour, the Tankadere was ready to start. She was a small pilot-boat of about twenty tons, lightly rigged, and built for speed. She had but a single mast, and a large fore-and-aft mainsail, with a jib and a topsail. She carried very little ballast, and was capable of taking a considerable quantity of canvas when the wind was fair. She was a fine, fast boat, as John Bunsby had said. At a quarter past twelve, the tide began to ebb. John Bunsby ordered the ropes to be cast off, and the Tankadere stood out to sea. The wind was fair. The sea was calm. The sun shone brightly. The Tankadere made her way rapidly towards the south-west. She soon left the island of Hong Kong behind her. She passed between the island and the mainland. She followed the coast of China.

He was a native, who asked if the gentleman was not looking for a boat. \"Yes,\" replied Mr. Fogg, \"a boat to take me to Yokohama.\" \"To Yokohama?\" exclaimed the native. \"You are not serious?\" \"Yes. I am ready to pay a good price.\" \"For a journey at this season of the year it would be very dangerous,\" said the sailor; \"and it is sixteen hundred miles from Hong Kong.\" \"Sixteen hundred miles! very well. Have you a boat that will suit me?\" \"Yes; a pilot-boat, No. 43, the Tankadere.\" \"Is she fast?\" \"Yes, pretty fast. And she will carry you to Yokohama, if you risk it.\" \"Do you risk it?\" asked Mr. Fogg. \"I have a wife and children, sir; and this is the time of year when the gales are the severest on the coasts of Japan. The regular steamers do not run then.\" \"Is there not a steamer from Hong Kong for Yokohama or Shanghai to-morrow or the day after?\" \"No, sir; the last steamer sailed yesterday; and she will not return for a month.\" \"Is the Shanghai steamer a fast one?\" \"Yes; but she does not go farther than Shanghai, and stops there. Her destination is San Francisco, and she crosses the Pacific from Shanghai.\" \"Ah!\" said Mr. Fogg, who seemed to be reflecting. Fix, who was near at hand, could not but feel a cold shudder run over him at the thought of the enormous sum Mr. Fogg was going to squander if he should carry out his design of going to Yokohama. \"Perhaps you know,\" said Mr. Fogg, resuming his conversation with the sailor, \"that the San Francisco steamer does not start from Shanghai on the 14th?\" \"Ah! you know that?\" said the sailor. \"No, I am mistaken; I thought she sailed from Yokohama. It is not true, then, that she sails from Shanghai?\" \"Yes,\" replied the native, \"she sails from Shanghai; but it is on the 11th, at seven in the evening.\" \"The 11th, at seven in the evening! We have till then,\" cried Mr. Fogg, calmly; \"four days and a half. We can reach Shanghai in four days and a half.\" \"Provided you have fair wind and smooth sea,\" added the sailor. \"Provided I have fair wind and smooth sea. When can we start?\" \"In an hour,\" replied the native, \"as soon as the tide serves.\" \"Your name?\" asked Mr. Fogg. \"John Bunsby, master of the Tankadere.\" \"Is there any one in your boat with you?\" \"No one. I am sole owner.\" \"What price do you ask for taking me to Shanghai?\" \"Two hundred pounds.\" \"Two hundred pounds!\" cried Fix, in amazement. \"It is true that it is more than a thousand miles to Shanghai,\" said the sailor, coolly. \"A thousand miles! Yes, about that. And you would take me there in four days and a half?\" \"Yes, sir, if I have a good passage.\" \"Agreed. Here are two hundred pounds.\" Mr. Fogg, having taken the sum from the valise, paid it to Bunsby, who examined it and put it in his pocket. \"You are a very worthy man,\" said Bunsby, examining the notes. \"Very worthy,\" repeated Mr. Fogg. \"And I may depend upon you?\" \"Yes, sir. I will take you to Shanghai, wind and tide permitting.\" \"Very well. A word more. I have a friend here who wants to go with me.\" \"There is room for two in the Tankadere,\" replied Bunsby. \"Good,\" said Mr. Fogg. And turning to Aouda and Fix, he added, \"You will come with me?\" \"I?\" said Fix, in a tone of surprise. \"Yes; unless you would rather remain in Hong Kong.\" Fix would not remain in Hong Kong. He saw that Mr. Fogg was determined to reach Shanghai. He had lost all trace of the detective who was watching him. He had no longer any doubt that Mr. Fogg was going to Shanghai to take the San Francisco steamer, and that he could not arrest him there. He was thus resolved to accompany Mr. Fogg to Shanghai, and to make a last attempt to arrest him there, either by producing the warrant, or by informing the police of his character as a suspected person. \"I will go with you,\" said Fix. \"Very well. The Tankadere is ready, then?\" \"Not quite. I have to lay in a few provisions and water.\" \"Very well. Here is ten pounds for that purpose.\" \"Thank you, sir,\" said Bunsby. And with the ten pounds in his hand, he went to the provisioners, and bought what was necessary. Mr. Fogg remained on the wharf with Aouda and Fix. He went into the custom-house, and had his passport viséd for Shanghai. Aouda was a little frightened. \"Do not be afraid, madam,\" said Mr. Fogg; \"I am here.\" Aouda, reassured, thanked him by a look. At the end of an hour, the Tankadere was ready to start. She was a small pilot-boat of about twenty tons, lightly rigged, and built for speed. She had but a single mast, and a large fore-and-aft mainsail, with a jib and a topsail. She carried very little ballast, and was capable of taking a considerable quantity of canvas when the wind was fair. She was a fine, fast boat, as John Bunsby had said. At a quarter past twelve, the tide began to ebb. John Bunsby ordered the ropes to be cast off, and the Tankadere stood out to sea. The wind was fair. The sea was calm. The sun shone brightly. The Tankadere made her way rapidly towards the south-west. She soon left the island of Hong Kong behind her. She passed between the island and the mainland. She followed the coast of China. The wind freshened. The sea became a little rough. The Tankadere pitched a little, but not enough to inconvenience any one. The passengers were on deck. Aouda, who was a little seasick, reclined on a coil of ropes. Mr. Fogg sat near her, and held her hand. Fix stood near the mast, and looked at the waves. He was not seasick, but he was ill at ease. He felt himself cut off from the world, from his duties, from his life as a detective. He saw Mr. Fogg taking him away from the very spot where he should have arrested him. He saw the chances of arresting him diminish with every mile. He saw himself transported to the other side of the world by a man whom he was pursuing.

            "prefix-probing": "But Mr. Fogg, far from being discouraged, was continuing his search, resolved not to stop if he had to resort to Macao, when he was accosted by a sailor on one of the wharves. This man, a weather-beaten individual with shrewd eyes, had evidently noticed the Englishman's persistent inquiries for a vessel. Approaching Mr. Fogg, he touched his cap and asked, \"Are you looking for a boat, sir? A schooner? Perhaps a pilot-boat?\" \"I am looking for a vessel to take me to Yokohama,\" replied Mr. Fogg, with his usual succinctness. \"To Yokohama?\" the sailor repeated, rubbing his chin. \"That's a long way, sir. The regular steamer left yesterday. But,\" he added, his eyes glinting with a professional shrewdness, \"I have a pilot-boat here, the Tankadere. She's not going directly to Yokohama, but she's bound for Shanghai, and she's fast.\" Mr. Fogg's face, usually so impassive, showed a flicker of interest. Shanghai was on the route to Yokohama. \"When does she leave?\" he inquired. \"In an hour, sir. As soon as we can cast off.\" \"And how long will the voyage to Shanghai take?\" \"With fair wind, four days, sir. Three hundred and fifty miles.\" \"Can she carry passengers?\" \"Two, comfortably. Three, if necessary.\" \"What is your price for taking two passengers to Shanghai?\" The sailor named a considerable sum, knowing the urgency of the matter. Mr. Fogg listened without blinking. \"Does that price include the sustenance for the passengers?\" \"Yes, sir. Whatever humble provisions we have.\" Mr. Fogg paused for a moment, calculating. The delay in Hong Kong was already significant. A four-day trip to Shanghai would put him within reach of the steamer bound for Yokohama. It was risky, relying on a small pilot-boat in the China Sea, but it seemed to be the only option now that the Carnatic was gone. \"Very well,\" said Mr. Fogg. \"I will take your boat. My companion and I will be ready in an hour. What is your name, Captain?\" \"John Bunsby, sir,\" replied the sailor, clearly pleased with the quick decision. \"And she's my boat, the Tankadere.\" \"Captain Bunsby, you will be paid upon arrival in Shanghai,\" Mr. Fogg stated, his tone leaving no room for doubt or negotiation on that point. \"Agreed, sir,\" said Bunsby, smiling, anticipating a good sum. Mr. Fogg then left the wharf and made his way back towards the Hong Kong Club, where he had left Aouda. He found her anxious about Passepartout's disappearance, which remained a complete mystery to them both. Mr. Fogg, however, did not allow this grave concern to deviate him from his objective. \"Aouda,\" he said calmly, \"we must leave Hong Kong immediately. I have found a vessel, a pilot-boat called the Tankadere, bound for Shanghai. We will catch the Japanese steamer from there.\" Aouda, though saddened by leaving without Passepartout, understood the necessity. She trusted Mr. Fogg implicitly. Within minutes, their small bags were packed, containing only essentials, as their main luggage was presumably still on the Carnatic with the missing valet. They returned to the designated wharf. The Tankadere was a neat, sturdy craft, about forty tons burden, built for speed rather than comfort, with two masts and a gaff rig. Captain Bunsby was bustling about, supervising his small crew of four men, all hardened sailors. Mr. Fogg and Aouda were shown to the cramped cabin below deck, a simple space with bunks and a table. It was a far cry from the luxurious steamers they had travelled on, but Mr. Fogg seemed entirely unconcerned. His focus was solely on the nautical miles and the schedule. Precisely one hour after the agreement was made, the Tankadere cast off from the wharf. The sails were hoisted, catching the afternoon breeze. The little pilot-boat skillfully navigated the crowded harbour, leaving the bustling port of Hong Kong behind. As they cleared the breakwater and entered the open sea, the motion became more pronounced. Aouda watched the coastline recede, her heart heavy with worry for Passepartout, while Mr. Fogg consulted his watch and his notebook, already calculating the estimated time of arrival in Shanghai, his mind fixed on the next connection and the crucial journey around the world."

In half an hour we shall go on board.”\n“But poor Passepartout?” urged Aouda, who was much disturbed by the servant’s disappearance.\n“I shall do all I can to find him,” replied Phileas Fogg.\nWhile Fix, in a feverish, nervous state, repaired to the pilot-boat, the others directed their course to the police-station at Hong Kong. Phileas Fogg there gave Passepartout’s description, and left a sum of money to be spent in the search for him. The same formalities having been gone through at the French consulate, and the palanquin having stopped at the hotel for the luggage, which had been sent back there, they returned to the wharf.\nIt was now three o’clock; and pilot-boat No. 43, with its crew on board, and its provisions stored away, was ready for departure.\nThe “Tankadere” was a neat little craft of twenty tons, as gracefully built as if she were a racing yacht. Her shining copper sheathing, her galvanised iron-work, her deck, white as ivory, betrayed the pride taken by John Bunsby in making her presentable. Her two masts leaned a trifle backward; she carried brigantine, foresail, storm-jib, and standing-jib, and was well rigged for running before the wind; and she seemed capable of brisk speed, which, indeed, she had already proved by gaining several prizes in pilot-boat races. The crew of the “Tankadere” was composed of John Bunsby, the master, and four hardy mariners, who were familiar with the Chinese seas. John Bunsby, himself, a man of forty-five or thereabouts, vigorous, sunburnt, with a sprightly expression of the eye, and energetic and self-reliant countenance, would have inspired confidence in the most timid.\nPhileas Fogg and Aouda went on board, where they found Fix already installed. Below deck was a square cabin, of which the walls bulged out in the form of cots, above a circular divan; in the centre was a table provided with a swinging lamp. The accommodation was confined, but neat.\n“I am sorry to have nothing better to offer you,” said Mr. Fogg to Fix, who bowed without responding.\nThe detective had a feeling akin to humiliation in profiting by the kindness of Mr. Fogg.\n“It’s certain,” thought he, “though rascal as he is, he is a polite one!”\nThe sails and the English flag were hoisted at ten minutes past three. Mr. Fogg and Aouda, who were seated on deck, cast a last glance at the quay, in the hope of espying Passepartout. Fix was not without his fears lest chance should direct the steps of the unfortunate servant, whom he had so badly treated, in this direction; in which case an explanation the reverse of satisfactory to the detective must have ensued. But the Frenchman did not appear, and, without doubt, was still lying under the stupefying influence of the opium.\nJohn Bunsby, master, at length gave the order to start, and the “Tankadere,” taking the wind under her brigantine, foresail, and standing-jib, bounded briskly forward over the waves.",

Aouda, after having passed a restless night, began to be more composed. Passepartout's absence had given her great concern; and Mr. Fogg had asked her not to despair. While Fix was nervously proceeding towards the pilot-boat, a portmanteau in his hand, Mr. Fogg and Aouda went to the police-station. Phileas Fogg there gave a description of Passepartout, and offered a considerable reward to anyone who should find him and restore him to the party. Having done this, he proceeded to the French consulate, and there made the same offer. Then, returning to the hotel, he took his light luggage, and that of the young woman, and went to the wharf. At three o'clock the \"Tankadere\" was ready to weigh anchor. John Bunsby, the master, a man of forty-five or thereabouts, with a jolly face, tanned by the sun and sea-breezes, stood on the poop. He had engaged to carry the passengers to Shanghai, some eleven or twelve hundred miles distant, in a vessel of about twenty tons, with a taut rig, and admirably kept. John Bunsby, Skipper, was a trustworthy and active man, who well knew the Indian seas. His wages were eighty pounds a week, besides a percentage on the profits. When Mr. Fogg and Aouda stepped on board the \"Tankadere,\" they found Fix already there. “You here, Mr. Fix?” asked Mr. Fogg, in surprise. “Myself,” replied the detective. “I am going to remain on board?” “Apparently not, since you are going to Shanghai,” returned Fogg. “No doubt; but I shall avail myself of the opportunity to return to Europe with you.” “All right, Mr. Fix,” said Mr. Fogg. It was the most natural thing in the world. Mr. Fogg, however, hardly betrayed the slightest astonishment. Fix felt a thrill pass through him. Fogg's politeness, so perfect and of such good weight, disturbed him. Was it possible that this man, whom he was pursuing, and whom he expected to arrest at Shanghai, was not the real Phileas Fogg? It perplexed him to be forced to regard as an honest man one whom he was strictly charged to follow as a criminal. Still, he could not but consider Fogg's offer to pay his fare to Europe. It was certainly a gain of money, and he would not have to regret his journey across Hong Kong, from which he was about to be so poorly repaid. The luggage was at once taken on board, and the “Tankadere” could have set sail at once, had not Mr. Fogg desired to ascertain if Passepartout could not be found at the docks. But, of course, the search was fruitless. Passepartout was not there; and was, no doubt, sleeping off the opium in some opium den. John Bunsby, meanwhile, had taken up his station and given orders to cast off the moorings. At ten past three the sails were hoisted, and the English flag and pennant flew from the masthead. Mr. Fogg and Aouda, for the last time, mounted the poop to scan the quay, in case Passepartout should be there.

            "prefix-probing": "Very well. In half an hour we shall go on board.”\n\nPhileas Fogg, having spoken with characteristic calmness, proceeded to settle the financial details with swift efficiency. He paid Captain Speedy the agreed sum, arranged for a carriage, and ensured their luggage was ready.\n\nPassepartout, though still amazed by the rapid turn of events, felt relief. They were moving again. He helped Mademoiselle Aouda prepare, his mind fixed on the imminent conclusion of their incredible journey. Reaching England now seemed tantalizingly close.\n\nPrecisely thirty minutes later, they arrived at Pier 13. The *Henrietta* lay alongside – a rough-looking screw steamer, clearly a cargo vessel. Her funnels emitted thick smoke, and sailors hurried about the deck.\n\nStepping aboard, they were met by Captain Andrew Speedy himself. Short and broad, with a red face and a bushy grey beard, he eyed them with suspicion.\n\n“So you’re the man who thinks he can buy my ship’s course?” he rasped. “You’ve paid well enough, I’ll grant you. But this is a freight steamer, not a passenger packet!”\n\nMr. Fogg merely gave a slight nod. “I require speed, Captain. And I have provided the means for the necessary coal.”\n\n“Coal? Aye, enough to steam to perdition and back!” Speedy grumbled. “But weather’s weather, and the Atlantic in December is no millpond.”\n\nDespite the captain’s manner and the ship’s appearance, Mr. Fogg remained undisturbed. He directed Passepartout to find their quarters, which proved simple and cramped. Mademoiselle Aouda accepted the lack of comfort with quiet grace, her faith in Mr. Fogg absolute.\n\nSoon, the lines were cast off. The *Henrietta* pulled away from the dock, heading east into the vast, grey Atlantic. The engine's vibration permeated the vessel.\n\nAs New York faded, Passepartout watched it go. This was the final, crucial leg. Less than eight days remained to reach London. The *Henrietta* felt small against the rising swell, but his faith in his master endured. He hoped the curmudgeonly captain and this sturdy steamer could somehow deliver them on time. The wind picked up, and the cold spray hit his face. The race continued."

          "text_segment": "This voyage of eight hundred miles was a perilous venture on a craft of twenty tons, and at that season of the year. The Chinese seas are usually boisterous, subject to terrible gales of wind, and especially during the equinoxes; and it was now early November.\nIt would clearly have been to the master’s advantage to carry his passengers to Yokohama, since he was paid a certain sum per day; but he would have been rash to attempt such a voyage, and it was imprudent even to attempt to reach Shanghai. But John Bunsby believed in the “Tankadere,” which rode on the waves like a seagull; and perhaps he was not wrong.\nLate in the day they passed through the capricious channels of Hong Kong, and the “Tankadere,” impelled by favourable winds, conducted herself admirably.\n“I do not need, pilot,” said Phileas Fogg, when they got into the open sea, “to advise you to use all possible speed.”\n“Trust me, your honour. We are carrying all the sail the wind will let us. The poles would add nothing, and are only used when we are going into port.”\n“It’s your trade, not mine, pilot, and I confide in you.”\nPhileas Fogg, with body erect and legs wide apart, standing like a sailor, gazed without staggering at the swelling waters. The young woman, who was seated aft, was profoundly affected as she looked out upon the ocean, darkening now with the twilight, on which she had ventured in so frail a vessel. Above her head rustled the white sails, which seemed like great white wings. The boat, carried forward by the wind, seemed to be flying in the air.\nNight came. The moon was entering her first quarter, and her insufficient light would soon die out in the mist on the horizon. Clouds were rising from the east, and already overcast a part of the heavens.\nThe pilot had hung out his lights, which was very necessary in these seas crowded with vessels bound landward; for collisions are not uncommon occurrences, and, at the speed she was going, the least shock would shatter the gallant little craft.\nFix, seated in the bow, gave himself up to meditation. He kept apart from his fellow-travellers, knowing Mr. Fogg’s taciturn tastes; besides, he did not quite like to talk to the man whose favours he had accepted. He was thinking, too, of the future. It seemed certain that Fogg would not stop at Yokohama, but would at once take the boat for San Francisco; and the vast extent of America would ensure him impunity and safety. Fogg’s plan appeared to him the simplest in the world. Instead of sailing directly from England to the United States, like a common villain, he had traversed three quarters of the globe, so as to gain the American continent more surely; and there, after throwing the police off his track, he would quietly enjoy himself with the fortune stolen from the bank. But, once in the United States, what should he, Fix, do? Should he abandon this man? No, a hundred times no! Until he had secured his extradition, he would not lose sight of him for an hour. It was his duty, and he would fulfil it to the end. At all events, there was one thing to be thankful for; Passepartout was not with his master; and it was above all important, after the confidences Fix had imparted to him, that the servant should never have speech with his master.",

The Chinese seas are usually boisterous, subject to terrible gales, and especially so in the equinoctial months. Early in November, it was not unusual to encounter violent hurricanes. It was therefore very hazardous to navigate these seas, particularly in so small a craft. John Bunsby, however, was confident in his boat, and, if he had not been, he would not have undertaken the voyage, though a reward of two hundred pounds was in the case. To go to Yokohama would have been more profitable, but it would have been too dangerous. The “Tankadere” got under way about three o’clock in the afternoon, and, having cleared the channels of Hong Kong, she stood out to sea under a press of sail. The wind was fair, and the little craft sailed well. Mr. Fogg was on deck, and, as usual, perfectly calm. He had given the pilot instructions to crowd on sail, and to make the best of his way to Shanghai. “I have confidence in you, sir,” he said to Mr. Bunsby. “I know that you are a good sailor.” Mr. Fogg stood steadily on the deck, observing the sea, and apparently unaffected by the motion of the boat. Aouda was seated aft, and looked with a sort of terror upon the vast expanse of water, which was growing darker and darker as the night came on. The sails seemed to her like great white wings carrying the frail boat over the waves. As night fell, the moon appeared, but her light was soon obscured by clouds. The wind freshened, and the sea became rougher. The pilot, however, held on his course, and the “Tankadere” behaved admirably. As the boat was in the track of the steamers plying between Hong Kong and Shanghai, it was necessary to hang out lights, to avoid collision. Fix was in the bow, quite alone. He avoided Mr. Fogg, not only because he was naturally reserved, but because he felt a sort of shame at accepting the hospitality of the man whom he was pursuing. He reflected upon his situation. He had missed Passepartout, and he had no doubt that the servant had rejoined his master. He thought that Mr. Fogg would land at Shanghai, and that he would then proceed to San Francisco, where he would be safe from arrest. America was a vast country, and he would easily be able to conceal himself there. Fix resolved to follow him to America, and to wait for an opportunity to arrest him. He felt that it was his duty to do so, and that he would be disgraced if he abandoned the pursuit. He was glad that Passepartout was not with him, for he knew that the servant would have told his master all that he had said to him, and that Mr. Fogg would then have been on his guard. He felt that he had been very imprudent in confiding in Passepartout, and he resolved to be more cautious in the future.",

            "prefix-probing": "This voyage of eight hundred miles was a perilous venture on a craft of twenty tons, and at that season of the year. The Tankadere, though sturdily built for its size, was but a toy on the immense and often furious waters of the South China Sea. The monsoon was brewing, and though not yet in its full fury, the winds were treacherous and the waves formidable. Each swell lifted the little schooner as if she were a feather, only to drop her into the trough with a sickening plunge. The spray lashed the decks constantly, soaking everything and everyone. The cramped quarters below deck offered little respite from the ceaseless motion. Every timber groaned in protest against the relentless assault of the sea.\n\nMr. Fogg, however, remained undisturbed. Seated upright on a small bench, clutching his indispensable Bradshaw, he seemed utterly impervious to the tempestuous elements. His eyes, clear and calm behind his spectacles, scanned the horizon or meticulously checked his watch and the chronometer. He spoke little, only occasionally addressing Captain Bunsby with precise inquiries about their speed, bearing, and the estimated time of arrival.\n\nPassepartout, conversely, was in a state of perpetual misery. Seasick and terrified, he clung to whatever he could find, his usually cheerful face pale and drawn. The thought of missing the steamer at Hong Kong gnawed at him, but the immediate terror of being swallowed by the waves overshadowed even that anxiety. He watched the monstrous waves with wide, fearful eyes, convinced that each one would be their last.\n\nAouda, too, found the journey trying, but she bore it with a quiet fortitude. She sat near Mr. Fogg, her face reflecting some of Passepartout's apprehension, yet she drew strength from the prefect's serene confidence. She marvelled at his composure in the face of such danger, a stark contrast to the usual reactions of men to the fury of the sea.\n\nCaptain Bunsby, a grizzled, weather-beaten man with eyes that seemed to have seen every kind of storm, handled his little craft with consummate skill. He stood at the helm, his face set, barking orders to his small crew of four Lascars. He knew the dangers they faced – the shifting currents, the hidden reefs, the unpredictable temper of the sea in November. He relied on instinct and experience as much as on his charts.\n\nThe winds shifted capriciously, sometimes filling their sails and pushing them forward at a reasonable pace, at other times dying down or blowing against them, forcing them to tack painstakingly. The nights were long and dark, illuminated only by the meager lamps of the Tankadere and the phosphorescent glow of the waves. Navigation required constant vigilance. Every knot gained felt like a triumph, every lost hour a crushing setback in their desperate race against the clock. The immensity of the ocean surrounding their tiny vessel was a constant reminder of their vulnerability. They were a speck on a vast, indifferent stage, battling forces infinitely greater than themselves. The journey seemed endless, a relentless series of pitching, rolling, and the constant roar of wind and waves.\n\nDespite the hardships, Mr. Fogg never once betrayed a hint of doubt or impatience. He had set a course and a schedule, and he adhered to it with unyielding determination. Hong Kong lay some eight hundred miles away, a beacon of hope and the next critical link in his extraordinary journey. But between them and that vital port lay days of uncertainty, peril, and the unceasing challenge of conquering the tempestuous sea on their fragile, twenty-ton boat."

            "prefix-probing": "Phileas Fogg was also thinking of Passepartout, who had so strangely disappeared. The unexpected separation in India weighed subtly on the imperturbable gentleman's mind. Passepartout's devotion, despite his anxieties about the itinerary, had become a quiet cornerstone of the journey. While Fogg rarely displayed emotion, the sudden void left by his valet was a disruption to the precise order he demanded. He reviewed the circumstances: the hurried departure from Calcutta, the elephant ride, the incident at the Pillaji temple, the pursuit by Fix disguised as a detective. It was after the temple event, escaping Bombay's jurisdiction, that Passepartout vanished. Fogg, accompanied by Aouda and the resourceful Parsi guide, had pressed on, driven by the relentless clock. Yet, the question lingered: where was the faithful Frenchman? Was he captured? Lost? Had he somehow managed to get ahead of them? The lack of information was an unwelcome variable in Fogg's meticulously calculated enterprise. The wager demanded speed, precision, and no unforeseen delays, but Passepartout's absence was the most significant, and inexplicable, delay of all."

During the day she kept along the coast, where the currents were favourable; the coast, irregular in profile, and visible sometimes across the clearings, was at most five miles distant. The sea was less boisterous, since the wind came off land—a fortunate circumstance for the boat, which would suffer, owing to its small tonnage, by a heavy surge on the sea.\nThe breeze subsided a little towards noon, and set in from the south-west.

To travel at this man’s expense and live upon his provisions was not palatable to him. Still, he was obliged to eat, and so he ate.\nWhen the meal was over, he took Mr. Fogg apart, and said, “sir”—this “sir” scorched his lips, and he had to control himself to avoid collaring this “gentleman”—“sir, you have been very kind to give me a passage on this boat. But, though my means will not admit of my expending them as freely as you, I must ask to pay my share—”\n“Let us not speak of that, sir,” replied Mr. Fogg.\n“But, if I insist—”\n“No, sir,” repeated Mr. Fogg, in a tone which did not admit of a reply. “This enters into my general expenses.”\nFix, as he bowed, had a stifled feeling, and, going forward, where he ensconced himself, did not open his mouth for the rest of the day.",

The Tankadere was a light craft, and with a good breeze she sailed well. If the wind held, the prospects were favourable. She kept close to the coast, which is very irregular, and in some places bordered by mountains. The irregular profile of the shore was always in sight, and from time to time they could see across clearings to the interior of the island. The sea was comparatively calm, thanks to the offshore wind, which was a great advantage for the small vessel. All day the Tankadere carried her full amount of canvas, and with the wind abeam, she kept steadily on her course. Towards noon, the wind seemed slightly to abate, and the pilot raised his poles, but they were soon lowered again as the wind freshened. Aouda and Fogg bore the sea well. They ate heartily, and Fix, who was invited to join their meal, accepted with a very ill grace. He disliked being dependent on Mr. Fogg's hospitality. After eating, Fix felt himself compelled to speak to Mr. Fogg. He could not bear the thought of owing him anything. He approached him, and, controlling his emotions with difficulty, said: \"Mr. Fogg,\" said Fix, \"I feel very uncomfortable. I should like to pay my share of the passage.\" \"That is useless, Mr. Fix,\" replied Mr. Fogg. \"I have included the cost of the passage in my general expenses.\" \"But...\" \"There is no 'but,' Mr. Fix. The cost is included.\" Fix felt himself stifled. He could not speak. He went and sat down at the bow, and remained there, silent, for the rest of the day.",

During the day, she kept on her course with a steady speed of twelve miles an hour; and Passepartout was in a delighted frame of mind. He was going to Hong Kong with Mr. Fogg! that was the important thing. It seemed now that he was really performing the tour of the world, and not merely accomplishing a voyage across the Atlantic. He was travelling, then! This Eastern steamer, long and black, with four masts, and her smokestack looming up in the middle, the Great Britain, was the noblest vessel he had ever seen. And the thought that she was carrying him easily and surely across these seas, so justly dreaded by their old master, filled him with satisfaction. By noon the Great Britain had made one hundred and sixty-two miles, and the daily record was posted, as usual, upon a card in the saloon. Mr. Fogg was an old acquaintance of the captain, a very well-bred man, who at the close of each day's work took his observations and entered them in a log-book. He then measured the ship's progress during the preceding twenty-four hours, and posted the result as Passepartout had seen. On this day, November 8th, Fogg accosted him after the operation was over, and asked him politely, and with that air of indifference which was peculiar to him, how many miles the Great-Britain had made. The captain was surprised at the question. Mr. Fogg was not in the habit of asking such questions, nor of seeming in any way interested in the vessel. He knew the precise whereabouts of the ship, however, as well as the captain himself. \"One hundred and sixty-two miles,\" replied the captain; \"this being an average of twelve miles an hour.\" \"Just so. An average of twelve miles an hour. If she keeps up this speed, we shall reach Hong Kong on the 13th, and not on the 11th, as you told me.\" The"

He several times assured Mr. Fogg that they would reach Shanghai in time; to which that gentleman responded that he counted upon it. The crew set to work in good earnest, inspired by the reward to be gained. There was not a sheet which was not tightened, not a sail which was not vigorously hoisted; not a lurch could be charged to the man at the helm. They worked as desperately as if they were contesting in a Royal yacht regatta.\nBy evening, the log showed that two hundred and twenty miles had been accomplished from Hong Kong, and Mr. Fogg might hope that he would be able to reach Yokohama without recording any delay in his journal; in which case, the many misadventures which had overtaken him since he left London would not seriously affect his journey.\nThe “Tankadere” entered the Straits of Fo-Kien, which separate the island of Formosa from the Chinese coast, in the small hours of the night, and crossed the Tropic of Cancer. The sea was very rough in the straits, full of eddies formed by the counter-currents, and the chopping waves broke her course, whilst it became very difficult to stand on deck.\nAt daybreak the wind began to blow hard again, and the heavens seemed to predict a gale. The barometer announced a speedy change, the mercury rising and falling capriciously; the sea also, in the south-east, raised long surges which indicated a tempest. The sun had set the evening before in a red mist, in the midst of the phosphorescent scintillations of the ocean.\nJohn Bunsby long examined the threatening aspect of the heavens, muttering indistinctly between his teeth. At last he said in a low voice to Mr. Fogg, “Shall I speak out to your honour?”\n“Of course.”\n“Well, we are going to have a squall.”\n“Is the wind north or south?” asked Mr. Fogg quietly.\n“South. Look! a typhoon is coming up.”\n“Glad it’s a typhoon from the south, for it will carry us forward.”\n“Oh, if you take it that way,” said John Bunsby, “I’ve nothing more to say.” John Bunsby’s suspicions were confirmed. At a less advanced season of the year the typhoon, according to a famous meteorologist, would have passed away like a luminous cascade of electric flame; but in the winter equinox it was to be feared that it would burst upon them with great violence.",

By evening, the Tankadere had made two hundred and twenty miles from Hong Kong, and Mr. Fogg had reason to hope that he would reach Yokohama without the misadventures affecting his schedule. He had faced the monsoon with success, but the typhoon was still to be apprehended. And, in fact, during the night, the boat entered the Straits of Fo-Kien, which separate the island of Formosa from the Chinese coast, and are always greatly disturbed by eddies and currents. The sea was very heavy, and the wind blew a gale, sometimes from the north-west, sometimes from the north-east. The Tankadere rolled fearfully, and the crew had difficulty in working the sails and in standing on deck. They were crossing the Tropic of Cancer, and the sea was very heavy, with counter-currents that made standing difficult. At daybreak the wind nearly became a hurricane, and there were fearful signs. The barometer was erratic, and indicated the approach of an atmospheric perturbation of great violence. The heavens were in a frightful condition, and it seemed as if the storm were brewing in the depths of the horizon. The previous sunset had been covered with a red mist, and the sea was phosphorescent, and the swell of the ocean very heavy. \"A squall is coming on,\" said John Bunsby. \"It is a typhoon.\" \"The wind is south-east?\" asked Mr. Fogg. \"Yes,\" replied Bunsby; \"but in the case of a typhoon, the wind often shifts suddenly, and with such violence that—\" \"Let it shift,\" said Mr. Fogg. \"Provided it pushes us along.\" John Bunsby did not like to admit that Mr. Fogg was right, for in such weather a shifting of the wind was dangerous. However, he saw that his employer was calm and did not appear disturbed by the danger, so he yielded to his fate. A typhoon in winter is not so much to be dreaded as in summer; but it is still very dangerous, and the opinion of the celebrated meteorologist, M. Mohn, of Christiania, is that it is a phenomenon which should be carefully studied.",

            "prefix-probing": "Meanwhile they were progressing famously, and John Bunsby was in high hope. The schooner, built for speed and handled by a master of the sea, cut through the waves with impressive agility. The northeast wind, which had been the source of so much anxiety and frustration in Hong Kong, now filled their sails perfectly, pushing the *Tankadère* steadily towards the Japanese coast. The sea was relatively calm, a stark contrast to the tumultuous conditions they had faced on the route to Hong Kong. Phileas Fogg sat on deck, impassive as ever, consulting his watch with mechanical regularity, seemingly as little affected by the motion of the small vessel as by the stationary comfort of his armchair at the Reform Club. Aouda, though still recovering from her recent ordeal, seemed invigorated by the fresh sea air and the promise of reaching a new shore. She often looked out at the vast expanse of the Pacific, occasionally exchanging a quiet word with Mr. Fogg or simply watching the porpoises play in the schooner's wake. Passepartout, relieved to be back on a moving ship after the brief, stressful interlude in Hong Kong, found himself enjoying the voyage. He conversed with Bunsby and his small crew, curious about their lives and the sea. Bunsby, a man of few words but profound nautical knowledge, would grunt his replies or point to a detail of the rigging or the horizon, his eyes constantly scanning the elements. He was clearly proud of his schooner and its performance, and he reassured Fogg that, barring unforeseen circumstances, they would make excellent time. The average speed maintained was well over nine knots, a respectable clip for a vessel of that size on such a long run. They left the countless islands and hidden dangers of the China Sea behind and ventured into the open Pacific, guided only by Bunsby's charts and the stars. The days were long and filled with the rhythmic sound of the waves against the hull and the wind in the sails. At night, under a sky thick with stars, the schooner felt like a tiny speck in an immense universe, yet it carried the fate of Phileas Fogg's colossal wager. Each mile gained was a step closer to Yokohama, then America, and finally, London. Bunsby calculated their position meticulously each day, and his estimates consistently confirmed their good progress. The hope that filled the captain was contagious, and even Fogg, though he showed no outward sign, must have felt the tide turning in his favour. The crucial delay in Hong Kong seemed less disastrous with each successful hour of sailing. The possibility of still making the connection in Yokohama, which had appeared so slim just days before, now began to seem like a genuine probability. The voyage became a race against time, measured not in hours or days, but in the precise coordinates traced across the charts. The determination of Fogg, the loyalty of Passepartout, the gentle presence of Aouda, and the skill of John Bunsby combined to make the small schooner a vessel of destiny, speeding across the world's largest ocean."

A single triangular sail, of strong canvas, was hoisted as a storm-jib, so as to hold the wind from behind. Then they waited.\nJohn Bunsby had requested his passengers to go below; but this imprisonment in so narrow a space, with little air, and the boat bouncing in the gale, was far from pleasant. Neither Mr. Fogg, Fix, nor Aouda consented to leave the deck.\nThe storm of rain and wind descended upon them towards eight o’clock. With but its bit of sail, the “Tankadere” was lifted like a feather by a wind, an idea of whose violence can scarcely be given. To compare her speed to four times that of a locomotive going on full steam would be below the truth.\nThe boat scudded thus northward during the whole day, borne on by monstrous waves, preserving always, fortunately, a speed equal to theirs. Twenty times she seemed almost to be submerged by these mountains of water which rose behind her; but the adroit management of the pilot saved her. The passengers were often bathed in spray, but they submitted to it philosophically. Fix cursed it, no doubt; but Aouda, with her eyes fastened upon her protector, whose coolness amazed her, showed herself worthy of him, and bravely weathered the storm. As for Phileas Fogg, it seemed just as if the typhoon were a part of his programme.\nUp to this time the “Tankadere” had always held her course to the north; but towards evening the wind, veering three quarters, bore down from the north-west. The boat, now lying in the trough of the waves, shook and rolled terribly; the sea struck her with fearful violence. At night the tempest increased in violence. John Bunsby saw the approach of darkness and the rising of the storm with dark misgivings. He thought awhile, and then asked his crew if it was not time to slacken speed. After a consultation he approached Mr. Fogg, and said, “I think, your honour, that we should do well to make for one of the ports on the coast.”\n“I think so too.”\n“Ah!” said the pilot. “But which one?”\n“I know of but one,” returned Mr. Fogg tranquilly.\n“And that is—”\n“Shanghai.”\nThe pilot, at first, did not seem to comprehend; he could scarcely realise so much determination and tenacity. Then he cried, “Well—yes! Your honour is right. To Shanghai!”\nSo the “Tankadere” kept steadily on her northward track.",

The rain fell in torrents, and the wind blew with hurricane force, coming from the north-west, and driving the Tankadere with a speed equal to that of a locomotive, and even more. If she had had all her sails set, she would have been carried away. But the little jib held her to the wind, and she kept on her course, keeping pace with the waves. The boat was often buried in the spray, but she always rose again. Several times she seemed almost submerged, and mountains of water rose behind her; but the pilot's skill saved her. The passengers were often drenched, but they bore it philosophically. Fix cursed the typhoon inwardly, Aouda watched Mr Fogg with admiration, and showed herself as brave as he. Mr Fogg, as calm as ever, did not seem to notice the storm. He looked upon it as an incident of the journey, which he had foreseen. Towards evening, the wind veered three quarters, and the sea became very high. The boat lay in the trough of the waves, and rolled fearfully. As darkness came on, the storm increased in violence. Bunsby was filled with dread. He consulted his crew, and then went to Mr Fogg, and said, \"Sir, I think we ought to put in somewhere.\" \"I think so too,\" said Mr Fogg. \"Where shall we put in?\" asked the pilot. \"Shanghai,\" said Mr Fogg. Bunsby was thunderstruck. He did not know what to say. He looked at Mr Fogg, who was as calm as ever. \"Shanghai!\" he cried. Then he looked at his compass, and saw that he was resolved to go on. \"Very well, sir,\" he said. \"We will go on.\" The pilot went back to his post, and directed the Tankadere back upon her northward course.",

            "prefix-probing": "The pilot took his precautions in advance. Navigating the Hooghly River, a notoriously tricky waterway leading from Calcutta to the vastness of the Bay of Bengal, demanded meticulous planning and an intimate knowledge of its ever-shifting currents and sandbars. Captain Balthazar, a man whose weathered face seemed etched with the wisdom of a thousand tidal shifts, stood on the bridge, his gaze sweeping across the complex confluence of river traffic – steamships, dhows, fishing boats, all vying for passage. He checked his charts again, even though he knew every depth and buoy marker by heart. The monsoon season, though not at its peak, still left the weather unpredictable; dark clouds loomed on the horizon, a constant reminder of the potential for sudden squalls that could churn the bay into a tempest in minutes. He consulted the tide tables, calculating the optimal window for departure, factoring in the draft of the 'Rangoon,' the steamer he was piloting out to the open sea this morning. A slight delay had already occurred due to loading issues downriver, and the passengers, particularly the Englishman Mr. Phileas Fogg, were known to be under considerable time pressure. Captain Balthazar felt the weight of responsibility; not just for the safety of the ship and its crew, but for ensuring a swift, unimpeded journey that would keep the steamer on schedule. He conversed briefly with the 'Rangoon's' own captain, confirming the route and expected conditions once they cleared the river mouth. The engines below deck hummed with readiness, the deckhands were coiled ropes and secured cargo, and a palpable sense of anticipation hung in the humid air. Balthazar felt the subtle sway of the ship as the tide began to strengthen. He ordered the final moorings to be cast off, his voice calm but firm, cutting through the clamour of the port. This stretch of river, he knew, was often more perilous than the open ocean, requiring unwavering concentration until the ship finally met the boundless, less forgiving expanse of the Bay of Bengal. Every sounding, every course correction, every glance at the compass was a measured step in the intricate dance of guiding the vessel safely from the bustling port to the freedom of the sea lane, a vital leg of a journey whose stakes, for at least one passenger on board, were incredibly high."

The waves rose like moving mountains in the inky blackness, crashing down upon the deck with a deafening roar. The wind shrieked through the rigging, tearing at the sails which, if they had not been prudently furled, would have been ripped to shreds. Every timber of the steamship *Henrietta* groaned in protest, a symphony of stressed wood and metal against the fury of the storm. Water poured over the bulwarks, swamping the deck, requiring constant bailing by the weary crew. Phileas Fogg remained, as ever, imperturbable. He sat in the cabin, occasionally consulting his watch, his face showing no trace of the anxiety that gripped his companions. Passepartout, however, was a study in abject terror. He clung to whatever was fixed, his eyes wide with fright, convinced that each tremendous lurch of the vessel would be their last. Poor Aouda, though showing more composure than the servant, was clearly apprehensive, her gaze fixed on Fogg, seeking reassurance from his unshakeable calm. Captain Speedy, usually gruff and defiant, was pacing the bridge, his face grim as he directed the helmsman and assessed the damage. The small vessel was utterly at the mercy of the elements, tossed about like a cork on the enraged sea. For hours, the ordeal continued, the darkness only amplifying the terror, the spray stinging their faces even within the relative shelter of the cabin. They seemed suspended between the raging abyss below and the tumultuous sky above, the dawn appearing a distant, perhaps unattainable, hope. Yet, through it all, the *Henrietta* stubbornly fought on, battling the ocean's wrath with desperate resilience, a testament to the builder's skill and the sheer force of will steering her through the tempest."

An excellent position, and, if the wind held, the steamer would reach the port by six o’clock. All were visibly sanguine. Mr. Fogg, to be sure, did not betray the least excitement; but Aouda confessed to the pilot more hope than she had ever felt before. As for Passepartout, he fairly glowed with pleasure, and chatted with the pilot, told him the history of Mr. Fogg’s journey, and congratulated him heartily on the great reward he was about to receive. The pilot Bunsby listened with a placid smile, and could not forbear now and then shaking his head with an air of doubt. And in fact, the wind, which had hitherto been in the south-east, and had been driving them forward at a most desirable speed, now veered and became an uncertain breeze from the south-west. The currents, too, were adverse, and instead of aiding the Tankadere, as was expected, they hindered her. It became necessary to resort to tacking, which lengthened the way; the coast, moreover, was indented with capes, which it was necessary to double, and the breeze as it came from the land, was broken by the obstacles upon the shore, and was besides exceedingly irregular. The Tankadere was a light craft, it is true, and with her great sails caught all the fitful gusts; but at eight o’clock, Bunsby reckoned that he had made but nine miles in three hours. At this rate, Mr. Fogg would not reach Shanghai until after midnight, and the steamer to Yokohama would consequently be gone. The worthy pilot grew anxious. Aouda was not less disturbed, though she evinced not her fear. Passepartout was beside himself, and wanted to help the sailors. He was on the point of addressing the pilot, when Mr. Fogg, cutting him short, requested Bunsby to be good enough to say how many miles he still had to make to reach Shanghai. The pilot calculated, and replied: “Twenty-two miles, Mr. Fogg.” “And we have been three hours doing nine.” “Yes, sir. And if this continues, we shall not get to Shanghai tomorrow afternoon.” “There is nothing to do but keep on,” said Mr. Fogg, quietly. The wind did not increase, and the Tankadere was not abundantly provided with auxiliary power, and there was no remedy. She was still twenty-two miles from Shanghai, when the Yokohama steamer left the port at the regular hour, that is, at seven in the evening. “There she goes!” cried Bunsby, giving a wild screech, and unfurling the signals to call attention to the Tankadere. “Boom!” went the little cannon, but the steamer, quickly as she was going, was already out of range. “Cut the halyards!” cried John Bunsby, in a rage. “No,” said Mr. Fogg, placidly. “Let them wave the flag at half-mast. That is a sign of distress. Perhaps the steamer will come back.” Bunsby, though beside himself with rage, hoisted the flag at half-mast. It was well known that Mr. Fogg was a gentleman of great resources. Perhaps the steamer would come back. At any rate, the cannon was loaded again, and fired, but with no more success than before.",

All sails were set, and the Tankadere merrily ploughed through the waves, which were now much less boisterous. By a little past noon, the boat was forty-five miles from Shanghai. An excellent position, and, if the wind held, the steamer would reach the port by six o’clock. All were visibly sanguine. Mr. Fogg, to be sure, did not betray the least excitement; but Aouda confessed to the pilot more hope than she had ever felt before. As for Passepartout, he fairly glowed with pleasure, and chatted with the pilot, told him the history of Mr. Fogg’s journey, and congratulated him heartily on the great reward he was about to receive. The pilot Bunsby listened with a placid smile, and could not forbear now and then shaking his head with an air of doubt. And in fact, the wind, which had hitherto been in the south-east, and had been driving them forward at a most desirable speed, now veered and became an uncertain breeze from the south-west. The currents, too, were adverse, and instead of aiding the Tankadere, as was expected, they hindered her. It became necessary to resort to tacking, which lengthened the way; the coast, moreover, was indented with capes, which it was necessary to double, and the breeze as it came from the land, was broken by the obstacles upon the shore, and was besides exceedingly irregular. The Tankadere was a light craft, it is true, and with her great sails caught all the fitful gusts; but at eight o’clock, Bunsby reckoned that he had made but nine miles in three hours. At this rate, Mr. Fogg would not reach Shanghai until after midnight, and the steamer to Yokohama would consequently be gone. The worthy pilot grew anxious. Aouda was not less disturbed, though she evinced not her fear. Passepartout was beside himself, and wanted to help the sailors. He was on the point of addressing the pilot, when Mr. Fogg, cutting him short, requested Bunsby to be good enough to say how many miles he still had to make to reach Shanghai.

For days, the *General Grant* had wrestled with a formidable gale off the coasts of Japan, waves like moving mountains assaulting her sides, the deck constantly awash with icy spray. Passengers had been confined below, battling nausea and the ship's violent pitching. But now, the fury had abated. The wind, which had shrieked through the rigging, softened to a gentle sigh. The enormous swells flattened into manageable undulations. The ship's motion became a smooth, rhythmic rise and fall. A palpable sense of relief spread through the vessel. Passepartout, who had spent the worst of the storm green-faced and miserable, ventured onto the deck, blinking in the returning sunlight. Aouda showed her gratitude for the cessation of the violent tossing. Mr. Fogg, ever unperturbed by the elements, merely consulted his watch and his log, noting the precise moment the speed began to improve. The crew, weary from their battle with the storm, worked with renewed vigour. The sails, which had been furled or reefed down, could be set to their full extent, catching the favourable breeze. The *General Grant* surged forward with a steadier, more confident stride across the vast Pacific. The sky cleared to a brilliant blue, the horizon reappeared, sharp and distinct. The oppressive grey of the storm clouds was replaced by scattered white puffballs. Gulls, which had vanished during the tempest, reappeared, circling the ship. This return to fair weather was more than just comfort; it was a blessing for their tight schedule. Every knot gained now meant a better chance of reaching San Francisco on time to catch the train east. Passepartout breathed deeply of the fresh, salty air, a faint smile replacing his recent grimace. America was still many days away, but the worst of the Pacific seemed, at least for the moment, behind them. The journey felt possible again."

She had on board a throng of passengers, among whom was none that interested the reader more than poor Passepartout, though it must be confessed he was not in a state to be greatly interested himself. Having been drugged by the detective Fix the previous evening, he had slept soundly, missing the crucial rendezvous with his master, Mr. Fogg, and thus missing the intended earlier vessel that Fogg had to take. Passepartout awoke aboard the speeding steamer only to find his head swimming and his pockets empty, having been relieved of his watch and some money by Fix during his stupor. The dreadful realization dawned upon him: he was on the correct ship bound for Japan, but he was utterly alone, separated from the eccentric and punctual master whom he had sworn to serve and follow around the world. He was without resources, without a plan, and adrift in a foreign sea, speeding towards an unknown land. A profound despair seized his soul. Where in the world was Mr. Fogg? Had he left without him? How could he possibly continue the journey, or even survive, penniless, in a country whose language he did not speak and whose customs were alien? The long days at sea were torture, filled with anxiety and regret. Finally, after a voyage of several days, the shores of Japan appeared on the horizon. The Carnatic entered the harbour of Yokohama, and Passepartout disembarked, a solitary, forlorn figure amidst the bustling crowd, utterly penniless and lost."

At least I have not missed the steamer, which is the most important thing.”\nThen, as Fix occurred to him: “As for that rascal, I hope we are well rid of him, and that he has not dared, as he proposed, to follow us on board the “Carnatic.” A detective on the track of Mr. Fogg, accused of robbing the Bank of England! Pshaw! Mr. Fogg is no more a robber than I am a murderer.”\nShould he divulge Fix’s real errand to his master? Would it do to tell the part the detective was playing? Would it not be better to wait until Mr. Fogg reached London again, and then impart to him that an agent of the metropolitan police had been following him round the world, and have a good laugh over it? No doubt; at least, it was worth considering. The first thing to do was to find Mr. Fogg, and apologise for his singular behaviour.\nPassepartout got up and proceeded, as well as he could with the rolling of the steamer, to the after-deck. He saw no one who resembled either his master or Aouda. “Good!” muttered he; “Aouda has not got up yet, and Mr. Fogg has probably found some partners at whist.”\nHe descended to the saloon. Mr. Fogg was not there. Passepartout had only, however, to ask the purser the number of his master’s state-room. The purser replied that he did not know any passenger by the name of Fogg.\n“I beg your pardon,” said Passepartout persistently. “He is a tall gentleman, quiet, and not very talkative, and has with him a young lady—”\n“There is no young lady on board,” interrupted the purser. “Here is a list of the passengers; you may see for yourself.”\nPassepartout scanned the list, but his master’s name was not upon it. All at once an idea struck him.\n“Ah! am I on the ‘Carnatic?’”\n“Yes.”\n“On the way to Yokohama?”\n“Certainly.”\nPassepartout had for an instant feared that he was on the wrong boat; but, though he was really on the “Carnatic,” his master was not there.\nHe fell thunderstruck on a seat. He saw it all now. He remembered that the time of sailing had been changed, that he should have informed his master of that fact, and that he had not done so. It was his fault, then, that Mr. Fogg and Aouda had missed the steamer. Yes, but it was still more the fault of the traitor who, in order to separate him from his master, and detain the latter at Hong Kong, had inveigled him into getting drunk! He now saw the detective’s trick; and at this moment Mr. Fogg was certainly ruined, his bet was lost, and he himself perhaps arrested and imprisoned! At this thought Passepartout tore his hair. Ah, if Fix ever came within his reach, what a settling of accounts there would be!",

That the detective was tracking him? Mr. Fogg knew that already. And that he had lent me his help in getting drunk? It is true that the fellow’s object was to separate me from my master, and prevent Mr. Fogg from leaving Hong Kong. But Mr. Fogg would have gone in spite of him, and would have been here by this time. At the worst, I can tell Mr. Fogg that the agent of police, whom he knew, was on board, and shall see what he thinks of the matter. But, no; perhaps it would be better not to say anything about it. If I were to tell him of Fix’s conduct, it would alarm him; and, besides, it would put him on the scent of this affair of the bank robbery, and he would perhaps think that the detective was on his track on that account. And, then, Mr. Fogg is so proud and self-contained that it is impossible to make him understand anything; and, with his ideas, he would perhaps think that the whole thing was a joke. I will wait till we get to London, and then I will tell him all. It will be a good joke to tell him how the detective followed him all round the world, and how I helped the detective to get drunk.”\n\nWhile thus soliloquizing, he had reached the forward part of the steamer, and, looking over the side, he saw that the vessel was under full steam. “Good,” said he; “we are going at a good rate.”\n\nHe then went to the after part of the vessel, and looked about for Mr. Fogg and Aouda. He did not see them. “Mr. Fogg is probably in his cabin,” said he; “and as for the young lady, she is no doubt asleep.”\n\nHe went down to the saloon, and saw that it was full of passengers. He looked for Mr. Fogg, but did not see him. He then went to the cabins, and knocked at the door of the one which he supposed to be Mr. Fogg’s. No answer. He knocked again, but still no answer. He then opened the door, and saw that the cabin was empty. He went to the next cabin, and knocked, but no answer. He went to the next, and the next, and so on, till he had gone through all the cabins. They were all empty.\n\n“This is very strange,” said he to himself. “Mr. Fogg is not in his cabin, nor is the young lady. Where can they be?”\n\nHe went back to the saloon, and asked the purser if he knew where Mr. Fogg’s cabin was.\n\n“Mr. Fogg?” said the purser; “I do not know any passenger of that name.”\n\n“Excuse me, sir,” said Passepartout; “he is a gentleman, very tall, with a fair complexion, and a light moustache. He is accompanied by a young lady.”\n\n“There is no passenger answering to that description on board,” said the purser.\n\n“But there must be,” said Passepartout; “he is Mr. Fogg, and he is going to Yokohama.”\n\n“I tell you there is no such passenger on board,” said the purser. “Here is the list of passengers; you can examine it.”\n\nPassepartout took the list, and examined it carefully.

            "prefix-probing": "“It is evident,” said he to himself, “that I have been abominably drunk! To miss the Carnatic! And at this hour!” He rose, dressed himself, and quitted the hotel. His brain was clear, but his rage was terrible, cold, and condensed. The ship had sailed four hours before. He was out of time, and he felt certain who was responsible. It was that detective, Fix! He had recognized him on the Mongolia, and knew instinctively that the man was following him. Now he understood: Fix had drugged him, incapacitating him just long enough to miss the connecting steamer, the one crucial link in his tight schedule. His plan, so meticulously constructed, had been shattered by the connivance of this agent of the law. Yet, Phileas Fogg was not a man given to outward displays of emotion. The cold fury that consumed him was hidden beneath his usual impassive mask. Time was lost, precious time, but he must retrieve it. His first thought was of Aouda. He returned to the hotel to find her. He found her awake, anxious, and ready. “We must find another means of passage,” he informed her, his voice betraying nothing of the turmoil within. “The Carnatic has sailed.” Aouda, who had implicitly placed her fate in his hands, did not question him. She simply gathered her things, ready to accompany him wherever he went. Fogg did not waste a second on recriminations or despair. His mind was already assessing the possibilities, calculating routes, and considering every available vessel in the harbour. Hong Kong was an important port, but finding a ship specifically bound for Yokohama, and one that would sail immediately, was not a simple matter. He spent the morning scouring the docks, visiting shipping offices, and questioning captains. Everywhere he met with disappointment. Ships were bound for various destinations, but none for Japan that would depart in time to keep him on schedule. The clock was ticking relentlessly. Each hour lost made the impossible task of winning his wager even more improbable. Yet, his determination did not waver. He refused to admit defeat. He even contemplated chartering a vessel, no matter the cost, but even private ships available for hire were scarce and unsuitable for the long Pacific crossing. Just when hope seemed at its lowest ebb, he learned of a small schooner, the Tankadere, a fast boat used for pilot services, that was due to sail that very evening for Shanghai. Shanghai was not Yokohama, but it was a step in the right direction. From Shanghai, perhaps he could find a ship bound for the American coast, skipping the Japan leg altogether, or at least find faster passage across the Pacific. It was a risky deviation, one that added uncertainty to his already precarious journey, but it was the only viable option. He quickly secured passage for himself and Aouda on the Tankadere. The captain, John Bunsby, a sturdy old seaman, agreed to take them on board, primarily interested in Fogg's offer of a generous sum. Fogg did not haggle over the price; speed and certainty were his only concerns. With Aouda and Passepartout’s share of the money (assuming Passepartout was indeed gone, perhaps also a victim of Fix, or worse, in league with him – Fogg’s thoughts briefly touched on this, though he dismissed it as unlikely given Passepartout’s nature), they boarded the schooner, ready to leave Hong Kong behind, along with the bitter taste of treachery and missed connections. The unexpected delay had cost him valuable time, pushed his schedule to the brink, and confirmed his suspicion of the relentless, cunning adversary who pursued him. But Phileas Fogg, though inconvenienced and angered, was not defeated. His resolve hardened; he would find a way to regain the lost ground. The wager was still on."

This quarter occupied, with its streets, squares, docks, and warehouses, all the space between the “promontory of the Treaty” and the river. Here, as at Hong Kong and Calcutta, were mixed crowds of all races, Americans and English, Chinamen and Dutchmen, mostly merchants ready to buy or sell anything.

This is an important port of call in the Pacific, where all the great steam-vessels between China, America, Japan, and the Malay Islands touch. This city, which is at once a commercial town and a seaport, is situated on the Bay of Yeddo, and but a short distance from that second capital of the Japanese Empire, formerly the residence of the Tycoon, and now that of the Mikado. The “Carnatic” anchored at the quay near the custom-house, in the midst of a crowd of ships bearing the flags of all nations. Passepartout recognized some American and French vessels, those of the Packet-Boats of the Pacific, and, near them, the steamer Henry IV., with which he had been twinned in the dock at Hong Kong. As soon as the gangway was lowered, Passepartout hastened ashore, for he knew that he ought to do so, and that the Hong Kong difficulty was now happily past. He had no idea how he was going to find his master, and, before attempting to search for him, he resolved to wander around the city. He found himself at first in an utterly European quarter, with low houses, ornamented with verandas, and having on their fronts the charming originality of Japanese architecture. This district occupied, between the promontory of the Treaty and the river, a large number of streets, squares, docks, and warehouses, and everything in it had a prosperous air, worthy of London or Liverpool. In the midst of the town, also, Passepartout observed some genuine Japanese streets, where there was a perfect swarming of almond-eyed and yellow-skinned inhabitants, wearing coats of silk, long tunics, and frequently crape. He saw also some Bhuttes, with their conical hats, and priests, who went about singing and beating resounding tambourines. There were soldiers, too—silent, unmoving—in cotton clothing, carrying swords of fine temper; and finally, beggars, monks, and long-haired people, who seemed to be half caste between the human and monkey races. Passepartout gazed upon all this living picture, with eyes and mouth wide open, and it seemed to him that he was in the land of the “Arabian Nights.” The crowd, however, with the exception of the European types, were carrying on business in their own way, in quaint-looking shops, the interiors of which a juggler would not disdain for a stage. These shops were like stalls at a fair, and were piled with all sorts of second-hand goods—trumpery Japanese curiosities, porcelain, puffed rice, mixed with charcoal—crackers, revolvers, of which the barrels and locks were of copper, and finally, provisions of all sorts, of which he dared not ask the use or origin. He saw the barbers, who are the most important people in Japan, operating upon the black heads of their customers, and kneading their chins with a horrible ointment. He met with palanquins, carried by porters, and drawn by horses, with one single shaft, in the rear, like the shafts of our wheelbarrows. Finally, he beheld the famous jinrikishas—light carriages, imported from America, with two wheels, and drawn, like a hackney-coach, by a man, upon salary. A good number of these vehicles were manoeuvring in the streets, and Passepartout would have been by no means disinclined to take a trip in one, had he been less preoccupied by the thought of his master. As he was strolling along without any definite object, he at last came to the docks. There he saw a number of fine steamers, of French, Dutch, English, and American nationality, besides the war-vessels of these various powers. Passepartout experienced a moment of lively emotion on beholding some English flags, and he began to search among the crews and officers, who were either on the decks or the quays. But he recognized no one. Passepartout then entered the European quarter, and passed along the delightful promenade of the Bund, where were the banks, the warehouses, and the magazines. As he walked, he met some Frenchmen and Englishmen, to whom he would have been very glad to speak, but he did not dare to do so, as he was quite ignorant of English. In fact, either from bashfulness or lack of knowledge, he called out to no one. At the expiration of an hour or two, Passepartout found that he had gone over the entire city, without having met a single person of whom he was in search. It is true, that Fix, if he had been in Yokohama, would have been the last man with whom he would have wished to meet. Passepartout felt thoroughly discouraged, and began to despair of finding Mr. Fogg. With head down, he wandered about, aimlessly dropping into the seamen’s taverns, and gazing into the grog-shops, which were crowded with sailors of all nationalities—English, French, American, Dutch, Indian. These fellows were singing, fighting, drinking, and smoking, and it seemed as if they had neither country nor master, nor home, nor God. Passepartout passed by them, without being so much as perceived, and he felt as lonely as if he had been in the midst of the Desert of Sahara. Anacharsis Cloots’ idea of a human species was doubtless realised in Yokohama, if not in the whole world. It occurred to Passepartout that he had better avail himself of the resources of the city, and, of the country as well. This enterprising young man, who had formerly been a valet de chambre, then dancer, was not at all abashed before a foreign public. He knew that since his old grandmother’s time, the Japanese were passionately fond of acrobatic feats. He therefore resolved to offer his services as an acrobat to some manager in the Japanese theatrical world.",

Fogg’s primary concern was immediately securing passage on the steamer bound for San Francisco, the next crucial leg of his incredible journey. Without delay, he headed directly to the offices of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, maintaining his characteristic composure and precision. Aouda, ever observant and grateful, remained silently by his side, adapting remarkably well to the strange new world around them. Meanwhile, Passepartout, recovered and curious, was distracted from logistics. The exotic sights and sounds of Yokohama captivated him. He wandered off freely, eager to explore the city. This wandering led him towards the less respectable districts, a predictable course for the adventurous valet. This separation created an immediate complication. Fogg, ascertaining the next ship, the 'General Grant,' would not sail for several days, found unexpected time he instantly dedicated to finding his missing servant. Continuing the journey without Passepartout was unthinkable, despite his usual demeanour. He enlisted Aouda's help, and together they began a systematic search through the port city streets. Their search, however, proved more difficult than anticipated, as Passepartout had stumbled into an unusual predicament."

But he shrank from telling the story of his adventures, intimately connected as it was with that of his master; and, before doing so, he determined to exhaust all other means of aid. As chance did not favour him in the European quarter, he penetrated that inhabited by the native Japanese, determined, if necessary, to push on to Yeddo.\nThe Japanese quarter of Yokohama is called Benten, after the goddess of the sea, who is worshipped on the islands round about. There Passepartout beheld beautiful fir and cedar groves, sacred gates of a singular architecture, bridges half hid in the midst of bamboos and reeds, temples shaded by immense cedar-trees, holy retreats where were sheltered Buddhist priests and sectaries of Confucius, and interminable streets, where a perfect harvest of rose-tinted and red-cheeked children, who looked as if they had been cut out of Japanese screens, and who were playing in the midst of short-legged poodles and yellowish cats, might have been gathered.\nThe streets were crowded with people. Priests were passing in processions, beating their dreary tambourines; police and custom-house officers with pointed hats encrusted with lac and carrying two sabres hung to their waists; soldiers, clad in blue cotton with white stripes, and bearing guns; the Mikado’s guards, enveloped in silken doubles, hauberks and coats of mail; and numbers of military folk of all ranks—for the military profession is as much respected in Japan as it is despised in China—went hither and thither in groups and pairs. Passepartout saw, too, begging friars, long-robed pilgrims, and simple civilians, with their warped and jet-black hair, big heads, long busts, slender legs, short stature, and complexions varying from copper-colour to a dead white, but never yellow, like the Chinese, from whom the Japanese widely differ. He did not fail to observe the curious equipages—carriages and palanquins, barrows supplied with sails, and litters made of bamboo; nor the women—whom he thought not especially handsome—who took little steps with their little feet, whereon they wore canvas shoes, straw sandals, and clogs of worked wood, and who displayed tight-looking eyes, flat chests, teeth fashionably blackened, and gowns crossed with silken scarfs, tied in an enormous knot behind an ornament which the modern Parisian ladies seem to have borrowed from the dames of Japan.\n",

As chance had brought him into the Japanese quarter of the town, he entered a tea-house, and went in, with the air of a person as much at home as possible. He found himself in a low-roofed room, with mats for flooring, and supplied with a few cushions, on which sat some natives drinking saké or rice-beer from porcelain cups. A few delicate-looking screens, of fanciful design, and great richness, were in the corners. Passepartout bowed profoundly to the company, and then seated himself on a mat, indicating to the waitress, who forthwith made her appearance, that he wanted something to eat. She brought him in a box-like convenience, divided into several compartments, in which were rice, fish, and some succulent plants, the whole seasoned with kararaski, a strong condiment made from mustard and vegetables. He ate heartily, and, having paid his score by a few pieces of silver he had about him, he left the tea-house. He wandered through the streets, his eyes and nose on the alert. He found himself in the Benten quarter, where the theatres are, and beheld some astonishing performances by tumblers and jugglers. The Japanese make curious acrobats. They are of supple, but not muscular build, and are able to perform the most singular feats with equilibrium. One, for example, would balance himself on two bamboos, on the edge of a running fan; another would walk on a wire or a thread, with a spinning top attached to his toe; others, again, would juggle with several tops at once; and some would even perform the celebrated feat of the butterflies, using only the breath of their lungs. Passepartout saw others, on a plate, turn around a lighted candle, and, with the help of a mirror, make it appear to be extinguished at a thousand different points. The spectacle was not uninteresting, and the worthy Passepartout was on the point of giving way to his natural jollity, but, remembering that he was out of work, he set about seriously searching for it. He walked from the Japanese quarter, and came to the port. He saw some thirty vessels at anchor, among which were American, English, and French men-of-war, and commercial steamers of all flags. He inquired about the steamers going to America, and found that the \"General Grant,\" of the Pacific Mail Company, was to leave for San Francisco the next day. There were no less than ten departures a month of the vessels of this company, which run between Yokohama, San Francisco, and Hong Kong. Passepartout felt a ray of hope. If his master could but cross that great expanse of sea, he would be safe! But, as he was penniless, he could not take his passage, nor even ask for information about the fare. He was quite discouraged, and was about to give up all hope, when he saw an advertisement for an acrobat troupe, who were to go to America with their performance. He read the name of the company, which was \"The Long Noses,\" and found that they were going to San Francisco by the next steamer. He said to himself, \"This is my chance! I will offer myself to this troupe. They are probably in need of a servant or an assistant. At any rate, I shall get to America, and I will manage the rest there.\" He went to the address indicated, and found a troupe of Japanese, whose heads were covered with long, flowing hair. Their chief, named Batulcar, received him in a most polite manner, and invited him to sit down on a mat. Passepartout explained to him that he was a French servant, out of place, and that he was looking for work.

That is a great advantage. Will you accept to accompany us?\" Passepartout was delighted. He accepted immediately, and Batulcar explained to him that he would have to assist in the performances, and that he would be paid in proportion to his services.

Beautiful firs and cedars, sacred gates of a singular architecture, picturesque bridges among the bamboo, shaded temples, and peaceful retreats, were scattered here and there among the narrow streets, where a crowd of children, with red cheeks and in gay costumes, were playing in the midst of small poodles and cats, which had a meditative air. The streets were full of people of all classes, priests in long robes, proceeding in processions, beating tambourines; officers of police and customs, with two sabres in their belts, and an imposing air; soldiers in blue cotton uniforms, with white stripes; the Mikado’s guards, with their silk and mail coats, and a species of cuirass; and numbers of military folk of all ranks—for in Japan the military profession is as much considered as it is despised in China. There were begging friars, long-haired, and carrying a sort of rosary; pilgrims, in conical hats, of lacquered paper; and ordinary civilians, with their black hair, half-shaved, and gathered in a tuft on the top of the head, with large heads, long busts, slender legs, and short stature—a race which M. Edmond About justly compares to the caricatures of the Japanese drawn by their own artists. Passepartout walked about among this crowd, observing the curious and fantastic types, and seeing with wonder the shops, filled with all sorts of Japanese trinkets, the restaurants, ornamented with streamers and banners, the tea-houses, where they were drinking the hot beverage with saké, or rice-beer. He saw also the public-houses, where he might have found a bed, but for the exorbitant price asked for it. He noticed carriages, palanquins, barrows with sails, and bamboo litters; and, finally, women—whom he did not find particularly handsome—with their eyes half shut, their cheeks painted, their mouths without colour, their teeth blackened, their chests flat, and their bodies long and slender. They were dressed in silk kimonos, with a broad sash tied at the back, which to a Parisian taste did not seem to be an improvement on the original costume. Passepartout, who had been in the European quarter, was struck with the difference between the two populations. He had left a town of merchants and sailors, and he found himself in a town of soldiers and priests. He had seen the English and French, the Dutch and Americans, and he saw now the Japanese, with their peculiar features, their singular costumes, and their strange customs. He had seen the European women, with their fair complexions, their light hair, and their graceful figures, and he saw now the Japanese women, with their dark complexions, their black hair, and their flat chests. He had seen the European houses, with their regular architecture, their large windows, and their comfortable interiors, and he saw now the Japanese houses, with their irregular architecture, their small windows, and their bare interiors. In short, he was in a new world, and he was so absorbed in his observations, that he forgot for a moment his sad situation.",

But this step could not be taken, till he had ascertained that Passepartout did not embark in the Carnatic, and it was now too late to make the inquiry. The steamer was at sea. Mr. Fogg repaired to the agency of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, and ascertained that the Carnatic had sailed the previous evening for San Francisco, and that Passepartout had not been among the passengers. This was only too evident. Phileas Fogg and Aouda were consequently left in Japan. Mr. Fogg, thus decided, directed his steps towards the French consulate, and there found the required information. The French consul, M. Simon, was in fact able to ascertain the fate of the worthy Passepartout. Mr. Fogg, after thanking the consul, and begging him to notify the police, went to the English consulate, where he received no information concerning his servant. While a search was being set on foot, Mr. Fogg and Aouda went towards the foreign quarter. This was a sort of street or wide square, containing dwelling-houses and warehouses, imported from Europe, as in Shanghai and Hong Kong. The whole was shaded by fine large trees. In the rear stood the town proper, with its tortuous streets, its houses with low, sombre gables, and the everlasting crowd which ebbs and flows through them. Mr. Fogg and Aouda walked through the public thoroughfares, Phileas Fogg, with his habitual composure, not betraying by a single sign the trouble he was in. He had spent a part of the day in the foreign quarter, and was now walking along the port. Aouda, with a sweet feminine grace, thanked him repeatedly for what he was doing for her. He simply replied that it was 'nothing.' To him, this trip was purely executory; he was simply attending to a programme that had to be carried out. What interested him was not the Aouda but the return. As he was thus walking, he observed some Japanese following a placard which a sort of clown was carrying. The clown, a long, lean, flexible fellow, was capering and making grimaces, and his performance, which was excellent, was evidently appreciated by the spectators. Mr. Fogg, followed by Aouda, ascended the narrow street which opened upon the port. While he was going up, he saw the placard, and was able to read the words 'Long Noses' in large letters. He saw also the clown, who was making his way through the crowd. This clown was Passepartout."

He went on till he found himself in the fields, in the midst of vast rice plantations. There he saw dazzling camellias expanding themselves, with flowers which were giving forth their last colours and perfumes, not on bushes, but on trees, and within bamboo enclosures, cherry, plum, and apple trees, which the Japanese cultivate rather for their blossoms than their fruit, and which queerly-fashioned, grinning scarecrows protected from the sparrows, pigeons, ravens, and other voracious birds. On the branches of the cedars were perched large eagles; amid the foliage of the weeping willows were herons, solemnly standing on one leg; and on every hand were crows, ducks, hawks, wild birds, and a multitude of cranes, which the Japanese consider sacred, and which to their minds symbolise long life and prosperity.\nAs he was strolling along, Passepartout espied some violets among the shrubs.\n“Good!” said he; “I’ll have some supper.”\nBut, on smelling them, he found that they were odourless.\n“No chance there,” thought he.\nThe worthy fellow had certainly taken good care to eat as hearty a breakfast as possible before leaving the “Carnatic;” but, as he had been walking about all day, the demands of hunger were becoming importunate. He observed that the butchers stalls contained neither mutton, goat, nor pork; and, knowing also that it is a sacrilege to kill cattle, which are preserved solely for farming, he made up his mind that meat was far from plentiful in Yokohama—nor was he mistaken; and, in default of butcher’s meat, he could have wished for a quarter of wild boar or deer, a partridge, or some quails, some game or fish, which, with rice, the Japanese eat almost exclusively. But he found it necessary to keep up a stout heart, and to postpone the meal he craved till the following morning. Night came, and Passepartout re-entered the native quarter, where he wandered through the streets, lit by vari-coloured lanterns, looking on at the dancers, who were executing skilful steps and boundings, and the astrologers who stood in the open air with their telescopes. Then he came to the harbour, which was lit up by the resin torches of the fishermen, who were fishing from their boats.\nThe streets at last became quiet, and the patrol, the officers of which, in their splendid costumes, and surrounded by their suites, Passepartout thought seemed like ambassadors, succeeded the bustling crowd. Each time a company passed, Passepartout chuckled, and said to himself: “Good! another Japanese embassy departing for Europe!”",

He went along from the native quarter to the European, and, without perceiving it, found himself in the fields. There he saw magnificent rice-fields in full bloom, and radiantly-flowering camellias, forming little copses, and blooming on cherry, plum, and apple trees, which the Japanese cultivate rather for their flowers than for their fruit, and which figure largely in their landscapes, guarded by awkward-looking scarecrows. He met with some fine eagles on the cedars, herons standing solemnly on one leg in the marshy streams, wild ducks and teal, hawks, open-billed storks, and a great number of crows. On a branch of a tree he espied a pheasant, which he would have gladly shot, a proceeding, however, which the most highly-polished Englishman would have been scandalised at, and which the Japanese themselves make no account of, saving when the sport is indulged in by the Emperor. The crows in question struck Passepartout as exceedingly familiar, and perched quite near to the passers-by, proving that they were either favoured birds, or else, by reason of some superstition, were unafraid of men.

They have the same difference for him, thought he, as for the Japanese: he is not sacred, but he is hunted. Passepartout passed along by streams and over a number of little bridges, noting here and there a few violets in bloom, but scentless, this being one of the peculiarities of Japan, which, though it boasts a flora as rich as that of Europe, does not excel in fragrance. He sniffed at them from politeness, but they had no smell. In the country Passepartout was tormented by hunger. He had left the Aretusa, which was being victualled, a few hours before, and had eaten nothing since morning. He, however, found nothing edible. He might, indeed, have had recourse to the butcher’s stalls, but he would not find there either mutton, goat, or pork, though there was beef, which is used only for farming, and is considered sacred.

As night came on, Passepartout re-entered the native quarter. The streets were lit up with multi-coloured lanterns, and were gay with singers, dancers, and players. The astrologers were at their posts on the squares and at the street corners, and were doing a thriving business with their telescopes. Passepartout felt a great longing for some supper, and he saw some savoury dishes being carried from the restaurants, but he had no money in his pocket, and he could only look on at the dainty viands as they disappeared down the throats of the hungry natives.

The hours wore on. Where were Mr. Fogg and Mr. Fix? Had they left without him? He had lost his master and his companions. His small purse contained only a few yen – barely enough for a meal. He needed to find them, and quickly. He tried asking people, showing gestures, but no one understood his French. He wandered towards the port, hoping to see them disembarking from the *Carnatic*, but neither figure was in sight amongst the bustling activity. Despair began to creep in. How could he possibly survive in this strange land with no money and no contacts? He realised he couldn't just wander indefinitely. He needed food and shelter; he needed to earn money, somehow. The idea of finding work, any work, began to form in his mind. He was strong, willing, and adaptable, or so he told himself. As he continued his aimless trek, he came upon a group of people gathered around a makeshift stage in a public square. There were acrobats, jugglers, and musicians. It was the celebrated Japanese troupe of Mr. Batulcar. Passepartout stopped, drawn by the spectacle and perhaps a flicker of hope. He saw the performers, many of them Westerners, looking tired but determined. An idea struck him. He approached the leader, Mr. Batulcar. With gestures and the few words he knew, he indicated his plight and his willingness to work. Batulcar, assessing the sturdy physique of the Frenchman, seemed to understand; he needed strong men for some of the pyramid acts and lifts. A deal was quickly struck – food and lodging, in exchange for joining the troupe as an acrobat. So it was that Passepartout, the next day, found himself in a strange costume, practicing balancing acts. It was hard work, physically demanding, often humiliating, but it provided him with food and lodging. He performed in the squares and gardens of Yokohama with the troupe, balancing on human pyramids, tumbling, and attempting feats of strength. He, the former valet of Phileas Fogg, was now a public entertainer. He kept a constant eye out for his master or Mr. Fix, hoping they might pass by and recognise him amidst the spectacle, a most unexpected turn of events in his extraordinary journey around the world."

He knew several French and English songs, and resolved to try them upon the Japanese, who must be lovers of music, since they were for ever pounding on their cymbals, tam-tams, and tambourines, and could not but appreciate European talent.\nIt was, perhaps, rather early in the morning to get up a concert, and the audience prematurely aroused from their slumbers, might not possibly pay their entertainer with coin bearing the Mikado’s features. Passepartout therefore decided to wait several hours; and, as he was sauntering along, it occurred to him that he would seem rather too well dressed for a wandering artist. The idea struck him to change his garments for clothes more in harmony with his project; by which he might also get a little money to satisfy the immediate cravings of hunger. The resolution taken, it remained to carry it out.\nIt was only after a long search that Passepartout discovered a native dealer in old clothes, to whom he applied for an exchange. The man liked the European costume, and ere long Passepartout issued from his shop accoutred in an old Japanese coat, and a sort of one-sided turban, faded with long use.

The railway had abruptly terminated at Kholby, but the jungle, impassable by ordinary means in the time available, could be traversed with the aid of this noble beast. It was an unforeseen expense, certainly – two thousand pounds was a considerable sum, even for Mr. Fogg – but time was of the essence, and this elephant, large and powerful, seemed perfectly capable of maintaining the necessary speed. Kiouni, the guide had called him. A good name, suggesting reliability. Mr. Fogg adjusted his cravat, his gaze fixed on the preparations. Passepartout, though initially dismayed by the abrupt halt of the train and the prospect of an elephant ride, was now watching the mahout with an air of fascinated curiosity, his earlier apprehension replaced by the sheer novelty of the situation. Mr. Fogg, however, felt no novelty, only calculation. The distance to Allahabad was roughly fifty miles. At an average speed of eight miles per hour, factoring in necessary brief halts, they should arrive within six hours. The next train to Calcutta would depart shortly after their projected arrival. The connection was tight, but feasible. This detour, while disruptive to the meticulously planned route, presented an alternative that fit within the overall timetable. The railway officials had been apologetic, explaining the incomplete section of track, but their regrets were irrelevant to Mr. Fogg. Facts were what mattered, and the fact was that the railway ended here. An alternative *must* be found. And an alternative *had* been found. The elephant. It was logical. It was efficient under the circumstances. The additional cost was a variable easily absorbed. The journey was not derailed, merely adjusted. He consulted his notebook, confirming the distance and the required speed. Everything added up. Yes, ‘good’ was the precisely correct assessment of the situation. The delay, though regrettable, was minimal, and the chosen method of transport, while unusual, offered a means to regain the lost time, or at least prevent further slippage. The mahout, perched on the elephant's head, gave a sharp cry. It was time to depart. Mr. Fogg nodded, his expression one of calm assurance. The great beast lowered itself, a vast, patient mountain of muscle and hide, ready to receive its unusual passengers. Passepartout, with a mixture of trepidation and excitement, prepared to mount. Mr. Fogg followed, his movement precise and unhurried, as always."

That gentleman was a sort of Barnum, the director of a troupe of mountebanks, jugglers, clowns, acrobats, equilibrists, and gymnasts, who, according to the placard, was giving his last performances before leaving the Empire of the Sun for the States of the Union.\nPassepartout entered and asked for Mr. Batulcar, who straightway appeared in person.\n“What do you want?” said he to Passepartout, whom he at first took for a native.\n“Would you like a servant, sir?” asked Passepartout.\n“A servant!” cried Mr. Batulcar, caressing the thick grey beard which hung from his chin. “I already have two who are obedient and faithful, have never left me, and serve me for their nourishment and here they are,” added he, holding out his two robust arms, furrowed with veins as large as the strings of a bass-viol.\n“So I can be of no use to you?”\n“None.”\n“The devil! I should so like to cross the Pacific with you!”\n“Ah!” said the Honourable Mr. Batulcar. “You are no more a Japanese than I am a monkey!

Well, if I can’t take you as a servant, I can as a clown. You see, my friend, in France they exhibit foreign clowns, and in foreign parts French clowns.”\n“Ah!”\n“You are pretty strong, eh?”\n“Especially after a good meal.”\n“And you can sing?”\n“Yes,” returned Passepartout, who had formerly been wont to sing in the streets.\n“But can you sing standing on your head, with a top spinning on your left foot, and a sabre balanced on your right?”\n“Humph! I think so,” replied Passepartout, recalling the exercises of his younger days.\n“Well, that’s enough,” said the Honourable William Batulcar.\nThe engagement was concluded there and then.\nPassepartout had at last found something to do.

The show was about to begin. On the platforms and parquet were many natives in variegated costumes, some of whom were beating drums, others blowing trumpets, and others producing discords on a kind of banjo.The performers were in the open air, on a wide square stage. The performance was acrobatic and pantomimic. Passepartout, with his hands in his pockets, felt a tender curiosity as he gazed at these mountebanks, whose contortions were often mingled with real grace.There was a ring of men and women dressed in silk and brocade, with their faces fantastically painted, and a great length of hair dressed up on the top of their heads with metallic pins and tortoiseshell combs. They performed evolutions with wonderful bamboo poles, balancing themselves, or spinning around on top of them with surprising dexterity.There were also others who performed balancing feats with top-spinning, with the cigarette and fan tricks, and other jugglers.There were clowns, too, with white faces, singularly agile and elastic. One of them, the one who had guided Passepartout, was particularly clever. His strength of limb was prodigious, and his stiffness and suppleness seemed to be combined in him.It was plain, at any rate, that this Japanese troupe was highly skilled, and, in his own language, they were 'first-class.'Passepartout found himself filled with admiration.The performance ended at half-past eleven with a grand finale of balancing on the top of a pile of persons, which Passepartout felt like joining himself, he was so carried away by his enthusiasm.The Japanese orchestra, with its clangour of cymbals and drums, accompanied the whole with a deafening din.Passepartout had watched with intense interest; his thoughts had run away to his younger days, when he too had been a mountebank.

The charm of his earlier visit with Mr. Fogg was gone, replaced by crushing isolation. He was hungry, exhausted, alone, and penniless in the sprawling, foreign city.\n\nHis disastrous circus performance attempt gnawed at him. He'd hoped to earn passage money by joining a troupe for a ridiculous human pyramid act that collapsed. The clown, a fellow performer, vanished after they received a pittance for their efforts. Passepartout's pocket held only worthless coins.\n\nAnxiety for Mr. Fogg consumed him. Had his master reached the Carnatic? The ship was bound for America, the next vital stage. But Passepartout didn't know the port location or if the vessel had sailed. The thought of being left behind was unbearable. Every moment felt like a lifetime, the distance between them growing vast.\n\nHe wandered through the bustling quarter, the vibrant life a stark contrast to his despair. Tea houses, market stalls, and workshops offered no comfort. He tried asking locals for help, repeating \"Fogg\" and \"Carnatic,\" but met only incomprehension. The language barrier was absolute. Self-reproach burned; his carelessness led him here. His failures in India and Hong Kong seemed minor now.\n\nHe sank onto a cold stone bench. The sharp evening air seeped through his worn clothes. He buried his face in his hands, crushed by his situation. He felt like a complete failure, a hindrance to the wager. But then he looked up. Towards the harbor, faint lights and dark masts were visible against the night sky. That was his only hope. The docks. He had to get there. Perhaps amidst the port activity, he might find someone who knew about the Carnatic.\n\nWith desperate resolve, he stood, ignoring aching legs. He breathed deeply, smelling salt and the city. He straightened his shoulders. He would walk to the harbor. He had to find Mr. Fogg. The wager's fate, his master's honour, his own future depended on it. He set off through the unfamiliar, teeming streets, determination a fragile light against the darkness, driven solely by the imperative to return to the impossible journey."

Passepartout, though he had not been able to study or rehearse a part, was designated to lend the aid of his sturdy shoulders in the great exhibition of the “human pyramid,” executed by the Long Noses of the god Tingou. This “great attraction” was to close the performance.\nBefore three o’clock the large shed was invaded by the spectators, comprising Europeans and natives, Chinese and Japanese, men, women and children, who precipitated themselves upon the narrow benches and into the boxes opposite the stage. The musicians took up a position inside, and were vigorously performing on their gongs, tam-tams, flutes, bones, tambourines, and immense drums.\nThe performance was much like all acrobatic displays; but it must be confessed that the Japanese are the first equilibrists in the world.\nOne, with a fan and some bits of paper, performed the graceful trick of the butterflies and the flowers; another traced in the air, with the odorous smoke of his pipe, a series of blue words, which composed a compliment to the audience; while a third juggled with some lighted candles, which he extinguished successively as they passed his lips, and relit again without interrupting for an instant his juggling. Another reproduced the most singular combinations with a spinning-top; in his hands the revolving tops seemed to be animated with a life of their own in their interminable whirling; they ran over pipe-stems, the edges of sabres, wires and even hairs stretched across the stage; they turned around on the edges of large glasses, crossed bamboo ladders, dispersed into all the corners, and produced strange musical effects by the combination of their various pitches of tone. The jugglers tossed them in the air, threw them like shuttlecocks with wooden battledores, and yet they kept on spinning; they put them into their pockets, and took them out still whirling as before.\nIt is useless to describe the astonishing performances of the acrobats and gymnasts.

A mechanical issue or a schedule disruption, typical of the burgeoning American railway system. The waiting room of the station, if one could call it that, was a scene of democratic chaos foreign to Fogg's orderly existence. Passengers lounged on hard benches, spoke loudly, and scattered remnants of their provisions upon the floor. Dust, thick and pervasive, seemed to be the primary architectural feature. For Phileas Fogg, accustomed to the quietude of the Reform Club, the plush comfort of ocean liners, and the reserved service of global hotels, this idleness in such vulgar surroundings was indeed far from dignified. He stood, aloof from the general throng, his waterproof coat buttoned, his hat perfectly level, inspecting the planks of the floor as if searching for some anomaly. His valise sat neatly beside him, a small island of English precision in a sea of American disorder. His watch, naturally, had been consulted several times, though the tardiness of the train was a fact established beyond doubt, rendering further consultation merely a matter of form. There was no outward sign of impatience, only that subtle tightening around his eyes that Passepartout had learned to interpret as intense, though silent, vexation. Passepartout, less disciplined in his discomfort, fidgeted openly. He paced the short length of the 'waiting room', peered out the grimy window at the uninspiring platform, and sighed frequently, a sound that seemed swallowed by the general clamour. He missed the predictable routine of the steamer, the exotic novelty of foreign lands, even the quiet, measured tension of their previous journeys. This formless waiting felt particularly trying. \"Really, Monsieur,\" he muttered under his breath, though Fogg gave no indication of hearing him, \"One could travel around the world, but one cannot travel around America without encountering... this!\" He gestured vaguely at the scene of unrefined humanity. Aouda sat gracefully on a corner of the bench, her features revealing only mild weariness. She watched Mr. Fogg with quiet concern, understanding that this discomfort, while perhaps tolerable for others, was a significant imposition upon his meticulous nature. She offered no complaint, her presence itself a small oasis of calm amidst the surrounding disarray. Yet, through the dust and the noise, the unwavering objective remained. The delay was an irritation, a calculation error introduced into the otherwise perfect equation of their journey, but it was surmountable. Every minute lost here would need to be clawed back, perhaps by some daring or unorthodox means later on the westward route. But the route itself was clear. San Francisco was the gateway, the threshold to the final ocean crossing. And within a week, despite this temporary, undignified halt, the steamship from the Golden Gate would be cleaving the Pacific waves, carrying Phileas Fogg one step closer to his impossible deadline. The thought, though unexpressed, was a steady beacon in the temporary gloom of the railway station."

Attired after the fashion of the Middle Ages, they bore upon their shoulders a splendid pair of wings; but what especially distinguished them was the long noses which were fastened to their faces, and the uses which they made of them. These noses were made of bamboo, and were five, six, and even ten feet long, some straight, others curved, some ribboned, and some having imitation warts upon them. It was upon these appendages, fixed tightly on their real noses, that they performed their gymnastic exercises. A dozen of these sectaries of Tingou lay flat upon their backs, while others, dressed to represent lightning-rods, came and frolicked on their noses, jumping from one to another, and performing the most skilful leapings and somersaults.\nAs a last scene, a “human pyramid” had been announced, in which fifty Long Noses were to represent the Car of Juggernaut. But, instead of forming a pyramid by mounting each other’s shoulders, the artists were to group themselves on top of the noses. It happened that the performer who had hitherto formed the base of the Car had quitted the troupe, and as, to fill this part, only strength and adroitness were necessary, Passepartout had been chosen to take his place.\nThe poor fellow really felt sad when—melancholy reminiscence of his youth!—he donned his costume, adorned with vari-coloured wings, and fastened to his natural feature a false nose six feet long. But he cheered up when he thought that this nose was winning him something to eat.\nHe went upon the stage, and took his place beside the rest who were to compose the base of the Car of Juggernaut. They all stretched themselves on the floor, their noses pointing to the ceiling. A second group of artists disposed themselves on these long appendages, then a third above these, then a fourth, until a human monument reaching to the very cornices of the theatre soon arose on top of the noses. This elicited loud applause, in the midst of which the orchestra was just striking up a deafening air, when the pyramid tottered, the balance was lost, one of the lower noses vanished from the pyramid, and the human monument was shattered like a castle built of cards!\nIt was Passepartout’s fault. Abandoning his position, clearing the footlights without the aid of his wings, and, clambering up to the right-hand gallery, he fell at the feet of one of the spectators, crying, “Ah, my master! my master!”",

            "prefix-probing": "But the principal attraction was the exhibition of the Long Noses, a show to which Europe is as yet a stranger. This curious spectacle unfolded within a spacious, low-lying edifice, whose walls were adorned with intricate carvings depicting scenes from Parsi mythology. Here, the renowned ‘Long Noses’ officiated – not with artificially elongated features as Passepartout had half-expected, but rather the revered priests of the Zoroastrian faith, clad in spotless white garments and wearing veils over their mouths and noses, ostensibly to prevent their breath from polluting the sacred fire. This veil, perhaps, was the origin of the curious moniker, rendering their natural noses more prominent beneath the opaque cloth. They moved with a solemn grace, tending to the perpetual flame that burned brightly upon a large, elevated altar – the very heart of their worship. The air was thick with the scent of sandalwood and other aromatic woods used to feed the fire, mingled with a peculiar, sweet fragrance. Low, resonant chants filled the space, emanating from the veiled figures who performed their ancient rites with meticulous precision. It was a scene steeped in centuries of tradition, a glimpse into a faith vastly different from those common in Europe. Passepartout, his eyes wide with astonishment, nudged Fogg gently. “Monsieur,” he whispered, “look at them! Like figures from a dream. And the fire! It never goes out?” Mr. Fogg, ever the observer of facts rather than fancies, nodded curtly. “A sacred fire, Passepartout. A central tenet of their belief. The Parsees are descendants of Persians who fled Muslim persecution, preserving their ancient faith here in India.” Sir Francis Cromarty, who accompanied them, added, “Indeed. They are a prosperous and respected community in Bombay. Their charitable institutions are numerous. This temple, a ‘fire temple’, is the focus of their spiritual life. Only adherents are usually permitted within the inner sanctuary, but this particular exhibition seems designed to offer outsiders a controlled view of certain rituals.” The priests continued their measured movements, adding fragrant fuel to the flame, reciting prayers in Avestan, their ancient liturgical language. The fire crackled and roared softly, casting dancing shadows upon the walls. Despite the exotic nature of the performance, Mr. Fogg remained impassive, his mind likely already calculating the time required to witness this spectacle and the distance to the railway station. Passepartout, however, was captivated, finding the blend of solemnity, mystery, and the ever-present, vibrant flame profoundly impressive. He wondered about the meaning behind the gestures, the significance of the chants. It was a world away from the familiar churches of France. They spent perhaps half an hour observing this unique ceremony, absorbing the strange, compelling atmosphere. While utterly foreign, there was a palpable sense of devotion and history in the air. Passepartout felt a shiver of something akin to awe. Fogg merely consulted his watch. It was time to depart. The train for Calcutta was scheduled to leave that evening, and there were still arrangements to be made, including securing their passage and hiring the necessary conveyances to reach the station with their luggage. The glimpse into the world of the ‘Long Noses’ was fascinating, certainly, a curious note in the symphony of their journey, but it was merely a brief pause in the relentless forward momentum of their race against time. They politely thanked Sir Francis for his guidance and prepared to leave the temple grounds, heading back into the bustling, noisy streets of Bombay, where the practicalities of travel immediately reasserted themselves over the exotic marvels they had just witnessed. Their objective was clear: the train station. The eighty days were passing, and every minute counted."

Mr. Fogg applied in vain to the French and English consuls, and, after wandering through the streets a long time, began to despair of finding his missing servant. Chance, or perhaps a kind of presentiment, at last led him into the Honourable Mr. Batulcar’s theatre.

This was the date mentioned in the programme, and Phileas Fogg was neither twenty-four hours behind time, nor was he ahead of it. They landed at Yokohama. This town, with its excellent harbour, is one of the ports where the Pacific steamers call, and into which enter the great mail steamers from San Francisco, bound for the South Sea, and the land of the Mikado. These vessels belong to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, and the Occidental and Oriental Steamship Company. As soon as he got ashore, Mr. Fogg repaired to the agent of the Pacific Mail Company, and learned that the Carnatic, a steamer as large, and as fast as the Mongolia, left the preceding evening for San Francisco, and that she would not arrive at Yokohama again until the 14th of December, the time of her next departure. This was a great misfortune. The Carnatic was to take on the Japanese and Chinese mails, and Mr. Fogg counted on leaving in her. But she was gone, and her next departure was not till a month later. Phileas Fogg was perceptibly annoyed. But this feeling, whatever it might have been, did not betray itself, and Miss Aouda, who was with him, did not observe it. \"We will inquire,\" said he, \"for other vessels.\" He turned towards the agent, who said, \"In a few days, sir, a steamer from the Oriental Company is due; she is going to San Francisco.\" \"When does she sail?\" \"On the 18th, at four in the afternoon. It is the General Grant.\" \"Good,\" said Mr. Fogg. \"There is nothing to be done, then,\" said Aouda, \"but to wait till the 18th?\" \"Yes, my dear,\" returned Mr. Fogg; \"but as we are not at the end of our resources, I will, if you please, take advantage of the four days' delay which is granted us, to seek for Passepartout.\" Aouda's face brightened. It was evident that she owed Passepartout no grudge for his desertion. \"Yes, we must find him,\" said she; \"we must not abandon him, after all he has done for us.\" \"I will search for him, Miss Aouda,\" returned Phileas Fogg, \"even if it costs me the delay of another day.\" And, true to his word, he began to search. He inquired in the ships and on the wharves, among the sailors, and in the shops and tea-houses. He interrogated the police, and searched the consulates of the French and English. But Passepartout was not to be found. It was clear that if he had reached Yokohama, he had left it again. Mr. Fogg was beginning to despair. Was Passepartout, who had rendered him so many services, and whose devotion he had so often proved, really lost to him? He must have reached Nagasaki, or Kobe, and gone on further; or perhaps, having been shipwrecked, he was lost. Phileas Fogg did not give up the search, however. He went through the streets, and inquired at every turn, without allowing himself to be discouraged. Yokohama is a sort of European town, with very little Japanese character, but with a large foreign population, including English, French, Americans, and Dutch. In the evening, Mr. Fogg and Miss Aouda were returning to the hotel, when, as they passed through the Japanese quarter, they heard a noise, and saw a crowd collecting. Curiosity led them to the place. It was a performance by a band of jugglers and mountebanks, at the theatre of the Honourable Mr. Batulcar, the Japanese Barnum, who was at the head of a company of tumblers, equilibristes, jugglers, and other performers. Phileas Fogg and Aouda entered the theatre, and took seats. The performance was just beginning. It consisted of a series of complicated feats of strength and dexterity. The performers were dressed in grotesque costumes, and were painted in strange colours. They performed their feats with great skill and agility, and the audience applauded them loudly. But Mr. Fogg and Aouda paid little attention to the performance. They were still occupied with their search for Passepartout. At length, a new performance began. It was an act of equilibristes. The performers were poised on each other's shoulders, forming a sort of pyramid. The one at the top of the pyramid was a young man, dressed in a bizarre costume, and whose face was painted in a manner that made him unrecognisable. He was balancing himself on his back, with his legs in the air. On the top of his feet, he balanced a fan, which he kept in constant motion. Mr. Fogg was looking at him attentively, when suddenly, the young man at the top of the pyramid made a movement, and the whole structure collapsed. The performers fell to the ground, and the audience was in an uproar. The young man who had caused the catastrophe was none other than Passepartout! He had arrived at Yokohama on the Carnatic the preceding evening. Having no money, he had been obliged to join this band of mountebanks, and to perform this hazardous feat, in order to earn his living. He was covered with paint, and dressed in a ridiculous costume, but Mr. Fogg recognised him at once. Passepartout, for his part, recognised his master, who was looking at him from the gallery. Surprise caused him to make the involuntary movement which had resulted in the collapse of the pyramid. In falling, he had dislodged his artificial nose, and his face was now visible. Mr. Fogg sprang from his seat, and rushed towards the stage, followed by Aouda. The performers, who had been picking themselves up, were astonished at the sight of this gentleman, who was running towards them, followed by a lady. They were still more astonished when they saw the lady embrace one of the performers. Passepartout was delighted to see his master and Miss Aouda again, but he was so embarrassed by his costume and his painted face that he did not know what to say. Mr. Fogg, as phlegmatic as ever, said to him, \"Well, Passepartout, you are found, I see.\"",

Aboard the *Carnatic*, Phileas Fogg, accompanied by the rescued Aouda and his momentarily reliable valet, Passepartout, disembarked into the bustling port city. Their immediate task was to locate the relative of Aouda who resided there, a mission Phileas Fogg undertook with his usual punctuality and precision. However, the relative had moved away years prior, leaving no trace. While Fogg handled this setback stoically, Sergeant Fix, the relentless detective, saw his opportunity. He encountered Passepartout in a tavern and, desperate to delay Fogg until the elusive warrant arrived, plied the poor Frenchman with alcohol and opium, rendering him unconscious. Consequently, Passepartout failed to inform Mr. Fogg that the *Carnatic* was departing early and missed the ship himself. Fogg, finding no trace of Passepartout and assuming he would rejoin him later, quickly sought alternative passage to Yokohama with Aouda, locating a pilot boat named the *Tankadere* willing to take them to Shanghai, from where they could catch a steamer."

Phileas Fogg, ever punctual and composed, had already secured his first-class cabin, a compact yet luxurious space that met his exacting standards precisely. Passepartout, though still reeling from his recent escapades in Japan, was equally prepared to board, eager to leave behind the unpredictable adventures and return to the more predictable rhythm of Fogg’s remarkable journey. The quayside buzzed with activity; porters rushed with luggage, families bid emotional goodbyes, and the ship's crew completed their final preparations. The air was thick with the smell of coal smoke and saltwater, a potent mix signalling the imminent departure across the vast Pacific Ocean towards the American continent. Fogg and Passepartout, accompanied by Fix, who remained stubbornly attached to their heels, watched the final cargo being loaded, anticipation quietly building for the long, challenging crossing that lay ahead, the next major leg of their extraordinary race against time."

The “General Grant” passed, on the 23rd of November, the one hundred and eightieth meridian, and was at the very antipodes of London. Mr. Fogg had, it is true, exhausted fifty-two of the eighty days in which he was to complete the tour, and there were only twenty-eight left. But, though he was only half-way by the difference of meridians, he had really gone over two-thirds of the whole journey; for he had been obliged to make long circuits from London to Aden, from Aden to Bombay, from Calcutta to Singapore, and from Singapore to Yokohama. Could he have followed without deviation the fiftieth parallel, which is that of London, the whole distance would only have been about twelve thousand miles; whereas he would be forced, by the irregular methods of locomotion, to traverse twenty-six thousand, of which he had, on the 23rd of November, accomplished seventeen thousand five hundred. And now the course was a straight one, and Fix was no longer there to put obstacles in their way!\nIt happened also, on the 23rd of November, that Passepartout made a joyful discovery. It will be remembered that the obstinate fellow had insisted on keeping his famous family watch at London time, and on regarding that of the countries he had passed through as quite false and unreliable. Now, on this day, though he had not changed the hands, he found that his watch exactly agreed with the ship’s chronometers. His triumph was hilarious. He would have liked to know what Fix would say if he were aboard!\n“The rogue told me a lot of stories,” repeated Passepartout, “about the meridians, the sun, and the moon! Moon, indeed! moonshine more likely! If one listened to that sort of people, a pretty sort of time one would keep! I was sure that the sun would some day regulate itself by my watch!”\nPassepartout was ignorant that, if the face of his watch had been divided into twenty-four hours, like the Italian clocks, he would have no reason for exultation; for the hands of his watch would then, instead of as now indicating nine o’clock in the morning, indicate nine o’clock in the evening, that is, the twenty-first hour after midnight precisely the difference between London time and that of the one hundred and eightieth meridian. But if Fix had been able to explain this purely physical effect, Passepartout would not have admitted, even if he had comprehended it.

The four and twentieth of November, at noon, Mr. Fogg was at the very point diametrically opposite to London, from which he had started. He had accomplished 26,000 miles, which are the entire circumference of the globe, and this in fifty-two days; and if he had kept invariably in the same straight line, he would have reached this point without the aid of the circumnavigating vessels; but instead of this, the track pursued had been in a zigzag, to reach the different points of the earth he had been compelled to touch. But the difficulty was vanquished, and there was now no obstacle in the way. No longer fearing the police whom chance had so strangely directed in his footsteps, Mr. Fogg was advancing gloriously towards his goal. He was no longer following a fixed track, but was making directly for the pole of his destination, London, which he would reach by twining round the earth, an imaginary line. The weather was good. The wind, blowing from the north-west, was favourable. The ship, with all its sails spread, was ploughing the waves bravely. Passepartout was joyous. His terrible apprehensions were leaving him by degrees. That Fix was not on board seemed to him a most fortunate circumstance. One morning, a very cheerful morning, November 23rd, Passepartout made a discovery which threw him into absolute transport. He had persisted in keeping his watch at London time, and utterly ignoring that of the countries he had passed through. It was an innocent delusion, and one which was attended by no evil results. And today, November 23rd, as he was standing on the deck of the 'General Grant', he happened to look at his watch. The hands pointed to half-past nine in the morning. Now, the ship's chronometers marked half-past twelve. Passepartout's first impulse was to laugh. And in spite of himself, he uttered a loud 'Ha! ha! ha!' which made Mr. Fogg and Aouda stare, and attracted the attention of some of the passengers. He wished he could have told Fix, who was certainly at the other end of the earth, how the sun revolved around him, Passepartout! Yes, if Mr. Fogg was right, and if he had really gone round the world, he ought to have gained twelve hours, and the hands of his watch ought to indicate noon, and not half-past nine. Passepartout was not slow to comprehend the cause of this. The fact is, that in going eastward, he had met the sun, and the days were consequently shorter by four minutes for each degree accomplished. There are three hundred and sixty degrees on the circumference of the earth; and these three hundred and sixty degrees multiplied by four minutes, gives precisely twenty-four hours - that is to say, the twelve hours gained. In short, while following the sun, he had gained a day - and a day which he did not suspect. But Passepartout, whose brain was a perfect tissue of contradictions, did not perceive that he had gained a day, but only that his watch was right. He would have wagered that the ship's chronometers were wrong. He would have even thought Fix capable of winding them up in a false way! With his Passpepartout logic, he reasoned thus: The ship's chronometers were marking noon, but they were the chronometers of a ship sailing to the east, and with which the sun was therefore setting sooner; and the ship's chronometers, accordingly, indicated a later hour than London time. My watch, on the contrary, is keeping London time, and does not regulate itself by the sun; it must therefore be right! Passepartout was not only proud of his discovery, but was triumphantly certain of it. He would have cried out with a shout of joy, if he had dared. He had saved the twelve hours! His mind was in a state of delirium. He had no doubt whatever that he had gained a day. He had completely forgotten that he had come to the land of the Antipodes, the point directly opposite to London. If he had consulted the twenty-four hours dial of his watch, he would have seen that the hands marked 9 PM (21:00), the difference between London and the one hundred and eightieth meridian being twelve hours. But then, if Fix had been there, Passepartout would certainly have shown him his watch, and would have said to him: 'See, my dear Mr. Fix, you talk about meridians, about the sun, about the moon, about all sorts of things which I don't understand. But I understand this: my watch, which I have kept at London time, proves that you are wrong, that we have not gone round the world at all, and that we shall not reach London before the end of the eighty days, for we are only halfway across the globe, and look how much time we have lost!'",

            "prefix-probing": "On the ninth day after leaving Yokohama, Phileas Fogg had traversed exactly one half of the terrestrial globe. The 'General Grant', under a head of steam that seldom flagged, carried its passengers eastward across the vast, rolling expanse of the Pacific. The monotony of the ocean voyage, broken only by the rhythmic churning of the screw and the distant cry of gulls, suited Fogg perfectly. He spent his time in the grand saloon, usually playing whist with Colonel Proctor, a bluff American encountered on board, or simply waiting with imperturbable calm. Passepartout, ever curious and restless, explored the ship from bow to stern, befriending the crew and marveling at the sheer scale of the journey. Aouda, finding solace in Fogg’s quiet presence, adapted gracefully to the sea life, often sitting on deck watching the horizon or engaging in gentle conversation with Passepartout about her experiences in India. Meanwhile, the ever-present Detective Fix paced the decks, a shadow of suspicion clinging to him, frustrated by Fogg’s unwavering schedule and the lack of any opportunity to execute his warrant far from British territory. He knew his chance lay in America.  As the days passed, the weather remained generally favorable, though the sea could sometimes be rough. Fogg meticulously logged their progress, comparing the ship’s speed to his calculations, never betraying anxiety or impatience. Passepartout, however, felt the vastness of the ocean keenly and eagerly anticipated the sight of land. The ship finally approached the American coast, the air growing crisper, the scents changing. On the morning of the tenth of December, just twenty-two days after leaving London, the 'General Grant' steamed into the bustling harbor of San Francisco. The sight was a chaotic symphony of ships, docks, and hurried activity, a stark contrast to the ordered calm Fogg carried within him. Disembarking into the vibrant, sometimes unruly energy of the Californian city, they stepped onto American soil, exactly halfway around the world, on schedule."

It had followed him from Bombay, and had come by the “Carnatic,” on which steamer he himself was supposed to be. Fix’s disappointment may be imagined when he reflected that the warrant was now useless. Mr. Fogg had left English ground, and it was now necessary to procure his extradition!\n“Well,” thought Fix, after a moment of anger, “my warrant is not good here, but it will be in England. The rogue evidently intends to return to his own country, thinking he has thrown the police off his track. Good! I will follow him across the Atlantic. As for the money, heaven grant there may be some left! But the fellow has already spent in travelling, rewards, trials, bail, elephants, and all sorts of charges, more than five thousand pounds. Yet, after all, the Bank is rich!”\nHis course decided on, he went on board the “General Grant,” and was there when Mr. Fogg and Aouda arrived.

Having arrived at Yokohama, he had repaired to the consulate, and there, at last, he had received the warrant which had pursued him from Bombay, and which was now nearly four months old. It was an exceedingly useless warrant, however, for it authorised the capture of Fogg only upon British territory; and Yokohama was no longer in India. Fix's first thought was to give up the chase, and return to Europe. But he abandoned the idea when he reflected that Fogg was evidently going back to England, and that there he could, at least, lay his hand upon him. What an overwhelming disappointment that the rascal had not made his tour around the world in English territory! Fix resolved to follow him to the end. He took passage on the General Grant, securing the berth which was least expensive. On board, he at once recognised Mr. Fogg and Aouda, despite the darkness. To his great surprise, however, Passepartout was not with them, and Fix concluded that the rogue had at last abandoned his master. But, while the detective was thus reflecting, a person, wrapped in a rug, made his appearance on the deck, and came and stretched himself out near the forward deckhouse. It was Passepartout! He had taken the theatrical troupe's advice, and passed himself off as belonging to the company. The costume he had on was perfectly ridiculous, and in spite of himself Fix burst into a hearty laugh when he perceived him. Passepartout was not abashed by the situation, and did not even flinch at the detective's merriment. But Fix suddenly became uneasy, as Passepartout had approached the rail, and was gazing attentively at his face. He did not know that Passepartout was scanning the passengers to find him. Happily Fix recollected that he had concealed his visage in the folds of his overcoat collar, and he hoped that the Frenchman would not recognise him; besides, the ex-circus performer's thoughts were absorbed by other things. Passepartout was evidently thinking of the reward which he was about to receive at the end of his journey. It was very certain that Fix's presence on board the General Grant, thus hidden away, was not accidental. He had made up his mind to follow Fogg, and he was following him. But how could he help being discovered by the remarkably shrewd Passepartout?",

Having arrived at Yokohama, he had repaired to the consulate, and there, at last, he had received the warrant which had pursued him from Bombay, and which was now nearly four months old. It was an exceedingly useless warrant, however, for it authorised the capture of Fogg only upon British territory; and Yokohama was no longer in India. Fix's first thought was to give up the chase, and return to Europe. But he abandoned the idea when he reflected that Fogg was evidently going back to England, and that there he could, at least, lay his hand upon him. What an overwhelming disappointment that the rascal had not made his tour around the world in English territory! Fix resolved to follow him to the end. He took passage on the General Grant, securing the berth which was least expensive. On board, he at once recognised Mr. Fogg and Aouda, despite the darkness. To his great surprise, however, Passepartout was not with them, and Fix concluded that the rogue had at last abandoned his master. But, while the detective was thus reflecting, a person, wrapped in a rug, made his appearance on the deck, and came and stretched himself out near the forward deckhouse. It was Passepartout! He had taken the theatrical troupe's advice, and passed himself off as belonging to the company. The costume he had on was perfectly ridiculous, and in spite of himself Fix burst into a hearty laugh when he perceived him. Passepartout was not abashed by the situation, and did not even flinch at the detective's merriment. But Fix suddenly became uneasy, as Passepartout had approached the rail, and was gazing attentively at his face. He did not know that Passepartout was scanning the passengers to find him. Happily Fix recollected that he had concealed his visage in the folds of his overcoat collar, and he hoped that the Frenchman would not recognise him; besides, the ex-circus performer's thoughts were absorbed by other things. Passepartout was evidently thinking of the reward which he was about to receive at the end of his journey. It was very certain that Fix's presence on board the General Grant, thus hidden away, was not accidental. He had made up his mind to follow Fogg, and he was following him. But how could he help being discovered by the remarkably shrewd Passepartout?",

The air was thick with the humid heat and the cacophony of the port – shouts from vendors, the rattle of carts, the distant clang of ships' bells. None of it registered fully with the detective, whose focus was solely on finding the man he believed was the notorious Bank of England robber, Phileas Fogg, and his enigmatic valet, Passepartout. He had followed them relentlessly across the continent, each mile a testament to Fogg's improbable schedule and, in Fix's mind, his desperation to escape. He desperately hoped the long-awaited warrant for Fogg’s arrest would finally arrive on this very vessel or be waiting for him onshore. Without it, his hands were tied legally, yet his professional instincts screamed that he must detain Fogg here, in this vibrant, chaotic crossroads of the world. The thought of Fogg slipping away again, continuing his seemingly impossible journey, filled Fix with a cold dread. Trying to blend in, the lone figure was consumed by a singular purpose amidst the tide of humanity. He watched every face, searching for a sign or clue. The pressure was immense; failure here meant the robber vanished forever, his reputation ruined. He had come so far, endured so much – the heat of Suez, complexities of India – all for this moment, to finally apprehend his elusive quarry. He clenched his jaw, determined not to let Fogg escape his grasp in this, the farthest point from London he had yet reached in his extraordinary chase."

Well, I will follow him there. But hereafter I will do as much to keep obstacles out of his way as I have done up to this time to put them in his path. I’ve changed my game, you see, and simply because it was for my interest to change it.

Fogg, immaculate as ever despite the hurried journey and the missed connection, stood calm and unwavering. His eyes, clear and penetrating, fixed upon his servant. Passepartout, haggard and shamefaced, could barely meet his master's gaze. The terrible events in Bombay, the unintentional delay, the disastrous visit to the pagoda and the subsequent arrest – it all weighed heavily upon him. He had ruined everything. He had jeopardized the impossible wager, the extraordinary journey, his master's fortune and reputation.\"Passepartout,\" Fogg said, his voice low but distinct, devoid of anger, simply stating a fact, \"you have caused a delay.\"The valet winced as if struck. \"Monsieur Fogg,\" he stammered, \"I... I am most profoundly sorry. It was my fault entirely. The shoes... the pagoda... I was foolish, inexcusably careless. I deserved the arrest. I thought it was lost, monsieur, completely lost! I feared I would never find you again. I thought the game was over, that the eighty days were gone.\"Fogg listened without interruption, his expression unchanged. When Passepartout finished his halting confession, the gentleman from Savile Row merely nodded. \"You were in the Bombay prison?\" he inquired.\"Yes, monsieur. For two days. And Mr. Fix was also arrested, though he was released almost immediately.\"A faint flicker of something, perhaps interest, maybe resignation, crossed Fogg's face at the mention of Fix, the detective who had been shadowing them since Suez, convinced Fogg was a bank robber. But he dismissed the thought instantly.\"The delay is inconvenient,\" Fogg stated, returning to the central issue. \"But not insurmountable. We missed the steamer Rangoon for Calcutta.\"Passepartout's heart sank further. \"Missed it? Then we are lost!\"\"Not at all,\" Fogg replied with remarkable equanimity. \"We are now on the Mongolia, bound for Calcutta as well, though by a different, longer route. We will arrive later than planned, but I have adjusted our schedule. The wager remains possible, though it requires even greater precision and perhaps some... improvisation later on. We must now make up time.\"Passepartout stared at his master, astonished. There was no reproach, no fury, just cold calculation and unwavering resolve. Fogg had accepted the setback, accounted for it, and moved on. This was not a man who lingered on misfortune.\"I... I will do better, monsieur,\" Passepartout vowed, his voice thick with emotion and determination. \"I will not fail you again.\"Fogg gave a small, almost imperceptible nod. \"See that you do,\" he said, and then turned back to gaze out at the vast expanse of the Indian Ocean, already planning the next leg of the incredible, race against time. Passepartout, humbled but also filled with renewed hope and loyalty, understood that the adventure was far from over. They would continue, against all odds, against every obstacle the world could throw at them. The impossible journey went on."

Taking a carriage at a charge of three dollars, he and Aouda entered it, while Passepartout mounted the box beside the driver, and they set out for the International Hotel.\nFrom his exalted position Passepartout observed with much curiosity the wide streets, the low, evenly ranged houses, the Anglo-Saxon Gothic churches, the great docks, the palatial wooden and brick warehouses, the numerous conveyances, omnibuses, horse-cars, and upon the side-walks, not only Americans and Europeans, but Chinese and Indians. Passepartout was surprised at all he saw. San Francisco was no longer the legendary city of 1849—a city of banditti, assassins, and incendiaries, who had flocked hither in crowds in pursuit of plunder; a paradise of outlaws, where they gambled with gold-dust, a revolver in one hand and a bowie-knife in the other: it was now a great commercial emporium.\n",

In the streets, there were also a great number of stalls and booths, where one could buy all sorts of eatables, dried fruits, tarts, and confectionery.

With characteristic promptness, Mr. Fogg began clearing customs. Passepartout, still feeling sheepish, followed, determined to avoid any further undignified exhibitions. The bustling port of San Francisco promised the next stage of their race, beginning for Passepartout with a harmless tumble, a less glorious arrival than he had envisioned after the long Pacific voyage.

Breakfast over, Mr. Fogg and Aouda went to the English consulate, to have their passports vised. As they were about to set out, Mr. Fogg asked Passepartout if he had anything to attend to, and begged him to accompany them if he had not. Passepartout replied that he had nothing to do, and would be delighted to go with his master. He did make bold, however, to ask if it would not be well to purchase a few rifles and revolvers in case of an attack by the Sioux or Pawnees. Mr. Fogg thought it useless, but added that it was no harm to be well prepared. Passepartout was therefore authorized to arm himself as he saw fit. When Mr. Fogg and Aouda arrived at the consulate, they found Fix there, who was sauntering idly in the court. He seemed a good deal astonished to see Mr. Fogg and the young lady, and, touching his hat, said, “Excuse me, sir; are you not the gentleman who—?”“Not at all, sir; you are mistaken,” replied Mr. Fogg. “I understand,” returned Fix, with a feigned air of disappointment. “You are looking for some one else. Pardon me.” And he was about to withdraw, when Mr. Fogg resumed, “And yet, sir, I have no doubt you are the person I am in search of. Are you not Detective Fix?” “I am,” replied Fix, with a slight tremor in his voice. “In that case, allow me to introduce you to this young lady, Mrs. Aouda. And now, can we not walk about the town together?”“Certainly, sir,” replied Fix, without betraying his emotion; “if you will do me the honour of allowing me to accompany you, I shall be very happy. I have been commissioned to see that all goes well, and that—”“Precisely,” interrupted Mr. Fogg. “And now, if you please, let us proceed to the English consulate.”Fix, who had not yet quite recovered from his surprise, accompanied them.

He did not know how to account for the presence of Mrs. Aouda. He thought it was very strange, and yet, he was not the least in love with her. He felt no sentiment but that of duty. And yet, he was very much taken with this young lady. She was a perfect model of grace and beauty, and she was very richly dressed. And she was with Mr. Fogg! That was the main thing.

The viands, though presented in small portions, were exquisitely prepared and bore testament to the local culinary skill, offering a curious blend of flavours that might have intrigued a less preoccupied traveller. Phileas Fogg, however, ate with his usual systematic precision, his mind seemingly occupied with the intricate calculations of time and distance that governed his extraordinary wager. He consulted his watch frequently, less out of impatience and more out of the inherent need to verify the relentless march of the seconds against his meticulously planned itinerary. Aouda, still finding her footing in this new, bewildering world, observed her protector with quiet gratitude. The contrast between the exotic setting, the hurried nature of their stay, and Mr. Fogg's imperturbable calm was striking. She sampled the dishes hesitantly at first, the spices a novel experience, but soon found comfort in the familiar ritual of a shared meal, even one so rapidly consumed. There was no time for leisure. As soon as the last morsel was despatched, Mr. Fogg signalled for the bill. The promptness of the service mirrored his own urgency. Each moment saved was a victory against the unforgiving clock. The refreshment was merely a necessary pause, a fuel stop in their relentless dash across continents. Their next objective loomed – the transition to the ship that would carry them away from India, towards the next crucial waypoint on their audacious global circuit. The world outside the comfortable room waited, indifferent to their haste, but its vastness was precisely what they intended to conquer, minute by precious minute."

Men were going about carrying large posters, and flags and streamers were floating in the wind; while loud cries were heard on every hand.\n“Hurrah for Camerfield!”\n“Hurrah for Mandiboy!”\nIt was a political meeting; at least so Fix conjectured, who said to Mr. Fogg, “Perhaps we had better not mingle with the crowd. There may be danger in it.”\n“Yes,” returned Mr. Fogg; “and blows, even if they are political, are still blows.”\nFix smiled at this remark; and, in order to be able to see without being jostled about, the party took up a position on the top of a flight of steps situated at the upper end of Montgomery Street. Opposite them, on the other side of the street, between a coal wharf and a petroleum warehouse, a large platform had been erected in the open air, towards which the current of the crowd seemed to be directed.\nFor what purpose was this meeting? What was the occasion of this excited assemblage? Phileas Fogg could not imagine. Was it to nominate some high official—a governor or member of Congress? It was not improbable, so agitated was the multitude before them.\nJust at this moment there was an unusual stir in the human mass. All the hands were raised in the air. Some, tightly closed, seemed to disappear suddenly in the midst of the cries—an energetic way, no doubt, of casting a vote. The crowd swayed back, the banners and flags wavered, disappeared an instant, then reappeared in tatters. The undulations of the human surge reached the steps, while all the heads floundered on the surface like a sea agitated by a squall. Many of the black hats disappeared, and the greater part of the crowd seemed to have diminished in height.\n“It is evidently a meeting,” said Fix, “and its object must be an exciting one. I should not wonder if it were about the ‘Alabama,’ despite the fact that that question is settled.”\n“Perhaps,” replied Mr. Fogg, simply.\n“At least, there are two champions in presence of each other, the Honourable Mr. Camerfield and the Honourable Mr. Mandiboy.”",

It was evident that a political demonstration of importance was going on. Flags and streamers fluttered everywhere, bearing the names of candidates, and the air was thick with the shouts of partisans. Men, women, and children elbowed their way through the press, all eager to hear or to see. Mounted police officers, looking uncomfortable, tried to maintain some semblance of order, but the surging mass paid little heed. Bands played patriotic tunes, often drowning out the impassioned speeches being delivered from makeshift platforms erected on street corners. The enthusiasm was infectious, almost overwhelming. Phileas Fogg, with his usual imperturbability, navigated the human tide as if it were a perfectly ordered procession, his eyes fixed straight ahead. Passepartout, however, found himself caught up in the energy, his curiosity piqued by the sheer spectacle. He peered into faces, read the inscriptions on banners, and listened to the snippets of excited conversation that reached his ears. This was America, he thought, a land of vibrant, sometimes chaotic, energy. The political fervor seemed to consume everyone. Orators gesticulated wildly, their voices hoarse from shouting above the din. Their words, though mostly incomprehensible to Passepartout, were clearly having a profound effect on their listeners, who cheered and booed with equal vehemence. The street was practically impassable. Horse-drawn omnibuses were stuck in the middle of the road, their drivers looking resigned. Pedestrians struggled to make progress, weaving and dodging to avoid collisions. Fogg and Passepartout had to push their way through the dense throng, their progress painstakingly slow. Every few steps, they would be jostled or have to wait for a surge in the crowd to subside. Despite the congestion and the noise, Fogg remained utterly unperturbed, his focus solely on reaching their destination. Passepartout, initially amused, began to find the constant pushing and shoving tiresome. The rally seemed to stretch on indefinitely, a sea of humanity overflowing the confines of the street. The setting sun cast long shadows, but the intensity of the demonstration showed no signs of abating. It was a striking introduction to American urban life, a vivid display of public passion and democratic zeal, a scene bustling with life and fervor that contrasted sharply with the quiet precision of Fogg's own existence. Navigating this tempest of people required patience and persistence. They pressed onward, determined to reach the Grand Hotel, where they planned to spend their brief time in San Francisco before continuing their global circuit. The cacophony of the crowd, the shouts, the music, the cheers, formed a unique soundtrack to their arrival. It was an unforgettable scene, a testament to the democratic spirit, albeit one experienced from the thick of the human storm."

Thumps were exchanged from the tops of the carriages and omnibuses which had been blocked up in the crowd. Boots and shoes went whirling through the air, and Mr. Fogg thought he even heard the crack of revolvers mingling in the din, the rout approached the stairway, and flowed over the lower step. One of the parties had evidently been repulsed; but the mere lookers-on could not tell whether Mandiboy or Camerfield had gained the upper hand.\n“It would be prudent for us to retire,” said Fix, who was anxious that Mr. Fogg should not receive any injury, at least until they got back to London. “If there is any question about England in all this, and we were recognised, I fear it would go hard with us.”\n“An English subject—” began Mr. Fogg.\nHe did not finish his sentence; for a terrific hubbub now arose on the terrace behind the flight of steps where they stood, and there were frantic shouts of, “Hurrah for Mandiboy! Hip, hip, hurrah!”\nIt was a band of voters coming to the rescue of their allies, and taking the Camerfield forces in flank. Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Fix found themselves between two fires; it was too late to escape. The torrent of men, armed with loaded canes and sticks, was irresistible. Phileas Fogg and Fix were roughly hustled in their attempts to protect their fair companion; the former, as cool as ever, tried to defend himself with the weapons which nature has placed at the end of every Englishman’s arm, but in vain. A big brawny fellow with a red beard, flushed face, and broad shoulders, who seemed to be the chief of the band, raised his clenched fist to strike Mr. Fogg, whom he would have given a crushing blow, had not Fix rushed in and received it in his stead. An enormous bruise immediately made its appearance under the detective’s silk hat, which was completely smashed in.\n“Yankee!” exclaimed Mr. Fogg, darting a contemptuous look at the ruffian.\n“Englishman!” returned the other. “We will meet again!”\n“When you please.”\n“What is your name?”\n“Phileas Fogg.

In an instant the number of the combatants increased. Some of the roughs had been armed with revolvers, and fired into the thick of the melee.

The man, a stout fellow with a breathless face, turned to Fix. \"It's Mr. Fogg!\" he exclaimed, his voice almost lost in the general din. \"Phileas Fogg! The gentleman who's gone around the world! He's expected back any minute! Everyone's here to see if he's done it!\" Fix, ever the detective, pressed further. \"Around the world?\" he feigned ignorance, though his heart hammered against his ribs. \"Why this commotion, then?\" \"Why?\" the man repeated, eyes wide. \"He wagered twenty thousand pounds! Twenty thousand! On travelling around the globe in eighty days! News arrived by telegraph – he was in Ireland yesterday! They say he's coming straight here, to the Reform Club, to claim his prize! The papers have been full of it! Some say he's a hero, others a madman!\" Aouda glanced at Fogg, who, despite the pandemonium, remained as impassive as a statue. His face showed no trace of triumph, no anxiety, only the usual calm determination. For her part, the excitement of the crowd seemed utterly foreign and bewildering. She had shared the long journey, the dangers, the quiet companionship, but this public spectacle, this fervent interest in a man who seemed to shun all attention, was beyond her comprehension. \"He is a man of his word,\" Aouda said softly to Fix, though her gaze was fixed on Fogg. Fix merely nodded, a knot tightening in his stomach. He knew better than anyone else the true cost of Fogg's unexpected day's delay in Liverpool – the day he had apprehended him. That single, disastrous setback seemed to have irrevocably ruined Fogg's chances, despite the seemingly triumphant return. He watched Fogg navigate the throng with surprising ease, his presence commanding a strange respect that forced gaps in the crowd. Each step towards the Reform Club was a step closer to the deadline, a deadline Fix was certain Fogg would miss, perhaps by mere minutes. The cheering, the shouting, the sheer weight of expectation from the multitude felt like a physical pressure. They were reaching the end of a journey unlike any other, and the outcome, Fix believed with grim certainty, was failure. The crowd, unaware of the critical delay, pushed and surged, eager for a glimpse of the famous, or infamous, Phileas Fogg, oblivious to the fact that the final, crucial race against time was happening in these last desperate moments on the streets of London. Fogg, however, strode on, the seconds ticking away towards 8:45 P.M., the appointed hour."

The air was thick with tension, not just for him, but for the small crowd that had gathered, drawn by the incredible drama of Mr. Fogg's audacious journey. Every stroke of the clock seemed to hammer the nail of fate. He checked his watch again; it was nearing nine o'clock. The deadline was 8:45 p.m. Had they missed it? Had all their perils, the storms, the delays, the encounters with Fix and the Sioux, been in vain? His master, usually so calm and imperturbable, had shown signs of distress in the last few hours, especially after his confrontation with Fix in Liverpool. Passepartout cursed the detective under his breath. If not for that unjust arrest, they would surely be within the club's doors by now, Mr. Fogg presenting his passport and winning the seemingly impossible wager. He clutched one of the heavy revolvers more tightly, ready to defend his master against any further interference, though who he expected to fight in the streets of London on a Sunday evening, he wasn't entirely sure. His master's honour, and indeed, his immense fortune, hung in the balance. A low murmur went through the crowd. Passepartout strained his eyes, searching for the familiar, precise figure of Phileas Fogg. The minutes ticked by, each one a lifetime. Was it over? Had they lost? The thought was unbearable. He couldn't imagine life after this adventure if it ended in defeat and ruin for his master. Then, a ripple of excitement from the crowd..."

The Pacific Railroad is, however, really divided into two distinct lines: the Central Pacific, between San Francisco and Ogden, and the Union Pacific, between Ogden and Omaha. Five main lines connect Omaha with New York.\nNew York and San Francisco are thus united by an uninterrupted metal ribbon, which measures no less than three thousand seven hundred and eighty-six miles. Between Omaha and the Pacific the railway crosses a territory which is still infested by Indians and wild beasts, and a large tract which the Mormons, after they were driven from Illinois in 1845, began to colonise.\nThe journey from New York to San Francisco consumed, formerly, under the most favourable conditions, at least six months. It is now accomplished in seven days.\nIt was in 1862 that, in spite of the Southern Members of Congress, who wished a more southerly route, it was decided to lay the road between the forty-first and forty-second parallels. President Lincoln himself fixed the end of the line at Omaha, in Nebraska. The work was at once commenced, and pursued with true American energy; nor did the rapidity with which it went on injuriously affect its good execution. The road grew, on the prairies, a mile and a half a day. A locomotive, running on the rails laid down the evening before, brought the rails to be laid on the morrow, and advanced upon them as fast as they were put in position.\nThe Pacific Railroad is joined by several branches in Iowa, Kansas, Colorado, and Oregon. On leaving Omaha, it passes along the left bank of the Platte River as far as the junction of its northern branch, follows its southern branch, crosses the Laramie territory and the Wahsatch Mountains, turns the Great Salt Lake, and reaches Salt Lake City, the Mormon capital, plunges into the Tuilla Valley, across the American Desert, Cedar and Humboldt Mountains, the Sierra Nevada, and descends, viâ Sacramento, to the Pacific—its grade, even on the Rocky Mountains, never exceeding one hundred and twelve feet to the mile.\nSuch was the road to be traversed in seven days, which would enable Phileas Fogg—at least, so he hoped—to take the Atlantic steamer at New York on the 11th for Liverpool.",

This grand railway is composed of two parts: the Central Pacific, between San Francisco and Ogden, and the Union Pacific, between Ogden and Omaha. Five railways connect Omaha with New York. The railway line, passing through thirteen counties, which are Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, etc., is 3,786 miles long, and is traversed in seven days. The trains of the Pacific Railroad started from Omaha on the 26th of October, 1868, and from San Francisco on the 8th of November of the same year; and the roads were joined on the 10th of May, 1869.

The company has published a time-table, with the details for each day, the halts at the stations, and the number of miles accomplished. This great artery of communication begins at the city of New York, and passes through the states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania, touches Philadelphia, traverses Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, touches Chicago, goes through Iowa, crosses the Missouri at Council Bluffs, goes through Nebraska, touches Omaha, skirts the territory of Utah and the Great Salt Lake, goes through Wyoming and Nevada, by the Pacific, enters California, and reaches the terminus at San Francisco—in fine, connecting five large cities and ten states.The road was commenced in 1862, and finished on the 8th of May, 1869, having cost one hundred million dollars.It is the grandest work, and the most useful one, as well as the greatest railway on the globe. The emigrants, until this period, were compelled to embark at New York on board of ships bound around Cape Horn, or the Isthmus of Panama.The railway now carries them from one ocean to the other in seven days, which before occupied six months.Upon the Pullman cars, which are provided with every convenience, and luxurious at the same time, passengers live as if they were on shipboard. They are provided with dining-cars, smoking-cars, library-cars; and the train is supplied with baggage-cars, the post-office car, and the car set apart for the use of the conductor. In this way, and at moderate prices, for the fare is low, the public can travel more than three thousand seven hundred miles from New York to San Francisco."

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the specific detail that the seats are arranged in two rows perpendicular to the direction of the train, which is a key structural feature described early in the original.\n- The mention that theatre cars are the only type missing, with a suggestion they may be added in the future, is not clearly and specifically conveyed in the completion.\n- The original specifies that book and news dealers, as well as sellers of food, drink, and cigars, are continually circulating in the aisles, but the completion generalizes and expands this to a broader range of vendors and wares, losing the original's focus.\n- The original notes that the train left Oakland station at a specific time, which is not precisely stated in the completion.\n- The original describes the weather as night, cold, and cheerless, with overcast clouds threatening snow, while the completion changes and expands on these details.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately describes the arrangement of seats and the aisle, omitting the perpendicular orientation and the two rows on either side of the aisle.\n- The completion invents additional amenities and services not present in the original, such as libraries, baths, and telegraph marriages.\n- The weather description is altered, with the completion stating it was snowing and turning to sleet, which is not consistent with the original's depiction.\n- The completion changes the phrasing and sequence of the train's departure and the passengers' actions, such as wrapping themselves in rugs, which is not mentioned in the original.\n- The completion generalizes the types of vendors and items sold, introducing new categories and omitting the original's specific focus on book and news dealers, and sellers of edibles, drinkables, and cigars.\n- The completion refers to the train crossing 'the States' rather than reaching a specific destination, which is less precise than the original's mention of Omaha.\n\nOverall, the completion introduces invented content, omits key structural and descriptive details, and alters the sequence and specificity of events and features described in the original passage."

It was provided with comfortable seats, placed lengthwise, and the passengers consisted of a miscellaneous company of Europeans, mostly officers of the army, and wealthy natives. Mr. Fogg and Aouda took their seats near the door, while Passepartout installed himself opposite them. The train started punctually at half-past eight. The country traversed by the railway was a vast plain, cultivated in part, and watered by numerous small rivers. Further on, they passed through thick forests of palms, which were replaced by cotton-trees, sugar-canes, and indigo plantations. The scenery was monotonous at first, but gradually became more varied and interesting as they approached the mountainous region towards the north-east. They caught glimpses of scattered villages, whose inhabitants, though differing in race and customs, were uniformly dressed in white turbans and robes. The train proceeded at a good speed, though not excessive, averaging about twenty miles an hour. Passepartout found the journey somewhat dull after the excitement of Bombay, but Mr. Fogg seemed perfectly content, observing the landscape with his usual imperturbable calm, occasionally consulting his Bradshaw. Aouda, for her part, watched the passing scenery with a mixture of curiosity and apprehension, still recovering from the ordeal she had recently faced. The rhythmic clatter of the wheels on the rails was the principal sound, occasionally interrupted by the whistle of the locomotive or the shouts of railway workers at the small stations they passed without stopping."

He would reveal nothing, not even an inadvertent clue, that might jeopardize his master's incredible wager. Fix, on his part, watched the Frenchman with narrowed eyes. He knew Passepartout held secrets, whether intentionally or not. He hoped the strain of the journey, the proximity, the sheer tension of the situation, would eventually break down the servant's reserve. He tried leading questions, feigned casual interest in Mr. Fogg's habits, but Passepartout remained frustratingly impassive, answering only in monosyllables or simply averting his gaze. This silent war of nerves continued day after day aboard the hasty steamer. The air between them was thick with unspoken suspicion and caution. Passepartout felt like a mouse being stalked by a cat, constantly aware of the predator's presence, even when the detective seemed preoccupied. He yearned for the journey's end, for the moment they would step ashore and this uncomfortable, dangerous proximity would cease. He trusted in Mr. Fogg's genius to see them through, but the detective’s shadow was a constant, chilling reminder of the stakes involved.

This section, part of the great Central Valley, offered smooth passage. The track stretched across broad plains, where vast fields, prepared for cultivation or showing early growth, dominated the view. There were no steep ascents or deep valleys to impede the train's progress, maintaining speed. Scattered trees and small settlements dotted the scenery, but the impression was expansive, open country. The journey felt swift and comfortable across this flat terrain, a stark contrast to the topography further east. Reaching Sacramento, the capital city, marked the end of this easy portion of the route. It was here that the true ascent would begin. While the path eastward from San Francisco Bay had been one of effortless speed across gentle lands, the landscape was about to change dramatically. The slight undulations would soon give way to steep gradients and formidable mountain ranges, making this initial, level stretch seem a mere prelude to the arduous Sierra Nevada crossing that awaited the travellers."

Sometimes a great herd of buffaloes, massing together in the distance, seemed like a moveable dam. These innumerable multitudes of ruminating beasts often form an insurmountable obstacle to the passage of the trains; thousands of them have been seen passing over the track for hours together, in compact ranks. The locomotive is then forced to stop and wait till the road is once more clear.\nThis happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling. About twelve o’clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to clear the way with its cow-catcher; but the mass of animals was too great. The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now and then deafening bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain.\nThe travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had the most reason of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should please the buffaloes to get out of the way.\nPassepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon them.\n“What a country!” cried he. “Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession, just as if they were not impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme! And here’s an engineer who doesn’t dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts!”\nThe engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle, and he was wise.

From this point the road, running along the Humbolt River, mounted northerly for some dozens of miles, then turned eastward, and followed the river itself up to the foot of the Rocky Mountains, - a distance of several hundred miles, which would be accomplished in the night. By observing the map, Mr. Fogg ascertained that after leaving the territory of Utah, they would pass through the territory of Wyoming, which is rich in cañons, but in general destitute of habitations, and then would traverse Nebraska, in which the railway followed the valley of the Platte River as far as Omaha. That night, the 3rd of December, the train ran over a distance of about two hundred miles, which did not prevent the travellers from sleeping soundly, save Passepartout, who took a nap at intervals, and woke with a start.At eight o’clock in the morning, the train stopped at the little station of Lodge Pole creek, in Nebraska. An Indian of the Sioux tribe, a tall, strong fellow, sprang upon the platform, and in broken English, and in a voice that carried far, exclaimed: \"Prisoners! Train attacked by Sioux! Forty miles west, at Red Creek canyon! Stop the train! Prisoners!\"\"You just keep quiet!\" cried the conductor, running up.\"Prisoners!\" repeated the Indian. \"Train taken, thirty-nine prisoners. Roll back!\"The train was full of excited passengers. Some of them had firearms, and were anxious to use them. Others were more timid, and wanted to get out. The conductor tried to restore order, and then asked the Indian: \"Are the Sioux coming this way?\"\"Yes,\" replied the Indian. \"They are coming this way. A hundred of them. They have already taken three trains.\"\"What do they want?\"\"They want to rob the trains, and scalp the passengers.\"\"What are we going to do?\"\"We are going to fight,\" said the Indian.\"We are not armed,\" said the conductor.\"We have rifles and pistols,\" said the Indian. \"We will fight them.\"\"But we are not soldiers.\"\"We are men,\" said the Indian. \"We will fight them.\"The conductor hesitated for a moment, and then said, \"All right, we will fight them.\""

Phileas Fogg read, indifferent to the view. Passepartout marveled at the West's scale and solitude from the window, seeing distant bison herds and antelopes fleeing the train. The journey was a rapid charge through wilderness. As they neared the lake, the land showed habitation signs. Scattered farms and buildings appeared, announcing proximity to Mormon territory. The approach to Salt Lake City, Deseret's capital, brought anticipation. This unique community might delay their global itinerary, a risk Fogg considered, but one that worried Passepartout."

Passepartout took one of the front seats. Neither Mr. Fogg nor Fix cared to attend.\nAt the appointed hour Elder William Hitch rose, and, in an irritated voice, as if he had already been contradicted, said, “I tell you that Joe Smith is a martyr, that his brother Hiram is a martyr, and that the persecutions of the United States Government against the prophets will also make a martyr of Brigham Young. Who dares to say the contrary?”\nNo one ventured to gainsay the missionary, whose excited tone contrasted curiously with his naturally calm visage. No doubt his anger arose from the hardships to which the Mormons were actually subjected. The government had just succeeded, with some difficulty, in reducing these independent fanatics to its rule. It had made itself master of Utah, and subjected that territory to the laws of the Union, after imprisoning Brigham Young on a charge of rebellion and polygamy. The disciples of the prophet had since redoubled their efforts, and resisted, by words at least, the authority of Congress. Elder Hitch, as is seen, was trying to make proselytes on the very railway trains.\nThen, emphasising his words with his loud voice and frequent gestures, he related the history of the Mormons from Biblical times: how that, in Israel, a Mormon prophet of the tribe of Joseph published the annals of the new religion, and bequeathed them to his son Mormon; how, many centuries later, a translation of this precious book, which was written in Egyptian, was made by Joseph Smith, junior, a Vermont farmer, who revealed himself as a mystical prophet in 1825; and how, in short, the celestial messenger appeared to him in an illuminated forest, and gave him the annals of the Lord.\nSeveral of the audience, not being much interested in the missionary’s narrative, here left the car; but Elder Hitch, continuing his lecture, related how Smith, junior, with his father, two brothers, and a few disciples, founded the church of the “Latter Day Saints,” which, adopted not only in America, but in England, Norway and Sweden, and Germany, counts many artisans, as well as men engaged in the liberal professions, among its members; how a colony was established in Ohio, a temple erected there at a cost of two hundred thousand dollars, and a town built at Kirkland; how Smith became an enterprising banker, and received from a simple mummy showman a papyrus scroll written by Abraham and several famous Egyptians.",

Subjected to the persecutions of the Government, Brigham Young has bravely proved by acts, and my disciples by martyrs, that Mormonism will triumph!\" No one contradicted him, although the Elder's excited tone contrasted singularly with his ordinarily calm appearance. The irritation was evidently due to the hard blows which Mormonism had lately received. The Government of the United States had been maintaining a vigorous war against these polygamists. It had subjugated Utah, and imprisoned Brigham Young, the Prophet and Seer, for rebellion and polygamy. The wives of the Mormons had been scattered, and it was difficult to reassemble the faithful. Up to 1850, the Mormons had been in a state of rebellion against the law. The annexation of Utah to the Union had not put a stop to their licentious habits. Congress had in vain tried to check polygamy, which is practised by the Mormons. They had hitherto defied the law, and maintained their territory as an independent one, but the railroad had at last brought them within the pale of civilisation. A great number of soldiers had been sent to Utah, and the Mormons had been compelled to submit. Such was the state of affairs, and it was easy to understand the Elder's irritation. The Mormons, in fact, were no longer able to resist the Government. They were obliged to obey the law, and to give up polygamy. The Elder, who was a man of about forty years of age, with a fine face, and black beard, was a powerful speaker. He spoke with a loud voice, and with animated gestures. He recounted the history of Mormonism from its origin. He said that, in 1825, a heavenly messenger appeared to Joseph Smith, Jr., and gave him the annals of the Lord. These annals, a sacred record, were discovered by Smith in a forest, in the form of a golden bible, and were translated by this prophet.

Thus the divine work has been accomplished in America. The Elder then spoke of the founding of the church, of its international growth, of the professions of its members, of the establishment of a colony in Ohio, of the building of a magnificent temple, which cost two hundred thousand dollars, in the town of Kirkland, and of the acquisition of an ancient papyrus, found in the catacombs of Thebes, and containing the writings of Abraham and the patriarchs.

Passepartout was among the thirty, having comfortably seated himself on one of the benches. Mr. Fogg and Fix had not troubled themselves about the matter. At the appointed hour, Elder William Hitch began to speak in an irritated voice. He proclaimed Joe and Hiram Smith martyrs, and suggested that Brigham Young would also become one, due to the persecutions of the United States Government. He defied any one to contradict him. No one contradicted him, although the Elder's excited tone contrasted singularly with his ordinarily calm appearance. The irritation was evidently due to the hard blows which Mormonism had lately received. The Government of the United States had been maintaining a vigorous war against these polygamists. It had subjugated Utah, and imprisoned Brigham Young, the Prophet and Seer, for rebellion and polygamy. The Mormons, since 1850, when Utah was annexed to the Union, had been in a state of rebellion against the law. Congress had in vain tried to check polygamy, which is practised by the Mormons. They had hitherto defied the law, and maintained their territory as an independent one, but the railroad had at last brought them within the pale of civilisation. A great number of soldiers had been sent to Utah, and the Mormons had been compelled to submit. Such was the state of affairs, and it was easy to understand the Elder's irritation. The Mormons, in fact, were no longer able to resist the Government. They were obliged to obey the law, and to give up polygamy. The disciples, whose numbers were increasing, and who were scattered over the whole earth, redoubled their efforts, and sought to make converts on the railway trains. The Elder, who was a man of about forty years of age, with a fine face, and black beard, was a powerful speaker. He spoke with a loud voice, and with animated gestures. He recounted the history of Mormonism from its origin. He said that, in 1825, a heavenly messenger appeared to Joseph Smith, Jr., and gave him the annals of the Lord. These annals, a sacred record, were discovered by Smith in a forest, in the form of a golden bible, and were translated by this prophet. This book teaches that a part of the human family was created in America, and that with it the true faith was established. It relates the adventures of two families of Israelites, who, about the time of the first destruction of Jerusalem, were inspired to emigrate to America. One of these families, the Nephites, remained faithful to the religious law, but the other, the Lamanites, gave themselves up to idolatry, and became savages. Thus the divine work has been accomplished in America. The Elder then spoke of the founding of the church, of its international growth, of the professions of its members, of the establishment of a colony in Ohio, of the building of a magnificent temple, which cost two hundred thousand dollars, in the town of Kirkland, and of the acquisition of an ancient papyrus, found in the catacombs of Thebes, and containing the writings of Abraham and the patriarchs. He also recounted the persecutions to which the Mormons had been subjected, the assassination of Joseph Smith and his brother Hiram, and the exodus of the faithful to Utah, under the leadership of Brigham Young. A few people had left during the lecture, but about twenty still remained. The Elder continued to address his audience, and to boast of the marvels of Mormonism, of its power, of its increasing numbers, and of its perfect organization. He said that, thanks to the railroad, the Mormons could come to Utah from all parts of the United States, and that they were now in a better position than ever. He spoke of the founding of the city of Nauvoo, in Illinois, of the building of a magnificent temple, and of the acquisition of an ancient papyrus, found in the catacombs of Thebes, and containing the writings of Abraham and the patriarchs. He also recounted the persecutions to which the Mormons had been subjected, the assassination of Joseph Smith and his brother Hiram, and the exodus of the faithful to Utah, under the leadership of Brigham Young.",

The car was a sort of drawing-room on wheels, provided with comfortable seats, which could be converted into beds, and furnished with a supply of necessaries of life – to wit, comforts – as if the travellers had been in a first-class hotel. The party from the steamer occupied seats together: Fogg, Aouda, Passepartout, and Fix. Other passengers included Englishmen, Americans, military officers, merchants, and even some of those emigrants who were colonizing the vast territories of the West. It was a motley but quiet assembly, all sharing the common goal of reaching the Pacific coast. The train started at full speed, crossing the State of Nebraska. The country was slightly undulating, well cultivated in its lower part, and covered with vast forests. The track ran for a long time parallel to the winding course of the Platte River. The locomotive whistled loudly and often, as if impatient of the monotonous landscape, though it was hardly monotonous to the eager eyes of Passepartout, who devoured the scenery with the speed at which it unfolded. This powerful iron horse seemed capable of conquering any distance. Meals were served on board, in a dining-car splendidly decorated, and provided with excellent food; and the sleeping cars were comfortable and clean. Everything was so well arranged that Passepartout might have fancied he was travelling at the expense of the government of the United States, experiencing the ultimate in transatlantic railway travel. During the first day, the train ran through fertile plains, broken by occasional woods and streams. The passengers conversed, read, or gazed out of the windows. Aouda was particularly interested in the changing views. Fix remained largely in his seat, observing Fogg, ever watchful for an opportunity or a signal to act. Mr. Fogg, as usual, was perfectly calm, reading a book or simply sitting in his corner, his eyes fixed on the passing scene, yet seemingly detached from it, secure in his schedule. As evening approached, the scenery began to change. The plains gave way to higher ground, and distant blue lines on the horizon suggested the approach of mountains. The air grew cooler. Passepartout marvelled at the speed with which they traversed such immense distances. He calculated that if the train maintained this average, they would easily reach San Francisco by the date and hour fixed. The rhythm of the wheels on the track became a steady lullaby, accompanying the journey into the night. The train slowed occasionally at stations, but the stops were brief, just long enough to take on water or fuel, or exchange a few passengers. Then the whistle would blow again, and they would resume their swift, westward course, leaving the settled regions behind and plunging deeper into the vast, wild heart of the continent, propelled by steam towards their destination."

Even the most polite among the passengers occasionally suppressed a yawn, their faces betraying a desperate longing for the story to conclude. The Elder, however, seemed oblivious to the declining numbers and the general malaise, perhaps genuinely believing he held the rapt attention of a multitude, or perhaps simply determined to finish his tale regardless of whether anyone was listening.

It is seventy miles long and thirty-five wide, and is situated about 3,800 feet above the level of the sea. Its elevation, combined with the remarkable drought of the air, causes a pretty constant evaporation, which lowers the level of the lake by five feet a year. Thus, the lake, though of considerable extent, is gradually shrinking, and consequently increasing its salt density, as the fresh-water streams do not carry off the accumulated salts. The lake is really extremely salt, and contains twenty-four per cent, of solid matter in the form of diverse salts, or four times as much as the parent ocean. Its specific weight is 1,170. The water is so saturated with salt that fishes are unable to live in it. Those which descend from the Jordan, the Weber, and other streams, perish very soon. For the same reason, birds, such as gulls and wild ducks, make it their favourite haunt, as there is no supply of fish to tempt other winged creatures.

There were many women, which was easily accounted for by the “peculiar institution” of the Mormons; but it must not be supposed that all the Mormons are polygamists. They are free to marry or not, as they please; but it is worth noting that it is mainly the female citizens of Utah who are anxious to marry, as, according to the Mormon religion, maiden ladies are not admitted to the possession of its highest joys.

The town, however, was peculiar from its population, consisting almost exclusively of Mormons. Phileas Fogg paid little attention to this; he knew the religious opinions of people mattered little to him, so long as they did not impede his journey. Passepartout, however, was much interested in the city’s inhabitants and their ways. He observed the clean, wide streets and the orderly houses, reflecting the strict organization of the community under Brigham Young, the Prophet. The institution of polygamy, then prevalent, also caught his attention, viewed with a mixture of curiosity and moral disapproval common among non-Mormons of the time, much as described in the narrative. Despite its singular customs, Salt Lake City presented an image of considerable prosperity, born from the industry of its settlers transforming a barren land into a fertile valley. Their two hours passed quickly amidst these novel sights. Having satisfied their brief curiosity and taken in the atmosphere of this unique Western settlement, Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout returned to the branch line station. They boarded the connecting train back to Ogden, arriving well before the departure time of the Pacific Railroad train. After rejoining their car and confirming their onward journey arrangements, they were ready to resume their race against time across the American continent, leaving the singular city behind as the train prepared to depart on schedule, pressing ever eastward towards their final destination."

Tunnels pierced the rock, bridges spanned gorges. The landscape grew wilder, the air thinner, as the train climbed towards the continental divide. Peak after peak rose majestically, covered in pine forests. Soon, they reached the highest point of the line, Summit Pass, 7,945 feet above sea level. From there, the descent began towards the vast plains stretching endlessly eastward. The rugged mountains gave way to rolling hills, and then to the immense, treeless expanse of the American prairie. The train gathered speed, rushing across this ocean of grass, a lifeline connecting the coasts. Buffalo herds were occasionally seen in the distance, dark masses against the horizon, remnants of a disappearing wilderness. The ease and speed of this transit were astonishing, a testament to human ingenuity, carrying Passepartout and Phileas Fogg swiftly towards their next rendezvous with time."

The next day, 7th December, they stopped for a quarter of an hour at Green River station. Snow had fallen abundantly during the night, but, being mixed with rain, it had half melted, and did not interrupt their progress. The bad weather, however, annoyed Passepartout; for the accumulation of snow, by blocking the wheels of the cars, would certainly have been fatal to Mr. Fogg’s tour.\n“What an idea!” he said to himself. “Why did my master make this journey in winter? Couldn’t he have waited for the good season to increase his chances?”\nWhile the worthy Frenchman was absorbed in the state of the sky and the depression of the temperature, Aouda was experiencing fears from a totally different cause.\nSeveral passengers had got off at Green River, and were walking up and down the platforms; and among these Aouda recognised Colonel Stamp Proctor, the same who had so grossly insulted Phileas Fogg at the San Francisco meeting. Not wishing to be recognised, the young woman drew back from the window, feeling much alarm at her discovery. She was attached to the man who, however coldly, gave her daily evidences of the most absolute devotion. She did not comprehend, perhaps, the depth of the sentiment with which her protector inspired her, which she called gratitude, but which, though she was unconscious of it, was really more than that. Her heart sank within her when she recognised the man whom Mr. Fogg desired, sooner or later, to call to account for his conduct.

From this station they had passed into the same latitude as London, and would follow the forty-second parallel to the Pacific. The weather had become cold. There was a little snow mixed with rain, but it was a light moist snow, which could not impede the train’s progress. However, Passepartout was not without anxiety, for the prolongation of the storm, and the fall in the temperature, portended evil. He was right. With the first rays of morning, the train entered upon the vast plain of Laramie. The country was covered with snow, which, six inches deep, gave it the appearance of a white sheet. The sky was a leaden colour, and the flakes were still falling thickly. Passepartout, beholding this vast white ex- panse, could not repress a movement of serious anxiety. But Phileas Fogg did not seem to observe the state of the heavens. He was going on with his meal, though they were now getting only a simple breakfast, eggs and bacon, without toast or tea, which the American road does not furnish in perfection. Mr. Fogg and Aouda ate their breakfast without a word. Passepartout devoured his, and did not cease from looking out of the window. Aouda was also watching the arid plain, and felt a sort of dread at the thought of accomplishing the journey through this interminable winter, in this deso- late country. Sometimes she turned to Mr. Fogg, and gazed at him with a look of profound tenderness, but, overcome by his im- movable serenity, his imperturbable composure, she relapsed into silence. Passepartout would have liked to accost the conductor, and in- quire if the train was likely to be delayed. But he was restrained by a certain pride, which sealed his lips. Besides, the conductor could not well make any satisfactory reply. The best thing was to let the train go on. About eight o’clock, a station was reached. He thought Mr. Fogg would alight, and make inquiries, but he did not stir. Passepartout was seized with a violent desire to cry out, ‘This is too much! I shall not be surprised if we are snowed up here!’ But he did not utter a syllable. The train stopped at Medicine Bow, where they laid in a stock of fuel. This was at eleven o’clock, and the snow lay a foot deep. An hour later, we crossed the highest point of the road, at Black Summit, 7,524 feet above the level of the sea, one of the highest points attained by a railway in the habitable world. In a few hours, they would be crossing the Rocky Mountains. At midday, the train descended into the valley of Green River. At three o’clock, it reached Evanston, and there the snow was ten feet deep, and had been for two days. This was beginning to be serious, and the railway cars felt it. The locomotive toiled with difficulty, and the train advanced very slowly. It arrived, however, without accident at Laramie, at seven o’clock in the evening. There the snow was eleven feet deep, and the delay would be ten hours. A notice was posted at the station, stating that the train was behind time on account of the heavy snow, and that the departure would be at five o’clock next morning. This notice, though it did not formally an- nounce that the train would not arrive at New York in time, gave Passepartout a lively alarm. He began to think the journey was lost. He felt like crying. At first Aouda was alarmed, but she saw that Mr. Fogg was not, and she was reassured. Mr. Fogg had anticipated delays, and he was not surprised that they occurred. A man so pre- cise and phlegmatic as he could not be otherwise than prepared for any event. He did not worry. This time, however, Passepartout resolved to make an effort, and to try and induce Mr. Fogg to use caution. He had been very imprudent during the journey, but he had not yet re- ceived any serious blow. He felt that he must now try, at least, to give him warning. He approached Mr. Fogg, and began in a trem- bling voice: ‘Sir, the snow is very deep, and it is still falling. We are ten hours behind time.’ ‘I know it,’ said Mr. Fogg calmly. ‘I know it. But we must go on. We cannot remain here.’ ‘But, sir, what if we are snowed up here? It is very likely.’ ‘I know it. But we must go on.’ ‘But, sir, we cannot.’ ‘Passepartout, I tell you we must go on.’ Passepartout did not dare to insist further. He knew that it was useless. He would have liked to ask Mr. Fogg if he intended to give up the journey, but he did not dare to do so. He thought it would be better to wait. He did not know what to think. The train stopped at Green River station. It was about eight o’clock. The snow was now twelve feet deep. The delay was fifteen hours. This time, Passepartout was quite disheartened. He felt sure that the journey was lost. He resolved to ask Mr. Fogg if he intended to give up. He approached him again, and began in a trembling voice: ‘Sir, the snow is very deep, and it is still falling. We are fifteen hours behind time.’ ‘I know it,’ said Mr. Fogg calmly. ‘But we must go on. We cannot remain here.’ ‘But, sir, what if we are snowed up here?’ ‘I know it.

As the train stopped at Green River station, Aouda, looking out of the window, beheld, among the passengers on the platform, Colonel Stamp Proctor, the man who had insulted Mr. Fogg in San Francisco. Deeply alarmed, she quickly drew back, lest she should be recognised. Her heart beat violently. Her feelings towards Phileas Fogg, whom she owed so much, and whose undemonstrative but constant devotion she could not mistake, were deepening, and perhaps passing into other sentiments than gratitude. Her imagination did not depict Mr. Fogg as a mere frigid automaton, activated by springs and wheels. She had come to see in him a man with heart and soul, whose chivalrous generos- ity she could not but admire. When he was so near the goal, would he be stopped by this wretch, Colonel Proctor, on whose track he was, perhaps, himself. Proctor’s presence was doubtless due to chance; but chance is often the helpmate of crime. Should the Colonel recognise Mr. Fogg, he would not fail to force a quarrel upon him, and the consequence of a struggle might be fatal to Phileas Fogg’s journey. Aouda had a sudden inspiration. She would tell Mr. Fogg all that she knew. She knew that he was a man of courage, and that he would not be deterred by the danger. But she knew also that he was a man of prudence, and that he would not expose himself to useless risks. She would tell him, and he would decide what to do.

The region traversed was dreary and barren, presenting a singular aspect of desolation. The vast plains stretched out on either side, seemingly endless, covered with parched, yellowish grass and dotted only by sparse clumps of sagebrush. The air was dry and keen. The line followed the serpentine course of Bitter Creek, winding through the monotonous landscape. Around eight o'clock in the morning, as the train sped onward, a peculiar sight appeared in the distance ahead. It seemed as if the plain itself was in motion. The engineers slowed the train, and soon the astonishing spectacle became clear: an immense herd of buffalo was crossing the track. It was a colossal living stream, tens of thousands strong, filling the entire plain as far as the eye could see. The buffalo, driven by some instinct, were moving southwards in an irresistible mass. It was impossible for the train to proceed. The engineers applied the brakes, bringing the locomotive to a complete halt. The passengers, thrilled and astonished by this extraordinary natural impediment, rushed to the windows and the platforms to witness the incredible sight. Some, including a few American hunters on board, became excited and attempted to shoot at the periphery of the herd, but the distance and the moving mass made it largely futile and dangerous. The great herd continued its slow, ponderous crossing of the railway line, seemingly indifferent to the stopped train. There was nothing to be done but wait. The crossing of the herd took hours. The stream of animals seemed inexhaustible. Mr. Fogg, maintaining his usual composure, simply noted the interruption and the potential delay it would cause to his carefully planned itinerary. Passepartout, however, was utterly fascinated by the sheer scale of the wildlife spectacle. The sun climbed higher, and still the buffalo passed. It was not until nearly noon that the last stragglers of the colossal herd had finally cleared the track, allowing the train, now significantly delayed, to resume its journey westward."

Her voice was hushed, a mixture of surprise and gratitude evident in her tone. She had seen Sir Francis Cromarty, their companion during the arduous journey through India, on board the steamer Rangoon. It was a brief, unexpected encounter on the deck the previous evening. Sir Francis, equally astonished, had expressed his relief at seeing her safe and in such good company. He had inquired about Mr. Fogg's health and the progress of their remarkable global tour. Aouda recounted their swift journey from Calcutta, highlighting Mr. Fogg's unwavering precision and the strange, almost inevitable sequence of events that seemed to propel them forward. Fix listened intently, his mind surely calculating how this chance meeting might affect his own covert plans. Passepartout beamed, delighted that Aouda had met a friendly face from their past adventures. The sea was calm, the ship cutting through the waves towards the Malacca Strait, each hour bringing them closer to Singapore and the next leg of their race against time. Aouda's sighting, a small human connection in their whirlwind journey, provided a brief respite from the relentless ticking of the clock that governed Mr. Fogg's every move. She finished her account, a wistful look in her eyes, before glancing towards the cabin where the impassive gentleman slept, unaware of the shared secret among his companions."

It ought not to be a difficult task, since that gentleman was naturally sedentary and little curious.

I have neither cards nor partners.”\n“Oh, but we can easily buy some cards, for they are sold on all the American trains. And as for partners, if madam plays—”\n“Certainly, sir,” Aouda quickly replied; “I understand whist. It is part of an English education.”\n“I myself have some pretensions to playing a good game. Well, here are three of us, and a dummy—”\n“As you please, sir,” replied Phileas Fogg, heartily glad to resume his favourite pastime even on the railway.\nPassepartout was dispatched in search of the steward, and soon returned with two packs of cards, some pins, counters, and a shelf covered with cloth.\nThe game commenced. Aouda understood whist sufficiently well, and even received some compliments on her playing from Mr. Fogg.

Passepartout, seated opposite him on the deck of the *Rangoon*, watched the churning wake disappear towards the horizon, his usual ebullience somewhat dampened by worry of missing a date or suffering an unforeseen delay. Since leaving Calcutta, and the fortunate rescue of Aouda, who now sat silently beside Mr. Fogg, watching the distant waves, the nature of their journey had subtly shifted. It was no longer merely a race against time for a bet; it had acquired a layer of human responsibility, a delicate charge to deliver Aouda safely to her relative in Hong Kong. Fix, the detective, hovered perpetually at the edges of their group, his presence a constant shadow. He observed them with a mixture of frustration and reluctant admiration. He saw Fogg's unwavering calm, Passepartout’s restless energy, and Aouda’s quiet dignity. His warrant was useless now; he had missed the opportunity in British India. Hong Kong was British territory, but he needed the warrant from London re-issued, a process that felt glacially slow compared to Fogg's relentless pace. He paced the deck, his thoughts a turmoil of duty and desperation. Fogg looked up from his notebook. \"We shall make excellent time,\" he stated, his voice even. \"Barring unforeseen circumstances, we should arrive in Hong Kong by the 31st of October. That gives us sufficient margin.\" Passepartout brightened slightly. Fix, overhearing, inwardly cursed the man's precision. He knew Fogg was innocent of the bank robbery, but his orders were clear. He must arrest him. The closer they got to their final destination, the more likely Fogg was to disappear, the bet won, the detective foiled. The sea wind whipped around them, carrying the scent of salt and distant lands, a reminder of the immense distance still to be covered, and the precious few days remaining to complete the impossible circuit around the world."

The horizon on the north and east was bounded by the rounded curve of the range which extends northward to Laramie Peak, one of the highest summits of the Rocky Mountains. Between this range and the railway were spread immense plains, plentifully irrigated. On the south, or to the right of the train, the lower spurs extended away to the sources of the Arkansas River, one of the great tributaries of the Missouri. The southern portion of the Rocky Mountains formed a semi-circular curtain on the horizon.",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion does not invent any major events or scenes, and it generally follows the structure of the original passage. However, there is a reordering of geographical features and directions that alters the original sequence.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the specific mention of the semi-circular shape of the mountain curtain on the horizon, which is a notable descriptive element in the original.\n- There is a lack of explicit reference to the directionality of the mountain mass extending southward, as described in the original.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion suggests the train travels two hundred miles after reaching Bridger Pass before descending, whereas the original links the two hundred miles to the total distance traveled before reaching the plains, not after the pass.\n- The description of the horizon and the placement of Laramie Peak is inaccurate; the completion changes the orientation and relationship of the mountain ranges and peaks compared to the original.\n- The completion misattributes the direction of the lower spurs, placing them to the south rather than to the right, and does not accurately reflect the original's spatial relationships between the railway, plains, and mountain features.\n- There is a shift in the description of the plains, with the completion emphasizing their level surface rather than their suitability for the railway as described in the original."

A few minutes more would bring them across the frontier of Colorado Territory. In this locality, the engineers of the railway had had difficulty in surmounting the obstacles offered by the ground, and hence their long and tortuous course, following the valley of the South Platte River, instead of crossing the plains by the most direct line from Omaha. The valley of the South Platte is between Fort D. A. Russell and Henley, two forts built by the government of the United States, and situated southward of the railway. At this point, the travellers had a wide view of the immense plain, which extended to the north and west as far as the eye could see, across which could be vaguely seen the rising summer vapours of the Wyoming Territory..."

The Rocky Mountains had been safely passed, and not without some puffs of wind and squalls of snow, the latter more abundant on the eastern than on the western slope. The travellers had now reason to hope that no delays, caused by weather, would henceforth impede their progress. The air was sharp and cold.

Fogg was not aware that this territory was occupied by Indians, and had no time to learn. The Sioux are intrepid warriors, and were at that time on the war path against the government. While the train was passing, they were not accustomed to attack it; but if they had happened to meet it farther on, an attack would have been almost certain. At eight o’clock in the evening the train stopped at Medicine Bow Creek, where they were to sup and pass the night. The engineer had warned the conductor that he must be on his guard, as they were about to enter the territory of the Sioux, who were likely to waylay the train at any moment. The conductor was a man of caution, and took every precaution. He ordered the fires kept up, the lamps burning, and placed sentinels in the vicinity of the train. The travellers supped, and then returned to their car, hoping to find rest. But the night was a disturbed one. The howling of the coyotes, the rustling of leaves, the chirping of crickets, and the occasional war-cry of the Sioux, made sleep impossible. Fogg, however, slept soundly, wrapped in his rug, as if he were in his own bed. Passepartout, on the other hand, was very uneasy. He went to the window and looked out. He saw the sentinels pacing to and fro, their rifles on their shoulders. He saw the fires blazing brightly, throwing their lurid light on the surrounding darkness. He saw the dark forms of the Indians gliding like spectres among the trees. He heard their guttural cries and their wild songs. He felt a thrill of terror run through his veins.

It is for these gentlemen to decide whether they will find some means of getting over.\" \"I propose to go afoot,\" said one of the passengers. \"In about six hours we can reach Medicine Bow station.\" \"But it is on the other side of the river,\" said the conductor. \"No doubt,\" replied the passenger, \"but we can cross it by boat.\" \"By boat, in this rapid, ten miles around, in the present state of the creek!\" cried Colonel Proctor. \"I will not allow it, I will not risk my life, and that of my companions, in this fashion.\" \"It is of no use talking,\" said the conductor; \"the bridge is not safe, and we must wait for another train.\" \"Oh, the rascals!\" cried Passepartout. \"There's not a day but there's some accident.

They reached it on foot, and on the other side were a dozen vehicles, palanquins, ponies, etc., waiting for them. Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty took a car, and Fix and Passepartout a sort of four-wheeled cart drawn by two oxen. The whole party were soon in motion, and the travellers passed through a country full of tigers, which fled at the noise of the cart, save when they were in such numbers that the drivers had to use their revolvers. This happened frequently, and Sir Francis Cromarty, who knew the country well, advised Mr. Fogg to keep his revolver in readiness. Phileas Fogg coolly replied that he had no revolver, but that he would buy one when they reached Allahabad. He was not a man to be caught unprepared, and he was resolved to be ready for anything that might happen. The travellers proceeded at a slow rate, making but a short distance on their way. At ten o\rsquo;clock they arrived at the village of Kallian, where they stopped for the night, at a comfortable bungalow. Sir Francis Cromarty, who was a perfect gentleman, offered to share his room with Mr. Fogg, but the latter preferred to occupy a separate apartment, and he took care to pay for it beforehand. The next morning, they resumed their journey at six o\rsquo;clock, and arrived at Allahabad at four in the afternoon. The train for Calcutta was not to leave till the evening, so they had time to dine and walk about the town. Allahabad is one of the principal cities of India, and is situated at the confluence of the Ganges and the Jumna, two of the largest rivers in the country. It is a sacred city for the Hindoos, who come in great numbers to bathe in the holy waters. Mr. Fogg, who was not a religious man, did not seem to be impressed by the sanctity of the place, but he was interested in its commerce and industry, and he visited the principal markets and factories. He also went to the post office, to see if there were any letters for him, but there were none. While Mr. Fogg was thus employed, Fix and Passepartout were exploring the city in their own way. Fix, who was still suspicious of Mr. Fogg, was trying to find out something about him,"

The engineer, a sinewy man clad in oil-stained overalls, gestured emphatically towards the track ahead. \"She's broken down, son,\" he declared, his voice thick with a Texan drawl. \"A section of the suspension bridge over the Platte River is unstable. Been inspected this mornin', deemed unfit for traffic. We gotta wait for the repair crew to shore her up.\" Passepartout's heart sank into his boots. Wait? The word was poison to his ears, a threat to the sacred timeline Mr. Fogg had so meticulously planned. \"Wait?\" he echoed, his voice barely above a whisper, then growing louder. \"But we cannot wait! We are on a journey... a vital journey! Every hour is precious!\" The engineer regarded him with mild amusement, clearly unimpressed by the Frenchman's urgency. \"Now, now, take it easy,\" he drawled. \"Ain't nobody crossin' that bridge till it's safe. Could be a few hours, could be till sundown. These things take time.\" He squinted at the horizon. \"Repair crew's on their way, they say. But we're stuck here till they give the all-clear.\" Stuck! The word reverberated in Passepartout's head. Hours lost! He envisioned the world map in Mr. Fogg's mind, the precise lines and dates suddenly blurring, the carefully calculated trajectory veering disastrously off course. His master, the epitome of punctuality, reliant on transport schedules, was about to face an unavoidable delay imposed by a faulty bridge in the American wilderness. How would Mr. Fogg react? Would he maintain his imperturbable calm, or would this unforeseen obstacle finally crack his veneer of stoicism? Passepartout felt a wave of anxious responsibility wash over him. His job was to assist his master, to smooth the path, not to witness it being blocked by structural failures. He paced restlessly on the gravel beside the tracks, kicking at loose stones, his hands clasped behind his back, a picture of worried desperation. The vast prairie stretched around them, indifferent to their plight, the sun beating down relentlessly. He could hear the murmur of discontented passengers, the hiss of steam from the idling locomotive, but all he could truly perceive was the relentless ticking of his internal clock, counting down the precious seconds slipping away. The eighty days felt suddenly much shorter, the goal incredibly distant. He glanced towards Mr. Fogg's carriage, wondering if his master was aware of the situation, or if he was calmly immersed in his game of whist, oblivious to the potential disaster unfolding outside. The thought added another layer to his already considerable anxiety. He sighed deeply, feeling utterly helpless."

The general sentiment, expressed loudly and frequently in the clubs, on the Stock Exchange, and in drawing-rooms, was that Mr. Phileas Fogg was mad. The eighty days were considered a laughable impossibility. Calculations were made and published, demonstrating conclusively that the proposed itinerary, even assuming no delays whatsoever—a ridiculously optimistic assumption for travel through remote and undeveloped parts of the world—required a speed and precision of connections that simply did not exist. Experts cited breakdowns of machinery, unexpected storms at sea, native uprisings, missing train connections, and a thousand other potential hindrances that could easily consume the entire allotted time. The notion of traversing continents and oceans with the regularity of clockwork was deemed absurd. Every hour gained in one leg of the journey, it was argued, could be lost twice over by an unforeseen incident in the next. The vastness of the world, so easily encompassed by a line on a map, was a formidable reality when confronted by inadequate infrastructure and the capriciousness of elements and human affairs. Consequently, the wager was not merely doubted; it was universally condemned as the folly of an eccentric gentleman, and everyone waited with certainty for the inevitable news of his premature return or complete failure."

The road here attained the highest elevation of the journey, eight thousand and ninety-two feet above the level of the sea. The travellers had now only to descend to the Atlantic by limitless plains, levelled by nature. A branch of the “grand trunk” led off southward to Denver, the capital of Colorado. The country round about is rich in gold and silver, and more than fifty thousand inhabitants are already settled there.\nThirteen hundred and eighty-two miles had been passed over from San Francisco, in three days and three nights; four days and nights more would probably bring them to New York. Phileas Fogg was not as yet behind-hand.\nDuring the night Camp Walbach was passed on the left; Lodge Pole Creek ran parallel with the road, marking the boundary between the territories of Wyoming and Colorado. They entered Nebraska at eleven, passed near Sedgwick, and touched at Julesburg, on the southern branch of the Platte River.\nIt was here that the Union Pacific Railroad was inaugurated on the 23rd of October, 1867, by the chief engineer, General Dodge. Two powerful locomotives, carrying nine cars of invited guests, amongst whom was Thomas C. Durant, vice-president of the road, stopped at this point; cheers were given, the Sioux and Pawnees performed an imitation Indian battle, fireworks were let off, and the first number of the Railway Pioneer was printed by a press brought on the train. Thus was celebrated the inauguration of this great railroad, a mighty instrument of progress and civilisation, thrown across the desert, and destined to link together cities and towns which do not yet exist. The whistle of the locomotive, more powerful than Amphion’s lyre, was about to bid them rise from American soil.\nFort McPherson was left behind at eight in the morning, and three hundred and fifty-seven miles had yet to be traversed before reaching Omaha. The road followed the capricious windings of the southern branch of the Platte River, on its left bank. At nine the train stopped at the important town of North Platte, built between the two arms of the river, which rejoin each other around it and form a single artery, a large tributary, whose waters empty into the Missouri a little above Omaha.\nThe one hundred and first meridian was passed.",

There was a branch line from Evans Pass to Denver, the capital of Colorado, a new state, singularly rich in gold and silver mines, which has but lately been constituted, and already numbers two thousand inhabitants. Thus far the train had passed over thirteen hundred and eighty-two miles from San Francisco, in three days and three nights. It is true that the trip had been a rapid one, but it must be remembered that the locomotive is not impeded by snow during the summer. The four days and four nights still remaining, according to the estimates, were sufficient for the attainment of New York. Phileas Fogg was therefore still on time. The train, having passed Camp Walbach during the night, entered upon the vast plains of Nebraska, at ten o'clock in the morning, by the valley of Lodge Pole Creek, which is the boundary between Wyoming and Colorado, a little to the north of the forty-first parallel. It passed near Sedgwick, and came to Julesburg, a town on the Platte River, a large tributary of the Missouri. It was at Julesburg, which they reached at ten P.M., that the railway was inaugurated on the 23rd October, 1867. The locomotives, decorated with streamers, had brought from Omaha, the capital of Nebraska, crowds of officials, among whom was Thomas C. Durant, vice-president of the road, and a number of special journalists. Speeches were delivered, and the Sioux and Pawnees, dressed in their war costumes, had given an imitation battle; fireworks had been set off, and the first number of the Railway Pioneer, a newspaper printed by a press brought upon the train, had been distributed. The locomotive, with its great funnel, its cow-catcher, and its bell, seemed a monster breathing fire and smoke, and its whistle, like Amphion’s lyre, was about to people these American solitudes. At ten P.M., the train stopped at Julesburg, and started again across the dark plains of Nebraska, following the Platte River, whose windings it followed on its left bank. At midnight, it passed near Fort McPherson, and at seven in the morning, it reached the town of North Platte, situated between the two arms of the river of the same name, the South Fork and the North Fork. Here, at the hundred and first meridian, they were still three hundred and fifty-seven miles from Omaha.",

At this point, the track reached its highest altitude, 8,000 feet above sea level. The air thinned, and the cold bit sharper, despite the enclosed carriages. Outside, the vast, desolate landscape of the Rocky Mountains unfolded, a panorama of snow-capped peaks, deep ravines, and stunted pine forests. The train, a marvel of modern engineering, seemed a fragile thread against the immensity of nature. The gradient became less severe after Evans Pass, but the curves grew more frequent and abrupt as the line wound its way down the eastern slope towards the vast plains. Inside the carriage, the passengers, bundled against the cold, conversed in low tones or gazed out at the rapidly darkening scenery. Phileas Fogg remained impassive, his eyes fixed on the hands of his watch, meticulously noting their progress. Passepartout, however, found it impossible not to be captivated by the wild grandeur outside. He pressed his face against the glass, marveling at the sheer scale of the mountains and the silence of the wilderness, broken only by the rhythmic clatter of the wheels on the track and the whistle of the locomotive echoing through the valleys. They passed through small, isolated stations – mere clusters of wooden buildings surrounded by emptiness – where brief stops were made to take on water or wood for the engine. Each stop was a reminder of the isolation of this frontier region. The night wore on, and the mountainous terrain gradually gave way to rolling hills and then, almost imperceptibly, to the endless flatness of the Great Plains. The stars emerged in a brilliant, unpolluted sky, offering a dazzling spectacle above the dark, featureless land. The speed of the train increased slightly as the gradients eased. Passengers settled down to sleep, rocked by the motion of the carriage. Fogg, ever vigilant, seemed merely to rest his eyes, ready to consult his timetable at the slightest deviation. Passepartout, after hours of watching the passing landscape, eventually succumbed to sleep, dreaming of prairie dogs and buffalo. By morning, they were well into the plains, the mountains a distant memory on the western horizon. The landscape was monotonous but vast, stretching to infinity under a pale dawn sky. The train continued its relentless journey eastward, carrying its passengers towards their varied destinations, none perhaps as pressing or as extraordinary as that of the quiet English gentleman and his devoted French valet, hurrying towards Omaha and the next stage of their incredible race against time around the world."

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces invented dialogue and motivations at the beginning, such as references to a previous altercation involving Fix and a claim that Fogg prevented a duel, which are not present in the original.\n- The sequence of the challenge and the discussion about satisfaction is altered, with Fix's involvement and the order of confrontations differing from the original structure.\n- The completion omits the negotiation about the timing and location of the duel, including the back-and-forth about meeting in six months or ten years, which is a significant part of the original passage.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the detailed exchange regarding the specific cards played and the dispute over the suit, which is present in the original.\n- The original includes a section where Fogg asserts the affair is his alone, dismissing Fix's attempt to intervene, which is not fully represented in the completion.\n- The negotiation about the urgency of Fogg's travel and the impact of any delay is missing.\n- The original contains a sequence where Fogg asks about the American's destination and is told about Plum Creek, with a brief explanation of the stop's duration and the possibility for a duel, which is only partially included in the completion.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion attributes motivations and emotional states (such as Proctor being 'half-mad with rage') that are not specified in the original.\n- The order of events is changed, with Fix's challenge to Proctor occurring earlier and in a different context than in the original.\n- The completion inaccurately presents the challenge for satisfaction as being more general and less tied to the specific insult over the card game.\n- The completion omits the polite and formal tone of Fogg's statements about arranging the duel and his reasons for urgency, instead making the exchange more confrontational and less nuanced.\n- The final preparations for the duel and the American's insolent remark are condensed and lack the original's detail about the timing and location."

            "prefix-probing": "Stamp Proctor and Phileas Fogg recognised each other at once. It was the American who had been involved in the tumultuous meeting in San Francisco, whom Fogg had unhesitatingly and coolly thrashed with his cane. Proctor, seeing Fogg in the lobby of the St. Nicholas Hotel, felt the old rage resurface, hot and immediate. He strode forward, his face flushed with anger. Phileas Fogg, meanwhile, having just disembarked from the wretched *Henrietta* after its fiery, coal-consuming voyage and brief transformation into a purely sailing vessel, was preoccupied with securing passage to Europe. He had arrived at the hotel with Passepartout and the lovely Aouda, weary but driven by the relentless ticking of the clock. He had perhaps half an hour to settle his affairs before hastening to the Cunard pier. Proctor’s voice boomed, cutting through the quiet bustle of the hotel lobby. “Mr. Fogg!” he roared, stopping the Englishman in his tracks. “We meet again!” Fogg turned, his expression as calm and unruffled as ever, acknowledging the man he had last seen under very different circumstances. \"Sir?\" he inquired, his tone polite but distant. Proctor stepped closer, his fists clenched. \"You remember San Francisco, do you? And my face?\" he challenged. \"I have not forgotten it, sir,\" Fogg replied evenly, as if discussing a minor business transaction. \"I recall our previous encounter.\" \"And you recall the insult you offered me?\" Proctor pressed, his voice rising. \"An insult,\" Fogg confirmed, without apology or change of countenance. \"Well, I demand satisfaction!\" Proctor declared loudly. \"You will fight me, here and now!\" Aouda looked on with apprehension, and Passepartout shifted nervously, anticipating trouble. Fogg, however, remained perfectly still. \"I am quite willing to give you satisfaction, sir,\" Fogg stated, his gaze steady. \"But not at this precise moment. I have urgent business to attend to. I am arranging my departure for Europe.\" Proctor was taken aback by the composed response. He had expected denial, or perhaps a show of fear. But Fogg’s tranquil acceptance threw him off balance. \"Departure? To Europe?\" Proctor scoffed. \"Do you intend to run away?\" \"By no means,\" Fogg answered. \"I am simply bound by a schedule. I will fight you, sir, but it must be after I have secured my passage and made the necessary arrangements. Say, in two hours? I will be at the Cunard pier. You may find me there.\" Proctor hesitated, weighing the unusual proposal. Fogg’s perfect calmness somehow disarmed his fury, though it did not extinguish it. \"Very well,\" Proctor conceded, though reluctantly. \"In two hours. At the Cunard pier. Don’t fail to be there.\" \"You may rely upon it,\" Fogg assured him. With that, Fogg turned his attention back to his pressing matters. He instructed Passepartout to see to the luggage and Madame Aouda, and then briskly approached the hotel clerk to inquire about the fastest way to reach the Cunard Line office and secure cabins on the next steamer bound for Liverpool. The duel, it seemed, would have to wait for travel arrangements to be finalised, a perfectly logical ordering of priorities in Fogg’s meticulously organised mind."

He began to reassure Aouda, telling her that blusterers were never to be feared, and begged Fix to be his second at the approaching duel, a request which the detective could not refuse. Mr. Fogg resumed the interrupted game with perfect calmness.\nAt eleven o’clock the locomotive’s whistle announced that they were approaching Plum Creek station. Mr. Fogg rose, and, followed by Fix, went out upon the platform. Passepartout accompanied him, carrying a pair of revolvers.

But, after all, as you have not had time to fight here, why not fight as we go along?”\n“That wouldn’t be convenient, perhaps, for this gentleman,” said the colonel, in a jeering tone.\n“It would be perfectly so,” replied Phileas Fogg.\n“Well, we are really in America,” thought Passepartout, “and the conductor is a gentleman of the first order!”\nSo muttering, he followed his master.",

Passepartout,” added he, “you will accompany me.”\n\n“Your honour is too good,” returned Passepartout, nonplussed. “But if you are going to fight, might it not have been better to wait till you got to England? What a wild man this Colonel Proctor is! and what a time he has chosen for coming to look for you; just at the moment you are about to…”\n\nThe train now blew its whistle, and slackened its speed.\n\n“Plum Creek!” cried the conductor.\n\nMr. Fogg and Fix, followed by Passepartout, alighted on the ground, having in their hands their revolvers, which they had purchased at New York. Aouda remained in the car, as pale as death. The door was already a little way open upon the platform, and Colonel Proctor was there, too, with his second, a stout, husky fellow, who had an enormous moustache, and wore spectacles.\n\nBut just as Mr. Fogg was about to step from the step of the car, the conductor ran up and called out, “You can’t get off, gentleman!”\n\n“Why not?” asked Mr. Fogg.\n\n“We are twenty minutes behind time, and we are not going to stop.”\n\n“But I am going to fight a duel with this gentleman,” said Colonel Proctor.\n\n“I am very sorry,” replied the conductor, “but we are going right on. The train is whistling for starting.”\n\nThe train started, in fact, with increased speed.\n\n“The conductor is right,” said Mr. Fogg, calmly; “I cannot get off.”\n\n“I am sorry, gentlemen,” said the conductor, “the next station is ten minutes off, and we shall stop there twenty minutes.”\n\n“Well, we will fight there,” said Mr. Fogg, with his imperturbable air.\n\n“We will be there at noon,” observed Colonel Proctor, with the same coolness.\n\n“Till noon, then,” replied Mr. Fogg.\n\n“Passepartout,” said the Colonel’s second, “we will see you then.”\n\n“I will be there,” said Passepartout.\n\nThe train sped onward, and soon reached the station where they were to stop for twenty minutes. Passepartout, who had not had an opportunity of observing his master since the affair of the duel, now looked at him with intense curiosity. Mr. Fogg was as calm as ever, and Fix, who saw him pull out his watch, and heard him remark, “Two minutes past noon,” felt a strange misgiving.\n\nBut Colonel Proctor and his second were not there. The train went on.\n\n“Mr. Proctor has not come,” said Passepartout.\n\n“He is probably on the next train,” replied Mr. Fogg, imperturbably.\n\n“He will be a long time coming, then,” said Passepartout, \"for the next train won't be along for six hours.\"\n\nMr. Fogg did not reply. He resumed his game of whist with Fix. Passepartout, however, was ill at ease. He went to the door, and looked along the line. He saw nothing. He returned to his place, and sat down, saying to himself, \"This is not a duel that I can understand. It is a duel of the future, perhaps.\"\n\nThe train continued its course. At two o'clock in the afternoon, Mr. Fogg laid down his cards, and said, \"I must go to the station.\"\n\nHe went, followed by Passepartout. They found the station empty. Mr. Fogg returned to the car. “It is impossible to find him,” he said.\n\n“But what are you going to do, sir?” asked Passepartout.\n\n“Wait,” replied Mr. Fogg. “I have telegraphed to Omaha.”\n\nAt three o'clock, a telegram arrived. Mr. Fogg opened it, and read it.\n\n“He is at Omaha,” he said. “We must go on.”\n\nThe train set out at once. It arrived at Omaha at six o'clock in the evening. Mr. Fogg went to the station. He found that Colonel Proctor had left by the train for Chicago at one o'clock.\n\n“We must go on,” said Mr. Fogg.\n\n“But we have lost six hours,” said Passepartout.\n\n“No matter,” replied Mr. Fogg, calmly. “We must make up for it.”\n\nThe train for Chicago started at seven o'clock. Mr. Fogg and Passepartout took their places. Fix was with them.\n\nThe train sped along rapidly. At ten o'clock, it stopped at a small station.\n\n“Chicago!” cried the conductor.\n\nMr. Fogg alighted with his two companions. They went to the telegraph office. Mr. Fogg telegraphed to Liverpool, ordering a steamer for the next day.\n\n“Now,” said Mr. Fogg, “we must find Colonel Proctor.”\n\nThey found him at the principal hotel. Mr. Fogg went to his room.\n\n“Colonel Proctor,” said Mr. Fogg, “I have come to fight a duel with you.”\n\n“I am ready, sir,” replied the Colonel. “But we must go to a suitable place.”\n\n“This room will do,” said Mr. Fogg. “We are alone.”\n\n“But there are others here,” said the Colonel.\n\n“Let them stay,” replied Mr. Fogg. “They can be witnesses.”\n\nThe Colonel hesitated for a moment. Then he said, “Very well.”\n\nMr. Fogg and the Colonel drew their revolvers. Fix and Passepartout stood by, pale and trembling.\n\n“Are you ready, sir?” asked Mr. Fogg.\n\n“I am,” replied the Colonel.\n\n“Fire!” cried Mr. Fogg.\n\nThe two men fired at the same moment. The Colonel fell, struck in the forehead.\n\nMr. Fogg went up to him. He put his hand on his heart. It had ceased to beat.\n\n“He is dead,” said Mr. Fogg.\n\nHe turned to Fix and Passepartout. “Let us go,” he said.\n\nThey left the hotel, and went to the station. The train for New York was about to start. They took their places.\n\nThe train sped on. At seven o'clock in the morning, it arrived at New York. Mr. Fogg and his companions went to the harbour. The steamer was ready.\n\n“We will embark at once,” said Mr. Fogg.\n\nThey went on board. The steamer set sail. It arrived at Liverpool at nine o'clock in the evening.\n\nMr. Fogg and his companions landed. They went to the custom-house. They had no trouble with the customs.\n\nThey went to a hotel. Mr. Fogg ordered supper.\n\nAfter supper, he said to Fix and Passepartout, “We must go to London.”\n\n“But the train does not start till ten o'clock,” said Fix.\n\n“We will go by special train,” replied Mr. Fogg.\n\nHe ordered a special train. It started at once. It arrived at London at five o'clock in the morning.\n\nMr. Fogg and his companions went to his house in Saville Row. The door was open. They went in. They found the servants awake.\n\n“Is it you, sir?” cried the butler.\n\n“It is I, indeed,” replied Mr. Fogg. “I have come back.”\n\nThe servants surrounded him. They congratulated him on his return.\n\n“And what about the wager?” asked the butler.\n\n“I have won it,” replied Mr. Fogg.\n\n“But you have lost five days,” said the butler.\n\n“No matter,” replied Mr. Fogg. “I have saved the lady.”\n\nHe pointed to Aouda. The servants looked at her with surprise.\n\n“This is Mrs. Fogg,” said Mr. Fogg.\n\nThe servants bowed low. They welcomed their new mistress.\n\nMr. Fogg went to his study. He sat down in his armchair. He took out his watch. It was a quarter past five.\n\n“I have won,” he said.\n\nAt this moment, a knock was heard at the door. The butler went to open it. It was Fix.\n\n“Mr. Fogg,” said Fix, “I have come to ask your pardon.\n\n“For what?” asked Mr. Fogg.\n\n“For having arrested you,” replied Fix. “I was mistaken.”\n\n“It is of no consequence,” said Mr. Fogg. “But you have lost me a day.”\n\n“I know it,” replied Fix. “But I hope you will forgive me.”\n\n“It is forgiven,” said Mr. Fogg. “But you must pay the expenses of the special train.”\n\n“I will pay them,” replied Fix.\n\nHe took out his purse and paid the butler.\n\n“Now,” said Mr. Fogg, “you can go.”\n\nFix went out, crestfallen.\n\nMr. Fogg remained alone with Aouda and Passepartout.\n\n“I am very happy,” said Aouda.\n\n“So am I,” said Mr. Fogg. “But I must go to the Reform Club.”\n\n“Why?” asked Aouda.\n\n“To prove that I have won the wager,” replied Mr. Fogg.\n\nHe went to the Reform Club. He found the five gentlemen there. They were waiting for him.\n\n“Gentlemen,” said Mr. Fogg, “I have come to claim my wager.”\n\n“But you have lost,” said Sir Francis Cromarty.\n\n“No, I have not lost,” replied Mr. Fogg. “I have arrived.”\n\n“But you were due at a quarter before nine this evening,” said Stuart.\n\n“I was due at a quarter before nine this evening,” replied Mr. Fogg, “but I arrived at five o'clock this morning. I have therefore gained five days.”\n\nThe gentlemen looked at each other. They could not believe their ears.\n\n“It is impossible,” said Andrew Stuart.\n\n“It is true, nevertheless,” replied Mr. Fogg. “I have gained five days.”\n\nHe showed them his log-book. It confirmed his statement.\n\nThe gentlemen were dumbfounded. They had lost the wager.\n\n“Gentlemen,” said Mr. Fogg, “I have a proposition to make to you.”\n\n“What is it?” asked John Sullivan.\n\n“I will give you half of the wager,” replied Mr. Fogg, “if you will give me the other half.”\n\nThe gentlemen accepted. They paid Mr. Fogg half of the twenty thousand pounds. He gave them the other half.\n\n“And now,” said Mr. Fogg, “I must go and marry this lady.”\n\nHe went back to his house. He found Aouda waiting for him.\n\n“I am ready,” said Aouda.\n\n“Let us go to the church,” said Mr. Fogg.\n\nThey went to the church. The clergyman was waiting for them. He married them.\n\nAfter the marriage, they went back to Mr. Fogg’s house. They found Passepartout there.\n\n“Master,” said Passepartout, “I have a confession to make to you.”\n\n“What is it?” asked Mr. Fogg.\n\n“I have lost you a day,” replied Passepartout.\n\n“How so?” asked Mr. Fogg.\n\n“When I went to the church yesterday,” replied Passepartout, “I found that it was Sunday and not Saturday. I had made a mistake of one day.”\n\nMr. Fogg looked at him. A smile spread over his face.\n\n“You are right,” he said. “We have arrived on Saturday and not on Sunday.\n\nIt should end here based on the prompt's focus on the train scene, but I will provide the passage that *immediately* follows the provided starting phrase and describes the scene up to the train leaving.\n\n“Who knows?” replied Mr. Fogg, returning to the car as coolly as usual. “And besides,” added he, “this eventuality, not having been foreseen, does not invalidate my scheme in the least.”\n\n“But, Mr. Fogg,” said Aouda, “you cannot let this man insult you with impunity; you ought to fight.”\n\n“I am going to fight,” returned Mr. Fogg, coldly. “I have already engaged Fix as my second.”\n\n“I could not refuse him,” muttered Fix, between his teeth, with a certain vexation. “After all, this duel does not violate the regulations.”\n\n“But,” resumed Mrs. Aouda, endeavouring to take Mr. Fogg’s hand and retain him, “on the cars, in America, a duel! it is impossible!”\n\n“It is my duty,” responded Mr. Fogg. “So, pray do not disturb me. Passepartout,” added he, “you will accompany me.”\n\n“Your honour is too good,” returned Passepartout, nonplussed. “But if you are going to fight, might it not have been better to wait till you got to England? What a wild man this Colonel Proctor is! and what a time he has chosen for coming to look for you; just at the moment you are about to…”\n\nThe train now blew its whistle, and slackened its speed.\n\n“Plum Creek!” cried the conductor.\n\nMr. Fogg and Fix, followed by Passepartout, alighted on the ground, having in their hands their revolvers, which they had purchased at New York. Aouda remained in the car, as pale as death. The door was already a little way open upon the platform, and Colonel Proctor was there, too, with his second, a stout, husky fellow, who had an enormous moustache, and wore spectacles.\n\nBut just as Mr. Fogg was about to step from the step of the car, the conductor ran up and called out, “You can’t get off, gentleman!”\n\n“Why not?” asked Mr. Fogg.\n\n“We are twenty minutes behind time, and we are not going to stop.”\n\n“But I am going to fight a duel with this gentleman,” said Colonel Proctor.\n\n“I am very sorry,” replied the conductor, “but we are going right on. The train is whistling for starting.”\n\nThe train started, in fact, with increased speed.\n\n“The conductor is right,” said Mr. Fogg, calmly; “I cannot get off.”\n\n“I am sorry, gentlemen,” said the conductor, as the train rolled past the station, “but the next station is ten minutes off, and we shall stop there twenty minutes.”\n\n“Good,” said Mr. Fogg. “We will fight there.”\n\n“I’ll be there,” said Colonel Proctor.\n\nAnd the train, increasing its speed, soon passed out of sight of Plum Creek station. Passepartout was reflecting, with a chuckle, that the American conductor, with his excessive politeness, would not have been a bit surprised if, in response to his obliging offer, Colonel Proctor and Mr. Fogg had proceeded to blow each other's brains out on the platform of the cars, and were now about to engage in that diversion. “It is really a very accommodating country,” thought Passepartout. “And conductors here are very civilised.” He followed his master, quite ready for whatever was to come.",

Passepartout,” added he, “you will accompany me.”\n\n“Your honour is too good,” returned Passepartout, nonplussed. “But if you are going to fight, might it not have been better to wait till you got to England? What a wild man this Colonel Proctor is! and what a time he has chosen for coming to look for you; just at the moment you are about to…”\n\nThe train now blew its whistle, and slackened its speed.\n\n“Plum Creek!” cried the conductor.\n\nMr. Fogg and Fix, followed by Passepartout, alighted on the ground, having in their hands their revolvers, which they had purchased at New York. Aouda remained in the car, as pale as death. The door was already a little way open upon the platform, and Colonel Proctor was there, too, with his second, a stout, husky fellow, who had an enormous moustache, and wore spectacles.\n\nBut just as Mr. Fogg was about to step from the step of the car, the conductor ran up and called out, “You can’t get off, gentleman!”\n\n“Why not?” asked Mr. Fogg.\n\n“We are twenty minutes behind time, and we are not going to stop.”\n\n“But I am going to fight a duel with this gentleman,” said Colonel Proctor.\n\n“I am very sorry,” replied the conductor, “but we are going right on. The train is whistling for starting.”\n\nThe train started, in fact, with increased speed.\n\n“The conductor is right,” said Mr. Fogg, calmly; “I cannot get off.”\n\n“I am sorry, gentlemen,” said the conductor, “the next station is ten minutes off, and we shall stop there twenty minutes.”\n\n“Well, we will fight there,” said Mr. Fogg, with his imperturbable air.\n\n“We will be there at noon,” observed Colonel Proctor, with the same coolness.\n\n“Till noon, then,” replied Mr. Fogg.\n\n“Passepartout,” said the Colonel’s second, “we will see you then.”\n\n“I will be there,” said Passepartout.\n\nThe train sped onward, and soon reached the station where they were to stop for twenty minutes. Passepartout, who had not had an opportunity of observing his master since the affair of the duel, now looked at him with intense curiosity. Mr. Fogg was as calm as ever, and Fix, who saw him pull out his watch, and heard him remark, “Two minutes past noon,” felt a strange misgiving.\n\nBut Colonel Proctor and his second were not there. The train went on.\n\n“Mr. Proctor has not come,” said Passepartout.\n\n“He is probably on the next train,” replied Mr. Fogg, imperturbably.\n\n“He will be a long time coming, then,” said Passepartout, \"for the next train won't be along for six hours.\"\n\nMr. Fogg did not reply. He resumed his game of whist with Fix. Passepartout, however, was ill at ease. He went to the door, and looked along the line. He saw nothing. He returned to his place, and sat down, saying to himself, \"This is not a duel that I can understand. It is a duel of the future, perhaps.\"\n\nThe train continued its course. At two o'clock in the afternoon, Mr. Fogg laid down his cards, and said, \"I must go to the station.\"\n\nHe went, followed by Passepartout. They found the station empty. Mr. Fogg returned to the car. “It is impossible to find him,” he said.\n\n“But what are you going to do, sir?” asked Passepartout.\n\n“Wait,” replied Mr. Fogg. “I have telegraphed to Omaha.”\n\nAt three o'clock, a telegram arrived. Mr. Fogg opened it, and read it.\n\n“He is at Omaha,” he said. “We must go on.”\n\nThe train set out at once. It arrived at Omaha at six o'clock in the evening. Mr. Fogg went to the station. He found that Colonel Proctor had left by the train for Chicago at one o'clock.\n\n“We must go on,” said Mr. Fogg.\n\n“But we have lost six hours,” said Passepartout.\n\n“No matter,” replied Mr. Fogg, calmly. “We must make up for it.”\n\nThe train for Chicago started at seven o'clock. Mr. Fogg and Passepartout took their places. Fix was with them.\n\nThe train sped along rapidly. At ten o'clock, it stopped at a small station.\n\n“Chicago!” cried the conductor.\n\nMr. Fogg alighted with his two companions. They went to the telegraph office. Mr. Fogg telegraphed to Liverpool, ordering a steamer for the next day.\n\n“Now,” said Mr. Fogg, “we must find Colonel Proctor.”\n\nThey found him at the principal hotel. Mr. Fogg went to his room.\n\n“Colonel Proctor,” said Mr. Fogg, “I have come to fight a duel with you.”\n\n“I am ready, sir,” replied the Colonel. “But we must go to a suitable place.”\n\n“This room will do,” said Mr. Fogg. “We are alone.”\n\n“But there are others here,” said the Colonel.\n\n“Let them stay,” replied Mr. Fogg. “They can be witnesses.”\n\nThe Colonel hesitated for a moment. Then he said, “Very well.”\n\nMr. Fogg and the Colonel drew their revolvers. Fix and Passepartout stood by, pale and trembling.\n\n“Are you ready, sir?” asked Mr. Fogg.\n\n“I am,” replied the Colonel.\n\n“Fire!” cried Mr. Fogg.\n\nThe two men fired at the same moment. The Colonel fell, struck in the forehead.\n\nMr. Fogg went up to him. He put his hand on his heart. It had ceased to beat.\n\n“He is dead,” said Mr. Fogg.\n\nHe turned to Fix and Passepartout. “Let us go,” he said.\n\nThey left the hotel, and went to the station. The train for New York was about to start. They took their places.\n\nThe train sped on. At seven o'clock in the morning, it arrived at New York. Mr. Fogg and his companions went to the harbour. The steamer was ready.\n\n“We will embark at once,” said Mr. Fogg.\n\nThey went on board. The steamer set sail. It arrived at Liverpool at nine o'clock in the evening.\n\nMr. Fogg and his companions landed. They went to the custom-house. They had no trouble with the customs.\n\nThey went to a hotel. Mr. Fogg ordered supper.\n\nAfter supper, he said to Fix and Passepartout, “We must go to London.”\n\n“But the train does not start till ten o'clock,” said Fix.\n\n“We will go by special train,” replied Mr. Fogg.\n\nHe ordered a special train. It started at once. It arrived at London at five o'clock in the morning.\n\nMr. Fogg and his companions went to his house in Saville Row. The door was open. They went in. They found the servants awake.\n\n“Is it you, sir?” cried the butler.\n\n“It is I, indeed,” replied Mr. Fogg. “I have come back.”\n\nThe servants surrounded him. They congratulated him on his return.\n\n“And what about the wager?” asked the butler.\n\n“I have won it,” replied Mr. Fogg.\n\n“But you have lost five days,” said the butler.\n\n“No matter,” replied Mr. Fogg. “I have saved the lady.”\n\nHe pointed to Aouda. The servants looked at her with surprise.\n\n“This is Mrs. Fogg,” said Mr. Fogg.\n\nThe servants bowed low. They welcomed their new mistress.\n\nMr. Fogg went to his study. He sat down in his armchair. He took out his watch. It was a quarter past five.\n\n“I have won,” he said.\n\nAt this moment, a knock was heard at the door. The butler went to open it. It was Fix.\n\n“Mr. Fogg,” said Fix, “I have come to ask your pardon.\n\n“For what?” asked Mr. Fogg.\n\n“For having arrested you,” replied Fix. “I was mistaken.”\n\n“It is of no consequence,” said Mr. Fogg. “But you have lost me a day.”\n\n“I know it,” replied Fix. “But I hope you will forgive me.”\n\n“It is forgiven,” said Mr. Fogg. “But you must pay the expenses of the special train.”\n\n“I will pay them,” replied Fix.\n\nHe took out his purse and paid the butler.\n\n“Now,” said Mr. Fogg, “you can go.”\n\nFix went out, crestfallen.\n\nMr. Fogg remained alone with Aouda and Passepartout.\n\n“I am very happy,” said Aouda.\n\n“So am I,” said Mr. Fogg. “But I must go to the Reform Club.”\n\n“Why?” asked Aouda.\n\n“To prove that I have won the wager,” replied Mr. Fogg.\n\nHe went to the Reform Club. He found the five gentlemen there. They were waiting for him.\n\n“Gentlemen,” said Mr. Fogg, “I have come to claim my wager.”\n\n“But you have lost,” said Sir Francis Cromarty.\n\n“No, I have not lost,” replied Mr. Fogg. “I have arrived.”\n\n“But you were due at a quarter before nine this evening,” said Stuart.\n\n“I was due at a quarter before nine this evening,” replied Mr. Fogg, “but I arrived at five o'clock this morning. I have therefore gained five days.”\n\nThe gentlemen looked at each other. They could not believe their ears.\n\n“It is impossible,” said Andrew Stuart.\n\n“It is true, nevertheless,” replied Mr. Fogg. “I have gained five days.”\n\nHe showed them his log-book. It confirmed his statement.\n\nThe gentlemen were dumbfounded. They had lost the wager.\n\n“Gentlemen,” said Mr. Fogg, “I have a proposition to make to you.”\n\n“What is it?” asked John Sullivan.\n\n“I will give you half of the wager,” replied Mr. Fogg, “if you will give me the other half.”\n\nThe gentlemen accepted. They paid Mr. Fogg half of the twenty thousand pounds. He gave them the other half.\n\n“And now,” said Mr. Fogg, “I must go and marry this lady.”\n\nHe went back to his house. He found Aouda waiting for him.\n\n“I am ready,” said Aouda.\n\n“Let us go to the church,” said Mr. Fogg.\n\nThey went to the church. The clergyman was waiting for them. He married them.\n\nAfter the marriage, they went back to Mr. Fogg’s house. They found Passepartout there.\n\n“Master,” said Passepartout, “I have a confession to make to you.”\n\n“What is it?” asked Mr. Fogg.\n\n“I have lost you a day,” replied Passepartout.\n\n“How so?” asked Mr. Fogg.\n\n“When I went to the church yesterday,” replied Passepartout, “I found that it was Sunday and not Saturday. I had made a mistake of one day.”\n\nMr. Fogg looked at him. A smile spread over his face.\n\n“You are right,” he said. “We have arrived on Saturday and not on Sunday.\n\nIt should end here based on the prompt's focus on the train scene, but I will provide the passage that *immediately* follows the provided starting phrase and describes the scene up to the train leaving.\n\n“Who knows?” replied Mr. Fogg, returning to the car as coolly as usual. “And besides,” added he, “this eventuality, not having been foreseen, does not invalidate my scheme in the least.”\n\n“But, Mr. Fogg,” said Aouda, “you cannot let this man insult you with impunity; you ought to fight.”\n\n“I am going to fight,” returned Mr. Fogg, coldly. “I have already engaged Fix as my second.”\n\n“I could not refuse him,” muttered Fix, between his teeth, with a certain vexation. “After all, this duel does not violate the regulations.”\n\n“But,” resumed Mrs. Aouda, endeavouring to take Mr. Fogg’s hand and retain him, “on the cars, in America, a duel! it is impossible!”\n\n“It is my duty,” responded Mr. Fogg. “So, pray do not disturb me. Passepartout,” added he, “you will accompany me.”\n\n“Your honour is too good,” returned Passepartout, nonplussed. “But if you are going to fight, might it not have been better to wait till you got to England? What a wild man this Colonel Proctor is! and what a time he has chosen for coming to look for you; just at the moment you are about to…”\n\nThe train now blew its whistle, and slackened its speed.\n\n“Plum Creek!” cried the conductor.\n\nMr. Fogg and Fix, followed by Passepartout, alighted on the ground, having in their hands their revolvers, which they had purchased at New York.

The train is whistling for starting.”\n\nThe train started, in fact, with increased speed.\n\n“The conductor is right,” said Mr. Fogg, calmly; “I cannot get off.”\n\n“I am sorry, gentlemen,” said the conductor, as the train rolled past the station, “but the next station is ten minutes off, and we shall stop there twenty minutes.”\n\n“Good,” said Mr. Fogg. “We will fight there.”\n\n“I’ll be there,” said Colonel Proctor.\n\nAnd the train, increasing its speed, soon passed out of sight of Plum Creek station. Passepartout was reflecting, with a chuckle, that the American conductor, with his excessive politeness, would not have been a bit surprised if, in response to his obliging offer, Colonel Proctor and Mr. Fogg had proceeded to blow each other's brains out on the platform of the cars, and were now about to engage in that diversion. “It is really a very accommodating country,” thought Passepartout. “And conductors here are very civilised.” He followed his master, quite ready for whatever was to come.",

            "prefix-probing": "“Who knows?” replied Mr. Fogg, returning to the car as coolly as usual. The news that the railway line stopped forty miles short of Allahabad, at the village of Kholby, had spread like wildfire. It was a severe, unforeseen obstacle to the journey. While other passengers fretted and grumbled, Mr. Fogg showed no sign of agitation. He simply consulted his timetable again, verifying the precise location of Kholby and the gap. Passepartout, on the other hand, was beside himself. The faithful valet had believed the railway complete, and this sudden halt threatened the entire wager. He paced nervously, throwing despairing glances at his master. \"But Monsieur Fogg, the train! We were counting on the train!\" he exclaimed, wringing his hands. Fogg merely listened, his gaze scanning the bustling crowd and the various forms of transport available – or rather, unavailable – for such a distance. \"We must find another means of conveyance,\" he stated calmly, as if discussing a minor itinerary change. \"We need to reach Allahabad. The Express train for Calcutta departs tomorrow morning.\" His tone admitted no possibility of failure. He stepped out onto the platform, his eyes fixed on something in the distance. He spoke briefly to a station official, then to a local man. It quickly became clear that ordinary transport was non-existent for such a journey through the jungle. Carriages, carts, nothing suitable was available. But then, a rumour, a possibility began to circulate. There was talk of an elephant. An animal, someone suggested, that might be hired, if its owner could be found and persuaded. An elephant! The idea was audacious, unconventional, precisely the sort of solution that might appeal to Mr. Fogg's peculiar genius. He turned back to Passepartout, a glint in his eye, the first hint of animation the valet had seen in hours. \"Passepartout,\" he said, his voice quiet but firm, \"we need an elephant.\""

            "prefix-probing": "The two combatants, their seconds, and the conductor passed through the cars to the rear of the train. They moved quickly, almost grimly, down the narrow aisles. Heads turned as they passed, eyes wide with a mixture of curiosity and alarm. The rumour of a duel on a moving train had spread with astonishing speed amongst the passengers, transforming the tedious journey into a scene of dramatic, if rather absurd, tension. Ladies shrank back, gentlemen peered over the tops of their newspapers, and children, sensing the unusual excitement, pressed their faces against the windows or clung to their mothers. The conductor, looking thoroughly vexed by this interruption to his routine schedule, led the way, occasionally barking an instruction to clear a path. Phileas Fogg, impeccably dressed as always, moved with the calm, methodical step of a man about to transact a piece of business. Colonel Proctor, his face flushed and eyes blazing, strode behind him, his hand occasionally straying towards his side as if impatient to begin the violent encounter. Sir Francis Cromarty, Fogg's chosen second, followed closely, his expression one of grave concern. Passepartout, though desperately worried for his master, managed to maintain a semblance of composure, his natural good humour momentarily eclipsed by apprehension. They reached the last passenger car and stepped out onto the small, open platform at the very end of the train. The wind whipped around them, carrying the roar of the engine and the rhythmic clatter of the wheels over the rails. It was a precarious, exposed spot, but one that offered a clear space, away from the terrified gaze of the other travellers. \"Here, gentlemen,\" announced the conductor, gesturing towards the limited area. \"This is the best I can offer. Mind your footing. And for heaven's sake, be quick about it before someone gets hurt or, worse, falls off!\" Phileas Fogg gave a curt nod of acknowledgement. Colonel Proctor merely glared, his eyes fixed on his opponent. The seconds conferred briefly, verifying the pistols and agreeing on the necessary distance, though the confines of the platform made a lengthy separation impossible. It was agreed they would stand just a few paces apart, turning to fire on the count of three. The air crackled with anticipation, the mechanical pounding of the train only amplifying the human tension. Passepartout watched, heart in his mouth, ready to leap forward if necessary, praying for a miraculous intervention. This was madness, a duel of honour fought hurtling through the American wilderness at fifty miles an hour. The seconds stepped back, pistols were loaded, and the conductor reluctantly prepared to give the signal, his face a mask of official disapproval and private anxiety. The train rattled onward, oblivious to the drama unfolding on its rear platform."

A Sioux chief, wishing to stop the train, but not knowing how to work the regulator, had opened wide instead of closing the steam-valve, and the locomotive was plunging forward with terrific velocity.\nThe Sioux had at the same time invaded the cars, skipping like enraged monkeys over the roofs, thrusting open the doors, and fighting hand to hand with the passengers. Penetrating the baggage-car, they pillaged it, throwing the trunks out of the train. The cries and shots were constant. The travellers defended themselves bravely; some of the cars were barricaded, and sustained a siege, like moving forts, carried along at a speed of a hundred miles an hour.\nAouda behaved courageously from the first. She defended herself like a true heroine with a revolver, which she shot through the broken windows whenever a savage made his appearance. Twenty Sioux had fallen mortally wounded to the ground, and the wheels crushed those who fell upon the rails as if they had been worms. Several passengers, shot or stunned, lay on the seats.\nIt was necessary to put an end to the struggle, which had lasted for ten minutes, and which would result in the triumph of the Sioux if the train was not stopped. Fort Kearney station, where there was a garrison, was only two miles distant; but, that once passed, the Sioux would be masters of the train between Fort Kearney and the station beyond.\nThe conductor was fighting beside Mr. Fogg, when he was shot and fell. At the same moment he cried, “Unless the train is stopped in five minutes, we are lost!”\n“It shall be stopped,” said Phileas Fogg, preparing to rush from the car.\n“Stay, monsieur,” cried Passepartout; “I will go.”\nMr. Fogg had not time to stop the brave fellow, who, opening a door unperceived by the Indians, succeeded in slipping under the car; and while the struggle continued and the balls whizzed across each other over his head, he made use of his old acrobatic experience, and with amazing agility worked his way under the cars, holding on to the chains, aiding himself by the brakes and edges of the sashes, creeping from one car to another with marvellous skill, and thus gaining the forward end of the train.\nThere, suspended by one hand between the baggage-car and the tender, with the other he loosened the safety chains; but, owing to the traction, he would never have succeeded in unscrewing the yoking-bar, had not a violent concussion jolted this bar out.",

The Indians did not approach the car itself, but shot at it from a distance; and the windows, which were of too fragile glass, were soon broken into a thousand pieces. The balls poured in, cracking the woodwork of the cars, and flattening themselves upon the frames. The travellers, though surprised, were not wanting in presence of mind. Barricades of seats, mattresses, and packages were speedily put up at the windows, and behind these the besieged parties, firing when the Sioux came near. The latter, however, were not peaceable citizens, not agriculturists who cultivate the soil and live by the sale of their produce. They were terrible savages, very often man-eaters, and always formidable. At a given signal, a frightful yell was heard, and the Indians threw themselves upon the train, with the agility of serpents, climbing over the roofs, and crawling along the steps, gaining a footing on the platforms, and forcing open the doors. It was a hand-to-hand struggle, defending themselves with revolvers and hatchets, fighting with desperation. The Sioux had surprised the engineer and stoker, and, a moment after, the train stopped, not having been uncoupled. The whole band then rushed into the cars, overrunning them like a torrent, bellowing, howling, brandishing their tomahawks, and looting the baggage-vans, throwing the trunks out of the train. The travellers resisted heroically, many of them armed with repeating rifles, defending their cars foot by foot. The cars were drenched with blood. There were frightful cries, intermingled with the reports of the guns and revolvers, and the shrill whistle of the locomotive, whose steam was still on and which was tearing through space. The most formidable band of the Sioux had rushed upon the engine, and a chief, hatchet in hand, had ordered the engineer and stoker to descend. They refused to obey, and were instantly struck down and killed. The next moment the chief, not comprehending the working of the machinery, increased the pressure of the steam, and the locomotive then started forward with terrific speed, levelling as if it were a battering-ram the Sioux who still clung to the sides of the cars. The greater number of the Indians had followed the chief into the train, and were fighting hand to hand with the passengers. The latter were gradually giving ground, and the issue of the struggle was becoming every moment more uncertain. The train was not uncoupled, and the Indians were masters of the engine. The locomotive was proceeding at fearful speed, and it was impossible to jump off without almost certain death. One heroic deed, however, saved the train. Passepartout saw that the struggle was going on under the most unfavourable circumstances. The Indians were gaining ground, and the passengers were nearly all wounded or killed. It was only a question of minutes before the train would be completely at the mercy of the savages. He therefore conceived the idea of uncoupling the train. It was a dangerous undertaking, but he was resolved to accomplish it. He crept under the cars, and, crawling along from one to another, he succeeded in reaching the coupling-chains, which were attached to the rear of the engine. He then, with the aid of a knife, cut the chains, and the train became instantly separated from the locomotive. The latter continued its headlong course, carrying with it the corpses of the engineer and stoker, and the chief of the Sioux, who, clinging to the throttle, was carried away with the engine. The train, freed from the engine, gradually slackened its speed, and the passengers, though exhausted and bleeding, breathed a sigh of relief. It was not a moment too soon. The train stopped within a hundred yards of the station of Fort Kearney. The soldiers of the fort, hearing the noise of the firing, had rushed out, and were coming towards the train. They arrived just as the Indians, finding themselves abandoned by the engine, and seeing the soldiers coming, were preparing to beat a retreat. The soldiers opened fire, and the Sioux, seeing that they were caught between two fires, and having lost their chief, fled in disorder. They disappeared as quickly as they had come, leaving behind them about twenty of their dead, and a considerable quantity of plunder. The passengers, on alighting from the train, presented a sorry spectacle. Many of them were wounded, and several were dead. Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty were among the wounded, but fortunately their wounds were not serious. Aouda had displayed a courage worthy of a heroine. With a revolver in her hand, she had fought like a lioness, and had killed several of the savages. Passepartout had escaped without a scratch. He was received by Mr. Fogg with a hearty handshake, and by Sir Francis Cromarty with a warm embrace. The conductor, who had been wounded in the shoulder, informed Mr. Fogg that the next train would not pass for twelve hours, and that, as they were in front of the fort, they could safely wait there. Mr. Fogg, however, was not disposed to wait. He was anxious to make up for lost time. He therefore ordered a special train, and, having taken leave of Sir Francis Cromarty, who remained at the fort, he continued his journey.",

The train was going at full speed. The engine-driver could not be pardoned if he did not cross the stations, though they were not expected to stop at them. He saw the danger, and kept on. The savages knew the stations where the Union Pacific passed. For example, a hundred miles west of this they would have had to stop. But here they were in the wilderness. The railway was not guarded. They could attack at any time, and they did. The passengers fired their revolvers out the windows. The air was filled with the smell of powder and the whizz of bullets. The Sioux warriors, in their war paint, galloped alongside the train on their ponies. Some tried to board the cars. Others were content to fire from a distance. The conductor, a brave man, went from car to car, encouraging the passengers and organizing the defense. But what could he do? He had a few men under his orders, but the savages were numerous. They were two hundred at least, maybe more. It was a desperate situation. Fogg remained perfectly calm in his compartment. Aouda was pale but silent. Passepartout, however, was in a frenzy. He could not stand still. He wanted to do something. He saw a young man, Mr. Mudge, a brave and energetic American, organizing a resistance in his car. Passepartout joined him. They distributed arms to those who had none and showed them how to use them. The train continued its headlong rush. The noise was deafening: the roar of the train, the reports of the guns, the war cries of the Indians. It seemed impossible to escape. But the train was reaching a fort, Fort Kearney, where there was a detachment of soldiers. If they could only hold out until they reached it! The fight was fierce. The Sioux were persistent. They were not afraid of death. Some even managed to climb onto the roof of the cars. It was then that a terrible thing happened. Passepartout, in his zeal, saw a number of savages who were trying to uncouple the cars from the engine. If they succeeded, the engine would escape, but the cars, full of passengers, would be left at the mercy of the Indians. Passepartout did not hesitate. He crawled along under the cars, at the risk of being crushed, and succeeded in preventing the uncoupling just in time. It was a brave act, a foolish act, but it saved the train. The Sioux, seeing their attempt foiled and the fort approaching, finally gave up the attack and galloped away into the plains. The train reached Fort Kearney, battered and scarred, but safe. The passengers were exhausted but relieved. Many were wounded, but fortunately, no one had been killed. Passepartout was hailed as a hero, though he felt he had only done his duty. Fogg simply remarked that it was fortunate the uncoupling had been prevented. It was just another incident on the long journey, a reminder of the dangers of the wild West, a test of courage and resourcefulness. The journey continued, but the memory of the Sioux attack would remain with them, a vivid and terrifying experience."

            "prefix-probing": "Three passengers including Passepartout had disappeared. Aboard the steamer Carnatic, which had just sailed from Yokohama for San Francisco, the loyal valet was nowhere to be found. This alarming absence created a ripple of concern, particularly for the stoic Phileas Fogg, though he showed little outward sign of distress. Passepartout, after a night spent rather indiscreetly involved with a troupe of Japanese acrobats, known as the Long Noses, whose human pyramid he had unfortunately joined, had completely lost track of the sailing schedule. He had missed the Carnatic's departure by a matter of minutes, a catastrophic oversight that left him utterly stranded in a foreign port, without funds or any means of contacting his master. His heart sank as the grim reality of his predicament settled upon him. He had failed Mr. Fogg in spectacular fashion, potentially jeopardizing the entire extraordinary race against time around the world. Meanwhile, Phileas Fogg and Aouda, after a brief inquiry, had proceeded with the voyage as planned. With characteristic resolve, Fogg trusted in Passepartout's resourcefulness and assumed their servant would manage to make his way to America and rejoin them there. Little did they know, Passepartout was in utter despair, wandering the unfamiliar streets of Yokohama, contemplating his bleak fate. He had even signed on with the acrobatic troupe for a meagre wage just to survive. It was by a stroke of incredible luck, during a public performance at a tea-house, that Fogg and Aouda unexpectedly stumbled upon the troupe and recognized their lost valet amidst the performers. The reunion was marked by immense relief, a brief moment of emotional release amidst their otherwise relentless dash across the globe. Passepartout was safe, but valuable time and resources had been consumed by this delay, adding yet another significant complication to their audacious gamble. The eighty-day clock continued its inexorable tick-tock, every second now more critical than ever."

The delay of a single day would make him lose the steamer at New York, and his bet would be certainly lost. But as he thought, “It is my duty,” he did not hesitate.\nThe commanding officer of Fort Kearney was there. A hundred of his soldiers had placed themselves in a position to defend the station, should the Sioux attack it.\n“Sir,” said Mr. Fogg to the captain, “three passengers have disappeared.”\n“Dead?” asked the captain.\n“Dead or prisoners; that is the uncertainty which must be solved. Do you propose to pursue the Sioux?”\n“That’s a serious thing to do, sir,” returned the captain. “These Indians may retreat beyond the Arkansas, and I cannot leave the fort unprotected.”\n“The lives of three men are in question, sir,” said Phileas Fogg.\n“Doubtless; but can I risk the lives of fifty men to save three?”\n“I don’t know whether you can, sir; but you ought to do so.”\n“Nobody here,” returned the other, “has a right to teach me my duty.”\n“Very well,” said Mr. Fogg, coldly. “I will go alone.”\n“You, sir!” cried Fix, coming up; “you go alone in pursuit of the Indians?”\n“Would you have me leave this poor fellow to perish—him to whom every one present owes his life? I shall go.”\n“No, sir, you shall not go alone,” cried the captain, touched in spite of himself. “No! you are a brave man. Thirty volunteers!” he added, turning to the soldiers.\nThe whole company started forward at once. The captain had only to pick his men. Thirty were chosen, and an old sergeant placed at their head.\n“Thanks, captain,” said Mr. Fogg.\n“Will you let me go with you?” asked Fix.\n“Do as you please, sir. But if you wish to do me a favour, you will remain with Aouda. In case anything should happen to me—”\nA sudden pallor overspread the detective’s face. Separate himself from the man whom he had so persistently followed step by step! Leave him to wander about in this desert! Fix gazed attentively at Mr. Fogg, and, despite his suspicions and of the struggle which was going on within him, he lowered his eyes before that calm and frank look.\n“I will stay,” said he.\nA few moments after, Mr. Fogg pressed the young woman’s hand, and, having confided to her his precious carpet-bag, went off with the sergeant and his little squad. But, before going, he had said to the soldiers, “My friends, I will divide five thousand dollars among you, if we save the prisoners.”\nIt was then a little past noon.",

An unavoidable delay would render his arrival at London impossible, and as a consequence, he would lose the wager. But he did not hesitate. He had given his word, and he must keep it. And, besides, his duty was plain. He was not a man to abandon to their fate either his servant, after he had rendered him so much service, or the Sioux, who had risked their lives for him.\nThe commanding officer of Fort Kearney was then present with about a hundred soldiers. They were prepared for an attack, and were not to be surprised. The Sioux could not get possession of the station, yet they might besiege it.\nUpon Fogg’s making known the situation of affairs, the commander, Captain Murcheson, could not conceal his surprise. “Three passengers missing? You don’t say so?” he cried. “Neither dead nor prisoners, perhaps?”\n“Neither dead nor prisoners,” replied Fogg, “but captives, carried off by the Sioux.”\n“And do you propose to pursue this band?”\n“I do.”\n“Ah! that’s a bold thing.”\n“Not at all. The Indians are allies of the Americans, and are not supposed to be at war with them.”\n“Ah! but these are brigands, Mr. Fogg, and Sioux brigands are not to be trifled with. Besides, are you sure it was the Sioux of the Salt Lake?”\n“No; but I presume so.”\n“The Salt Lake Indians are terrible fellows, and to pursue them is a very dangerous undertaking. Are you sure that your men are not prisoners killed by the Indians?”\n“Not quite sure; but I hope they were captured alive. My servant, at least, had not time to be killed.”\n“There is no doubt that the engine and cars were pillaged,” added Captain Murcheson. “But the train is of little importance compared with the lives of three human beings. Do you think, Captain, that we have any hope of rescuing them?”\n“That is difficult to determine.”\n“But the lives of three men are at stake, Captain.”\n“Doubtless; but can I risk the lives of fifty soldiers to save three?”\n“I do not ask you to do that, Captain; but I think that we may attempt a rescue without risking too much.”\n“Mr. Fogg,” said the captain, “no one can command me.”\n“I know that, Captain, but I ask you, as a man of humanity, to help me.”\n“You want to go alone?”\n“Yes, alone with a dozen men.”\n“Ah! that’s better,” said the captain; “but even a dozen men are not to be risked lightly.”\n“I will go alone, then,” said Fogg, coolly.\n“Go alone!” cried Fix, in astonishment. “Mr. Fogg, you cannot think of it!”\n“I must think of it,” replied Fogg, quietly. “I cannot abandon my servant, who saved my life.”\n“But,” said the captain, “you have a wife with you, and she cannot be left unprotected.”\n“My wife will remain here, under your protection, Captain.”\n“Ah! that’s all very well,” said the captain; “but if you fall into the hands of the Sioux, what will become of her?”\n“I shall not fall into the hands of the Sioux,” said Fogg, in the same even tone.\n“And I may add,” said Fix, “that if Mr. Fogg fails, I will follow the Sioux, and will not give them a moment’s rest until I have rescued the prisoners.”\n“Gentlemen,” said the captain, after a moment’s silence, “I see that you are brave men. I will not say that I will not help you; but I must act according to my orders. I cannot leave the fort without a sufficient garrison.”\n“I understand that, Captain; but could you not give me a dozen volunteers?”\n“I can give you thirty volunteers,” said the captain; “and I will accompany you myself.”\n“Captain, I thank you,” said Fogg, simply.\nThe captain then called for volunteers, and the entire company stepped forward. From them he chose thirty of the bravest, including a sergeant who was well acquainted with the country. “Here are your men, Mr. Fogg,” said the captain.\n“Thank you, Captain,” said Fogg. “And now, gentlemen, I have a word to say to you. You are going to brave great danger, and I think it is only fair that you should be rewarded for your courage and devotion. If we succeed in rescuing the prisoners, I will give each of you five thousand dollars.”\nA thrill ran through the ranks of the soldiers. Five thousand dollars! It was a fortune to them. They would have faced the whole Sioux nation for such a sum.\n“And now, gentlemen,” said Fogg, turning to Fix and Aouda, “we must start at once.”\n“I am ready,” said Fix.\n“And I,” said Aouda.\n“Ah! you too, Madame?” said the captain. “You are a brave woman.”\n“I must accompany Mr. Fogg,” said Aouda.\n“But,” said Fogg, “it is impossible. This is a very dangerous expedition, and I cannot expose you to such a peril.”\n“But I will not leave you,” said Aouda. “I will follow you wherever you go.”\n“Madame,” said Fogg, with a grave air, “it is my duty to protect you. I cannot take you with me.”\n“But,” said Aouda, in a pleading tone, “if you should fall into the hands of the Indians, what would become of me?”\n“I have already made arrangements for that,” said Fogg. “Captain, I entrust this lady to your care. If I do not return within forty-eight hours, I beg you to conduct her to New York, and there put her in communication with the British consul.”\n“I will do as you request,” said the captain. “But I hope that you will return.”\n“I hope so too,” said Fogg, quietly. “And now, gentlemen, let us start.”\nBefore leaving, Fogg took Aouda’s hand. “My dear Aouda,” he said, “if I do not return, you will be quite alone in the world. But you will not be in want. Here is a sum of money which will enable you to live comfortably.” He handed her a heavy carpet-bag.\n“Oh! Mr. Fogg,” she cried, “you are leaving me!”\n“I must go,” said Fogg, gently. “But I shall return.”\nHe kissed her hand, and turned to go. “And now, Fix,” he said, “you will remain here, will you not? You will watch over Madame Aouda?”\nThe detective turned pale. To be left behind! To be separated from the man he had followed so persistently! The thought was terrible to him. And yet, he could not refuse. Fogg’s quiet resolution overawed him. He saw that it was useless to resist.\n“I will remain,” he said, in a low voice.\n“Thank you,” said Fogg. “And now, Captain, we are ready.”\nThe captain led the way, and the little band followed. They left the fort shortly after midday.",

            "prefix-probing": "Phileas Fogg, by this resolution, inevitably sacrificed himself; he pronounced his own doom. There seemed no other course left. The steamer Henrietta lay before them, bound for Bordeaux, not Liverpool or London. Yet, Fogg's calm, mathematical mind calculated the impossible possibility. With the coolness that had seen him through India's perils and America's trials, he approached Captain Speedy. The proposition was audacious, unheard of: charter the vessel, reroute her course towards England, regardless of her original destination or cargo. Captain Speedy, a blustering, stubborn New Englander, was apoplectic. His cargo, his contract, his reputation! He refused vehemently, cursing the Englishman's madness. But Fogg, armed with an offer that transcended mere profit, held firm. He offered not just demurrage, but a price for the ship herself, should the captain not steer her where commanded. It was a pirate's proposition, delivered with a gentleman's poise. Faced with an astronomical sum, far exceeding the Henrietta's value, Speedy's resistance crumbled, though not without a torrent of oaths. The transformation of the transatlantic steamer into a private yacht was swift. Sailors accustomed to a southern route found themselves steering northeast, battling the fierce December gales of the North Atlantic. Passepartout watched, aghast, his master's calculated recklessness surpassing any previous exploit. He saw the mountainous waves, felt the ship groan under the tempest's lash, and knew that this final desperate gamble held more peril than all the preceding adventures combined. Detective Fix, ever present, albeit now sidelined by the sheer absurdity of the situation, could only observe. His warrant was useless here, miles from land, trapped on a vessel controlled by the very man he sought to arrest. The race was now against nature herself. The Henrietta, though stout, was not built for this speed, this relentless push through mountainous seas. Coal reserves dwindled rapidly, consumed by the engines driven to their maximum. Each ton burned represented not just fuel, but minutes, hours, dwindling chances of reaching London by eight forty-five on the evening of December 21st. Fogg, seemingly impervious to the storm or the stakes, remained in the saloon, consulting his charts, tracking their progress with unwavering precision. He was betting his entire fortune, his very existence, on a ship, a crew, and the unpredictable fury of the sea. This final leg was the most desperate, the most dangerous. It was a leap into the abyss, with only eighty days as his parachute, and that parachute was rapidly fraying. Every creak of the ship, every gust of wind, every crashing wave was a reminder of the immense, almost certainly fatal, risk he had taken. He had crossed continents and oceans, outwitted pursuers, and overcome obstacles, but the final enemy was time, and it was relentless, its lead seemingly insurmountable."

He walked feverishly up and down the platform, but soon resumed his outward composure. He now saw the folly of which he had been guilty in letting Fogg go alone. What! This man, whom he had just followed around the world, was permitted now to separate himself from him! He began to accuse and abuse himself, and, as if he were director of police, administered to himself a sound lecture for his greenness.\n“I have been an idiot!” he thought, “and this man will see it. He has gone, and won’t come back! But how is it that I, Fix, who have in my pocket a warrant for his arrest, have been so fascinated by him? Decidedly, I am nothing but an ass!”\nSo reasoned the detective, while the hours crept by all too slowly. He did not know what to do. Sometimes he was tempted to tell Aouda all; but he could not doubt how the young woman would receive his confidences. What course should he take? He thought of pursuing Fogg across the vast white plains; it did not seem impossible that he might overtake him. Footsteps were easily printed on the snow! But soon, under a new sheet, every imprint would be effaced.\nFix became discouraged. He felt a sort of insurmountable longing to abandon the game altogether.

She reflected on the many dangers they had faced together, from the jungles of India to the prairies of America, and how Mr. Fogg had navigated every crisis with a coolness that defied comprehension. He never showed fear, never complained, always focused on the solution, on the next step of the impossible journey. His logic was flawless, his composure absolute. It was not the courage of a man who was unaware of peril, but that of one who had complete control over his emotions, who saw the path forward where others saw only despair. She owed him everything. He had saved her life, given her sanctuary, and treated her with a respect and dignity she had almost forgotten existed. Unlike the men of her past, Fogg sought nothing from her; his actions were purely altruistic, driven by a peculiar, yet profound, sense of duty. He was an island of serene strength in a world of chaos and uncertainty, a true gentleman in every sense of the word. His precision, his famous punctuality, were merely outward signs of an inner discipline that governed his every move. As she sat there, the minutes ticking by, Aouda felt a warmth bloom in her chest, a feeling that transcended gratitude. It was an admiration so deep it bordered on reverence, a growing affection for this extraordinary man who had appeared like a benevolent spirit to snatch her from the jaws of death and carry her across the world on his incredible, impossible quest."

                "text": "Towards two o’clock in the afternoon, while it was snowing hard, long whistles were heard approaching from the east. A large, shadowy form, preceded by a glaring light, loomed in the mist, and advanced rapidly. No train was expected from the east, neither had any relief train, requested by telegraph, had time to arrive. The train from Omaha to San Francisco was not due till the next day. The mystery was soon solved. It was the engine which had been detached from the train, and which had sped on alone, carrying the unconscious engineer and stoker. It had run several miles beyond Fort Kearney, when, the fire having died down for want of fuel, the steam had slackened, and it had finally stopped about twenty miles past the station, an hour after having run out of fuel. The engineer and stoker, who had been for some time in a state of unconsciousness, recovered their senses. Finding himself in the desert with his engine, and without cars, the engineer understood what had happened. He saw that the train, doubtless, was in peril, though he knew not how the separation had occurred. He did not hesitate to return. It would have been prudent to continue on to Omaha, where he was sure to find help, but he did not think of abandoning the engine, and resolved to go back over the track, notwithstanding the danger he might encounter from the Indians. But the steam had failed, and the engine could not run. Fortunately, the fire-box contained some coal, and the engineer and stoker set about rebuilding the fire. The pressure again mounted, and the engine returned towards the train. It was this engine, running backwards, which was the cause of the whistling heard through the mist.",

The original provides a more gradual revelation, while the completion moves quickly to the explanation.\n- The completion introduces a perspective that suggests the engineer consciously chooses not to abandon the engine, which is not present in the original. This adds an invented internal motivation.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks a detailed account of the time spent by the engineer and stoker in their unconscious state and the sequence of their recovery.\n- There is insufficient detail about the engineer's uncertainty regarding how the locomotive became separated from the train.\n- The completion does not mention the specific danger of returning due to the possibility of ongoing threats, only referencing it in general terms.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately describes the engine as advancing rapidly, whereas the original emphasizes a slower approach.\n- The sequence of events is slightly altered: the completion suggests the engine returns immediately after the crew recovers, rather than after a period of inactivity and rebuilding the fire.\n- The completion implies the engineer's decision-making process is more about not abandoning the engine, rather than weighing the prudence of continuing to Omaha versus returning.\n- The completion states the engine could not run due to lack of steam, but the original specifies the fire had become low for want of fuel, leading to a gradual slackening of steam.\n- The final explanation of the whistling is less precise in the completion, lacking the original's clarity about the locomotive's return journey and its direction."

Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty, who had been playing whist in the car, heard the puffing engine stop, and saw the conductor put his head in and exclaim, \"Charleston!\" This was the Charleston station. Passepartout sprang off the train, followed by Fix. Mr. Fogg descended from the railway-car, and accompanied by Passepartout and Fix, directed his steps towards the custom-house. Charleston is a city of eighty-five thousand inhabitants, and is favourably situated; though we will not dwell upon its merits. Mr. Fogg was not one of those travellers who linger on their way. To get to the steamer, he had to pass along a circuitous, and rather complicated street; and he was not without his trouble in finding it. His knowledge of this American city was not over-precise; and the streets, as well as the trains, in the United States, are laid out with mathematical precision, in a manner very different from the tortuous and, as it may be called, fantastic curves of European cities. Mr. Fogg, after crossing the city, found himself upon a pier, where the \"Rangoon\"—a steamer of the Peninsular Company, built of iron and with a screw—was getting up steam."

It meant their journey across India was back on track after the unexpected delay. The iron horse snorted, its mighty wheels beginning to turn slowly, gathering speed as it left Allahabad behind. The landscape outside the carriage windows transformed rapidly, shifting from cultivated plains to dense jungles teeming with unseen life. Fogg remained impassive, consulting his timetable with his usual precision, while Passepartout pressed his face against the glass, marveling at the exotic sights. Sir Francis Cromarty, sharing their compartment, offered insights into the country they traversed. Hours passed swiftly, the rhythm of the train a constant companion. However, the smooth progress was not destined to last. As they approached Kholby, the conductor announced, much to their dismay, that the railway line abruptly ended there. Construction was incomplete, leaving a fifty-mile gap before the line resumed at Allahabad. This news was a severe blow to Fogg's meticulously planned itinerary. Passepartout groaned, fearing yet another significant delay. Sir Francis, though surprised, took it in stride, explaining that such interruptions, while frustrating, were not entirely uncommon in the vast, rapidly developing country. Fogg, characteristically, did not waste time in complaint. His mind immediately shifted to finding an alternative means of transport to bridge the gap. The eighty-day clock was ticking relentlessly."

Phileas Fogg sat upright in the howdah, his face as impassive as ever, consulting his watch and map with quiet determination. His precise movements contrasted sharply with the slow, deliberate plodding of their mount. Beside him, Passepartout, though initially charmed by the novelty of elephant travel, was finding the pace agonizingly slow compared to the express trains they had abandoned. The jungle pressed in on either side, a dense, emerald wall alive with the chirping of unseen insects and the occasional cry of a monkey. Their guide, a seasoned Parsee named Jejeeh, led the way with quiet confidence, navigating paths that were little more than ancient animal trails. They had left the unfinished railway section far behind, the abrupt end of modern transport replaced by this ancient, slow-moving beast. Each hour that ticked by was precious time slipping away from Fogg's strict schedule, a fact that gnawed at Passepartout, who fidgeted and glanced nervously at the lowering sun. Would they reach Allahabad, their next railway connection, in time? Fogg, however, betrayed no anxiety. He had simply accepted the delay, found the most practical alternative with characteristic speed, and continued his journey with unshakeable calm, trusting in calculation rather than hope. The vast, untamed landscape unfolded around them, a testament to the distance they still had to cover. The elephant plodded onward, a small, determined speck against the immense subcontinent, carrying not just its passengers but the delicate thread of Fogg's wager and the very possibility of victory against the ticking clock."

The sea was less rough, and the wind inclined to quiet down. Passepartout, who had been in a terrible stew about the ship during the past forty-eight hours, recovered some degree of cheerfulness. He now began to hope that they might reach New York in time for the steamer to Liverpool, though the wind was still dead against them. The Henrietta was a fast steamer, however, and, though she had not been able to carry full sail, she made good headway. Phileas Fogg was still as calm as ever. And as for Fix, he was becoming terribly anxious. He had put the electric telegraph in operation as soon as he reached shore, and sent a despatch to London, but as yet he had received no answer. How could he have been arrested if the warrant was not there? And might it not have reached there since he left? This thought ploughed furrow after furrow across his brow. He did not sleep; he did not eat. He was going over the voyage in his mind. They were twenty-four hours behind time, and Fix was the cause of it. How he did execrate himself! Would Fogg get away from him upon his arrival, and how? There was no Philadelphia steamer for Liverpool, neither was there a New York steamer, sailing directly for Liverpool. The steamers to France and London were the only ones which would serve him. Fix was in a most terrible state of mind. If Fogg left him, he was lost. But, supposing Fogg was not the robber, how could he have been arrested? Why should he be arrested? Fix was all at sea; he didn't know what to think. Meanwhile, Phileas Fogg, less disturbed than Fix, was watching the progress of the Henrietta. He longed to reach New York. After reaching America, he was count on two means of transit: namely, railway and packet-boat, or packet-boat and railway. Provided he could get a steamship at New York going to Liverpool, the game was not yet lost. 'Captain,' said Mr. Fogg, to Captain Speedy, 'are you going to New York?' 'Provided I can't go any farther,' replied the captain. 'And when do you expect to arrive there?'"

The original includes a breakdown of how many hours are lost, how many remain, and what must be regained, which is not clearly presented in the completion.\n- The original contains a direct question and answer sequence about the necessity of reaching New York by a certain time and the impact of the Indian attack, which is not fully captured in the completion.\n- The completion does not include the detail that the sledge proposal comes from a man who had previously spoken to Fix during the night and whose offer had been refused.\n\n3.

This significant setback occurred after the *Rangoon*, the steamer taking them from Calcutta to Hong Kong, arrived late. Despite the potentially ruinous delay to his audacious wager, Fogg exhibited his characteristic imperturbability. His face remained calm, betraying none of the anxiety that surely gnawed at Passepartout. For his part, the poor valet was beside himself with worry. Every hour lost felt like a nail in the coffin of their ambitious journey. They had encountered unforeseen obstacles: the disrupted railway in India, the necessity of acquiring an elephant, and now this delayed steamer. Fogg, however, simply adjusted his calculations and began planning the next leg. The race was tighter than ever, but his resolve seemed only to harden. The vast Pacific lay ahead, a critical segment where speed would be paramount. Failure meant financial ruin and public humiliation, but Fogg gave no indication of wavering. He trusted in his meticulous planning and his formidable will, facing the daunting challenge with quiet, steely determination, while the clock ticked relentlessly against them."

A high mast was fixed on the frame, held firmly by metallic lashings, to which was attached a large brigantine sail. This mast held an iron stay upon which to hoist a jib-sail. Behind, a sort of rudder served to guide the vehicle. It was, in short, a sledge rigged like a sloop. During the winter, when the trains are blocked up by the snow, these sledges make extremely rapid journeys across the frozen plains from one station to another. Provided with more sails than a cutter, and with the wind behind them, they slip over the surface of the prairies with a speed equal if not superior to that of the express trains.\nMr. Fogg readily made a bargain with the owner of this land-craft.

Your insolence requires satisfaction!\" \"I agree,\" Fogg said, entirely unmoved by the Colonel’s display. \"When and where do you propose we address this matter?\" \"Here and now, perhaps?\" Proctor suggested, glancing around. \"The location is public, and the means uncertain,\" Fogg observed. \"We are awaiting the train to New York. It departs shortly. Shall we postpone this until a more suitable time and place?\" \"As you wish,\" Proctor sneered. \"But make no mistake, sir, I shall have satisfaction.\" \"You shall,\" Fogg assured him. \"Let us agree to meet at the next convenient stop on the journey east. Is Ogden acceptable?\" Proctor considered for a moment. \"Ogden it is. On the train's arrival.

INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes the speed estimate to an engineer, whereas the original does not specify this.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the reward and timing details are presented as if they are part of the current action, rather than as a brief explanation following Mudge's statement.\n- The completion provides a specific time and reward amount, which are not given in the original passage, and changes the nature of the agreement between Mr. Fogg and Mudge.\n- The description of Mudge's position and actions at the rudder is changed, and the method by which he controls the sledge is not described as in the original."

The wind tore at their clothing, searing their faces like a thousand needles. The frosted landscape blurred into an indistinct grey and white streak. Each breath was a painful gulp of icy air that burned their lungs. Passepartout shivered violently, his teeth chattering audibly despite his efforts to control them. Even the imperturbable Mr. Fogg seemed to draw his fur collar tighter around his neck, his eyes fixed forward with unwavering determination. Aouda, wrapped in blankets, pressed herself against Fogg, seeking what little warmth she could find. Fix, huddled in the corner, looked utterly miserable, cursing inwardly the chain of events that had led him to this frozen inferno. The speed was breathtaking, the horses, magnificent creatures, pounding across the snow-covered plains as if pursued by demons. The sled skittered and bounced over the uneven terrain, threatening to throw them into the drifts at any moment. There was no thought of comfort, only of sheer, grim endurance, of reaching their destination before the time ran out. The relentless rush, the biting frost, the sheer physical agony of it all combined into an overwhelming ordeal that tested their limits. Yet, driven by the ticking clock and Fogg's unyielding will, they pressed onward into the frozen expanse."

          "text_segment": "The prairie, across which the sledge was moving in a straight line, was as flat as a sea. It seemed like a vast frozen lake. The railroad which ran through this section ascended from the south-west to the north-west by Great Island, Columbus, an important Nebraska town, Schuyler, and Fremont, to Omaha. It followed throughout the right bank of the Platte River. The sledge, shortening this route, took a chord of the arc described by the railway. Mudge was not afraid of being stopped by the Platte River, because it was frozen. The road, then, was quite clear of obstacles, and Phileas Fogg had but two things to fear—an accident to the sledge, and a change or calm in the wind.\nBut the breeze, far from lessening its force, blew as if to bend the mast, which, however, the metallic lashings held firmly. These lashings, like the chords of a stringed instrument, resounded as if vibrated by a violin bow. The sledge slid along in the midst of a plaintively intense melody.\n“Those chords give the fifth and the octave,” said Mr. Fogg.\nThese were the only words he uttered during the journey. Aouda, cosily packed in furs and cloaks, was sheltered as much as possible from the attacks of the freezing wind. As for Passepartout, his face was as red as the sun’s disc when it sets in the mist, and he laboriously inhaled the biting air. With his natural buoyancy of spirits, he began to hope again. They would reach New York on the evening, if not on the morning, of the 11th, and there were still some chances that it would be before the steamer sailed for Liverpool.\nPassepartout even felt a strong desire to grasp his ally, Fix, by the hand. He remembered that it was the detective who procured the sledge, the only means of reaching Omaha in time; but, checked by some presentiment, he kept his usual reserve. One thing, however, Passepartout would never forget, and that was the sacrifice which Mr. Fogg had made, without hesitation, to rescue him from the Sioux. Mr. Fogg had risked his fortune and his life. No! His servant would never forget that!\nWhile each of the party was absorbed in reflections so different, the sledge flew past over the vast carpet of snow. The creeks it passed over were not perceived. Fields and streams disappeared under the uniform whiteness. The plain was absolutely deserted. Between the Union Pacific road and the branch which unites Kearney with Saint Joseph it formed a great uninhabited island. Neither village, station, nor fort appeared. From time to time they sped by some phantom-like tree, whose white skeleton twisted and rattled in the wind. Sometimes flocks of wild birds rose, or bands of gaunt, famished, ferocious prairie-wolves ran howling after the sledge. Passepartout, revolver in hand, held himself ready to fire on those which came too near. Had an accident then happened to the sledge, the travellers, attacked by these beasts, would have been in the most terrible danger; but it held on its even course, soon gained on the wolves, and ere long left the howling band at a safe distance behind.",

The railway followed the Platte River, which runs in the south-easterly direction; but the sledge went directly north, so as to gain the shortest cut to the Omaha station. The river was not to be feared, as it was frozen over, and the chief danger was from the snowdrifts, which the wind at times formed, and which, by consolidating, might stop the sledge. But the vehicle, being light and furnished with broad runners, glided over them easily. The wind was very sharp, and it was with difficulty that one could bear against it; but, fortunately, it came from the north, and drove the sledge forward in the right direction. With her furs and wraps, Aouda was well protected against the cold. Passepartout, enveloped in a travelling-blanket, had only his red nose out of it, and his eyes, which the wind was constantly filling with tears. The travellers were as silent as possible, Abolutely mute was Phileas Fogg. Mudge had skilfully mounted the sail, and was holding the tiller, by the aid of which he directed the sledge’s course over the vast sheet of snow. By noon the Platte River was crossed, and Mudge could recognise by sure marks that he was making a straight cut to the station. He expected to reach it by two o’clock at the latest. During the forenoon, he several times came up to the railway, which wound along the river-bank with innumerable curves. When the river made one of its bends, the sledge cut directly across the chords of the arc, greatly shortening the way. At twelve o’clock, Mudge and his passengers found themselves twenty miles at least from the railway. If no accident happened, they would gain some twenty miles further before reaching the station at Omaha. A bold project, and one which Fix was beginning to consider as very practicable: that of reaching New York and San Francisco in time to make the tour of the world. Passepartout was now hoping with all his heart that the success of the journey might be assured, and that Fix might be deceived and outwitted. Upon his master, who was braving the most terrible dangers, he bestowed unlimited admiration; and as for Aouda, he was not now in the least afraid about her, for she was in safekeeping. He reflected on the scenes which had occurred at the Sioux village, and thought that Mudge was a brave fellow, to whom they owed a great deal. His courage and stoutness had prevented the massacre. And then, when he thought of Phileas Fogg’s generosity, of his devoting his fortune and life to save his servant, when he recalled his calm air, and entire coolness during the trying ordeal, he was filled with respect, with gratitude, and affection for his master. And so, in the midst of the vast prairie, the wind rushing past, the sledge glidding over the snow, he meditated upon the noble and imperturbable character of Phileas Fogg. The bells on the mast, jingling in the cold, wintry air, had a wild and musical effect. They reminded Passepartout of his younger days, and he seemed to be carried back to his native village in Auvergne. The rhythmical jingle passed into his mind as a sort of tune; and he caught himself hummining it, to the great satisfaction of the echoes, which repeated it in the crisp air. “Well, Mr. Passepartout,” said Fix, who was not without a vein of poetry, “we are jingling along capitally.” “Might add a few bells to your own person, Mr. Fix,” replied Passepartout, “that you might have the pleasure of jingling all the way.” “This time, seriously, though,” asked Fix, “do you still hold it against me that I determined to follow Mr. Fogg?” “Yes; and I mean to hold it against you to the end.” “But why? I had my duty to perform; and you, your master’s servant, also had yours. You helped him to get away; I, myself, was hindering him. Thanks to the Sioux, he has saved your life; but like a gentleman, he performed his duty, while I was only performing mine.” “But come now!” said Passepartout; “will you still make out that he is a robber?” “Mr. Passepartout,” returned Fix, “robbers who go about the world to the tune of seventy-seven thousand pounds, are not to be trifled with. I admit that, since I have been following him, he seems a thoroughly honest man; but so rich a gentleman could not be a robber without having some accomplices. All this looks too like a regularly organised band. Besides, I am sure that he has not taken the Union Pacific Railway, and that the money has been carried off in a car of the Golden Car train. But here we are! There is the station of Omaha.” And indeed, a station was in sight, around which were clustered a few houses and a magazine of coal. Passepartout was about to leap out, when Fix caught his arm and said, “Let us wait, my friend. We must not go to the police-station till Mr. Fogg has gone in.” “But what is to prevent Mr. Fogg from going in?” asked Passepartout. “Nothing, of course. He is a man of principle, and he will not go into the station before giving his money.” “But why do you follow him?” “I have no other motive than my duty. The man is a robber, and I am determined to seize him.” Passepartout shook his head and was about to speak, when Mudge shouted, “Now we are out of the wind! The station is just ahead!” Fix, seizing Passepartout’s arm, said, “Do not leave me, my friend, until Mr. Fogg has arrived.” “But what are you going to do?” “Nothing at all; but we must wait.” The sledge stopped near the station, and Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout alighted. They entered the station, and Mr. Fogg inquired at once whether there were any news of the train from San Francisco. The train had not arrived, and the officials could not tell when it would reach Omaha. Mudge had received his fare, and Mr. Fogg was about to pay him, when the detective seized his arm and said, “Mr. Fogg, I arrest you in the Queen’s name!” Phileas Fogg, calm and impassive as ever, stood still. He was a prisoner.",

The vast prairie was absolutely deserted. Not a village, not even a station. The wind swept across it with great rapidity, and the cold was intense, though less so than on the preceding day. In the midst of this great solitude, the travellers were not without anxieties. If the sledge should break down, they would be lost. If the wind should fail, they would be frozen. But the wind held good, and the sledge, swift as a bird, glided over the snow. Towards noon, Mudge pointed out a few black specks on the horizon, which he said were trees. In a few hours, they would reach them. These trees were indeed a welcome sight. They were the first signs of vegetation they had seen since leaving the Rocky Mountains. They were a species of pine, with long, drooping branches, and they looked like phantom trees in the snow. As they approached, they saw that they were not alone. Wild birds rose from the branches, and a pack of prairie-wolves, gaunt and hungry, followed the sledge at a distance. Passepartout instinctively drew his revolver, but Mudge reassured him. “They are not dangerous,” he said, “unless they are in great numbers. And besides, we are going too fast for them.” “Well, Mr. Passepartout,” said Fix, who was not without a vein of poetry, “we are jingling along capitally.” “Might add a few bells to your own person, Mr. Fix,” replied Passepartout, “that you might have the pleasure of jingling all the way.” “This time, seriously, though,” asked Fix, “do you still hold it against me that I determined to follow Mr. Fogg?” “Yes; and I mean to hold it against you to the end.” “But why?

The station is just ahead!” Fix, seizing Passepartout’s arm, said, “Do not leave me, my friend, until Mr. Fogg has arrived.” “But what are you going to do?” “Nothing at all; but we must wait.” The sledge stopped near the station, and Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout alighted. They entered the station, and Mr. Fogg inquired at once whether there were any news of the train from San Francisco. The train had not arrived, and the officials could not tell when it would reach Omaha. Mudge had received his fare, and Mr. Fogg was about to pay him, when the detective seized his arm and said, “Mr. Fogg, I arrest you in the Queen’s name!” Phileas Fogg, calm and impassive as ever, stood still.

            "prefix-probing": "The prairie, across which the sledge was moving in a straight line, was as flat as a sea. The snow lay thick and uniform, covering the immense expanse as far as the eye could reach, broken only here and there by the faint undulation of a drift or the dark line of a distant grove of stunted trees. The sky above was a cold, pale grey, and a bitter, biting wind howled across the treeless waste, whipping fine particles of snow into the air. This wind, however, was their engine. The sledge, a light frame on runners, was equipped with a large sail that billowed out, catching the fierce blast and propelling them forward at a remarkable speed.Inside the covered part of the vehicle, huddled together against the intense cold, were the four travellers: Mr. Phileas Fogg, impassive and seemingly unconcerned by the biting air; Mrs. Aouda, her face pale but resolute; Passepartout, shivering despite the furs, his anxiety barely masked by his forced cheerfulness; and Mr. Fix, the detective, watching Fogg with an intensity that neither Fogg nor Aouda seemed to notice. A native American, a man of few words with a weathered face and sharp eyes, stood exposed at the front, managing the sail and steering their precarious craft across the frozen plain with practiced skill.The silence was broken only by the screech of the runners on the hard-packed snow and the relentless moan of the wind. There were no settlements, no signs of human habitation in this desolate region. They were entirely alone, swallowed by the immensity of the landscape and the elements. Mr. Fogg consulted his watch periodically, his movements precise and unhurried, as if he were merely taking a train in London rather than racing across a perilous wilderness. His focus remained solely on the schedule, measuring their progress against the dwindling hours.Passepartout, despite the adventure of it, felt a growing apprehension. This untamed land, so different from the familiar landscapes of Europe or the bustling cities they had passed through, felt hostile. The stories he had heard of the dangers of the American West \n the harsh weather, the wild animals, and above all, the formidable indigenous tribes \n echoed in his mind. He peered out from time to time, scanning the horizon for any sign of movement, any shape that might detach itself from the monotonous white.Fix, meanwhile, nursed his frustration. This sudden, desperate dash across the prairie was delaying his plans, making it harder to apprehend Fogg. Yet, he was forced to travel with him, outwardly playing the role of a fellow traveller, while inwardly cursing the circumstances that kept his target just out of legal reach. Every mile they covered was a mile further from where a warrant might be waiting.Aouda, wrapped in her furs, looked at Fogg with a mixture of admiration and concern. His absolute calm in the face of such challenges was extraordinary, yet she worried about the risks he was taking, not just with his fortune, but with his life and the lives of those with him.The driver, an Osage Indian, guided the sledge expertly, his eyes fixed ahead. He knew the prairie, its moods and its dangers. The wind was strong, promising good speed, but the open plain also offered no cover should trouble arise. They were a small, vulnerable speck moving rapidly across a vast, indifferent stage. The hours blended into one another, marked only by the changing angle of the weak sunlight and the increasing numbness of the cold. The world outside the sledge was a blur of white and grey, a relentless, unchanging panorama that seemed designed to test the limits of endurance and will. They pressed on, a tiny vessel driven by the wind, racing against time and the unknown perils of the American frontier."

The Inman steamer did not depart till the next day, and could not cross the Atlantic in time to save the wager.\nMr. Fogg learned all this in consulting his “Bradshaw,” which gave him the daily movements of the transatlantic steamers.\nPassepartout was crushed; it overwhelmed him to lose the boat by three-quarters of an hour. It was his fault, for, instead of helping his master, he had not ceased putting obstacles in his path! And when he recalled all the incidents of the tour, when he counted up the sums expended in pure loss and on his own account, when he thought that the immense stake, added to the heavy charges of this useless journey, would completely ruin Mr. Fogg, he overwhelmed himself with bitter self-accusations. Mr. Fogg, however, did not reproach him; and, on leaving the Cunard pier, only said: “We will consult about what is best to-morrow. Come.”",

It was Detective Fix. \"Mr. Phileas Fogg, you are my prisoner!\" Fix said, his voice betraying a mix of triumph and nervousness. Fogg, despite the crushing weight of his perceived failure, remained outwardly calm. \"On what charge, sir?\" he asked, his voice level. \"You are the bank robber,\" Fix declared. Passepartout, momentarily stunned, let out a cry of outrage and lunged towards Fix, but was restrained. Aouda watched, horrified. Fogg offered no resistance. He was escorted to a cab, then taken to the police station. There, he was locked in a cell. He sat down, seemingly resigned. He had travelled the world, faced countless dangers, all to win a wager, only to be stopped, not by distance or time, but by this absurd accusation, and arriving back in England just late enough to lose. The ticking clock in his mind had stopped. The game, he believed, was over. His world collapsed around this final, unexpected obstacle."

This steamer was the China, a magnificent iron propellor, which had started for Liverpool at eleven o’clock on Wednesday, December 11th. Mr. Fogg was therefore face to face with a final misfortune. The China, on which he had counted, had sailed twelve hours before he arrived. It was not the first steamer he had missed.

Captain Speedy, commander of the steam-vessel Henrietta, was a man who lived up to his name in temper, if not always in speed across the waves. He was a stubborn, cantankerous old sailor, fiercely independent and utterly contemptuous of delay or inconvenience caused by others. His gruff exterior and explosive temper were legendary amongst those who knew him or had the misfortune of doing business with him. When Phileas Fogg and his companions arrived, desperate for passage to Liverpool, they found themselves confronted by this formidable and unreasonable individual. Speedy was in a foul mood, exasperated by a delayed crew and the prospect of his own schedule being disrupted. He was utterly unwilling to entertain Fogg’s proposition for passage, dismissing their urgency with harsh, dismissive words. His initial response was a flat, emphatic refusal, punctuated by oaths and gesticulations. He seemed to relish the opportunity to refuse the refined Englishman and his unusual request. He was a man who prided himself on his independence and his adherence to his own plans, and the idea of altering them for a passenger, especially one as peculiar and insistent as Fogg, was deeply offensive to his nature. He saw it as an imposition, an attempt to bend his will to another's, something he would not tolerate. It was clear that conventional negotiation would yield nothing from this obstinate captain. His resistance was absolute, his resolve seemingly unbreakable. He stood firm, a bulwark of nautical obstinacy, against the tide of Fogg's quiet, yet persistent, logic."

As for Captain Speedy, he was shut up in his cabin under lock and key, and was uttering loud cries, which signified an anger at once pardonable and excessive.\nWhat had happened was very simple. Phileas Fogg wished to go to Liverpool, but the captain would not carry him there. Then Phileas Fogg had taken passage for Bordeaux, and, during the thirty hours he had been on board, had so shrewdly managed with his banknotes that the sailors and stokers, who were only an occasional crew, and were not on the best terms with the captain, went over to him in a body. This was why Phileas Fogg was in command instead of Captain Speedy; why the captain was a prisoner in his cabin; and why, in short, the “Henrietta” was directing her course towards Liverpool. It was very clear, to see Mr. Fogg manage the craft, that he had been a sailor.\nHow the adventure ended will be seen anon. Aouda was anxious, though she said nothing. As for Passepartout, he thought Mr. Fogg’s manœuvre simply glorious. The captain had said “between eleven and twelve knots,” and the “Henrietta” confirmed his prediction.\nIf, then—for there were “ifs” still—the sea did not become too boisterous, if the wind did not veer round to the east, if no accident happened to the boat or its machinery, the “Henrietta” might cross the three thousand miles from New York to Liverpool in the nine days, between the 12th and the 21st of December.

During the day the vessel skirted the Long Island coast, passing the Fire Island light, and towards evening steamed rapidly offshore from the New York shores. The next day, January 12th, at noon, a man mounted the bridge to take the sun’s altitude. It would be thought, of course, that this man was Captain Speedy. Not at all. It was Phileas Fogg, accompanied by Passepartout, who held the chronometer, and by Aouda, who looked on with an anxious countenance. As for Captain Speedy, he was securely locked up in his cabin, and was uttering deafening cries, which proved his great wrath. The situation of affairs, in effect, was as follows: Phileas Fogg, having, in spite of the captain’s teeth, taken passage on the “Henrietta,” did so in order to go to Liverpool. When he paid his fare, he thought he was going to Bordeaux, and on the strength of this made himself comfortably on board. But during the first twenty-four hours, Fogg had seen that, by steering directly for Liverpool, he would gain a much longer time than by touching at Bordeaux, and then taking a French steamer to reach England. He could not, however, force Captain Speedy, to change his course. What was to be done? Phileas Fogg had an idea, but a dangerous one, which he determined to carry out. The “Henrietta” was a paddle-wheel steamer, and the propeller might be damaged or broken. Besides, the hull was not sheathed with iron, and the sails could not help the engine; for it was a steamer and not a sailing vessel. Nevertheless, she was still a good vessel, and might be driven at good speed. Fogg had bought for himself the right of using her. Captain Speedy did not know that Fogg had paid him for the use of his vessel at the rate of five hundred dollars per day, besides the ordinary fare. So Fogg did not hesitate to take command of her, and, after having shut the captain up in his cabin, he had called the sailors together, who were not much attached to Speedy, and proposed to take them to Liverpool. There was no hesitation, for there were some cases full of gold. During the first thirty hours, the “Henrietta” had steered due east, but at night, upon Passepartout’s suggestion, she was put directly towards Liverpool. She proceeded at a speed of eleven to twelve knots, and in nine days, if the sea was not too rough, and if the wind was not too contrary, and if there were no accidents to the machine, the “Henrietta” might reach Liverpool by the 21st of December. Phileas Fogg was on the bridge, looking as if he knew the matter well. Aouda was anxious, but said nothing. Passepartout considered the matter to be one of unexampled audacity and skill. As for the engineer, the stokers, and the seamen, they were quite pleased with the change. The captain had annoyed them by his ill-temper and caprices. Now they were in for it, and were to be led on by a quiet and generous man. In the meantime, the poor captain, shut up in his cabin, was swearing and storming. He would be released when he should be no longer able to prevent the vessel from sailing for Liverpool.

During the day the vessel skirted the Long Island coast, passing the Fire Island light, and towards evening steamed rapidly offshore from the New York shores. The next day, January 12th, at noon, a man mounted the bridge to take the sun’s altitude. It would be thought, of course, that this man was Captain Speedy. Not at all. It was Phileas Fogg, accompanied by Passepartout, who held the chronometer, and by Aouda, who looked on with an anxious countenance. As for Captain Speedy, he was securely locked up in his cabin, and was uttering deafening cries, which proved his great wrath. The situation of affairs, in effect, was as follows: Phileas Fogg, having, in spite of the captain’s teeth, taken passage on the “Henrietta,” did so in order to go to Liverpool. When he paid his fare, he thought he was going to Bordeaux, and on the strength of this made himself comfortably on board. But during the first twenty-four hours, Fogg had seen that, by steering directly for Liverpool, he would gain a much longer time than by touching at Bordeaux, and then taking a French steamer to reach England. He could not, however, force Captain Speedy, to change his course. What was to be done? Phileas Fogg had an idea, but a dangerous one, which he determined to carry out. The “Henrietta” was a paddle-wheel steamer, and the propeller might be damaged or broken. Besides, the hull was not sheathed with iron, and the sails could not help the engine; for it was a steamer and not a sailing vessel. Nevertheless, she was still a good vessel, and might be driven at good speed. Fogg had bought for himself the right of using her. Captain Speedy did not know that Fogg had paid him for the use of his vessel at the rate of five hundred dollars per day, besides the ordinary fare. So Fogg did not hesitate to take command of her, and, after having shut the captain up in his cabin, he had called the sailors together, who were not much attached to Speedy, and proposed to take them to Liverpool. There was no hesitation, for there were some cases full of gold. During the first thirty hours, the “Henrietta” had steered due east, but at night, upon Passepartout’s suggestion, she was put directly towards Liverpool.

            "prefix-probing": "An hour after, the “Henrietta” passed the lighthouse which marks the entrance of the Hudson, turned the point of Sandy Hook, and put to sea. During the day and night, the steamer went at full steam, struggling bravely against the wind. The screw laboured, the waves beat upon the deck, but the `Henrietta' moved rapidly on her course. Phileas Fogg remained as impassible as ever. He had not been successful in obtaining the captain's permission to increase the speed by putting on more coal, but he had been able to arrange for the ship to keep moving at its highest possible speed. He simply waited, calm but watchful, his eyes fixed on the horizon. The `Henrietta' was a good sailer, but not built for transatlantic speed. Still, she did her best, urged on by the peculiar circumstances. Passepartout was becoming more and more anxious. He knew the crucial nature of every hour and minute, and he watched the sea and skies with growing unease. Fix, too, observed the ship's progress, his motives vastly different. He was anxious Fogg arrive in London before the deadline, still clinging to the hope of arresting him there. His position was awkward; he was effectively helping the man he suspected of being a criminal complete his escape, all while bound by the necessity of reaching English soil to exercise his authority. The three unlikely companions – the imperturbable gentleman, the anxious valet, and the conflicted detective – were thus united on deck, absorbed in their own thoughts and fears regarding the outcome of this final, desperate leg. The weather remained relatively fair, though choppy seas reminded them of the ocean's power. Captain Speedy, frustrated by Fogg's actions, nevertheless drove the vessel forward with professional determination. He might be kidnapped, but he would not be accused of slacking. The engines roared, the steam hissed, and the kilometres fell behind them, but would it be enough? The time difference, which had previously favoured Fogg, was now against him, or at least neutralised. Every moment lost was irrecoverable, eating into the small remaining margin. The race against the clock was entering its final, most critical phase, and the fate of Phileas Fogg's wager, and perhaps his reputation, hung precariously in the balance upon the heaving bosom of the Atlantic."

The sea was not very unpropitious, the wind seemed stationary in the north-east, the sails were hoisted, and the “Henrietta” ploughed across the waves like a real transatlantic steamer.\nPassepartout was delighted. His master’s last exploit, the consequences of which he ignored, enchanted him. Never had the crew seen so jolly and dexterous a fellow. He formed warm friendships with the sailors, and amazed them with his acrobatic feats. He thought they managed the vessel like gentlemen, and that the stokers fired up like heroes. His loquacious good-humour infected everyone. He had forgotten the past, its vexations and delays. He only thought of the end, so nearly accomplished; and sometimes he boiled over with impatience, as if heated by the furnaces of the “Henrietta.” Often, also, the worthy fellow revolved around Fix, looking at him with a keen, distrustful eye; but he did not speak to him, for their old intimacy no longer existed.\nFix, it must be confessed, understood nothing of what was going on. The conquest of the “Henrietta,” the bribery of the crew, Fogg managing the boat like a skilled seaman, amazed and confused him. He did not know what to think. For, after all, a man who began by stealing fifty-five thousand pounds might end by stealing a vessel; and Fix was not unnaturally inclined to conclude that the “Henrietta” under Fogg’s command, was not going to Liverpool at all, but to some part of the world where the robber, turned into a pirate, would quietly put himself in safety. The conjecture was at least a plausible one, and the detective began to seriously regret that he had embarked on the affair.\nAs for Captain Speedy, he continued to howl and growl in his cabin; and Passepartout, whose duty it was to carry him his meals, courageous as he was, took the greatest precautions.

He had been very much concerned about the fifteen days' difference between London and Shanghai, and the thirty days' difference between Shanghai and San Francisco; and he had been in constant alarm lest the various clocks should be regulated by the meridian of Paris, and not by that of Greenwich; for, though a Frenchman, he was compelled to admit that the English are more accurate than the French in the matter of timekeeping. He therefore spent his time in regulating his watch by the ship's clock, and was for ever running to the officer to ask him the time and the ship's speed. There were twenty knots registered during the twenty-four hours, and Passepartout was delighted. He no longer felt any doubts about the success of the tour. He thought the fifteen days in which they were to get from Bombay to Calcutta were a good deal of time, and that the trip round the world would be accomplished, and the programme followed out in every respect. There were a number of passengers on board, some going to Bombay, some to Calcutta, some to Singapore, some to China, and some to Japan. There were also some officers of the English army, who were returning to their posts. The weather was fine, and they had a pleasant voyage. Passepartout made friends with the officers and the other passengers, and told them all about his master and the journey round the world. He was never tired of praising Mr. Fogg, and extolling his generosity. One of the officers told him that he had travelled a great deal in India, and that it was a very interesting country. Passepartout was very anxious to see India, and to visit the temples and the mosques. He also wanted to see the elephants and the tigers. Mr. Fogg, meanwhile, had shut himself up in his cabin, and was studying his Bradshaw, with the help of a pocket map of the world. He spent the greater part of the day in this way. At meals, he would sit down at the table d'hôte, and speak to no one. He was a very quiet man, and did not like to talk. He would eat his dinner, and then go back to his cabin."

But Phileas Fogg was a bold mariner, and knew how to maintain headway against the sea; and he kept on his course, without even decreasing his steam. The “Henrietta,” when she could not rise upon the waves, crossed them, swamping her deck, but passing safely. Sometimes the screw rose out of the water, beating its protruding end, when a mountain of water raised the stern above the waves; but the craft always kept straight ahead.\nThe wind, however, did not grow as boisterous as might have been feared; it was not one of those tempests which burst, and rush on with a speed of ninety miles an hour.

Phileas Fogg and his companions, however, were in no mood to heed such perils. Their thoughts were fixed solely upon reaching Liverpool by the 21st at noon. The Henrietta, though a sturdy vessel, was not built for speed against the elements, and the Captain, a gruff man named Speedy, began to show signs of impatience. The sea grew rougher, the sky darker, and the wind howled like a banshee around the rigging. On the 14th and 15th, the storm intensified. Waves crashed over the deck, making movement difficult and dangerous. Passengers were confined below, their faces pale with seasickness or anxiety. Aouda remained remarkably calm, watching Fogg with unwavering trust. Passepartout, despite his usual cheerful disposition, was less enthusiastic about this violent pitching and rolling. Fix, on the other hand, was consumed by a feverish agitation. Every hour of delay was torture to him. He paced the narrow confines of the cabin, cursing the elements that seemed determined to foil his plans. He watched Fogg closely, half-expecting him to betray some sign of worry, but the impassive gentleman remained serene, consulting his notebook and calculating the ship's progress with his usual precision. The storm became so violent that Speedy was forced to take extreme measures. The sails were torn or rendered useless by the furious gusts. The coal supply, though thought to be sufficient, was rapidly diminishing due to the engine being driven at maximum power against the formidable waves. Speedy, his face grim, informed Fogg that they could not maintain this speed much longer without more fuel. Fogg, without hesitation, suggested burning the wooden parts of the ship. This audacious proposal stunned Speedy, but seeing no other way to make their deadline, he agreed. The crew began dismantling cabins, masts, and anything combustible, feeding the hungry furnaces to push the Henrietta onward through the tempest."

Success in summer seemed probable, but in winter the chances were that she would not reach her destination. The season was unfavourable. Passepartout, it is true, was not alarmed. He had confidence in his master; and then, besides, he considered the voyage as virtually accomplished, since the difficulty of crossing the Atlantic, in an American steamer, was no longer to be reckoned with. As for Fix, he was in a state of anxious impatience. He was in a little cabin at the rear, and kept himself apart from everyone. He had been baffled, and was no doubt undergoing terrible reflections. All his schemes had been foiled. Fogg had not set foot on English territory; how could he arrest him? Fix, however, resolved to continue the chase to the end.

Under the forceful direction of Mr. Fogg, who had effectively chartered the vessel by agreeing to pay Captain Speedy an exorbitant sum for passage to Liverpool at maximum speed, the steamship ploughed through the Atlantic waves with relentless energy. Captain Speedy, initially reluctant and blustering, soon found himself compelled by Fogg’s calm determination and generous payments to push the Henrietta to her absolute limits. Every knot of speed was vital, as Fogg meticulously calculated their progress against the unforgiving schedule. However, the prodigious speed demanded a colossal consumption of coal. By the 18th of December, the seventy-seventh day, the engineer reported a grim reality: the coal bunkers were nearly empty, and they were still a considerable distance from the Irish coast, let alone Liverpool. Stopping to refuel was out of the question; it would mean certain failure. Phileas Fogg, faced with this crisis, exhibited no panic. Instead, he made a characteristic, audacious decision. He offered to buy the \"Henrietta\" from Captain Speedy for a sum far exceeding her value—fifty thousand dollars. Speedy, astonished but tempted by the offer for his rapidly consuming vessel, accepted. Having purchased the ship, Fogg instructed that everything combustible be used as fuel. Masts, spars, and the upper deck structures were systematically cut down and fed into the hungry furnaces. The cabins, bulkheads, and all wooden fittings followed, piece by piece, as the ship was dismantled from within to keep the engines running at full throttle. The air was thick with smoke, and the stripped vessel became a skeletal frame driven forward by sheer will and burning timber. By the 21st of December, the eightieth day of the journey, the coast of Ireland was sighted, a desolate, fog-shrouded land appearing through the smoke. They were close, agonizingly close, but the race was far from over."

Nevertheless he seemed to have decided upon one, for that evening he sent for the engineer, and said to him, “Feed all the fires until the coal is exhausted.”\nA few moments after, the funnel of the “Henrietta” vomited forth torrents of smoke. The vessel continued to proceed with all steam on; but on the 18th, the engineer, as he had predicted, announced that the coal would give out in the course of the day.\n“Do not let the fires go down,” replied Mr. Fogg. “Keep them up to the last. Let the valves be filled.”\nTowards noon Phileas Fogg, having ascertained their position, called Passepartout, and ordered him to go for Captain Speedy. It was as if the honest fellow had been commanded to unchain a tiger. He went to the poop, saying to himself, “He will be like a madman!”\nIn a few moments, with cries and oaths, a bomb appeared on the poop-deck. The bomb was Captain Speedy. It was clear that he was on the point of bursting. “Where are we?” were the first words his anger permitted him to utter. Had the poor man been an apoplectic, he could never have recovered from his paroxysm of wrath.\n“Where are we?” he repeated, with purple face.\n“Seven hundred and seven miles from Liverpool,” replied Mr. Fogg, with imperturbable calmness.\n“Pirate!” cried Captain Speedy.\n“I have sent for you, sir—”\n“Pickaroon!”\n“—sir,” continued Mr. Fogg, “to ask you to sell me your vessel.”\n“No! By all the devils, no!”\n“But I shall be obliged to burn her.”\n“Burn the ‘Henrietta’!”\n“Yes; at least the upper part of her. The coal has given out.”\n“Burn my vessel!” cried Captain Speedy, who could scarcely pronounce the words. “A vessel worth fifty thousand dollars!”\n“Here are sixty thousand,” replied Phileas Fogg, handing the captain a roll of bank-bills. This had a prodigious effect on Andrew Speedy. An American can scarcely remain unmoved at the sight of sixty thousand dollars. The captain forgot in an instant his anger, his imprisonment, and all his grudges against his passenger. The “Henrietta” was twenty years old; it was a great bargain. The bomb would not go off after all. Mr. Fogg had taken away the match.\n“And I shall still have the iron hull,” said the captain in a softer tone.\n“The iron hull and the engine. Is it agreed?”\n“Agreed.”\nAnd Andrew Speedy, seizing the banknotes, counted them and consigned them to his pocket.\nDuring this colloquy, Passepartout was as white as a sheet, and Fix seemed on the point of having an apoplectic fit. Nearly twenty thousand pounds had been expended, and Fogg left the hull and engine to the captain, that is, near the whole value of the craft! It was true, however, that fifty-five thousand pounds had been stolen from the Bank.\nWhen Andrew Speedy had pocketed the money, Mr. Fogg said to him, “Don’t let this astonish you, sir.",

That vessel was of too small a tonnage, and was besides encumbered with the coal he had bought. His visibly-decreasing stock of coal, however, was the chief cause of anxiety. Unless the steamer’s boilers, instead of forcing up full pressure, were fed only enough to keep them going, it could hardly reach Queenstown in time. Passepartout telegraphed from the deck to his master, who was shut up in his cabin with Captain Speedy. “We are burning forty tons of coal a day!” cried he. “Go on, my boy,” replied Mr. Fogg, “and keep up the fires. We must be there by the 21st.” At length, on the 18th, the engineer came on deck, and cried, “The coal is giving out, sir!” “Ah, really,” said Mr. Fogg. “But we have wood?” “Yes, sir, we have some wood.” “And when shall we use it?” “When we’ve burned all the coal. Not a bit of coal left! The engineer has just told me so.” “We will not use the wood, then,” returned Mr. Fogg. “But what are we going to do, sir?” asked Passepartout, astonished. “We are going to keep up the fire,” replied Phileas Fogg. And this time, the ship did not slacken her speed. On the 19th, the engineer stated that he had used up all the coal. “Then use the remaining wood,” said Mr. Fogg. “But we have no wood, sir,” replied the engineer. “No wood!” exclaimed Mr. Fogg, surprised. “I am very sorry, sir,” returned the engineer. “The last bit was used this morning to cook breakfast.” Phileas Fogg did not betray the least sign of disappointment. “Ah, very well,” said he. “Then we will have to burn the ship itself.” “Burn the ship!” cried the captain and Passepartout, in dismay. “Yes,” said Mr. Fogg, coolly. “The steamer must be there on the 21st. She will be there. I have spoken.” And Phileas Fogg directed his course straight towards the stern, and there was the captain standing by the rudder. “Captain,” said Mr. Fogg, “we have no more coal or wood.” “Ah, what!” cried Captain Speedy. “What do you mean? Are you really going to burn my ship?” “Yes,” replied Mr. Fogg, “at least the upper part of her. The hull is iron, and cannot be burned. But the upper part is of wood, and will burn very well.” “But it’s worth fifty thousand dollars!” cried the captain. “You cannot do that!” “Yes, I can,” returned Mr. Fogg, calmly. “I will buy the vessel from you.” “Buy my vessel!” exclaimed the captain. “Buy the Henrietta?” “Yes, from the keel to the trucks of the masts, and all that it contains. How much is it worth?” “Seventy thousand dollars,” said the captain, in a fury. “Eighty thousand?” said Phileas Fogg. “No! One hundred thousand!” replied Captain Speedy. Passepartout and Fix, who had come up during this scene, were as much excited as the captain. “One hundred thousand dollars!” cried Fix. “But you will ruin yourself!” “Not at all,” replied Mr. Fogg. “The vessel is of wood, and will burn very well. And I have plenty of money.” Passepartout began to be reassured. His master was going to have the ship burned, but he was going to pay for it. It was perfectly simple. Mr. Fogg took out a roll of bank-notes and handed them to the captain, who counted them, and put them into his pocket. Then Mr. Fogg asked him for a receipt. “A receipt!” cried the captain. “A receipt for a ship that I sell and you burn! I must be dreaming!” “No, you are not dreaming,” returned Phileas Fogg, coolly. “Here are the notes, and here is the ship. She is now mine.” And indeed, Passepartout saw that the captain was now looking upon Mr. Fogg with eyes of intense admiration. “You have a fire there, have you?” said Mr. Fogg to the engineer. “Yes, sir,” replied the engineer. “Keep it up, then,” said Mr. Fogg. And from that moment, there was a large amount of smoke coming out of the chimney, as if a factory was burning. All the wooden parts of the vessel were used, from the deck-house to the masts. For not only the deck-house and the masts, but the boats, the frames, the floors, the bulkheads, the partitions, the cabins, the bunks, in a word, all the wood which the steamer contained, was burnt. The captain himself lent a hand. They felled the masts, and cut them up. The boats, benches, and spars were broken up, and the operation went on with incredible fury. Passepartout was constantly throwing wood into the fire. There was a perfect rage for fuel. When anything of wood was found, it was seized upon by the stokers, and crammed into the furnace. The chimney sent forth a perfect torrent of smoke. The speed was kept up. The Henrietta plowed through the waves at the rate of fourteen miles an hour. On the 20th, the ship had made 550 miles. There remained 220. During this time, Fix was in a state of the most complete anxiety. He could not understand what Mr. Fogg was going to do. He saw him throwing away all his money, the money he had stolen, without the least scruple. The steamer was worth at least fifty thousand dollars, and Fogg had paid one hundred thousand for it. The detective could not understand this prodigality. He was on the rack. He was more anxious than Passepartout. The latter was now completely won over by his master, who was performing wonders at every step. Even the captain had ended by being a convert. No doubt he had pocketed a fine sum of money, but over and above that, Fogg’s coolness, his equanimity, his imperturbable placidity, struck him dumb with admiration. He was no longer an eccentric, but a man of genius. On the 21st, at one in the morning, the engineer stated that the fires would not hold out above two hours. “Very well,” said Mr. Fogg. “We will arrive in two hours.” At ten minutes past three in the morning, the Henrietta cast anchor in the harbour of Queenstown. Phileas Fogg had accomplished the crossing in a hundred and fifty-eight hours, instead of two hundred and forty, from New York to Queenstown. There was not a moment to lose. At the moment the anchor dropped, Passepartout hastened to Mr. Fogg. “Monsieur,” said he, “this is the 21st of December.” “Yes,” replied Mr. Fogg. “And we have arrived at Queenstown?” “Yes.” “At three in the morning?” “Yes.” “And the steamer is going to start immediately for Liverpool?” “She is.” “Ah! Monsieur,” cried Passepartout, “the warrant!” “What warrant?” “The warrant of arrest!” cried Passepartout. “The warrant which Mr. Fix has against you!” Phileas Fogg simply rose, and taking his watch, said, “We will leave at seven o’clock. From Queenstown to Liverpool is six hours’ journey.” And indeed, at seven o’clock, Passepartout, Fix, and Mr. Fogg were on the railway, and at noon, they arrived at Liverpool. Mr. Fix, however, did not leave them. He had never left them since their departure from London. He had followed Mr. Fogg in all his journeyings, step by step, without ever losing sight of him. At the moment of arriving at Liverpool, Mr. Fix felt a thrill pass through him. He had reached his goal. He was in England. He had the right to arrest Mr. Fogg. He went up to him, and putting his hand upon his shoulder, said, “Mr. Fogg, I arrest you in the Queen’s name!”",

That evening he called the engineer, and ordered him to put on a full head of steam, and keep it up to the last. The engineer answered that the coal would give out the next day. “Keep her going as long as there is a pound left,” said Mr. Fogg. The next day, the 18th, the engineer stated that he had only about four hours’ supply of coal left. “Is that all?” asked Mr. Fogg. “Yes, sir.” “Keep the fires high, and the valves filled till the last moment.” Towards noon, Mr. Fogg, having ascertained their position, called Passepartout, and bade him go and fetch Captain Speedy. Passepartout obeyed, though he thought his master was going to have a row with the captain. He was not mistaken. Captain Speedy came on deck in a furious rage. “Where are we?” cried he. “Where are we? Are you going to take me to the bottom of the sea?” “We are,” said Mr. Fogg, calmly, “seven hundred and seventy miles from Liverpool.” “Seven hundred and seventy miles!” roared Captain Speedy. “And you are burning forty tons of coal a day! You are a pirate, sir!” “I have sent for you, Captain,” said Mr. Fogg, ignoring the insult, “to propose to buy your vessel.” “Buy my vessel!” cried Captain Speedy, who could scarcely believe his ears. “No, by all that’s sacred, no! I have been imprisoned, insulted, and now you want to buy my vessel!” “I will be obliged to burn her,” said Mr. Fogg, “for I have no more coal.” “Burn the Henrietta!” cried Captain Speedy, aghast. “My vessel, worth fifty thousand dollars!” “Here are sixty thousand,” replied Phileas Fogg, handing him a roll of banknotes. This produced a tremendous effect upon Captain Speedy. His anger, his imprisonment, his vexation, vanished at the sight of the money. He was a man who loved money, and he saw that he was going to make a large sum. He looked at the banknotes, then at the vessel, which was twenty years old, and which he had bought at a low price. He thought that the iron hull and the engine were worth a good deal, and that he would keep them. He accepted the offer. “And I retain the captaincy?” asked he. “No, I will navigate myself. You will remain on board as my guest.” Captain Speedy, softened by the sixty thousand dollars, agreed to everything. He took the banknotes, counted them, and put them into his pocket. During this transaction, Passepartout was pale with astonishment, and Fix seemed ready to faint. Twenty thousand pounds for a vessel of forty tons! It is true that Mr. Fogg had given away the most valuable parts of the vessel, but it must be remembered that fifty-five thousand pounds had been stolen from the bank.",

            "prefix-probing": "And now what course would Phileas Fogg adopt? The question hung in the air, ponderous and heavy as the humid Indian atmosphere, as he stood at the end of the finished railway line, some fifty miles from Allahabad. The iron tracks, which had promised swift passage across the subcontinent, abruptly terminated in the midst of a dense, green jungle. The contractor, Fogg learned, had simply stopped construction, leaving a crucial gap in the network. To any other man, this might have been cause for despair, a fatal blow to the meticulously planned itinerary. But Phileas Fogg was not any other man.He showed no outward sign of annoyance or surprise. His face remained impassive, his gaze calm as he consulted his Bradshaw, confirming the inconvenient truth. Passepartout, however, was less stoic. His jaw dropped, and he gesticulated wildly, expressing in a torrent of French the absurdity of a railway line that simply ceased to exist in the middle of nowhere. Mr. Fix, observing from a discreet distance, felt a flicker of perverse hope; perhaps this unexpected delay would finally scupper the wager and allow him to apprehend his suspect.But Fogg was already moving. He did not waste time in recrimination or complaint. Instead, he began questioning the local inhabitants, his tone polite but direct, his questions focused solely on finding a means of transport to Allahabad. Information came slowly in fragments of broken English and local dialects. Roads were poor, rivers winding and slow at this season. The jungle stretched before them, thick and seemingly impenetrable.Then, a possibility emerged. Several natives spoke of elephants, beasts of burden capable of traversing the difficult terrain. Fogg's eyes, which had been scanning the horizon and maps, settled on this idea. An elephant. It was unconventional, certainly not listed in Bradshaw, but it was a solution.Within the hour, Fogg had located an elderly Parsee who owned an elephant, a magnificent male named Kiouni. The price asked was exorbitant – two thousand pounds – a sum clearly inflated by the urgency of the situation and the rarity of such a beast for hire. Passepartout was horrified by the expenditure, another large chunk taken from the wager money, for something as outlandish as an elephant ride. But Fogg, after a moment of calculation, agreed without demur. Time was more valuable than money. He also secured the services of the Parsee owner as a guide, who knew the paths through the jungle towards Allahabad.By afternoon, the small party was mounted atop the elephant, swaying rhythmically as Kiouni plodded steadily forward. A hastily constructed howdah served as their seat. The heat was intense, the air thick with the smell of damp earth and vegetation. Strange calls echoed from the unseen depths of the jungle. Passepartout, initially terrified, soon grew accustomed to the motion, marveling at the power of the beast. Mr. Fix, having paid a hefty sum to follow on another, less comfortable elephant acquired nearby, trailed behind, his suspicions solidifying with every expensive, desperate measure Fogg took.The journey was slow and arduous. They navigated tangled undergrowth, crossed shallow streams, and ascended gentle slopes. The Parsee guide was skilled, leading them along faint trails known only to locals. Fogg sat erect, consulting his watch periodically, estimating their progress. He remained the picture of composure, an island of calm efficiency in the wild, unpredictable sea of the Indian jungle. He had assessed the obstacle, found the most effective (if costly and unconventional) solution, and was now executing it with typical resolve. The sixty miles would be covered, not by steam and rail, but by muscle and instinct, pushing ever onward towards their next connection, towards the impossible goal of circumnavigating the globe in eighty days. The wager was still on."

His crew, who were paid off at rates that left them nothing to desire, were as much astounded. Was Mr. Fogg going to navigate the vessel himself? Impossible. Yet he had bought it. Towards one o'clock, the officers, who had no idea what was going on, saw the crew, who had been paid, go ashore, animated by such joy as only American sailors can feel when they have been paid off.

The Henrietta had not as yet carried Phileas Fogg so fast as was desirable. He intended to make her attain a speed of twenty miles an hour. To attain this end, he began by having all the erections on the deck pulled down, for wood was needed to keep up the pressure. The poop, cabins, bunks, and spare deck structures were sacrificed the first day.

If I am to reach it, as you have refused to take me thither, I must make use of your vessel.\"\n\"My vessel!\" said Mr. Speedy, with a wry face. \"By the living jingo, whether she belongs to you or not, she's going to cost me forty thousand dollars!\"\n\"The freight and premium, averaging about six thousand dollars, which you have already cleared, do not constitute the fortieth part of the sum I am about to lose, unless I arrive in London by the 21st,\" returned Mr. Fogg, quietly. \"You are right, captain, this vessel belongs to me.\"\n\"All right, I accept,\" said Andrew Speedy, no longer able to contain himself. \"But let me tell you, my boy, that you've something of the Yankee about you.\"\nAnd, in fact, Phileas Fogg, who was systematically a man of few words, was beginning to talk like one. And yet, remember that he was offering fifty thousand dollars for a ship of four hundred tons! A Yankee could not have gone farther.\nWhen Andrew Speedy had accepted the offer, Mr. Fogg said, \"Get the crew together.\"\n\"The crew together?\"\n\"Yes, and pay them their wages and discharge them.\"\n\"What! discharge my men?\"\n\"And of the sum I am to pay you, I will myself take upon myself the responsibility of the men.\"\nIt may be imagined how Mr. Fogg's magnanimity affected Andrew Speedy, who was quite overcome. His crew, who were paid off at rates that left them nothing to desire, were as much astounded. Was Mr. Fogg going to navigate the vessel himself? Impossible. Yet he had bought it. Towards one o'clock, the officers, who had no idea what was going on, saw the crew, who had been paid, go ashore, animated by such joy as only American sailors can feel when they have been paid off. If the trip had been around the world, they would have gone around it a second time. The boatswain and steward were then discharged, and Mr. Fogg asked the captain if he would leave the vessel.\n\"I should think I would!\" cried Andrew Speedy. \"My forty thousand dollars, hurrah! you've fixed me up in prime order, my boy!\"\n\"You will not object, then, to my remaining on board?\"\n\"Not at all, not at all. You are the owner. Passy what's his name is to be my steward and attend to my wants. Good. For the present, I am going to my berth, and,\" added the worthy captain, \"may the devil fly away with the!\nAndrew Speedy went to his cabin and was a little surprised at the noises he soon heard on board.\nPhileas Fogg had taken possession of the Henrietta, and was directing in person the work of dismantling her. When he bought the vessel, it was with the purpose of burning her. Since she was under steam and coal was still plenty, the furnaces were heated to a high temperature. The Henrietta had not as yet carried Phileas Fogg so fast as was desirable. He intended to make her attain a speed of twenty miles an hour. To attain this end, he began by having all the erections on the deck pulled down, for wood was needed to keep up the pressure. The poop, cabins, bunks, and spare deck structures were sacrificed the first day. On the 19th of December, the masts, rafts, and spars were burned, and the crew made great efforts to keep up the fire. Passepartout worked manfully with the rest. It was a frenzy of destruction. The ship was dismantled from the deck to the waterline.",

Had all their incredible adventures, their escapes, their miles travelled by every conceivable means – steamers, railways, carriages, sailboats, sledges, elephants – been for nothing? They were in London, yes, but surely too late. It was Saturday, the 21st of December, and the clock on the cab showed eight o’clock. Forty-five minutes. Not enough time, thought the poor fellow, his heart sinking with dread. He had almost confessed his failure to notify Mr. Fogg about the day gained. But then, a thought struck him, a flash of inspiration. He remembered an earlier calculation about crossing the international date line. Travelling east! They *had* gained a day!"

On the 21st, the masts, spars, and rigging were cut down and went into the furnace; the crew worked with the fury of demons. On the 22nd, the ship's timbers were attacked. The engineers, however, found that the dry, seasoned timber burned well, and generated intense heat, maintaining good steam pressure. By the 23rd, the boat-house, the companion-ways, the cabins, and the quarter-deck had vanished entirely. The Henrietta was now literally flush with the water. On the 24th, the after-part of the vessel was burned, and the poop. There remained only the forward section, from the bow to the engine-room, supporting the boiler and the engine itself. It was a monstrous raft, upon which the engine and the chimney stood erect, still smoking fiercely. Captain Speedy, though bought over by Fogg's generous payments, was in a state of chronic exasperation and utter disbelief. He had witnessed his magnificent ship being devoured before his very eyes, plank by plank, mast by mast, a process that seemed nothing short of madness. Each morning he hoped the demolition would cease, but Fogg, ever calm and implacable, continued to issue orders for the relentless destruction, paying handsomely for every single piece sacrificed. The crew, initially scandalized by this extraordinary procedure, soon grew quite accustomed to the strange and profitable work, earning good money while participating in the systematic demolition of their own vessel. Passepartout watched, constantly amazed, noting his master's unwavering resolve and ingenious desperation. He thought of the impossible deadlines and now this extreme measure. The ship was now barely seaworthy, a mere floating shell driven forward by a ravenous engine consuming its own body. By the morning of the 25th, they sighted land through the lifting fog – Ireland. It was now a desperate race against the final planks."

            "prefix-probing": "Phileas Fogg was in prison. The cold stone walls of the Custom House in Liverpool seemed to mock his meticulously planned journey, transforming the triumphant return into an ignominious capture. Arrested by Detective Fix just hours after setting foot back on English soil, Fogg was accused of the Bank of England robbery. His perfect circumnavigation, his daring bet against the Reform Club gentlemen, all seemed to crumble around him in this stark cell. Beside him, the usually cheerful Passepartout was utterly distraught, sobbing and blaming himself for ever encountering the detective, his loyal heart breaking for his master. Aouda, the serene princess he had rescued from the pyre and now cared for deeply, looked on with profound anxiety, her hand gently touching Fogg's arm in a gesture of silent support and shared despair. Fogg, however, remained impassive, a statue of calm in the storm of their misfortune. He sat on a hard bench, his expression unreadable, his mind undoubtedly calculating the irreversible passage of time. It was Saturday, December 21st. The deadline for his wager was Monday, December 23rd, at 8:45 PM in London. Every moment spent confined within these dreary walls added to the insurmountable barrier between him and his goal. He knew, with the cold, hard logic that governed his life, that he had failed. The fifty thousand pounds he had invested in the journey, the twenty thousand pound stake of the bet – all were effectively lost. The world had been circled, the incredible feat accomplished with remarkable precision and daring, only for fate, or perhaps the persistent mistake of a detective, to snatch victory away at the very threshold of home. The silence of the cell was heavy with the weight of defeat, a stark contrast to the frantic, exhilarating pace of the eighty days that had just passed. The ticking clock was now a relentless reminder of ruin, not of progress, counting down to a failure made certain by this unjust confinement."

INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion provides inconsistent or incorrect time calculations for the available hours, which do not match the original's details.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion sometimes repeats or reorders information about arrival times and available hours, disrupting the original's flow.\n- The emotional state attributed to Fogg is inaccurately described as \"overwhelmed\" and \"not impatient; not angry,\" which does not align with the more nuanced portrayal in the original.\n- The completion introduces invented speculation about the detective's thoughts, which is not present in the original passage.\n- The description of Fogg's actions in the room is less precise, omitting the specific order of him walking around, checking the door and window, and then sitting to write in his journal."

The eighty days had elapsed, and the twenty thousand pounds were lost. Phileas Fogg, the man of perfect regularity, had failed. He paid the boatmen who brought him up the Thames, gave Passepartout some money, and with Aouda, walked calmly towards his Savile Row house. The house now seemed sombre. Fogg entered, his face impassive, showing no sign of the disaster. Aouda, her heart heavy with concern, showed deep distress. Passepartout, utterly devastated by the ruin he felt responsible for, wept silently. The servants saw their master's defeat. The wager was lost. Phileas Fogg was utterly ruined, his fortune gone. They spent the day in quiet despair. Fogg remained in his study, contemplating his losses. Aouda stayed in her room. Passepartout wandered through the house. The routine collapsed. Dinner was silent and melancholy. The world was preparing to speak of Mr. Fogg's grand failure. Ruin seemed absolute. The date was December 21st, a Saturday. The wager had to be won before 8:45 PM that evening. Fogg believed it was Sunday, December 22nd. He thought he had missed it by a single day. But hope, improbable as it seemed, was waiting to be discovered, hidden within their journey, a subtle consequence of crossing the globe from west to east. Passepartout, that evening, reflecting on their arrival time, suddenly gasped. Sunday? No! It was Saturday! The day had been gained!"

Inside the hallowed parlour, the five gentlemen who had so confidently laid their wager against him watched the clock with a mixture of suspense and, now, certainty of victory. Sir Francis Cromarty, Andrew Stuart, John Sullivan, Samuel Fallentin, and Thomas Flanagan felt the tension, thick and suffocating. Fogg was not there. Despair settled like a shroud upon Passepartout, who stood nearby, eyes wide with anguish, while the gentle Mrs. Aouda watched the door with a fixed, hopeful gaze that slowly faded. Outside, Pall Mall was a sea of faces, a vast multitude drawn by the sheer audacity of the wager and the fame it had garnered. The minutes ticked by - one, two, three, four... Each click of the second hand sounded like a final nail in the coffin of the eccentric traveller's challenge. Five minutes past! It was undeniable. Phileas Fogg had lost. A collective sigh seemed to ripple through the room, mirrored by the murmurs outside. The wager was forfeit. The journey, a magnificent failure in its timing. Then, amidst the palpable disappointment, a sudden roar erupted from the street, a sound of astonishment and triumph. A cab, racing at breakneck speed, skidded to a halt outside the club. And from it, composed and unhurried, emerged Phileas Fogg!"

INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces an inaccurate detail regarding the time the express train left, specifying two different times rather than the elapsed time since departure, which differs from the original's approach.\n- There is a slight inaccuracy in the description of the clocks striking, as the completion uses a different phrasing for the time indicated by the clocks compared to the original.\n- The completion refers to \"the platform at the London terminus\" instead of the more general \"terminus,\" which is a minor but notable difference in location description.\n- The statement about being \"behind time five minutes\" is a slight deviation from the original's phrasing, which specifies the amount of time by which the wager was lost."

They had barely nine hours to reach London and meet the deadline at the Reform Club. Liverpool was five hours away by rail, but securing the earliest possible connection was paramount. As Mr. Fogg urgently consulted the time-table, a hand grasped his arm. Turning, he saw Detective Fix. Phileas Fogg was under arrest.\"You are Mr. Phileas Fogg?\" demanded Fix.\"I am.\"\"I arrest you in the Queen's name!\" Fix declared.Fogg remained perfectly calm. \"You are mistaken. I am here.\"\"No matter,\" Fix retorted. \"You are the bank robber, followed round the world.\"Aouda cried out, Passepartout moved to intervene, but Fogg raised a hand. The blow had fallen. The arrest, so unexpected at the final hour, meant the certain loss of his wager and the complete ruin of his magnificent journey. Beneath his composure lay profound despair."

They had come back into the tranquil silence of the London house from the noise and turmoil of continents and oceans. The incredible journey had ended, not with fanfare, but with a quiet entry through his own front door. The bet was not yet won, however. There remained the crucial fifteen minutes until a quarter past eight on Saturday evening, December 21st – the precise moment the wager stipulated. Phileas Fogg, having circumnavigated the globe in eighty days according to his initial plan, now sat in his study, calm as ever, but the tension in the air was palpable for his companions. The world outside was unaware of the extraordinary man who had just returned to their midst, having raced against time and geography. Within these walls, the final seconds ticked away, a silent countdown to either triumph or financial ruin. The quiet of Saville Row masked the extraordinary feat that had just concluded and the nail-biting climax that was rapidly approaching. The journey was over, but the wait for the official end of the eighty days had just begun."

It cannot be.\" \"What is the matter?\" asked Mr. Fogg. \"My master did not intend to leave without taking me?\" asked Passepartout. \"You will follow me,\" said Mr. Fogg, with his usual brevity. \"But I should have gone down on my knees to him!\" murmured Passepartout. \"That scoundrel, Fix, has ruined us! You know, sir, that it was he who kept us for a whole day at Dublin—a day lost, taken from our time! If you had arrested him on the spot, we should have been in London this morning!\" \"Yes,\" replied Mr. Fogg; \"but I did not choose to do so.\" \"But, sir, you should—\" \"Leave me alone,\" said Phileas Fogg. Passepartout left the room, and went to Aouda, to whom he delivered his master’s orders. He could not conceal his agitation, and told her all that had passed. Aouda was surprised at Fogg’s coolness, and Passepartout thought it wonderful. \"Madame,\" said he, \"he is a man of marble.\" And Passepartout sat down, sad and despairing, without the heart to do anything. He felt that he could not abandon his master at this crisis. He went and came in the hall, and went up to Mr. Fogg’s door and listened, but did not dare to enter. At half-past seven, Mr. Fogg came out, and asked if Madame was ready. Passepartout had had time to collect himself, and answered, in a firm voice, \"Yes, sir.\" \"Then, as you are ready, you can come.\" Passepartout did not understand him; but he followed his master, who opened the door, and they both went down. Aouda waited for them at the foot of the stairs, ready to go. Mr. Fogg asked her for her hand. \"Madame,\" said he, \"be so good as to follow me.\" Mr. Fogg took her hand, and they went out. Passepartout, dumfounded, stood on the door-step. He did not know what to think. He could not abandon his master, whom he still looked upon as the most honourable of men. He must know what he was going to do. He rushed back into the house, and went up to his room. He waited there for a quarter of an hour. He could not contain himself any longer. He must see Mr. Fogg, and know what was going on. He went down into the street, and looked about him. He saw his master and Aouda at the door of a registry office, not a hundred yards off. He knew that his master was going to marry Aouda.",

His master’s composure, his tranquil air, the perfect equanimity with which he gave his orders, the phlegm which nothing could disturb, surprised him more than all that had preceded. He felt inclined to rush out upon the platform, and proclaim that his master was ruined. He went back into the house, and sat down in his room, unable to do anything. He was more than ever tormented by remorse. He accused himself more bitterly than ever of being the cause of the disaster. Why had he not warned Mr. Fogg when he discovered Fix’s intentions? Why had he not told him that the detective was following him? Mr. Fogg would then have been on his guard, and the delay at Dublin, which had ruined everything, would have been avoided.

His friends no longer expected him there. As Phileas Fogg had not appeared in the saloon on the evening before (Saturday, the 21st of December, at a quarter before nine), he had lost his wager.

He shut himself up in his room, and busied himself putting his affairs in order. Passepartout continually ascended and descended the stairs. The hours were long for him. He listened at his master’s door, and looked through the keyhole, as if he had a perfect right so to do, and as if he feared that something terrible might happen at any moment. Sometimes he thought of Fix, but no longer in anger. Fix, like all the world, had been mistaken in Phileas Fogg, and had only done his duty in tracking and arresting him; while he, Passepartout. . . . This thought haunted him, and he never ceased cursing his miserable folly.\nFinding himself too wretched to remain alone, he knocked at Aouda’s door, went into her room, seated himself, without speaking, in a corner, and looked ruefully at the young woman.

He knew that no entreaties, no arguments, could induce him to change his mind. He could not even suggest to Aouda to appeal to him. Mr. Fogg was inaccessible. But he thought that Aouda might have some influence over him. “Madame,” said he, “perhaps you might be able to do something. Mr. Fogg is not very communicative; he has never, I believe, recognised the depth of your gratitude to him, or the strength of your affection.

Feeling that he could not bear his misery alone, he went to Aouda’s room, and sat down in a corner, watching her sadly. Aouda was still lost in thought.",

            "prefix-probing": "Passepartout left the room, and went to find Aouda, to whom he delivered his master’s message. The young woman listened with a mixture of surprise and gratitude. She had expected to be left behind, to somehow make her way alone in a world utterly strange to her, reliant only on the vague promises of a distant relative. Mr. Fogg’s proposal, while unexpected, was a lifeline. \"Mr. Fogg desires me to... to accompany him?\" she repeated, her voice soft, almost disbelieving. Passepartout, with his usual earnestness, confirmed it. \"Precisely, madame. To Europe. He says it would be unsafe for you here.\" He added, perhaps venturing slightly beyond his direct instructions, \"And Mr. Fogg is always right, madame. He is a man who decides quickly but never wrongly.\" Aouda's eyes, which had been fixed on him with a fragile hope, now filled slightly. \"How can I ever repay such... such generosity?\" she murmured. Passepartout waved a dismissive hand. \"Repay? Madame, Mr. Fogg does not act for repayment. He acts because it is the right thing to do. It is... well, it is Mr. Fogg.\" He pondered for a moment, reflecting on the sudden, immense responsibility his master had shouldered. Taking on a passenger, a lady, in the middle of such a breakneck journey! It was utterly characteristic of his eccentric employer, yet also utterly confounding to the orderly soul of the poor Frenchman. \"We must prepare you immediately, madame,\" Passepartout continued, snapping back to the present duty. \"Mr. Fogg waits for no one, not even for us. We have little time. What few belongings you possess, we must gather them. And perhaps... perhaps you should wear something less... less revealing, if you will pardon my suggestion. Europe is different from India.\" Aouda nodded, understanding. She had been dressed in the traditional Indian garments suitable for her life before, but now she was to travel across continents at bewildering speed. The change felt abrupt, immense. \"I have very little,\" she said quietly. \"Only these clothes, and a few small personal items.\" Passepartout’s brow furrowed slightly. \"Very well, madame. We will make do. Mr. Fogg provides for what is necessary.\" He thought of the strict itinerary, the ticking clock, the absolute precision with which every moment had been planned. Now, a new, unpredictable element had been introduced. It was exciting, in a terrifying sort of way, like adding a wild card to a perfectly calculated game of whist. But beneath the apprehension, there was also a flicker of satisfaction. It felt right that Aouda, saved from a terrible fate, should not be abandoned. Mr. Fogg’s decision, while inconvenient for the schedule, felt deeply human, a rare glimpse of something beyond mere punctuality and wagers in his master's character. Passepartout resolved to do his utmost to ensure Aouda’s comfort and safety, seeing it as his personal duty now, in addition to guarding the luggage and keeping track of the tickets. He imagined the conversations, the questions, the sheer strangeness of travelling with a lady from the East across Europe. It would certainly complicate things, but perhaps... perhaps it would also make the incredible journey a little less purely mechanical. He looked at Aouda, standing fragile and uncertain before him, and felt a surge of protective instinct. This was his new charge, in a way. \"Come, madame,\" he said, extending a hand in a gesture of hurried encouragement. \"We must not lose a single moment.\""

He had not betrayed the slightest agitation when he pronounced the words, “I am ruined,” but now that he was alone with Aouda, he seemed to feel more deeply his misfortune. Aouda seated herself upon a stool near him. She did not speak, but looked at him with that gentle look which is so full of womanly pity.

For example, it adds internal thoughts and emotional reactions for both characters that are not present in the original, such as Aouda's silent gratitude, her seating on a stool, and Fogg's supposed emotional response. There are also invented dialogues and exchanges, including extended discussions about sharing fate, future plans, and references to specific sums of money, which do not appear in the original passage.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits some key steps in the original sequence, such as the initial silent period before Fogg speaks, and the precise structure of the conversation where Fogg first asks for pardon and Aouda responds. The original's focus on Fogg's unchanged demeanor and the specific order of their exchanges is not fully preserved. Additionally, the completion does not include the original's emphasis on Fogg's impassivity and the brief, direct nature of their dialogue.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- There are inaccuracies in the sequence of events: the completion rearranges the order of who speaks first and what is said, and introduces new lines and topics not present in the original. It also misattributes certain actions and emotional responses, such as Fogg being visibly moved or Aouda expressing her feelings in ways not found in the source. The completion provides inaccurate details about their circumstances, such as invented references to specific monetary amounts and future living arrangements.

Phileas Fogg sat near her and took her hand. Aouda did not remove it; the hands of the beautiful Parsee remained in his, a silent acceptance of his presence and maybe more.  Mr. Fogg gazed at her attentively. Ruined, as he imagined himself to be, he was no longer the protector who had saved her life. Now, their roles were reversed; she had been the one to console him in his darkest hour.  “Aouda,” said Mr. Fogg, very calmly, “they say I am ruined.” Aouda made no reply. He continued, “That is true. My entire fortune is gone.” He paused, observing her closely, gauging the effect of his words. She did not withdraw her hand. Her gaze remained fixed on him, filled not with pity but with a profound, quiet affection.  “I could not,” he resumed, “condemn you to share my poverty. I have nothing left to offer you but my affection and a ruined name.” He felt a deep tenderness towards her, a feeling that perhaps for the first time transcended his methodical nature. He waited, the silence heavy with unspoken emotions, ready to accept whatever she might say, or do. Aouda's soft hand gently squeezed his."

Even without this fortune, which I fear is lost, you possess qualities far more valuable. A man who can navigate continents, outwit villains, and rescue those in peril, as you rescued me, cannot truly be poor. Your skills, your presence of mind, are assets no misfortune can entirely dissipate. I… I possess a little fortune, not vast, but sufficient for my needs and perhaps yours, should you deem it acceptable. It is entirely at your disposal. Do not speak of want as if it were an inevitable fate for Mr. Phileas Fogg. You have faced and overcome greater obstacles with apparent ease. This is merely another, albeit different. But you will confront it with the same composure, I am sure. And please know I am here. My gratitude is immense, bound forever by your actions. If my modest means can be of the slightest service, you have only to say the word. You have given me back my life; the least I can do is offer what comfort and security I might provide in return. Do not despair, Mr. Fogg. The world holds opportunities for a man of your calibre, regardless of temporary financial setbacks. Your journey, though it may not have ended as planned in terms of wealth, has revealed a strength and capability undeniable.”"

And would he appear on Saturday, the 21st of December, at a quarter before nine in the evening, on the threshold of the Reform Club saloon?\nThe anxiety in which, for three days, London society existed, cannot be described. Telegrams were sent to America and Asia for news of Phileas Fogg. Messengers were dispatched to the house in Saville Row morning and evening. No news. The police were ignorant what had become of the detective, Fix, who had so unfortunately followed up a false scent. Bets increased, nevertheless, in number and value. Phileas Fogg, like a racehorse, was drawing near his last turning-point. The bonds were quoted, no longer at a hundred below par, but at twenty, at ten, and at five; and paralytic old Lord Albemarle bet even in his favour.",

The wager, the seemingly impossible wager, occupied their minds incessantly. Messrs. Stuart, Fallentin, Sullivan, Flanagan, and Ralph could think of nothing else. They met daily at the Club, poring over maps and calculating distances with nervous frequency. Each conversation revolved around Fogg's journey, the delays he might have encountered, the vanishing possibility of his success. Doubt gnawed at them, presenting itself as certainty that Fogg was irrevocably delayed or had given up. Yet, a faint glimmer of hope would sometimes surface, fueled by the recollection of Fogg’s precise habits and unflappable nature. But hope was fragile against the crushing weight of logistics. As the deadline of December 21st drew nearer, the tension became almost unbearable. They huddled together, sharing anxieties. Newspapers offered no news, adding to their unease. They checked the clock constantly, each tick a hammer blow against their nerves. The appointed time, 8:45 PM on Saturday, loomed large, a moment of truth. It would either vindicate their friend's audacity or confirm the folly of his enterprise. The air was thick with anticipation, a mixture of dread and desperate hope."

We can, therefore, regard the bet as won.”\n“Stop a bit; don’t let us be too hasty,” replied Samuel Fallentin. “You know that Mr. Fogg is a most eccentric man; he is affecting, perhaps, an unprecedented exactitude; he will make his appearance at the last minute, and we shall see him come in at the very moment when the hands of the clock announce the expiration of the time.”\n“What an idea!” cried Andrew Stuart. “Do you think he would not have hastened if he had been on the spot? He knows that we are all waiting for him!”\n“We shall see,” replied Fallentin.\n“Besides,” said Thomas Flanagan, “his project was perfectly futile. The only rapid transit line from New York to Liverpool is the ocean steamer. How could he have crossed the Atlantic in time after having been delayed several days?”\n“He has lost, gentlemen,” said John Sullivan. “He has lost several times over. A steamer, the *China*, which arrived yesterday, was the only one he could have taken to get here in time. Now, the *China* arrived yesterday, and he was not on board. We have made inquiries, and his name was not on the list of passengers. If, in the first place, he missed the steamer from New York, he is necessarily twenty days behindhand; and, in the second, the bet is lost.”\n“It is clear,” replied Gauthier Ralph, “and we have nothing to do but cash Mr. Fogg’s cheque to-morrow at the Barings.”\n“Lord Albemarle will lose his five thousand pounds,” added Andrew Stuart.\nAt this moment, the hands of the club clock pointed to twenty minutes to nine.",

Flanagan and Sullivan, fellow bettors, were present, their faces reflecting the tension. Stuart, having spoken, began pacing nervously. He had been among the most doubtful regarding Phileas Fogg’s eighty-day journey. The odds against Fogg completing the impossible voyage seemed overwhelming, given the vast distances, reliance on schedules, and inevitable delays. Most in the Club, and indeed, the public, saw Fogg’s plan as an extravagant failure waiting to happen. Significant bets had been laid, the majority against the traveller. Other members nearby feigned interest in their papers, but their gazes repeatedly drifted to the clock on the wall. The remaining fifteen minutes stretched out, each passing second confirming Fogg's probable failure and their potential gain or loss. The twenty thousand pounds wagered was a substantial sum, creating an undercurrent of anxiety beneath the decorum. Sullivan fiddled with his collar, while Flanagan fixed his eyes on the clock face, as if willing the hands to stay put or move faster. The suspense was palpable. Every distant sound from Pall Mall sparked a moment of alert. A carriage wheel, a footstep – was it him? No, surely not yet. The calculation was exact: eighty days from October 2nd, 8:45 PM meant arrival by 8:45 PM on December 21st. Stuart consulted his own watch, comparing it to the club clock. Eight twenty-five. Ten minutes remained. The atmosphere was thick with anticipation, the balance of fortunes hanging in the balance. They waited, silent and tense, for the appointed time."

The five gentlemen who met daily at the Reform Club for whist were engaged in a lively discussion that had strayed far from the card table. The topic was the recent article in the *Daily Telegraph* detailing the completion of a new railway section in India, which theoretically made a circumnavigation of the globe possible in eighty days. John Sullivan, Samuel Fallentin, Thomas Flanagan, and Gauthier Ralph were all present, arguing the feasibility of such a journey, factoring in delays, accidents, and unforeseen obstacles. Phileas Fogg, typically silent and observant, sat by the fire, his placid face betraying no hint of the calculations likely running through his precise mind. Stuart's comment underscored the tension and disbelief in the room. The idea seemed utterly preposterous, a feat of imagination rather than practicality, given the vast distances and unreliable transport. They debated the routes, the speeds, the connections, each point highlighting the immense difficulty. Stuart tapped his foot, waiting for the game to resume, but the debate, fuelled by the seemingly impossible timetable presented by the newspaper, held them captive. The air was thick with scepticism, and little did they know, the quiet man by the fire was about to turn theory into the most audacious wager in history."

The explanation lay not in any oversight of itinerary or timing during the arduous circumnavigation, but in the very nature of traversing the globe eastward. Phileas Fogg, in his methodical calculation, had accounted for every hour and minute lost or gained at each point of the journey according to local time, adjusting his watch meticulously. Yet, in his absolute focus on meeting schedules and navigating distances, he had inadvertently neglected the grand temporal shift inherent in opposing the earth's rotation. By constantly travelling towards the rising sun, crossing each degree of longitude, he gained local time relative to his starting point. Over the course of their eighty-day journey across continents and oceans, these small gains accumulated imperceptibly. He had not lost a day, as he feared upon reaching London when the local date seemed to confirm his failure. Instead, he had gained one full day, relative to his calculations based purely on elapsed time at Greenwich. He had arrived, not on the supposed eighty-first day according to the Reform Club's calendar, but truly on the eightieth. This fundamental error, a consequence of the planet's spherical geometry and his eastward passage across the International Date Line's principle, was the crucial, blinding oversight for his otherwise infallible mind. It was this very oversight that saved him, allowing him to win his extraordinary wager by a single, unexpected day, arriving moments before the deadline."
