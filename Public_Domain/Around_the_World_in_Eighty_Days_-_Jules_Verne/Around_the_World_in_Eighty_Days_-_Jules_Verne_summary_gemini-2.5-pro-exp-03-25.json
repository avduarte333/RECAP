He was one of the most noticeable members of the Reform Club, though he seemed always to avoid attracting attention; an enigmatical personage, about whom little was known, except that he was a polished man of the world. People said that he resembled Byron—at least that his head was Byronic; but he was a bearded, tranquil Byron, who might live on a thousand years without growing old.\nCertainly an Englishman, it was more doubtful whether Phileas Fogg was a Londoner. He was never seen on ’Change, nor at the Bank, nor in the counting-rooms of the “City”; no ships ever came into London docks of which he was the owner; he had no public employment; he had never been entered at any of the Inns of Court, either at the Temple, or Lincoln’s Inn, or Gray’s Inn; nor had his voice ever resounded in the Court of Chancery, or in the Exchequer, or the Queen’s Bench, or the Ecclesiastical Courts. He certainly was not a manufacturer; nor was he a merchant or a gentleman farmer. His name was strange to the scientific and learned societies, and he never was known to take part in the sage deliberations of the Royal Institution or the London Institution, the Artisan’s Association, or the Institution of Arts and Sciences. He belonged, in fact, to none of the numerous societies which swarm in the English capital, from the Harmonic to that of the Entomologists, founded mainly for the purpose of abolishing pernicious insects.\nPhileas Fogg was a member of the Reform, and that was all.",

He was a conspicuous member of the Reform Club, yet he consistently seemed to steer clear of attracting attention. He was an enigmatic individual; little information about him was available beyond the fact that he was a refined man of the world. People often commented on his resemblance to Byron, at least regarding his head shape, but he was a calm, bearded version of Byron who appeared capable of living for a millennium without aging. It was certain he was English, but whether Phileas Fogg was a native Londoner was questionable. He was never seen frequenting places like the Stock Exchange ('Change), the Bank, or the counting-houses in the 'City'. No ships arriving at London docks were ever registered under his ownership. He held no public office, nor had he ever been admitted to practice law at any of the Inns of Court, such as the Temple, Lincoln's Inn, or Gray's Inn. His voice was never heard echoing in the Court of Chancery, the Exchequer, the Queen’s Bench, or the Ecclesiastical Courts. He was unequivocally not a manufacturer, nor was he a merchant or a country squire. His name was foreign to scientific and academic societies, and he was never known to take part in the thoughtful discussions held by organizations like the Royal Institution, the London Institution, the Artisan’s Association, or the Institution of Arts and Sciences. In reality, his only affiliation was with the Reform Club; he belonged to none of the numerous other societies that proliferate in the English capital, ranging from musical associations to those focused on eradicating harmful insects.",

He was a distinguished member of the Reform Club, standing out for his refined manners, yet he always avoided the spotlight and remained mysterious, known primarily as a cosmopolitan gentleman. People claimed he looked like Byron, at least in the shape of his head, though unlike the poet, Fogg sported a beard and a calm demeanor, seeming as though he could live forever without aging.\n\nWhile it was certain that Fogg was English, whether he was originally from London was less clear. He was never seen in the city’s financial districts, at the Bank, or among the business offices of the City, nor did he own any ships visiting the London docks. He held no public or legal posts, and his name did not appear among the members of any Inns of Court or legal institutions. He never participated in court proceedings, nor was he involved in manufacturing, commerce, or agriculture. He was not connected to any scientific or academic bodies, and never attended meetings of institutions like the Royal Institution or the Institution of Arts and Sciences. Fogg belonged to none of the many clubs and societies found throughout London, ranging from musical to entomological societies. In fact, the only organization he was associated with was the Reform Club."

His cheques were regularly paid at sight from his account current, which was always flush.\nWas Phileas Fogg rich? Undoubtedly. But those who knew him best could not imagine how he had made his fortune, and Mr. Fogg was the last person to whom to apply for the information. He was not lavish, nor, on the contrary, avaricious; for, whenever he knew that money was needed for a noble, useful, or benevolent purpose, he supplied it quietly and sometimes anonymously. He was, in short, the least communicative of men. He talked very little, and seemed all the more mysterious for his taciturn manner. His daily habits were quite open to observation; but whatever he did was so exactly the same thing that he had always done before, that the wits of the curious were fairly puzzled.\nHad he travelled? It was likely, for no one seemed to know the world more familiarly; there was no spot so secluded that he did not appear to have an intimate acquaintance with it. He often corrected, with a few clear words, the thousand conjectures advanced by members of the club as to lost and unheard-of travellers, pointing out the true probabilities, and seeming as if gifted with a sort of second sight, so often did events justify his predictions. He must have travelled everywhere, at least in the spirit.\nIt was at least certain that Phileas Fogg had not absented himself from London for many years. Those who were honoured by a better acquaintance with him than the rest, declared that nobody could pretend to have ever seen him anywhere else. His sole pastimes were reading the papers and playing whist. He often won at this game, which, as a silent one, harmonised with his nature; but his winnings never went into his purse, being reserved as a fund for his charities. Mr. Fogg played, not to win, but for the sake of playing. The game was in his eyes a contest, a struggle with a difficulty, yet a motionless, unwearying struggle, congenial to his tastes.",

He was sponsored by the Barings banking family, with whom he held a substantial line of credit. His financial transactions were always smooth, with checks paid instantly from his consistently healthy current account. Was Phileas Fogg a rich man? Certainly. Yet, even those who knew him best were baffled about the origin of his wealth, and inquiring directly from Mr. Fogg was futile. He was neither wasteful nor greedy; in fact, whenever he learned of a necessary and beneficial cause, whether noble or charitable, he would contribute discreetly, sometimes without revealing his identity. In short, he was a man of few words, his silence only deepening the mystery surrounding him. Although his daily routine was visible, its unchanging nature left onlookers utterly puzzled. Had he traveled the world? It seemed probable, given his profound understanding of various places; there seemed to be no remote location with which he wasn't intimately familiar. He frequently corrected the wild guesses made by other club members regarding missing explorers with a few precise remarks, indicating the likely truth, so often were his forecasts confirmed by events that he seemed to possess an almost predictive ability. He must have journeyed extensively, if only in his mind. It was, at least, confirmed that Phileas Fogg had not been absent from London for many years. Those who had a closer relationship with him affirmed that no one could honestly claim to have seen him elsewhere. His only hobbies were reading newspapers and playing the card game whist. He often won at whist, a silent game that perfectly matched his quiet nature, but his winnings were never kept by him; they were dedicated to his charitable contributions. Mr. Fogg played not to accumulate money, but for the game itself. He saw it as a mental challenge, a calm, persistent struggle against difficulty that suited his character.",

His accounts were always in good standing, and his cheques were promptly honored. There was no doubt that Fogg was a wealthy man, yet those closest to him were at a loss to explain the origins of his fortune, and Fogg himself was not one to reveal personal details. He was neither extravagant nor stingy; when he recognized a worthy or charitable cause, he would contribute quietly, often without revealing his identity. Fogg was extremely reserved, speaking little and thereby adding to the sense of mystery that surrounded him. His routines were visible to all, yet they were so consistent and unchanging that onlookers found themselves baffled by his predictability. \n\nIt seemed probable that he had traveled widely, as his knowledge of the world was extensive and he was familiar with even the most remote locations. He frequently corrected the speculations of club members about little-known explorers, offering accurate insights that time and again were proved correct, suggesting an almost uncanny awareness—if not direct experience, then at least a deep understanding—of global affairs. However, it was clear that Fogg had not left London in many years; those who knew him well claimed that no one had ever seen him outside the city. His main leisure activities were reading newspapers and playing whist, a silent card game that suited his quiet disposition. Although he often won, he set aside his winnings for charitable causes rather than personal use, valuing the challenge and strategy of the game over its monetary rewards. To him, whist was a stimulating, mentally engaging pursuit that aligned perfectly with his temperament."

He never used the cosy chambers which the Reform provides for its favoured members. He passed ten hours out of the twenty-four in Saville Row, either in sleeping or making his toilet. When he chose to take a walk it was with a regular step in the entrance hall with its mosaic flooring, or in the circular gallery with its dome supported by twenty red porphyry Ionic columns, and illumined by blue painted windows. When he breakfasted or dined all the resources of the club—its kitchens and pantries, its buttery and dairy—aided to crowd his table with their most succulent stores; he was served by the gravest waiters, in dress coats, and shoes with swan-skin soles, who proffered the viands in special porcelain, and on the finest linen; club decanters, of a lost mould, contained his sherry, his port, and his cinnamon-spiced claret; while his beverages were refreshingly cooled with ice, brought at great cost from the American lakes.\nIf to live in this style is to be eccentric, it must be confessed that there is something good in eccentricity.\nThe mansion in Saville Row, though not sumptuous, was exceedingly comfortable.

'Twenty-two minutes past eleven,' Passepartout answered, pulling a very large silver watch from his pocket. 'Your time is slow,' said Mr. Fogg. 'Excuse me, monsieur, that is impossible—' 'You are four minutes slow. It's not a major issue; simply note the discrepancy. Now, from this exact moment, twenty-nine minutes after eleven a.m., this Wednesday, October 2nd, you are employed by me.'",

James Forster, the servant who had just been dismissed, entered the room. \"The new servant, sir,\" he announced.\n\nA young man, around thirty years old, came forward and bowed. \"You are French, I think?\" Fogg asked, \"and your name is John?\"\n\n\"Jean, if you please, sir,\" the man replied. \"Jean Passepartout. I have kept this name because I am skilled at switching from one job to another. I consider myself honest, sir, but to be frank, I've tried several professions. I've been a traveling singer, a circus performer—leaping like Leotard and walking tightropes like Blondin. Afterwards, I became a gymnastics teacher to use my abilities more fully. I also worked as a fireman sergeant in Paris and took part in many large fires. But I left France five years ago and, wishing for a quieter domestic life, found work as a valet here in England. When I found myself out of employment, and heard that Mr. Phileas Fogg was the most precise and regular gentleman in the country, I decided to seek a peaceful life in his service, hoping even to forget my nickname of Passepartout.\"\n\n\"Passepartout suits me well,\" replied Mr. Fogg. \"I've received good references about you. Do you know my requirements?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Good. What is the time?\"\n\n\"Twenty-two minutes past eleven,\" Passepartout answered, pulling a large silver watch out of his pocket.\n\n\"You're running slow,\" said Mr. Fogg.\n\n\"Excuse me, sir, but that's impossible—\"\n\n\"You're four minutes behind. That's all right; it just needs to be noted. Starting from now—twenty-nine minutes past eleven, on Wednesday, October 2—you are officially in my service.\""

He appeared to be a man about forty years of age, with fine, handsome features, and a tall, well-shaped figure; his hair and whiskers were light, his forehead compact and unwrinkled, his face rather pale, his teeth magnificent. His countenance possessed in the highest degree what physiognomists call “repose in action,” a quality of those who act rather than talk. Calm and phlegmatic, with a clear eye, Mr. Fogg seemed a perfect type of that English composure which Angelica Kauffmann has so skilfully represented on canvas. Seen in the various phases of his daily life, he gave the idea of being perfectly well-balanced, as exactly regulated as a Leroy chronometer. Phileas Fogg was, indeed, exactitude personified, and this was betrayed even in the expression of his very hands and feet; for in men, as well as in animals, the limbs themselves are expressive of the passions.\nHe was so exact that he was never in a hurry, was always ready, and was economical alike of his steps and his motions. He never took one step too many, and always went to his destination by the shortest cut; he made no superfluous gestures, and was never seen to be moved or agitated. He was the most deliberate person in the world, yet always reached his destination at the exact moment.",

It is noted that Madame Tussaud’s figures are made of wax and are a popular London attraction, lacking only speech to appear fully human. During their brief meeting, Passepartout had carefully observed Mr. Fogg, describing him as a man around forty with attractive, refined features and a tall, well-proportioned physique. His hair and beard were light-colored, his forehead smooth and unlined, his face somewhat pale, and his teeth outstanding. His demeanor perfectly embodied what experts call \"repose in action,\" a characteristic of those who prefer doing over talking. Calm and unruffled, with a clear gaze, Mr. Fogg seemed the perfect embodiment of English self-control, much like the figures Angelica Kauffmann depicted skillfully in her paintings. Witnessing his daily routine suggested he was perfectly balanced and as precisely regulated as a fine chronometer. Indeed, Phileas Fogg was the very essence of punctuality, a trait evident even in the way he used his hands and feet, as both human and animal limbs can express emotions and character. His extreme precision meant he was never rushed, always prepared, and economical with his movements. He never took unnecessary steps, always choosing the most direct route, avoided needless gestures, and was never observed to be agitated or flustered. He was the most deliberate person imaginable, yet invariably arrived exactly on time.",

Throughout his short meeting with Mr. Fogg, Passepartout had scrutinized him closely. Mr. Fogg looked to be around forty, with distinguished, attractive features and a tall, well-built stature; his hair and whiskers were fair, his forehead smooth and unlined, his complexion pale, and his teeth impressive. His face displayed a quality that physiognomists call “repose in action”—the trait of those who act more than they speak. Unflappable and calm, with a clear gaze, Mr. Fogg embodied the classic English composure that Angelica Kauffmann famously depicted in her paintings. In all aspects of his daily routine, he seemed perfectly balanced and precise, as meticulously organized as a Leroy chronometer. In fact, Phileas Fogg was the living model of punctuality and exactitude, which was evident even in how he held his hands and feet—since, for both humans and animals, body language can reveal emotions. Mr. Fogg’s precision meant he was never rushed, always prepared, and sparing in his movements. He wasted no steps, always chose the most direct route, and avoided unnecessary gestures, never seen to be flustered or agitated.

          "text_segment": "He lived alone, and, so to speak, outside of every social relation; and as he knew that in this world account must be taken of friction, and that friction retards, he never rubbed against anybody.\nAs for Passepartout, he was a true Parisian of Paris. Since he had abandoned his own country for England, taking service as a valet, he had in vain searched for a master after his own heart. Passepartout was by no means one of those pert dunces depicted by Molière with a bold gaze and a nose held high in the air; he was an honest fellow, with a pleasant face, lips a trifle protruding, soft-mannered and serviceable, with a good round head, such as one likes to see on the shoulders of a friend. His eyes were blue, his complexion rubicund, his figure almost portly and well-built, his body muscular, and his physical powers fully developed by the exercises of his younger days. His brown hair was somewhat tumbled; for, while the ancient sculptors are said to have known eighteen methods of arranging Minerva’s tresses, Passepartout was familiar with but one of dressing his own: three strokes of a large-tooth comb completed his toilet.\nIt would be rash to predict how Passepartout’s lively nature would agree with Mr. Fogg. It was impossible to tell whether the new servant would turn out as absolutely methodical as his master required; experience alone could solve the question. Passepartout had been a sort of vagrant in his early years, and now yearned for repose; but so far he had failed to find it, though he had already served in ten English houses. But he could not take root in any of these; with chagrin, he found his masters invariably whimsical and irregular, constantly running about the country, or on the look-out for adventure. His last master, young Lord Longferry, Member of Parliament, after passing his nights in the Haymarket taverns, was too often brought home in the morning on policemen’s shoulders. Passepartout, desirous of respecting the gentleman whom he served, ventured a mild remonstrance on such conduct; which, being ill-received, he took his leave. Hearing that Mr. Phileas Fogg was looking for a servant, and that his life was one of unbroken regularity, that he neither travelled nor stayed from home overnight, he felt sure that this would be the place he was after. He presented himself, and was accepted, as has been seen.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "He lived a solitary life, largely separate from social circles. Recognizing that interaction leads to complications and slows things down, he avoided contact with others. Meanwhile, Passepartout was a quintessential Parisian. After leaving France for England to work as a valet, he had been unsuccessful in finding an employer he truly admired. Passepartout was not the type of impudent, arrogant servant often depicted in plays; instead, he was an honest man with a kind face, slightly full lips, gentle manners, and a helpful nature. He possessed a pleasingly round head, blue eyes, a rosy complexion, and a sturdy, well-built physique that was muscular and strong from the physical activities of his youth. His brown hair was somewhat disheveled; while sculptors supposedly had many methods for arranging Minerva's hair, Passepartout used only one technique: three strokes of a wide-toothed comb finished his grooming. It was uncertain how Passepartout's lively spirit would fit with Mr. Fogg's rigid routine. Whether the new servant could be as precisely methodical as his master required was a question only time would answer. Having been somewhat restless in his earlier years, Passepartout now longed for a settled life, but he hadn't found it despite working in ten English households. He couldn't stay long in any of them, as he was frustrated to find his masters consistently unpredictable and disorderly, always traveling or seeking adventures. His previous employer, young Lord Longferry, a Member of Parliament, frequently spent nights in taverns and was often brought home by the police in the morning. Wishing to maintain respect for his employer, Passepartout gently protested this behavior, but his complaint was poorly received, leading him to resign. Upon hearing that Mr. Phileas Fogg needed a servant and led an exceptionally regular life, never traveling or staying away overnight, Passepartout became convinced this was the position he sought. He applied and was hired, as has been mentioned.",

Passepartout, on the other hand, was a quintessential Parisian by nature. Since moving from France to England to work as a valet, he had yet to find an employer who truly suited him. He was not one of those cheeky servants portrayed by Molière, but rather an honest and friendly man, with slightly protruding lips, gentle manners, and a good, solid head—just the kind one admires in a friend. He had blue eyes, rosy cheeks, a sturdy and well-built frame, and his muscles had been well developed during an active youth. His brown hair was always a little messy, as he relied on just a few quick combs instead of mastering elaborate styles. No one could say for sure how well Passepartout’s spirited personality would mesh with Mr. Fogg’s highly disciplined ways; only time would tell if he could meet his master’s strict expectations. Having led a somewhat restless early life, Passepartout now longed for a stable position, but despite working in ten different English households, he had not found one where he could really settle. He was disappointed to discover that his previous employers were unpredictable and always seeking new adventures. His last employer, a young lord and member of Parliament, often spent his nights in London taverns and frequently needed to be brought home by the police. Passepartout, wanting to be able to respect the person he worked for, gently objected to such behavior, and when his advice was unwelcome, he resigned. Upon learning that Mr. Phileas Fogg was looking for a servant and led an extremely regular and predictable life, Passepartout felt this was the job he wanted.

A moderate-sized safe stood in his bedroom, constructed so as to defy fire as well as burglars; but Passepartout found neither arms nor hunting weapons anywhere; everything betrayed the most tranquil and peaceable habits.\nHaving scrutinised the house from top to bottom, he rubbed his hands, a broad smile overspread his features, and he said joyfully, “This is just what I wanted!",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Mr. Fogg's closet contained a generous supply of clothing, all chosen with excellent taste. Each item of apparel, including his pants, coats, and vests, as well as his shoes, was marked with a number corresponding to the designated time of year and season for it to be worn. This system of organization was also applied to his footwear. Essentially, the residence on Saville Row, which must have been a scene of great disarray and commotion during the time of the celebrated but extravagant Sheridan, was now the epitome of comfort, neatness, and structured living. There was no study area or books, as these would have served no purpose for Mr. Fogg, who had the use of two libraries, one for general literature and another for legal and political texts, at the Reform Club. A moderate-sized safe, constructed to be impervious to both fire and theft, stood in his bedroom. However, Passepartout found no firearms or hunting equipment anywhere; everything suggested the most tranquil and peaceable way of life. Having thoroughly inspected the entire house, he rubbed his hands together, a wide grin spreading over his face, and joyfully stated, \"This is precisely what I wanted!\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Mr. Fogg’s clothing collection was generous and displayed impeccable style. Each item of clothing—whether trousers, coat, or vest—carried a label indicating the appropriate season and time of year for its use; this method was also employed for his shoes. Essentially, the home on Saville Row, once chaotic and lively during Sheridan’s infamous tenure, now exemplified comfort, order, and perfection. There was no office or library in the house, as books would have been of no use to Mr. Fogg; he had access to two excellent libraries—one for general works and one specializing in law and politics—at the Reform Club. In his bedroom stood a medium-sized safe, built to withstand both fire and theft; however, Passepartout found no weapons or hunting implements anywhere, indicating that Mr. Fogg lived an exceptionally calm and peace-loving life. After thoroughly inspecting every part of the house, Passepartout rubbed his hands together, his face lit up with a wide smile, and he exclaimed happily, “This is exactly what I was looking for!”"

His breakfast consisted of a side-dish, a broiled fish with Reading sauce, a scarlet slice of roast beef garnished with mushrooms, a rhubarb and gooseberry tart, and a morsel of Cheshire cheese, the whole being washed down with several cups of tea, for which the Reform is famous. He rose at thirteen minutes to one, and directed his steps towards the large hall, a sumptuous apartment adorned with lavishly-framed paintings.

He finished his breakfast at thirteen minutes before one o'clock and proceeded towards the large hall, a lavish space decorated with grand paintings in ornate frames. An attendant provided him with a copy of The Times, which was still uncut. He skillfully cut the pages, a task he was evidently familiar with.

Upon arrival, he went straight to the dining-room, with its nine windows overlooking a beautifully landscaped autumn garden, and sat at his usual table, already set for him.

          "text_segment": "“Well, Ralph,” said Thomas Flanagan, “what about that robbery?”\n“Oh,” replied Stuart, “the Bank will lose the money.”\n“On the contrary,” broke in Ralph, “I hope we may put our hands on the robber. Skilful detectives have been sent to all the principal ports of America and the Continent, and he’ll be a clever fellow if he slips through their fingers.”\n“But have you got the robber’s description?” asked Stuart.\n“In the first place, he is no robber at all,” returned Ralph, positively.\n“What! a fellow who makes off with fifty-five thousand pounds, no robber?”\n“No.”\n“Perhaps he’s a manufacturer, then.”\n“The Daily Telegraph says that he is a gentleman.”\nIt was Phileas Fogg, whose head now emerged from behind his newspapers, who made this remark. He bowed to his friends, and entered into the conversation. The affair which formed its subject, and which was town talk, had occurred three days before at the Bank of England. A package of banknotes, to the value of fifty-five thousand pounds, had been taken from the principal cashier’s table, that functionary being at the moment engaged in registering the receipt of three shillings and sixpence. Of course, he could not have his eyes everywhere. Let it be observed that the Bank of England reposes a touching confidence in the honesty of the public. There are neither guards nor gratings to protect its treasures; gold, silver, banknotes are freely exposed, at the mercy of the first comer. A keen observer of English customs relates that, being in one of the rooms of the Bank one day, he had the curiosity to examine a gold ingot weighing some seven or eight pounds. He took it up, scrutinised it, passed it to his neighbour, he to the next man, and so on until the ingot, going from hand to hand, was transferred to the end of a dark entry; nor did it return to its place for half an hour. Meanwhile, the cashier had not so much as raised his head. But in the present instance things had not gone so smoothly. The package of notes not being found when five o’clock sounded from the ponderous clock in the “drawing office,” the amount was passed to the account of profit and loss. As soon as the robbery was discovered, picked detectives hastened off to Liverpool, Glasgow, Havre, Suez, Brindisi, New York, and other ports, inspired by the proffered reward of two thousand pounds, and five per cent. on the sum that might be recovered. Detectives were also charged with narrowly watching those who arrived at or left London by rail, and a judicial examination was at once entered upon.\nThere were real grounds for supposing, as the Daily Telegraph said, that the thief did not belong to a professional band. On the day of the robbery a well-dressed gentleman of polished manners, and with a well-to-do air, had been observed going to and fro in the paying room where the crime was committed. A description of him was easily procured and sent to the detectives; and some hopeful spirits, of whom Ralph was one, did not despair of his apprehension. The papers and clubs were full of the affair, and everywhere people were discussing the probabilities of a successful pursuit; and the Reform Club was especially agitated, several of its members being Bank officials.\nRalph would not concede that the work of the detectives was likely to be in vain, for he thought that the prize offered would greatly stimulate their zeal and activity.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The conversation among the members at the Reform Club turned to the recent Bank of England robbery. Thomas Flanagan asked Ralph about it, to which Stuart responded pessimistically that the Bank would likely lose the money. Ralph, however, was more hopeful, believing they could catch the thief. He mentioned that skilled detectives had been dispatched to all the major ports in America and Europe, suggesting the culprit would be hard-pressed to evade them. Stuart then asked if they had a description of the robber. Ralph countered emphatically that the person wasn't a robber at all. Stuart expressed disbelief that someone who stole fifty-five thousand pounds wasn't a robber, jokingly suggesting they might be a manufacturer instead. Phileas Fogg, who had been reading his newspaper, interjected, confirming from the Daily Telegraph that the individual was, in fact, a gentleman. He then joined the discussion, explaining that the widely-talked-about event had taken place three days prior at the Bank of England. A bundle containing fifty-five thousand pounds in banknotes was taken from the chief cashier's desk while he was busy processing a small transaction. Fogg highlighted the Bank of England's remarkable trust in the public's honesty, noting the absence of guards or barriers to protect its wealth, with gold, silver, and notes freely displayed. He recounted an example where a gold ingot was passed among visitors for half an hour without detection, illustrating the lax security. However, in this instance, things hadn't gone so smoothly. When the packet of notes was found missing at five o'clock, the amount was recorded as a loss. As soon as the theft was discovered, top detectives were quickly sent to various ports, including Liverpool, Glasgow, Havre, Suez, Brindisi, and New York, motivated by a reward of two thousand pounds plus five per cent of the recovered amount. Detectives were also tasked with closely watching people arriving at or leaving London by train, and a formal investigation commenced immediately. As the Daily Telegraph suggested, there were valid reasons to believe the thief was not part of a professional criminal group. On the day of the robbery, a well-dressed gentleman with refined manners and an affluent appearance had been observed frequently in the paying room where the crime occurred. A description of this person was easily obtained and sent to the detectives, leading some optimistic individuals, including Ralph, to believe his capture was possible. The incident dominated newspapers and clubs, with widespread discussion about the likelihood of a successful pursuit; the Reform Club was particularly agitated, as several of its members were Bank officials. Ralph remained confident in the detectives' efforts, believing the reward offered would significantly enhance their dedication and efficiency.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"Well, Ralph,\" said Thomas Flanagan, \"what do you think about the robbery?\" \n\n\"Oh,\" Stuart responded, \"the Bank will just lose the money.\"\n\nRalph disagreed, saying, \"Actually, I hope we can catch the thief. Skilled detectives have been sent to all major ports in America and Europe, so it would take an exceptionally clever person to avoid them.\"\n\nStuart asked, \"But do you at least have a description of the thief?\"\n\nRalph replied, \"First, let me say, he isn't a thief at all.\"\n\n\"What! A person who runs off with fifty-five thousand pounds, and he isn't a thief?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Maybe he's a factory owner,\" Stuart said sarcastically.\n\n\"The Daily Telegraph claims he's a gentleman.\"\n\nAt this point, Phileas Fogg looked up from his newspaper, greeted his friends, and joined the conversation. The subject, which everyone in town was talking about, was a bank robbery that had happened three days earlier at the Bank of England. Someone had taken a packet of banknotes worth fifty-five thousand pounds from the chief cashier's desk, while the cashier was busy recording a small payment. The bank was known for trusting the public; its treasures were not heavily guarded—gold, silver, and notes were in open view for anyone to access. An observer once reported handling a gold bar, passing it among acquaintances, and it didn't return to its place for half an hour, all while the cashier seemed unconcerned. In this case, however, the missing money wasn't discovered until five o'clock when the day ended, so the lost sum was simply recorded as a loss. When the robbery came to light, specialized detectives were quickly sent to major ports like Liverpool, Glasgow, Havre, Suez, Brindisi, New York, and others, motivated by a reward of two thousand pounds and five percent of any recovered amount. Surveillance at train stations was also increased, and a formal investigation began immediately.\n\nThere was good reason to believe, as reported by the Daily Telegraph, that the thief wasn't a professional criminal. On the day in question, a well-dressed, polite gentleman was seen coming and going in the payment room where the robbery took place. His description was easily obtained and shared with the authorities, and optimistic people like Ralph remained hopeful about his capture. The incident was widely discussed in newspapers, clubs, and especially at the Reform Club, where several bankers were members and the story had stirred up considerable interest.\n\nRalph remained confident in the detectives, believing the reward money would inspire them to work harder to solve the case."

Has the world grown smaller?”\n“Certainly,” returned Ralph. “I agree with Mr. Fogg. The world has grown smaller, since a man can now go round it ten times more quickly than a hundred years ago. And that is why the search for this thief will be more likely to succeed.”\n“And also why the thief can get away more easily.”\n“Be so good as to play, Mr. Stuart,” said Phileas Fogg.\nBut the incredulous Stuart was not convinced, and when the hand was finished, said eagerly: “You have a strange way, Ralph, of proving that the world has grown smaller. So, because you can go round it in three months—”\n“In eighty days,” interrupted Phileas Fogg.\n“That is true, gentlemen,” added John Sullivan. “Only eighty days, now that the section between Rothal and Allahabad, on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, has been opened.

Stuart questioned Ralph, asking what he meant by the world being 'once' a certain size and if it had literally become smaller. Ralph affirmed his agreement with Mr. Fogg, stating the world has indeed become smaller because people can now travel around it ten times faster than they could a century prior, suggesting this increased speed makes it more likely to apprehend the thief. Stuart countered that this same speed also facilitates the thief's escape. Phileas Fogg then politely directed Mr. Stuart to make his move in the game. However, the skeptical Stuart remained unconvinced and, once the hand was finished, quickly resumed the discussion, telling Ralph that proving the world had shrunk simply because it could be traversed in three months seemed illogical. Phileas Fogg interrupted, correcting the time to eighty days. John Sullivan confirmed this, adding, \"That's correct, gentlemen. Just eighty days now, thanks to the opening of the railway segment between Rothal and Allahabad on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway.\" Sullivan then presented the estimated travel time breakdown published by the Daily Telegraph: London to Suez via Mont Cenis and Brindisi (rail and steamboats) in 7 days; Suez to Bombay (steamer) in 13 days; Bombay to Calcutta (rail) in 3 days; Calcutta to Hong Kong (steamer) in 13 days; Hong Kong to Yokohama (steamer) in 6 days; Yokohama to San Francisco (steamer) in 22 days; San Francisco to New York (rail) in 7 days; and New York to London (steamer and rail) in 9 days.

Ralph replied that he agreed with Mr. Fogg, saying the world had indeed grown smaller because people could now travel around it ten times faster than a century ago. This, he argued, made it easier both to catch a thief and for a thief to escape. Phileas Fogg urged Stuart to play, but Stuart remained doubtful. As soon as the round ended, he questioned Ralph, suggesting that just because a person could travel the globe in three months wasn't proof the world was smaller. Fogg quickly corrected him, stating, 'In eighty days.' John Sullivan agreed, adding that with a new railway line between Rothal and Allahabad, the journey could be completed in eighty days. He then cited an itinerary reportedly published by the Daily Telegraph, outlining each leg of the trip: London to Suez in 7 days; Suez to Bombay in 13 days; Bombay to Calcutta in 3 days; Calcutta to Hong Kong in 13 days; Hong Kong to Yokohama in 6 days; Yokohama to San Francisco in 22 days; San Francisco to New York in 7 days; and finally, New York to London in 9 days—totaling 80 days altogether."

Passepartout, who had carefully memorized his schedule of responsibilities, was astonished to see his employer showing such unusual disregard for punctuality, since he was not expected at Saville Row until midnight. Mr. Fogg went to his bedroom and called for Passepartout. At first, Passepartout didn’t answer; he was sure he wasn’t being summoned since it wasn’t yet the expected time. When Mr. Fogg called again, still calmly, Passepartout finally arrived. \"I had to call you twice,\" Fogg noted. Passepartout pointed out, looking at his watch, that it wasn't yet midnight. Fogg replied that he understood and didn't blame him, but announced that they would be leaving for Dover and Calais in ten minutes. Passepartout’s face showed his confusion—he clearly hadn't yet processed what his master meant. \"Are you leaving home, sir?\" Passepartout asked. \"Yes,\" Phileas Fogg replied. \"We are going around the world.\" Passepartout was so shocked that he almost collapsed, eyes wide in amazement. \"Around the world!\" he exclaimed. \"In eighty days,\" said Mr. Fogg. \"We must not waste a moment.\""

Passepartout, who hadn’t been back to France in five years, actually liked the idea of returning to his homeland. Maybe they’d even get to Paris, and it would do him good to see it again.

A miraculous agreement of the times of departure and arrival, which was impossible, was absolutely necessary to his success. He might, perhaps, reckon on the arrival of trains at the designated hours, in Europe, where the distances were relatively moderate; but when he calculated upon crossing India in three days, and the United States in seven, could he rely beyond misgiving upon accomplishing his task? There were accidents to machinery, the liability of trains to run off the line, collisions, bad weather, the blocking up by snow—were not all these against Phileas Fogg? Would he not find himself, when travelling by steamer in winter, at the mercy of the winds and fogs? Is it uncommon for the best ocean steamers to be two or three days behind time? But a single delay would suffice to fatally break the chain of communication; should Phileas Fogg once miss, even by an hour; a steamer, he would have to wait for the next, and that would irrevocably render his attempt vain.\nThis article made a great deal of noise, and, being copied into all the papers, seriously depressed the advocates of the rash tourist.",

This piece examined the undertaking from all angles and concluded that the venture was completely irrational and doomed to fail. It argued that the travelers faced overwhelming challenges from both human and natural sources. The author stated that for success, an improbable perfect alignment of departure and arrival times was essential. While consistent train schedules might be expected in Europe due to shorter distances, the article questioned whether one could truly depend on crossing India in just three days or the United States in seven without significant doubt. It listed potential issues such as mechanical failures, train derailments, collisions, severe weather, and snow blockages as hindrances for Phileas Fogg. The text also raised concerns about steamship travel during winter, highlighting the risk of being delayed by storms and fog, and noted that even the most reliable ocean liners were frequently several days late. Crucially, it pointed out that even one minor delay, missing a connecting steamer by as little as an hour, would force Phileas Fogg to wait for the subsequent vessel, inevitably dooming his effort. This article gained widespread attention, being reproduced in numerous newspapers, and significantly dampened the spirits of those who supported the audacious traveler.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Finally, on October 7th, a lengthy article was published in the Royal Geographical Society's bulletin thoroughly analyzing the matter and concluding that the undertaking was utterly foolish. The article argued that every possible obstacle, both human and natural, stood in the travelers' way. To succeed, they would require a truly miraculous and impossible timing of all departures and arrivals. While it was conceivable that trains in Europe might reach their destinations on schedule due to shorter distances, expecting to cross all of India in three days or the United States in seven without incident seemed highly unrealistic. The article pointed out the risks of mechanical problems, train derailments, collisions, severe weather, and snow blockages, all of which could foil the attempt. Furthermore, traveling by steamer in winter would expose them to unpredictable winds and fogs, and even the best ships are sometimes delayed by days. Just one missed connection, as small as an hour late for a steamer, would mean waiting for the next one and would make the entire effort a failure. The article generated much attention, and as it was reprinted widely, it greatly discouraged the supporters of the daring traveler."

Not only members of the Reform Club, but the general public, placed large bets both for and against Phileas Fogg, whose name was listed in betting registers as if he were a competitor in a horse race. Special bonds were issued, appearing on the stock exchange; these 'Phileas Fogg bonds' were initially offered at face value or higher, and significant trading occurred. However, five days after the Geographical Society's bulletin article came out, interest started to fade: the value of 'Phileas Fogg' declined. These bonds were offered in increasing lots, starting with five, then ten, until eventually no one would buy fewer than twenty, fifty, or even a hundred at a time. The only remaining supporter of Phileas Fogg was Lord Albemarle, an elderly gentleman afflicted by paralysis. This noble lord, confined to his chair, would have gladly given his wealth to undertake the world tour himself, even if it took a decade; he wagered five thousand pounds on Phileas Fogg. When confronted with arguments about the journey's foolishness and pointlessness, he simply responded, 'If such a feat is possible, the first person to achieve it should unquestionably be an Englishman.' Fogg's small group of backers shrank constantly; the consensus turned against him, and the odds became highly unfavorable at one hundred and fifty or two hundred to one. Furthermore, a week after his departure, an event took place that ensured he would find no one willing to bet on him at any price.",

When Phileas Fogg made his attempt, people from the Reform Club and the general public alike placed large bets for and against him, treating his journey almost like a horse race by recording bets in books. Special “Phileas Fogg bonds” were created, traded, and even sold at profits on the stock exchange. However, just five days after news of his journey was published by the Geographical Society, enthusiasm faded and interest in backing Fogg dropped sharply—the bonds lost value and were grouped in larger and larger lots as demand dried up. Soon, only Lord Albemarle—a frail, elderly man bound to his chair—still believed in Fogg. Lord Albemarle, who passionately wished he could undertake such a journey himself, bet five thousand pounds on Fogg’s success. When others told him that the attempt was foolish and pointless, he simply answered that if the journey was possible, then an Englishman should be the first to accomplish it. As time passed, support for Fogg grew even weaker, the odds against him skyrocketed to as much as two hundred to one, and a week after he left, an event occurred that completely eliminated any remaining support for his cause."

The “Mongolia” plied regularly between Brindisi and Bombay viâ the Suez Canal, and was one of the fastest steamers belonging to the company, always making more than ten knots an hour between Brindisi and Suez, and nine and a half between Suez and Bombay.\nTwo men were promenading up and down the wharves, among the crowd of natives and strangers who were sojourning at this once straggling village—now, thanks to the enterprise of M. Lesseps, a fast-growing town. One was the British consul at Suez, who, despite the prophecies of the English Government, and the unfavourable predictions of Stephenson, was in the habit of seeing, from his office window, English ships daily passing to and fro on the great canal, by which the old roundabout route from England to India by the Cape of Good Hope was abridged by at least a half. The other was a small, slight-built personage, with a nervous, intelligent face, and bright eyes peering out from under eyebrows which he was incessantly twitching. He was just now manifesting unmistakable signs of impatience, nervously pacing up and down, and unable to stand still for a moment. This was Fix, one of the detectives who had been dispatched from England in search of the bank robber; it was his task to narrowly watch every passenger who arrived at Suez, and to follow up all who seemed to be suspicious characters, or bore a resemblance to the description of the criminal, which he had received two days before from the police headquarters at London. The detective was evidently inspired by the hope of obtaining the splendid reward which would be the prize of success, and awaited with a feverish impatience, easy to understand, the arrival of the steamer “Mongolia.”\n“So you say, consul,” asked he for the twentieth time, “that this steamer is never behind time?”\n“No, Mr. Fix,” replied the consul. “She was bespoken yesterday at Port Said, and the rest of the way is of no account to such a craft. I repeat that the ‘Mongolia’ has been in advance of the time required by the company’s regulations, and gained the prize awarded for excess of speed.”\n“Does she come directly from Brindisi?”\n“Directly from Brindisi; she takes on the Indian mails there, and she left there Saturday at five p.m. Have patience, Mr. Fix; she will not be late. But really, I don’t see how, from the description you have, you will be able to recognise your man, even if he is on board the ‘Mongolia.’”\n“A man rather feels the presence of these fellows, consul, than recognises them. You must have a scent for them, and a scent is like a sixth sense which combines hearing, seeing, and smelling. I’ve arrested more than one of these gentlemen in my time, and, if my thief is on board, I’ll answer for it; he’ll not slip through my fingers.”\n“I hope so, Mr. Fix, for it was a heavy robbery.”\n“A magnificent robbery, consul; fifty-five thousand pounds! We don’t often have such windfalls. Burglars are getting to be so contemptible nowadays! A fellow gets hung for a handful of shillings!”\n“Mr. Fix,” said the consul, “I like your way of talking, and hope you’ll succeed; but I fear you will find it far from easy. Don’t you see, the description which you have there has a singular resemblance to an honest man?”\n“Consul,” remarked the detective, dogmatically, “great robbers always resemble honest folks. Fellows who have rascally faces have only one course to take, and that is to remain honest; otherwise they would be arrested off-hand. The artistic thing is, to unmask honest countenances; it’s no light task, I admit, but a real art.”\nMr. Fix evidently was not wanting in a tinge of self-conceit.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The circumstances surrounding the sending of the telegram concerning Phileas Fogg were as follows: The iron steamship “Mongolia” of the Peninsular and Oriental Company, measuring 2800 tons and powered by 500 horsepower engines, was scheduled to arrive in Suez at eleven o’clock in the morning on Wednesday, October 9th. The “Mongolia” was one of the company's fastest vessels, consistently sailing between Brindisi and Bombay through the Suez Canal, regularly exceeding ten knots between Brindisi and Suez and achieving nine and a half knots between Suez and Bombay. Two men were observed walking on the docks among the many local people and visitors staying in what was once a spread-out village, but had become a rapidly developing town thanks to the efforts of M. Lesseps. One man was the British consul stationed in Suez, who, contrary to the doubts of the English Government and the negative forecasts of Stephenson, frequently saw English ships navigating the major canal from his office window, a route that significantly reduced the lengthy journey from England to India via the Cape of Good Hope by at least half. The other individual was a small, slightly built person with a nervous but intelligent face and bright eyes that darted from beneath his constantly twitching eyebrows. At that moment, he showed clear signs of impatience, restlessly moving back and forth, unable to remain still. This was Fix, one of the detectives sent from England to apprehend the bank robber. His duty was to closely monitor every passenger arriving in Suez and track anyone who seemed suspicious or matched the criminal's description, which he had received from police headquarters in London two days prior. The detective was clearly motivated by the prospect of earning a substantial reward for his success and waited with an intense, understandable eagerness for the “Mongolia” steamer to arrive. “So, you’re saying, consul,” he asked for what felt like the twentieth time, “that this steamer is always on time?” “Yes, Mr. Fix,” the consul responded. “She was expected yesterday at Port Said, and the remaining distance is nothing for a ship like her. As I mentioned, the ‘Mongolia’ has consistently beaten the company’s scheduled times and even earned a prize for her speed.” “Is she coming directly from Brindisi?” “Straight from Brindisi. She takes on the Indian mail there and departed on Saturday at five p.m. Be patient, Mr. Fix; she won't be late. But honestly, with that description you have, I really don’t see how you'll be able to identify your man, even if he is on board the ‘Mongolia.’” “Consul, you sense the presence of such people rather than just recognising them. You need an instinct for them, an instinct that’s like a sixth sense combining hearing, seeing, and smelling. I’ve apprehended several of these individuals in my career, and if my thief is aboard, I assure you; he won’t escape my grasp.” “I hope so, Mr. Fix, because it was a substantial theft.” “A magnificent theft, consul; fifty-five thousand pounds! We don’t often come across such opportunities. Thieves these days are becoming so pathetic! Someone gets hanged for stealing just a few shillings!” “Mr. Fix,” the consul said, “I appreciate your confidence and hope you succeed; but I worry you’ll find it quite challenging. Don't you notice that the description you have there bears a striking resemblance to an honest person?” “Consul,” the detective replied with certainty, “significant criminals always look like respectable people. Those with obviously dishonest faces have no other option but to remain honest; otherwise, they'd be arrested immediately. The true skill is in exposing those with honest appearances; it’s not an easy task, I admit, but it is a genuine art.” It was evident that Mr. Fix possessed a degree of self-importance.",

On the docks, among the crowd gathered in Suez—a town rapidly developing thanks to M. Lesseps' efforts—two men were walking: the British consul in Suez and another man named Fix, who was slight and restless, constantly showing signs of impatience. Fix was a detective sent from England to track down a bank robber, and he was vigilantly observing all arrivals, watching for anyone matching the description of the suspect recently received from London. Motivated by the prospect of a significant reward, Fix waited anxiously for the 'Mongolia.' He frequently asked the consul whether the ship was ever late, to which the consul assured him of the ship's punctuality and speed. The consul questioned how Fix would recognize the suspect with such a vague description, but Fix insisted that a detective relies on intuition or a 'sixth sense' to spot criminals and was confident he would not let the culprit escape if he was aboard. The consul remarked that the description seemed just as likely to fit an honest man, but Fix replied that skilled criminals often resemble trustworthy people, and that identifying them is an art—a point he made with a touch of pride."

It is thirteen hundred and ten miles from Suez to Aden, at the other end of the Red Sea, and she has to take in a fresh coal supply.”\n“And does she go from Suez directly to Bombay?”\n“Without putting in anywhere.”\n“Good!” said Fix. “If the robber is on board he will no doubt get off at Suez, so as to reach the Dutch or French colonies in Asia by some other route. He ought to know that he would not be safe an hour in India, which is English soil.”\n“Unless,” objected the consul, “he is exceptionally shrewd.

It's a distance of thirteen hundred and ten miles from Suez to Aden, at the opposite end of the Red Sea, and she needs to load a fresh supply of fuel.\" \"And does she travel directly from Suez to Bombay?\" \"Without making any other stops.\" \"Good!\" said Fix. \"If the thief is on board, he will surely get off at Suez to reach the Dutch or French colonies in Asia via a different route. He must know that he wouldn't be secure for even an hour in India, which is English territory.\" \"Unless,\" the consul objected, \"he is extraordinarily astute.

The weather was bright but cool, and the town’s minarets stood out above the rooftops, bathed in the soft sunlight. A long pier, about two thousand yards in length, stretched into the harbor, and several fishing and coastal vessels, some designed like ancient ships, could be seen on the Red Sea. Walking through this bustling scene, Fix watched everyone around him with his typical sharp, quick gaze. It was now 10:30. \n\n“The steamer still isn’t here!” he remarked as the sound of the port clock chimed.\n\n“She must be close now,” his companion replied.\n\n“How long will the steamer stay in Suez?”\n\n“About four hours; just enough time to take on more coal. The distance from Suez to Aden, at the end of the Red Sea, is 1,310 miles, so she’ll need to refuel.”\n\n“And does she sail straight from Suez to Bombay?”\n\n“Yes, without stopping anywhere else.”\n\n“Excellent!” said Fix. “If the thief is aboard, he’ll most likely disembark at Suez to try to reach the Dutch or French colonies in Asia via another route. He should realize he wouldn’t remain safe for even an hour in India, since it’s British territory.”\n\n“Unless,” the consul countered, “he’s extremely clever. English criminals, after all, usually blend in best in London rather than abroad.”\n\nThis comment made the detective ponder, and as he considered this, the consul returned to his office."

The hasty departure from London soon after the robbery; the large sum carried by Mr. Fogg; his eagerness to reach distant countries; the pretext of an eccentric and foolhardy bet—all confirmed Fix in his theory. He continued to pump poor Passepartout, and learned that he really knew little or nothing of his master, who lived a solitary existence in London, was said to be rich, though no one knew whence came his riches, and was mysterious and impenetrable in his affairs and habits. Fix felt sure that Phileas Fogg would not land at Suez, but was really going on to Bombay.\n“Is Bombay far from here?” asked Passepartout.\n“Pretty far. It is a ten days’ voyage by sea.”\n“And in what country is Bombay?”\n“India.”\n“In Asia?”\n“Certainly.”\n“The deuce! I was going to tell you there’s one thing that worries me—my burner!”\n“What burner?”\n“My gas-burner, which I forgot to turn off, and which is at this moment burning at my expense. I have calculated, monsieur, that I lose two shillings every four and twenty hours, exactly sixpence more than I earn; and you will understand that the longer our journey—”",

So Mr. Fogg is quite a personality, is he?” inquired Fix. “Absolutely,” replied Passepartout. “Is he a wealthy man?” pressed Fix. “Undoubtedly, as he’s traveling with an enormous amount of brand-new money. He's not stingy with it either; he even promised a large bonus to the 'Mongolia’s' engineer if we arrive in Bombay significantly ahead of schedule.” “And you’ve been working for your employer for a considerable time?” Fix asked. “Not at all; I just started serving him on the very day we departed London.” The effect of these responses on the already cautious and tense detective was considerable. The swift departure from London shortly after the theft, Mr. Fogg’s large sum of cash, his eagerness to reach distant places, and the excuse of an eccentric and daring wager – all this solidified Fix's suspicions. He continued to question the unsuspecting Passepartout, discovering that he genuinely knew little about his master. Fogg led a secluded life in London, was believed to be rich although the source of his wealth was unknown, and was secretive and unfathomable in his activities and habits. Fix became certain that Phileas Fogg would not disembark at Suez but was indeed heading further on to Bombay. “How far is Bombay from here?” Passepartout asked. “Quite a distance. It’s a ten-day sea journey,” Fix responded. “And which country is Bombay in?” “India.” “In Asia?” “Precisely.” “Blast it! I was just about to mention something bothering me—my burner!” Passepartout exclaimed. “What burner?” Fix asked. “My gas-burner, which I forgot to turn off. It's currently burning away at my expense back home. I’ve calculated, sir, that I’m losing two shillings every twenty-four hours, which is exactly sixpence more than I earn each day; and you can understand that the longer our trip lasts—”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "“So, Mr. Fogg is an unusual person, is he?”\n“I’d say so.”\n“Is he wealthy?”\n“Absolutely. He’s traveling with a large amount of new banknotes. And he doesn’t hold back on spending: he even offered a significant bonus to the engineer of the ‘Mongolia’ if we reach Bombay well ahead of schedule.”\n“And have you worked for your employer long?”\n“Actually, no. I started working for him the very day we left London.”\n\nThese answers, given to the already watchful and agitated detective, only heightened his suspicions. The quick departure from London after the theft, the considerable money Fogg carried, his desire to reach far-off lands, and the seemingly absurd pretense of a wild bet – all this convinced Detective Fix he was correct in his assumptions. He kept questioning poor Passepartout, only to find out that the valet knew almost nothing about Fogg, who led a life of isolation in London, was believed to be rich (though the origin of his wealth was a mystery), and remained secretive in both his actions and routine. Fix became convinced Fogg’s intention was not to stop at Suez but to continue on to Bombay.\n\n“Is Bombay a long way from here?” Passepartout asked.\n“Quite far. It takes about ten days by sea.”\n“And which country is Bombay in?”\n“India.”\n“In Asia?”\n“Yes, indeed.”\n“Good heavens! There’s something worrying me—my burner!”\n“Your burner?”\n“My gas-burner – I forgot to turn it off, so it’s burning and costing me money right now.

He wasn't listening but was instead focused on developing a plan. They arrived at the shop, where Fix told his companion to make his purchases and not miss the steamer, before he rapidly went back to the consulate. Now completely convinced, Fix had become entirely calm again. \"Consul,\" he declared, \"I am absolutely sure now. I've located my man. He is presenting himself as an unusual person who is trying to circumnavigate the globe in eighty days.\" \"Then he is a shrewd person,\" the consul replied, \"and intends to return to London after diverting the authorities in both countries.\" \"We shall see about that,\" Fix responded. \"But are you certain you are not wrong?\" \"I am not wrong.\" \"Why was this criminal so keen to demonstrate, via the visa, that he had been through Suez?\" \"I have no idea why,\" Fix admitted, \"but please listen to me.\" He briefly summarized the key elements of his discussion with Passepartout. \"Essentially,\" the consul stated, \"all evidence points strongly against this man.

Fully convinced now, Fix had regained his composure. \n\n\"Consul,\" he began, \"I'm certain now. I've found the man. He's pretending to be an eccentric on a trip around the world in eighty days.\"\n\n\"Then he's clever,\" replied the consul, \"and hopes to return to London after fooling the police of both nations.\"\n\n\"We'll see about that,\" Fix said.\n\n\"But are you sure you're not wrong?\"\n\n\"I'm sure.\"\n\n\"Why would this thief be so eager to have the visa prove he passed through Suez?\"\n\n\"I don't know; but let me explain.\"\n\nFix then summarized the key points of his discussion with Passepartout.\n\n\"So,\" the consul concluded, \"everything does look suspicious for this man.

The “Mongolia,” thanks to the vigorous exertions of the engineer, seemed likely, so rapid was her speed, to reach her destination considerably within that time. The greater part of the passengers from Brindisi were bound for India some for Bombay, others for Calcutta by way of Bombay, the nearest route thither, now that a railway crosses the Indian peninsula. Among the passengers was a number of officials and military officers of various grades, the latter being either attached to the regular British forces or commanding the Sepoy troops, and receiving high salaries ever since the central government has assumed the powers of the East India Company: for the sub-lieutenants get £280, brigadiers, £2,400, and generals of divisions, £4,000. What with the military men, a number of rich young Englishmen on their travels, and the hospitable efforts of the purser, the time passed quickly on the “Mongolia.” The best of fare was spread upon the cabin tables at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and the eight o’clock supper, and the ladies scrupulously changed their toilets twice a day; and the hours were whirled away, when the sea was tranquil, with music, dancing, and games.\nBut the Red Sea is full of caprice, and often boisterous, like most long and narrow gulfs. When the wind came from the African or Asian coast the “Mongolia,” with her long hull, rolled fearfully. Then the ladies speedily disappeared below; the pianos were silent; singing and dancing suddenly ceased. Yet the good ship ploughed straight on, unretarded by wind or wave, towards the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb. What was Phileas Fogg doing all this time? It might be thought that, in his anxiety, he would be constantly watching the changes of the wind, the disorderly raging of the billows—every chance, in short, which might force the “Mongolia” to slacken her speed, and thus interrupt his journey. But, if he thought of these possibilities, he did not betray the fact by any outward sign.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The voyage from Suez to Aden covers exactly thirteen hundred and ten miles, and shipping regulations permit steamships one hundred and thirty-eight hours to complete it. However, the 'Mongolia,' moving at a great pace thanks to the engineer's hard work, seemed likely to reach its destination significantly sooner than the allotted time. Most passengers who boarded at Brindisi were headed for India, either directly to Bombay or onwards to Calcutta via Bombay, which is now the most direct route since a railway line traverses the Indian subcontinent. The passenger manifest included numerous government officials and military personnel of various ranks, with the latter serving either in the British regular forces or commanding Sepoy regiments. These officers received substantial salaries, especially after the central government took over from the East India Company; for instance, a sub-lieutenant earned £280, brigadiers £2,400, and division generals £4,000. The company of these military men, along with several wealthy young English travelers and the purser's accommodating efforts, made the journey on the 'Mongolia' pass swiftly. Excellent meals were served frequently throughout the day – at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and the 8 pm supper – and the female passengers diligently changed their attire twice daily. When the sea was calm, hours were spent happily with music, dancing, and various games. However, the Red Sea is known for its unpredictable and often rough nature, typical of long, narrow gulfs. When winds blew from the African or Asian coasts, the 'Mongolia,' with its extended hull, experienced severe rolling. In such conditions, the ladies quickly retreated below deck; pianos fell silent; and all music and dancing abruptly stopped. Despite this, the capable ship continued its steady course, unhindered by wind or waves, towards the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb. Meanwhile, what was Phileas Fogg doing? One might expect him to be constantly observing the wind shifts, the violent swells – any factor that could potentially force the 'Mongolia' to slow down and disrupt his schedule.

Most of the passengers boarding at Brindisi were headed for India—some to Bombay, and others to Calcutta via Bombay, which was now the fastest route thanks to a new railway across the Indian subcontinent. The diverse group aboard included several officials and military officers of varying ranks, either serving with the British army or commanding Sepoy regiments, and all were well paid ever since the central government took over from the East India Company: sub-lieutenants made £280, brigadiers got £2,400, and division generals received £4,000. With these officers, a group of wealthy young English tourists, and the social activities arranged by the purser, the days aboard the \"Mongolia\" passed pleasantly. Meals were generous for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and supper, and the ladies changed outfits twice daily; calm days saw people enjoying music, dancing, and games. However, the Red Sea, known for its unpredictable and often rough conditions, could suddenly become turbulent. When the wind blew from Africa or Asia, the long-hulled \"Mongolia\" rolled heavily, causing most ladies to retreat below deck, leaving the piano and dancing areas deserted. Nonetheless, the sturdy vessel pressed on steadily towards the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, unfazed by the weather. As for Phileas Fogg, one might expect him, due to his concern, to be anxious about the changing winds and rough seas—any of which could delay the ship—but if he did worry, he gave no outward sign of it."

Passepartout was ravished to behold this celebrated place, and thought that, with its circular walls and dismantled fort, it looked like an immense coffee-cup and saucer. The following night they passed through the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, which means in Arabic “The Bridge of Tears,” and the next day they put in at Steamer Point, north-west of Aden harbour, to take in coal. This matter of fuelling steamers is a serious one at such distances from the coal-mines; it costs the Peninsular Company some eight hundred thousand pounds a year. In these distant seas, coal is worth three or four pounds sterling a ton.\nThe “Mongolia” had still sixteen hundred and fifty miles to traverse before reaching Bombay, and was obliged to remain four hours at Steamer Point to coal up.

The \"Mongolia\" maintained its fast pace. On the 13th, they spotted Mocha, marked by its decaying walls and date palms, with large coffee plantations visible on the hills behind it. Passepartout was enchanted to see this famous location and observed that, with its circular walls and ruined fort, it resembled a giant coffee cup and saucer. The subsequent night, they sailed through the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, whose Arabic name signifies \"The Bridge of Tears,\" and the next morning, they docked at Steamer Point, northwest of Aden harbour, to take on coal. Supplying coal to steamships is a considerable challenge when far from mining sites, costing the Peninsular Company around eight hundred thousand pounds annually. In these distant waters, a ton of coal commands a price of three or four pounds sterling. The \"Mongolia\" still had a journey of sixteen hundred and fifty miles remaining to reach Bombay and was required to stay for four hours at Steamer Point for coaling.

Meanwhile, the “Mongolia” continued on its swift journey; on the 13th, they sighted Mocha with its ruined walls covered in date-trees and, in the distance, large coffee plantations on the hills. Passepartout was delighted to see the famous city and remarked that its round walls and broken-down fort made it resemble a gigantic coffee-cup and saucer. The next night, the steamer traveled through the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, whose name means “The Bridge of Tears” in Arabic, and the following day they stopped at Steamer Point, just northwest of Aden harbor, to refuel with coal. At such remote locations, refueling steamers is an expensive matter; for the Peninsular Company, it costs about eight hundred thousand pounds a year, as coal in these waters sells for three or four pounds per ton. The “Mongolia” still had 1,650 miles to go before reaching Bombay and had to wait four hours at Steamer Point to take on coal. However, this expected delay did not upset Phileas Fogg’s plans; in fact, the “Mongolia” arrived at Aden on the evening of the 14th, fifteen hours earlier than its scheduled time of arrival on the morning of the 15th."

It steadily incorporated province after province, often acquiring them from native leaders through purchase but rarely paying the agreed sums, and was responsible for appointing the governor-general and his subordinate officials, both civilian and military.

Parts of India still remain outside British rule, with some fiercely independent rajahs in the interior. The renowned East India Company was extremely powerful from 1756, when the British first established themselves at the location of present-day Madras, until the great Sepoy Rebellion. During that time, it expanded its territory by acquiring provinces from local rulers, often without proper payment, and controlled the appointment of the governor-general and his officials. Now, the East India Company no longer exists, and India is governed directly by the British Crown.

This was Sir Francis Cromarty, one of Mr. Fogg’s whist partners on the “Mongolia,” now on his way to join his corps at Benares. Sir Francis was a tall, fair man of fifty, who had greatly distinguished himself in the last Sepoy revolt. He made India his home, only paying brief visits to England at rare intervals; and was almost as familiar as a native with the customs, history, and character of India and its people. But Phileas Fogg, who was not travelling, but only describing a circumference, took no pains to inquire into these subjects; he was a solid body, traversing an orbit around the terrestrial globe, according to the laws of rational mechanics.

Occupying the seat opposite them was a third passenger, Sir Francis Cromarty, one of Mr. Fogg's partners from the whist games on the 'Mongolia', now on his way to his military unit in Benares. Sir Francis was a tall, fair-haired man in his fifties, who had earned significant recognition during the recent Sepoy revolt. He considered India his home, returning to England for only short visits infrequently; consequently, he understood India's customs, history, and the character of its people almost as well as a native. However, Phileas Fogg, who was not experiencing the journey but merely traversing a circle, took no interest in investigating these matters; he perceived himself as a fixed object moving along an orbit around the earth, governed by the rules of rational mechanics. At that moment, he was calculating in his head the number of hours elapsed since leaving London and, if he were inclined to show unnecessary emotion, he would have rubbed his hands together in satisfaction. Sir Francis Cromarty had noticed the unusual nature of his travel companion—though his only chances to observe him were during the card games between rounds of whist—and questioned whether a human heart truly beat beneath this detached exterior, and if Phileas Fogg possessed any capacity to appreciate the beauty of the natural world. The brigadier-general was willing to admit to himself that, of all the eccentric individuals he had ever encountered, none was comparable to this man, who seemed a product of exact scientific principles. Phileas Fogg had openly shared with Sir Francis his plan to travel around the world and the circumstances that led to his undertaking; the general simply saw the wager as a pointless eccentricity and a lack of sound judgment. He felt that, based on the way this peculiar gentleman was living, he would go through life without achieving any good for himself or anyone else.",

Passepartout shared a compartment with his employer, and seated across from them was a third traveler: Sir Francis Cromarty. Sir Francis, who had played whist with Mr. Fogg on the 'Mongolia,' was making his way to rejoin his regiment at Benares. He was a tall, fair-haired man of fifty, renowned for his role in the Sepoy Rebellion. Having settled in India with only occasional trips back to England, Sir Francis was deeply familiar with Indian society and customs. In contrast, Phileas Fogg, who viewed his journey as little more than a calculated circumnavigation, had no interest in learning about these things; he approached travel logically and methodically, focused solely on tracking the hours since leaving London. If he were inclined to show emotion, Fogg might have celebrated his progress. Sir Francis, who had noticed Fogg’s peculiarity mostly while playing cards with him, wondered if someone so detached could appreciate the wonders of the world, or if Fogg even had emotions at all. Of all the odd characters he had encountered, Sir Francis considered Fogg the most unusual, a true embodiment of exact science. Fogg had openly shared his plan to travel around the globe and the wager that motivated him, but Sir Francis simply saw it as pointless eccentricity, doubting that Fogg’s journey would bring any benefit to himself or others."

Fogg replied that such a delay would not have affected his plans, since he was always prepared for possible setbacks. Sir Francis then brought up another concern: they might have trouble because of Passepartout's incident at the pagoda, since the authorities strictly enforce respect for Indian religious customs. Passepartout, wrapped in his blanket and sound asleep, was unaware of the discussion. Sir Francis said that if Passepartout were caught, he would be punished.

This fertile territory is watered by numerous small rivers and limpid streams, mostly tributaries of the Godavery.\nPassepartout, on waking and looking out, could not realise that he was actually crossing India in a railway train. The locomotive, guided by an English engineer and fed with English coal, threw out its smoke upon cotton, coffee, nutmeg, clove, and pepper plantations, while the steam curled in spirals around groups of palm-trees, in the midst of which were seen picturesque bungalows, viharis (sort of abandoned monasteries), and marvellous temples enriched by the exhaustless ornamentation of Indian architecture. Then they came upon vast tracts extending to the horizon, with jungles inhabited by snakes and tigers, which fled at the noise of the train; succeeded by forests penetrated by the railway, and still haunted by elephants which, with pensive eyes, gazed at the train as it passed. The travellers crossed, beyond Milligaum, the fatal country so often stained with blood by the sectaries of the goddess Kali. Not far off rose Ellora, with its graceful pagodas, and the famous Aurungabad, capital of the ferocious Aureng-Zeb, now the chief town of one of the detached provinces of the kingdom of the Nizam. It was thereabouts that Feringhea, the Thuggee chief, king of the stranglers, held his sway. These ruffians, united by a secret bond, strangled victims of every age in honour of the goddess Death, without ever shedding blood; there was a period when this part of the country could scarcely be travelled over without corpses being found in every direction. The English Government has succeeded in greatly diminishing these murders, though the Thuggees still exist, and pursue the exercise of their horrible rites.\nAt half-past twelve the train stopped at Burhampoor where Passepartout was able to purchase some Indian slippers, ornamented with false pearls, in which, with evident vanity, he proceeded to encase his feet.",

Overnight, the train moved beyond the mountains, went through Nassik, and by the following day, it was traversing the level, highly fertile landscape of the Khandeish region. This area featured dispersed villages marked by the presence of pagoda minarets. The productive land is sustained by many small rivers and clear streams, primarily flowing into the Godavery river. Waking up and observing the scenery, Passepartout found it hard to believe he was genuinely travelling across India by train. The engine, controlled by a British engineer and burning British coal, emitted smoke over fields of cotton, coffee, nutmeg, cloves, and pepper. Meanwhile, steam swirled amongst clusters of palm trees, where charming bungalows, viharis (which are a type of deserted monastery), and magnificent temples adorned with the abundant decorative details of Indian design were visible. Following this, the train encountered huge expanses stretching to the horizon, featuring wild areas populated by snakes and tigers that retreated from the sound of the train. These gave way to forests that the railway line ran through, still frequented by elephants whose thoughtful eyes watched the train go by. Beyond Milligaum, the passengers traversed a notorious area frequently marked by bloodshed caused by followers of the goddess Kali. Nearby lay Ellora, known for its elegant pagodas, and the renowned Aurungabad, once the capital of the fierce Aureng-Zeb and currently the main town of a separate province within the Nizam's kingdom. This area was historically controlled by Feringhea, the leader of the Thuggees, or \"king of the stranglers.\" These criminals, bound by a hidden society, killed victims of all ages to honour the goddess of Death, always avoiding the shedding of blood. At one time, travelling through this region was perilous, with bodies often discovered everywhere. The British authorities have significantly reduced these killings, although the Thuggees continue to exist and practice their grim rituals. The train halted at Burhampoor at twelve-thirty. There, Passepartout bought some Indian slippers decorated with imitation pearls, which he then put on his feet with clear satisfaction.",

Throughout the night, the train moved out of the mountains, passed through Nassik, and continued the next day across the flat, well-farmed lands of Khandeish. Scattered villages dotted the landscape, their pagoda minarets rising above. Numerous small rivers and clear streams, most feeding the Godavery, watered this fertile area. When he awoke, Passepartout, glancing outside, struggled to believe he was actually crossing India by train. The engine, manned by an English engineer and powered by English coal, released smoke over plantations of cotton, coffee, nutmeg, cloves, and pepper, while steam drifted among palm tree clusters, revealing charming bungalows, abandoned viharis (monasteries), and magnificent temples richly decorated with classic Indian architecture. Soon, they saw vast open lands stretching to the horizon, where jungles—home to snakes and tigers—bordered the route. These animals fled the noisy train, which next entered forests through which the railway ran. Elephants, standing thoughtfully, watched as the train sped by. After Milligaum, the train crossed the infamous region long plagued by the followers of the goddess Kali, notorious for violent acts. Nearby stood Ellora, known for its elegant pagodas, and the renowned Aurungabad—the former seat of the fierce ruler Aureng-Zeb and now the main city of an independent province ruled by the Nizam. This was once the realm of Feringhea, the leader of the Thuggees, whose members, united by secret ties, strangled countless victims in honor of the goddess of death, rarely spilling blood. At one time, this land was so dangerous that dead bodies were a common sight. The English administration has greatly reduced such killings, though the Thuggees persist in their dreadful practices.

Up to his arrival at Bombay, he had entertained hopes that their journey would end there; but, now that they were plainly whirling across India at full speed, a sudden change had come over the spirit of his dreams. His old vagabond nature returned to him; the fantastic ideas of his youth once more took possession of him. He came to regard his master’s project as intended in good earnest, believed in the reality of the bet, and therefore in the tour of the world and the necessity of making it without fail within the designated period. Already he began to worry about possible delays, and accidents which might happen on the way. He recognised himself as being personally interested in the wager, and trembled at the thought that he might have been the means of losing it by his unpardonable folly of the night before. Being much less cool-headed than Mr. Fogg, he was much more restless, counting and recounting the days passed over, uttering maledictions when the train stopped, and accusing it of sluggishness, and mentally blaming Mr. Fogg for not having bribed the engineer. The worthy fellow was ignorant that, while it was possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer, it could not be done on the railway.\nThe train entered the defiles of the Sutpour Mountains, which separate the Khandeish from Bundelcund, towards evening. The next day Sir Francis Cromarty asked Passepartout what time it was; to which, on consulting his watch, he replied that it was three in the morning. This famous timepiece, always regulated on the Greenwich meridian, which was now some seventy-seven degrees westward, was at least four hours slow. Sir Francis corrected Passepartout’s time, whereupon the latter made the same remark that he had done to Fix; and upon the general insisting that the watch should be regulated in each new meridian, since he was constantly going eastward, that is in the face of the sun, and therefore the days were shorter by four minutes for each degree gone over, Passepartout obstinately refused to alter his watch, which he kept at London time.

Passepartout was now deeply engrossed in his thoughts. Up until their arrival in Bombay, he had maintained hope that their journey would conclude there. However, as they were clearly being carried across India at full speed, a dramatic change occurred in his perspective. His old nomadic spirit re-emerged, and the imaginative ideas of his youth once again took hold. He began to view his master's undertaking as genuinely serious, believed in the reality of the wager, and consequently in the necessity of completing the world tour precisely within the allotted time. Already, he started to fret about potential hold-ups and unforeseen incidents along the route. He recognised that he was personally invested in the outcome of the bet and shuddered at the idea that his earlier, unforgivable carelessness might have led to its loss. Being far less composed than Mr. Fogg, he was considerably more agitated, constantly counting the days that had passed, complaining loudly whenever the train paused, accusing it of being sluggish, and mentally blaming Mr. Fogg for not having paid off the engineer. The well-meaning fellow was unaware that while such tactics could speed up a steamer, they were not applicable to a railway. As evening approached, the train entered the mountain passes of the Sutpour range, separating Khandeish from Bundelcund. The next day, Sir Francis Cromarty asked Passepartout the time. Consulting his well-known watch, which was always set to the Greenwich meridian (now roughly seventy-seven degrees to the west), he replied it was three in the morning. The watch was at least four hours behind the local time. Sir Francis corrected Passepartout, who then made the same comment he had previously made to Fix. When the general insisted that his watch ought to be regulated at each new meridian, since he was consistently travelling eastward (thus moving against the sun), and consequently losing four minutes for every degree covered, Passepartout stubbornly declined to adjust his timepiece, keeping it on London time. It was a simple quirk that caused no harm.",

His previous wandering impulses resurfaced, and the imaginative ideas from his youth took hold of him again. He now believed fully in his employer’s daring plan, accepted the reality of the wager, and understood the importance of completing the journey around the world within the set time. He began to worry about possible setbacks and mishaps that could arise during their travels. Feeling personally involved in the bet, he was uneasy at the idea that his foolishness the night before might have cost them success. Unlike the composed Mr. Fogg, Passepartout was agitated, constantly counting the days, expressing frustration when their train stopped, blaming it for being slow, and even internally criticizing Mr. Fogg for not bribing the engineer to hurry. He did not realize that, while a steamer could be sped up this way, the same was not possible with the train. By evening, the train had entered the passes of the Sutpour Mountains, which separate Khandeish from Bundelcund. The next day, Sir Francis Cromarty asked Passepartout for the time; consulting his watch, Passepartout said it was 3 a.m. However, this watch, which was always set to Greenwich time and now about seventy-seven degrees west of it, was actually about four hours slow. Sir Francis corrected him, prompting Passepartout to repeat his previous comment to Fix. When Sir Francis argued that the watch should be set for each new time zone, since they were traveling east and losing four minutes per degree, Passepartout stubbornly kept his watch on London time.

Passepartout, just as taken aback, quickly hurried outside and returned just as fast, shouting, \"Monsieur, the railroad tracks are gone!\" \"What exactly do you mean?\" asked Sir Francis. \"I mean,\" Passepartout explained, \"that the train will not be continuing.\" The general immediately stepped out, with Phileas Fogg following calmly behind him, and together they went to the conductor. \"Where precisely are we?\" Sir Francis inquired. \"At the small village of Kholby,\" the conductor replied. \"Are we stopping here permanently?\" \"Indeed. The railway is not yet completed.\" \"What! Not finished?\" \"That's right. There are still about fifty miles of track missing from here to Allahabad, where the line resumes.\" \"But the newspapers reported the entire railway was open,\" Sir Francis retorted, starting to become annoyed. \"What can I tell you, officer?\" the conductor responded. \"The papers were mistaken.\" \"Yet you are selling tickets from Bombay all the way to Calcutta,\" pressed Sir Francis, his temper rising. \"Certainly,\" replied the conductor, \"but passengers are aware that they need to arrange their own transportation from Kholby to Allahabad.\" Sir Francis was furious. Passepartout wanted to punch the conductor but didn't dare look at his master. \"Sir Francis,\" Mr. Fogg said calmly, \"if you agree, we will look around for some way to travel to Allahabad.\" \"Mr. Fogg, this represents a significant delay, detrimental to your schedule.\" \"No, Sir Francis,\" Mr. Fogg corrected. \"It was foreseen.\" \"What! You knew the path...\" \"Not at all,\" Fogg clarified, \"but I was certain that some kind of obstacle would arise on my route at some point. Therefore, nothing has been lost. I have two days I had gained previously to spend. A steamer is scheduled to leave Calcutta for Hong Kong at noon on the 25th. Today is the 22nd, and we will arrive in Calcutta in plenty of time.\" There was simply no response possible to such a self-assured declaration.",

The conductor walked through the train, announcing that all passengers must get off. Phileas Fogg looked to Sir Francis Cromarty for an explanation, but the general was also at a loss as to why they had stopped in a forest of date and acacia trees. Passepartout, equally confused, hurried outside and quickly returned, exclaiming that the railway ended there. When Sir Francis questioned him, Passepartout explained that the train would not continue any further. The general and Mr. Fogg then approached the conductor for answers. They learned that they were at the village of Kholby, where the railway track was incomplete, with about fifty miles still missing before Allahabad, where the line resumed. Despite newspapers reporting the railway's completion, the conductor said the reports were inaccurate and that passengers had to find their own way from Kholby to Allahabad, although tickets from Bombay to Calcutta had been sold. This made Sir Francis very upset, and Passepartout was so frustrated that he could barely meet his master's gaze. Calmly, Mr. Fogg suggested to Sir Francis that they seek alternative transportation to Allahabad. Sir Francis warned that this delay was a serious setback, but Fogg replied that he had anticipated some sort of obstacle, so it did not worry him; he had two days in reserve and there would still be time to catch the steamer leaving Calcutta for Hong Kong on the 25th, since it was only the 22nd and they could still make it in time. Fogg's confident words left nothing to be argued."

          "text_segment": "It was but too true that the railway came to a termination at this point. The papers were like some watches, which have a way of getting too fast, and had been premature in their announcement of the completion of the line. The greater part of the travellers were aware of this interruption, and, leaving the train, they began to engage such vehicles as the village could provide four-wheeled palkigharis, waggons drawn by zebus, carriages that looked like perambulating pagodas, palanquins, ponies, and what not.\nMr. Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty, after searching the village from end to end, came back without having found anything.\n“I shall go afoot,” said Phileas Fogg.\nPassepartout, who had now rejoined his master, made a wry grimace, as he thought of his magnificent, but too frail Indian shoes. Happily he too had been looking about him, and, after a moment’s hesitation, said, “Monsieur, I think I have found a means of conveyance.”\n“What?”\n“An elephant! An elephant that belongs to an Indian who lives but a hundred steps from here.”\n“Let’s go and see the elephant,” replied Mr. Fogg.\nThey soon reached a small hut, near which, enclosed within some high palings, was the animal in question. An Indian came out of the hut, and, at their request, conducted them within the enclosure. The elephant, which its owner had reared, not for a beast of burden, but for warlike purposes, was half domesticated. The Indian had begun already, by often irritating him, and feeding him every three months on sugar and butter, to impart to him a ferocity not in his nature, this method being often employed by those who train the Indian elephants for battle. Happily, however, for Mr. Fogg, the animal’s instruction in this direction had not gone far, and the elephant still preserved his natural gentleness. Kiouni—this was the name of the beast—could doubtless travel rapidly for a long time, and, in default of any other means of conveyance, Mr. Fogg resolved to hire him. But elephants are far from cheap in India, where they are becoming scarce, the males, which alone are suitable for circus shows, are much sought, especially as but few of them are domesticated. When therefore Mr. Fogg proposed to the Indian to hire Kiouni, he refused point-blank. Mr. Fogg persisted, offering the excessive sum of ten pounds an hour for the loan of the beast to Allahabad. Refused. Twenty pounds? Refused also. Forty pounds? Still refused. Passepartout jumped at each advance; but the Indian declined to be tempted. Yet the offer was an alluring one, for, supposing it took the elephant fifteen hours to reach Allahabad, his owner would receive no less than six hundred pounds sterling.\nPhileas Fogg, without getting in the least flurried, then proposed to purchase the animal outright, and at first offered a thousand pounds for him. The Indian, perhaps thinking he was going to make a great bargain, still refused.\nSir Francis Cromarty took Mr. Fogg aside, and begged him to reflect before he went any further; to which that gentleman replied that he was not in the habit of acting rashly, that a bet of twenty thousand pounds was at stake, that the elephant was absolutely necessary to him, and that he would secure him if he had to pay twenty times his value. Returning to the Indian, whose small, sharp eyes, glistening with avarice, betrayed that with him it was only a question of how great a price he could obtain. Mr. Fogg offered first twelve hundred, then fifteen hundred, eighteen hundred, two thousand pounds. Passepartout, usually so rubicund, was fairly white with suspense.\nAt two thousand pounds the Indian yielded.\n“What a price, good heavens!” cried Passepartout, “for an elephant.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "It turned out to be true that the train line ended abruptly at this spot. The newspapers, similar to watches that run fast, had prematurely announced the completion of the route. Most of the travelers were aware of this interruption; they disembarked and began hiring whatever vehicles the village offered: four-wheeled palkigharis, carts pulled by zebus, elaborate carriages resembling walking pagodas, palanquins, ponies, and other conveyances. Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty searched the entire village but found nothing suitable. \"I'll proceed on foot,\" declared Phileas Fogg. Passepartout, having caught up with his employer, winced, thinking of his fine but delicate Indian shoes. Fortunately, he had also been looking around and, after a moment's pause, said, \"Monsieur, I believe I have found a mode of transport.\" \"What is it?\" asked Fogg. \"An elephant! One owned by an Indian man living just a hundred steps away.\" \"Let's go and see the elephant,\" Mr. Fogg replied. They quickly reached a small dwelling, near which, enclosed by high stakes, was the animal. An Indian man emerged and, upon their request, led them inside the enclosure. The elephant, which its owner had raised for military use rather than as a pack animal, was semi-tamed. The Indian had started to make it unnaturally aggressive by frequently provoking it and feeding it a diet of sugar and butter every three months, a technique often used to train Indian elephants for combat. Fortunately for Mr. Fogg, the animal's training in this regard hadn't progressed far, and the elephant retained its inherent gentleness. Kiouni—as the animal was named—could certainly travel swiftly for extended periods, and lacking any other transport, Mr. Fogg decided to rent him. However, elephants are quite expensive in India, where they are becoming scarce, and males, which are needed for entertainment purposes, are particularly sought after, especially since few are domesticated. Therefore, when Mr. Fogg proposed hiring Kiouni, the Indian outright refused. Mr. Fogg persisted, offering the considerable sum of ten pounds an hour for the animal's use to Allahabad. Refused. Twenty pounds? Also refused. Forty pounds? Still refused. Passepartout was startled by each increase, but the Indian remained unmoved. The offer was, in fact, very attractive; assuming the journey to Allahabad took fifteen hours, the owner would receive a substantial six hundred pounds sterling. Phileas Fogg, without showing any agitation, then offered to buy the animal completely, initially proposing a thousand pounds. The Indian, perhaps expecting a much better deal, still declined. Sir Francis Cromarty took Mr. Fogg aside and urged him to consider carefully before going higher. To this, Mr. Fogg responded that he did not act impulsively, that a twenty-thousand-pound wager was at stake, that the elephant was absolutely essential to him, and that he would acquire it even if he had to pay twenty times its worth. Turning back to the Indian, whose small, keen eyes gleamed with greed, revealing that his only concern was the highest price he could get, Mr. Fogg offered first twelve hundred, then fifteen hundred, eighteen hundred, and two thousand pounds. Passepartout, usually rosy-cheeked, turned noticeably pale with tension. At two thousand pounds, the Indian agreed. \"What an enormous price, good heavens!\" exclaimed Passepartout, \"for an elephant.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "It was indeed the case that the railway line ended at this location. The newspapers, which sometimes give premature information, had incorrectly reported that the track was finished. Most passengers knew the train would not go further, so they left and arranged for whatever transportation the local village offered—ranging from four-wheeled palkigharis and zebu-drawn wagons to carts resembling moving temples, palanquins, ponies, and more. After thoroughly searching the village, Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty were unable to secure any such vehicle. “I will walk,” declared Phileas Fogg. Passepartout, now reunited with his employer and worried about the durability of his fine Indian shoes, grimaced at the prospect. Fortunately, he too had been looking around and hesitantly suggested, \"Sir, I believe I have found a way to continue.\" \"What is it?\" asked Fogg. \"An elephant! There is one owned by a local Indian, not far from here.\" \"Let’s see the elephant,\" Fogg replied. They soon arrived at a small hut, behind which the elephant was enclosed. The owner, who came out at their request, allowed them inside the enclosure. The elephant, named Kiouni, was only semi-tame, raised not for labor but for battle, and had been intentionally made fiercer by the owner through various methods, though the animal remained gentle enough. Given the lack of other options and Kiouni's strength, Fogg decided to hire the animal. However, since elephants in India were rare and valuable—especially the males, which were most prized and seldom domesticated—the owner refused to rent Kiouni, regardless of Fogg’s escalating offers, even up to forty pounds per hour. Passepartout was startled by each increase, but the owner would not agree, despite the impressive sum. Fogg then attempted to buy the elephant, offering a thousand pounds and gradually increasing his offer after being repeatedly refused. Sir Francis Cromarty cautioned Fogg not to act hastily, but Fogg insisted the elephant was necessary to win his wager. Finally, when offered two thousand pounds, the owner accepted, leaving Passepartout astonished by the enormous amount paid for the elephant."

All this portion of Bundelcund, which is little frequented by travellers, is inhabited by a fanatical population, hardened in the most horrible practices of the Hindoo faith. The English have not been able to secure complete dominion over this territory, which is subjected to the influence of rajahs, whom it is almost impossible to reach in their inaccessible mountain fastnesses.

The English have not managed to gain full control over this territory, which is under the influence of rajahs who are almost impossible to reach in their hidden mountain strongholds. The travelers frequently spotted groups of aggressive Indians who, seeing the elephant crossing the countryside, made angry and threatening gestures. The Parsee tried to avoid them as much as possible. Few animals were seen along the way; even the monkeys quickly fled their path with funny movements and faces that made Passepartout roar with laughter. However, amidst his amusement, a single thought troubled the loyal servant. What would Mr. Fogg do with the elephant once they reached Allahabad? Would he take him further? That was impossible! Transporting him would be ruinously expensive. Would he sell or release him? The worthy animal certainly deserved consideration. Should Mr. Fogg decide to give Kiouni to him, Passepartout, he would be in a very awkward position; and these concerns continued to weigh on his mind for a considerable time.",

This region of Bundelcund, seldom visited by travelers, was home to a zealous population deeply rooted in the harshest traditions of the Hindoo religion. The British had not managed to fully control this area, as local rulers—rajahs—remained largely out of reach in their remote mountain castles. Along the way, the travelers frequently encountered groups of fierce-looking Indians who, on seeing the elephant marching across the open country, reacted with anger and hostility. The Parsee steered clear of them whenever he could. There were hardly any animals to be seen, and even the monkeys would quickly scurry off, making faces that made Passepartout laugh heartily. Yet, amidst his amusement, Passepartout was troubled by one concern: what would Mr. Fogg do with the elephant once they arrived at Allahabad? Taking the animal further seemed out of the question, as transporting it would be absurdly costly. Would Mr. Fogg try to sell it, or simply let it go? The kindly animal deserved some thought. Passepartout wondered, too, how he would feel if Mr. Fogg gave Kiouni to him as a gift; the prospect left him rather unsettled, and he found himself worrying over these questions for quite some time."

Following her were guards, sharply contrasting in appearance, armed with unsheathed sabres and decorative pistols. They carried the corpse of an old man on a litter: he was dressed as a rajah, with a pearl-covered turban, a robe of silk and gold, a diamond-studded cashmere sash, and lavish weapons. Musicians and another group of wild, shouting fakirs, whose cries would sometimes rise above the music, brought up the rear and concluded the procession."

The procession slowly wound under the trees, and soon its last ranks disappeared in the depths of the wood. The songs gradually died away; occasionally cries were heard in the distance, until at last all was silence again.\nPhileas Fogg had heard what Sir Francis said, and, as soon as the procession had disappeared, asked: “What is a suttee?”\n“A suttee,” returned the general, “is a human sacrifice, but a voluntary one. The woman you have just seen will be burned to-morrow at the dawn of day.”\n“Oh, the scoundrels!” cried Passepartout, who could not repress his indignation.\n“And the corpse?” asked Mr. Fogg.\n“Is that of the prince, her husband,” said the guide; “an independent rajah of Bundelcund.”\n“Is it possible,” resumed Phileas Fogg, his voice betraying not the least emotion, “that these barbarous customs still exist in India, and that the English have been unable to put a stop to them?”\n“These sacrifices do not occur in the larger portion of India,” replied Sir Francis; “but we have no power over these savage territories, and especially here in Bundelcund. The whole district north of the Vindhias is the theatre of incessant murders and pillage.”\n“The poor wretch!” exclaimed Passepartout, “to be burned alive!”\n“Yes,” returned Sir Francis, “burned alive. And, if she were not, you cannot conceive what treatment she would be obliged to submit to from her relatives. They would shave off her hair, feed her on a scanty allowance of rice, treat her with contempt; she would be looked upon as an unclean creature, and would die in some corner, like a scurvy dog. The prospect of so frightful an existence drives these poor creatures to the sacrifice much more than love or religious fanaticism. Sometimes, however, the sacrifice is really voluntary, and it requires the active interference of the Government to prevent it. Several years ago, when I was living at Bombay, a young widow asked permission of the governor to be burned along with her husband’s body; but, as you may imagine, he refused. The woman left the town, took refuge with an independent rajah, and there carried out her self-devoted purpose.”\nWhile Sir Francis was speaking, the guide shook his head several times, and now said: “The sacrifice which will take place to-morrow at dawn is not a voluntary one.”\n“How do you know?”\n“Everybody knows about this affair in Bundelcund.”\n“But the wretched creature did not seem to be making any resistance,” observed Sir Francis.\n“That was because they had intoxicated her with fumes of hemp and opium.”\n“But where are they taking her?”\n“To the pagoda of Pillaji, two miles from here; she will pass the night there.”\n“And the sacrifice will take place—”\n“To-morrow, at the first light of dawn.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Sir Francis observed the procession with a somber expression before turning to the guide and stating, \"A suttee.\" The Parsee guide responded with a nod, placing a finger to his lips. The group wound slowly beneath the trees, and soon the last members vanished into the dense forest. Their songs gradually faded, with only occasional distant cries audible until complete silence returned. Phileas Fogg, having overheard Sir Francis, inquired, once the procession was out of sight, \"What exactly is a suttee?\" \"A suttee,\" the general clarified, \"is a human sacrifice, though supposedly a willing one. The woman we just saw is scheduled to be burned tomorrow morning at sunrise.\" \"Oh, those villains!\" exclaimed Passepartout, unable to contain his outrage. \"And whose body is it?\" asked Mr. Fogg. \"It's the body of the prince, her husband,\" the guide replied, \"an independent rajah from Bundelcund.\" \"Is it truly possible,\" Phileas Fogg continued, his voice devoid of any discernible feeling, \"that such brutal customs still persist in India, and that the English have been unable to stop them?\" \"These sacrifices aren't common across most of India,\" Sir Francis explained, \"but we have no authority in these untamed territories, particularly here in Bundelcund. The entire region north of the Vindhyas is plagued by constant killings and looting.\" \"The poor woman!\" cried Passepartout, \"to be burned alive!\" \"Yes,\" Sir Francis confirmed, \"burned alive. And were she not to do so, you can't imagine the mistreatment she would endure from her relatives. They would shave her head, give her minimal food like rice, treat her with utter scorn; she'd be seen as impure and would likely die neglected, like a stray dog. The prospect of such a dreadful existence often drives these unfortunate individuals to sacrifice more than affection or religious fervor. Occasionally, however, the sacrifice is genuinely voluntary, sometimes requiring government intervention to prevent it. Years ago, while I was stationed in Bombay, a young widow sought the governor's permission to be burned with her husband's corpse; permission was naturally refused. She left the city, found refuge with an independent rajah, and there carried out her self-immolation.\" While Sir Francis spoke, the guide repeatedly shook his head, now adding, \"The sacrifice scheduled for tomorrow at dawn is not voluntary.\" \"How can you be sure?\" \"It's widely known throughout Bundelcund.\" \"But the poor soul didn't appear to be resisting,\" Sir Francis noted. \"That's because they drugged her with fumes from hemp and opium.\" \"Where are they taking her?\" \"To the pagoda of Pillaji, about two miles away; she will stay there overnight.\" \"And the sacrifice will occur—\" \"Tomorrow, at the very first light of day.\"",

The procession gradually passed beneath the trees and vanished into the forest, with the music fading and only the occasional distant scream breaking the silence until all was quiet again. Phileas Fogg, having overheard, asked what a suttee was. General Sir Francis explained that it was a form of human sacrifice, though one that is supposed to be voluntary—where the woman they just saw would be burned at dawn the next day. Passepartout was horrified and exclaimed in anger. Fogg inquired about the deceased, learning that the body was that of a prince, the woman's husband. Fogg wondered how such brutal customs could still exist in India, and whether the British authorities were powerless to stop them. Sir Francis replied that such acts were rare in most of India, but in areas like Bundelcund, outside British control, violence and lawlessness persisted. Passepartout pitied the woman, shocked by the idea of being burned alive. Sir Francis explained that if a widow refused the ritual, she would face severe mistreatment and social exclusion by her family, often resulting in a miserable life or death, which sometimes drove women to choose the sacrifice. However, on occasion the act was truly voluntary, and authorities had to intervene to prevent it, recounting an instance when a young widow sought permission to self-immolate, was denied, but carried out the act with the help of a local ruler elsewhere. During this, the guide clarified that the upcoming sacrifice was not voluntary; although the woman had not resisted, it was because she was drugged. He explained she was being taken to the Pillaji temple to spend the night, and the ritual was to be performed at dawn."

But he did not hesitate, and he found in Sir Francis Cromarty an enthusiastic ally.\nAs for Passepartout, he was ready for anything that might be proposed. His master’s idea charmed him; he perceived a heart, a soul, under that icy exterior. He began to love Phileas Fogg.\nThere remained the guide: what course would he adopt? Would he not take part with the Indians? In default of his assistance, it was necessary to be assured of his neutrality.\nSir Francis frankly put the question to him.\n“Officers,” replied the guide, “I am a Parsee, and this woman is a Parsee. Command me as you will.”\n“Excellent!” said Mr. Fogg.\n“However,” resumed the guide, “it is certain, not only that we shall risk our lives, but horrible tortures, if we are taken.”\n“That is foreseen,” replied Mr. Fogg. “I think we must wait till night before acting.”\n“I think so,” said the guide.\nThe worthy Indian then gave some account of the victim, who, he said, was a celebrated beauty of the Parsee race, and the daughter of a wealthy Bombay merchant. She had received a thoroughly English education in that city, and, from her manners and intelligence, would be thought an European. Her name was Aouda. Left an orphan, she was married against her will to the old rajah of Bundelcund; and, knowing the fate that awaited her, she escaped, was retaken, and devoted by the rajah’s relatives, who had an interest in her death, to the sacrifice from which it seemed she could not escape.\nThe Parsee’s narrative only confirmed Mr. Fogg and his companions in their generous design. It was decided that the guide should direct the elephant towards the pagoda of Pillaji, which he accordingly approached as quickly as possible. They halted, half an hour afterwards, in a copse, some five hundred feet from the pagoda, where they were well concealed; but they could hear the groans and cries of the fakirs distinctly.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "This undertaking was daring and fraught with challenges, perhaps even unfeasible. Mr. Fogg was risking his life, or at least his freedom, and thus jeopardizing the success of his journey. Despite this, he didn't hesitate, finding an eager supporter in Sir Francis Cromarty. Passepartout, for his part, was ready for whatever was suggested. His master's concept thrilled him; he began to see genuine feeling and humanity beneath that seemingly cold exterior. He was starting to develop affection for Phileas Fogg. The guide remained a concern: how would he react? Would he align himself with the Indians? If he wouldn't assist, they needed to ensure he would at least remain neutral. Sir Francis directly posed the question to him. The guide responded, \"Gentlemen, I am a Parsee, and this woman is also a Parsee. You may command me as you wish.\" \"Excellent!\" declared Mr. Fogg. \"But be warned,\" the guide continued, \"it is certain that if we are captured, we face not just death, but terrible torture.\" \"We understand that risk,\" Mr. Fogg replied. \"I believe we should wait until nightfall before making a move.\" \"I agree,\" said the guide. The helpful guide then shared some details about the woman, stating she was a renowned beauty among the Parsees, the daughter of a wealthy merchant from Bombay. She had received a complete English education in that city, and her refined behavior and intellect were such that she might be mistaken for a European. Her name was Aouda. Having become an orphan, she was forcibly married to the aging rajah of Bundelcund; aware of her impending fate, she fled but was recaptured and condemned by the rajah's relatives, who stood to gain from her death, to the sacrifice from which escape seemed impossible. The guide's account only reinforced Mr. Fogg and his companions' determination in their noble endeavor. It was decided that the guide would steer the elephant towards the Pillaji pagoda, which he proceeded to do without delay. About thirty minutes later, they stopped in a thicket roughly five hundred feet away from the pagoda, where they were effectively hidden; however, the sounds of the fakirs' chanting and cries were clearly audible.",

Mr. Fogg was prepared to endanger his safety, or at least his freedom, which could jeopardize the outcome of his journey. Nevertheless, he did not waver and found a passionate supporter in Sir Francis Cromarty. Passepartout, for his part, was willing to embrace whatever plan might be suggested. He was captivated by his employer's resolve, seeing a compassionate nature behind his reserved demeanor, which made Passepartout begin to feel affection for Phileas Fogg. Their only uncertainty was the guide—would he join forces with the natives? If he could not be counted on to help, it was essential to ensure he would, at minimum, remain neutral. Sir Francis addressed him directly. \"Gentlemen,\" the guide answered, \"I am a Parsee, and so is this woman. You may command me as you wish.\" Mr. Fogg expressed his approval. The guide continued, warning that besides risking their lives, they would face awful torture if captured. Mr. Fogg replied that this had been anticipated, and suggested they should wait until nightfall to move. The guide agreed. The respectful Indian then explained more about the woman they were trying to rescue. She was renowned for her beauty among the Parsees and was the daughter of a wealthy merchant in Bombay. She had received a complete English education, and her grace and intellect made her appear almost European. Her name was Aouda. Orphaned, she had been forced to marry the elderly rajah of Bundelcund against her will. Upon learning of her grim fate, she tried to escape but was caught and sentenced to death by the rajah’s relatives who stood to gain from her demise. The guide’s story only strengthened Mr. Fogg and his companions’ resolve to save her. They agreed that the guide should lead their elephant toward the Pillaji pagoda, heading there quickly. After half an hour, they stopped in a thicket roughly five hundred feet from the pagoda, where they were hidden from view but could clearly hear the cries and lamentations of the fakirs."

This could only be determined at the moment and the place themselves; but it was certain that the abduction must be made that night, and not when, at break of day, the victim was led to her funeral pyre. Then no human intervention could save her.\nAs soon as night fell, about six o’clock, they decided to make a reconnaissance around the pagoda. The cries of the fakirs were just ceasing; the Indians were in the act of plunging themselves into the drunkenness caused by liquid opium mingled with hemp, and it might be possible to slip between them to the temple itself.\nThe Parsee, leading the others, noiselessly crept through the wood, and in ten minutes they found themselves on the banks of a small stream, whence, by the light of the rosin torches, they perceived a pyre of wood, on the top of which lay the embalmed body of the rajah, which was to be burned with his wife. The pagoda, whose minarets loomed above the trees in the deepening dusk, stood a hundred steps away.\n“Come!” whispered the guide.\nHe slipped more cautiously than ever through the brush, followed by his companions; the silence around was only broken by the low murmuring of the wind among the branches.\nSoon the Parsee stopped on the borders of the glade, which was lit up by the torches. The ground was covered by groups of the Indians, motionless in their drunken sleep; it seemed a battlefield strewn with the dead. Men, women, and children lay together.\nIn the background, among the trees, the pagoda of Pillaji loomed distinctly. Much to the guide’s disappointment, the guards of the rajah, lighted by torches, were watching at the doors and marching to and fro with naked sabres; probably the priests, too, were watching within.\nThe Parsee, now convinced that it was impossible to force an entrance to the temple, advanced no farther, but led his companions back again.

This decision could only be made at the actual location and moment, but it was certain the rescue had to be carried out that night, before dawn, when the victim would be taken to her funeral pyre. At that point, no human intervention could save her.\n\nAs night fell, around six o’clock, they decided to conduct a reconnaissance around the pagoda.

From there, by the light of rosin torches, they could see a wooden pyre, on top of which lay the embalmed body of the rajah, destined to be burned with his wife. The pagoda, its minarets silhouetted above the trees in the growing darkness, was located about a hundred steps away.\n\n“Let's go!” whispered the guide.\n\nHe moved through the brush even more cautiously than before, followed by his companions; the only sound around was the soft murmuring of the wind among the branches.\n\nSoon, the Parsee stopped at the edge of the glade, which was illuminated by the torches.

They debated whether to try entering through the doors while the Indians were in a drunken sleep or to attempt to break through the walls, but decided they could only make that decision when they got there. What was clear was that the rescue needed to happen that night, before sunrise, when the victim would be led to her death and nothing could save her. Once darkness fell around six o’clock, they set out to scout the area around the pagoda. The cries of the fakirs were fading, and the Indians were becoming intoxicated by opium and hemp, making it possible to approach the temple.\n\nThe Parsee guided them quietly through the forest, and within ten minutes, they reached a small stream. By the light of torches, they could see a wooden pyre with the preserved body of the rajah, meant to be burned alongside his wife. The pagoda, with its tall towers, was about a hundred steps away in the dusk.\n\n\"Come,\" the guide whispered. He carefully led his companions through the undergrowth, where the only sound was the wind in the trees. Soon they reached the edge of a clearing lit by torches, where groups of Indians were lying still in a drunken sleep, making the place look like a battlefield. Men, women, and children were scattered across the ground.\n\nIn the background, the Pillaji pagoda was clearly visible among the trees. To the guide’s disappointment, the rajah’s guards, carrying torches and with drawn swords, were patrolling the entrance. Priests were likely inside as well. Seeing that there was no way to enter the temple, the Parsee led everyone back. Both Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty realized they couldn’t make an attempt from that direction."

The other plan must be carried out; an opening in the walls of the pagoda must be made. It remained to ascertain whether the priests were watching by the side of their victim as assiduously as were the soldiers at the door.\nAfter a last consultation, the guide announced that he was ready for the attempt, and advanced, followed by the others. They took a roundabout way, so as to get at the pagoda on the rear. They reached the walls about half-past twelve, without having met anyone; here there was no guard, nor were there either windows or doors.\nThe night was dark. The moon, on the wane, scarcely left the horizon, and was covered with heavy clouds; the height of the trees deepened the darkness.\nIt was not enough to reach the walls; an opening in them must be accomplished, and to attain this purpose the party only had their pocket-knives. Happily the temple walls were built of brick and wood, which could be penetrated with little difficulty; after one brick had been taken out, the rest would yield easily.\nThey set noiselessly to work, and the Parsee on one side and Passepartout on the other began to loosen the bricks so as to make an aperture two feet wide. They were getting on rapidly, when suddenly a cry was heard in the interior of the temple, followed almost instantly by other cries replying from the outside. Passepartout and the guide stopped. Had they been heard? Was the alarm being given? Common prudence urged them to retire, and they did so, followed by Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis. They again hid themselves in the wood, and waited till the disturbance, whatever it might be, ceased, holding themselves ready to resume their attempt without delay. But, awkwardly enough, the guards now appeared at the rear of the temple, and there installed themselves, in readiness to prevent a surprise.\nIt would be difficult to describe the disappointment of the party, thus interrupted in their work.",

The Parsee conceded this was a possibility. They settled down at the base of a tree to wait. The passage of time felt slow; the guide occasionally left to observe from the forest edge, but the guards stayed vigilant under the torchlight, and a faint glow emanated from the pagoda windows. They waited until midnight, but the guards showed no sign of growing weary, making it clear they couldn't rely on them nodding off. The alternative plan had to be implemented: creating an entry point in the pagoda walls. They still needed to confirm if the priests inside were as watchful over their prisoner as the soldiers were at the entrance. After a final discussion, the guide declared himself ready and moved forward, with the others following. They took a circuitous route to approach the pagoda from the rear. By about half-past twelve, they reached the walls without encountering anyone; this section had no guards, windows, or doors. The night was dark. The dwindling moon barely rose above the horizon and was obscured by thick clouds; the towering trees intensified the gloom. Merely reaching the walls wasn't enough; they needed to breach them, and their only tools for this task were their pocket knives. Fortunately, the temple was constructed from brick and wood, which could be penetrated with relative ease; once one brick was removed, the rest would yield easily. They began working quietly, the Parsee on one side and Passepartout on the other, loosening bricks to create an opening about two feet wide. They were progressing quickly when, unexpectedly, a shout echoed from inside the temple, immediately followed by answering cries from outside. Passepartout and the guide froze. Had they been detected? Was the alarm being raised? Good sense advised them to withdraw, which they did, joined by Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis. They concealed themselves in the woods again, waiting for the commotion, whatever its cause, to subside, prepared to resume their attempt without delay. Awkwardly, however, the guards then appeared at the back of the temple and positioned themselves there, ready to prevent any surprise. The group's disappointment at being interrupted in their task in this manner was considerable.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "They paused and spoke quietly to each other. \"It's only eight o'clock,\" said the brigadier, \"perhaps the guards will fall asleep too.\" \"That's possible,\" the Parsee replied. They lay down beneath a tree to wait. The wait felt long. The guide occasionally slipped away to check on the guards at the edge of the woods, but the guards remained alert, illuminated by torchlight, and a faint glow shone from the pagoda windows. Midnight came and went, but the guards did not relax, making it clear sleeping was unlikely. The group would have to try a different method: break through the pagoda wall. They still needed to find out if the priests inside were staying as close to their captive as the soldiers at the entrance. After a final discussion, the guide signaled he was ready, and, accompanied by the others, took a detour to approach the back of the pagoda. They reached the wall at about half past midnight, encountering no one. There were no guards, windows, or doors on this side. The night was extremely dark—the moon was nearly set and hidden by clouds, and the high trees made it even darker. Simply reaching the wall was not enough; they had to make a hole in it, equipped with only pocket-knives. Fortunately, the temple wall was made of brick and wood, which proved easy to break through. Once one brick was removed, the others could be pried out quickly. The Parsee and Passepartout quietly started making an opening about two feet wide, progressing quickly. Suddenly, a cry sounded from inside the temple, quickly echoed by others outside. Passepartout and the guide stopped, fearing they had been discovered and the alarm raised. Cautiously, the group withdrew into the woods and waited for the commotion to stop, prepared to try again as soon as possible. Unfortunately, the guards soon moved to the rear of the building and took up position there to prevent a surprise. The party felt deeply frustrated by this untimely interruption."

She seemed, having shaken off the stupor of intoxication, to be striving to escape from her executioner.

The figure, who appeared to be the revived rajah, turned to Sir Francis and Mr. Fogg and abruptly said, “Let’s go!” In reality, it was Passepartout in disguise, who had slipped onto the pyre through the smoke, using the darkness to save the young woman from death. With clever courage, Passepartout managed to move through the crowd while everyone was paralyzed by terror."

Passepartout immediately set out into the streets of Allahabad, known as the 'City of God,' a profoundly revered city in India situated where the two holy rivers, the Ganges and the Jumna, meet, drawing devotees from across the entire peninsula. According to the ancient tales of the Ramayana, the Ganges originated in the heavens before being brought down to Earth through Brahma's intervention. As he made his purchases, Passepartout made sure to thoroughly observe the city. It was once protected by a magnificent fort, now repurposed as a state penitentiary; its trade activities had diminished, and Passepartout fruitlessly searched for a market similar to the kind he frequented on Regent Street. Eventually, he encountered an old, ill-tempered Jewish man selling second-hand goods, from whom he acquired a dress made of Scotch fabric, a substantial cloak, and an excellent coat made of otter fur, for which he readily paid seventy-five pounds.

Her ebony brows have the form and charm of the bow of Kama, the god of love, and beneath her long silken lashes the purest reflections and a celestial light swim, as in the sacred lakes of Himalaya, in the black pupils of her great clear eyes. Her teeth, fine, equal, and white, glitter between her smiling lips like dewdrops in a passion-flower’s half-enveloped breast. Her delicately formed ears, her vermilion hands, her little feet, curved and tender as the lotus-bud, glitter with the brilliancy of the loveliest pearls of Ceylon, the most dazzling diamonds of Golconda. Her narrow and supple waist, which a hand may clasp around, sets forth the outline of her rounded figure and the beauty of her bosom, where youth in its flower displays the wealth of its treasures; and beneath the silken folds of her tunic she seems to have been modelled in pure silver by the godlike hand of Vicvarcarma, the immortal sculptor.”\nIt is enough to say, without applying this poetical rhapsody to Aouda, that she was a charming woman, in all the European acceptation of the phrase. She spoke English with great purity, and the guide had not exaggerated in saying that the young Parsee had been transformed by her bringing up.\nThe train was about to start from Allahabad, and Mr. Fogg proceeded to pay the guide the price agreed upon for his service, and not a farthing more; which astonished Passepartout, who remembered all that his master owed to the guide’s devotion. He had, indeed, risked his life in the adventure at Pillaji, and, if he should be caught afterwards by the Indians, he would with difficulty escape their vengeance. Kiouni, also, must be disposed of. What should be done with the elephant, which had been so dearly purchased? Phileas Fogg had already determined this question.\n“Parsee,” said he to the guide, “you have been serviceable and devoted. I have paid for your service, but not for your devotion. Would you like to have this elephant? He is yours.”\nThe guide’s eyes glistened.\n“Your honour is giving me a fortune!” cried he.\n“Take him, guide,” returned Mr. Fogg, “and I shall still be your debtor.”\n“Good!” exclaimed Passepartout. “Take him, friend. Kiouni is a brave and faithful beast.” And, going up to the elephant, he gave him several lumps of sugar, saying, “Here, Kiouni, here, here.”\nThe elephant grunted out his satisfaction, and, clasping Passepartout around the waist with his trunk, lifted him as high as his head. Passepartout, not in the least alarmed, caressed the animal, which replaced him gently on the ground.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The hold the priests of Pillaji had over Aouda gradually diminished, and she began to return to her true self, allowing the soft, distinctively Indian look to reappear in her beautiful eyes. The poet-king, Ucaf Uddaul, when praising the beauty of the queen of Ahmehnagara, wrote this: “Her lustrous hair, parted in two, frames the graceful shape of her fair and delicate cheeks, which glow with vibrancy and youth. Her dark eyebrows resemble the form and allure of Kama, the god of love’s bow, and beneath her long, silken eyelashes, pure reflections and a heavenly radiance shimmer, like in the sacred lakes of the Himalayas, within the dark centers of her large, bright eyes. Her teeth, fine, uniform, and white, glint between her smiling lips like dewdrops inside a passion-flower’s partially closed petals. Her finely shaped ears, her red-tinted hands, and her small feet, curved and soft like a lotus-bud, shine with the brilliance of the finest pearls from Ceylon and the most dazzling diamonds from Golconda. Her slim and flexible waist, which could be circled by a hand, accentuates the curve of her figure and the beauty of her chest, where youthful vitality reveals its abundance; and beneath the silk layers of her robe, she appears to have been sculpted from pure silver by the divine hand of Vicvarcarma, the immortal artist.” To state simply, without necessarily applying this extravagant poetic description to Aouda, she was, in the European sense of the word, a charming woman. She spoke English fluently and correctly, confirming the guide’s assertion that her upbringing had significantly changed the young Parsee woman. As the train was preparing to depart from Allahabad, Mr. Fogg proceeded to pay the guide the exact fee agreed upon for his services, no more, which surprised Passepartout, who recalled how much his master owed to the guide’s loyalty. He had, in fact, risked his life during the rescue at Pillaji, and if the Indians caught him afterward, he would likely face severe revenge. Kiouni, too, needed a plan. What would happen to the elephant, bought at such a high cost? Phileas Fogg had already decided this matter. “Parsee,” he told the guide, “you have been helpful and dedicated. I have compensated you for your service, but not for your devotion. Would you accept this elephant? He is yours.” The guide’s eyes lit up. “Your honor gives me a fortune!” he exclaimed. “Take him, guide,” Mr. Fogg replied, “and I shall still consider myself in your debt.” “Excellent!” cried Passepartout. “Take him, my friend. Kiouni is a courageous and loyal animal.” Approaching the elephant, he offered him several sugar lumps, saying, “Here, Kiouni, take these.” The elephant rumbled contentedly and, wrapping his trunk around Passepartout’s waist, lifted him up to the height of his head. Passepartout, completely unafraid, petted the animal, which then gently lowered him back to the ground.",

Her beautiful eyes regained their gentle Indian warmth.

Her white, even teeth sparkled between smiling lips like dew in a passion-flower; her ears, red hands, and tiny, curved feet gleamed with pearl and diamond-like brilliance. Her slender waist accentuated her graceful figure and youthful bosom, and beneath her tunic she seemed crafted from pure silver by Vicvarcarma, the immortal sculptor. Without comparing Aouda directly to this poetic description, it suffices to say she was utterly charming by European standards. She spoke perfect English, which justified the guide’s earlier comments about her upbringing. As the train prepared to leave Allahabad, Mr. Fogg paid the guide exactly the agreed fee, surprising Passepartout, who recalled how much the guide had risked for them. The guide had endangered his life and, if caught by the Indians, might face their vengeance. Then there was the issue of what to do with the expensive elephant, Kiouni. Fogg resolved the matter by addressing the guide: ‘Parsee, you have served faithfully. I’ve paid for your service, but not your dedication. Would you like the elephant? He’s yours.’ The guide was delighted, calling the elephant a fortune. Fogg insisted the gift left him still in the guide’s debt. Passepartout encouraged him to take Kiouni, calling the beast brave and loyal, and fed him sugar lumps. The elephant, pleased, lifted Passepartout gently with his trunk, then set him down softly."

Elephants were bathing in the waters of the sacred river, and groups of Indians, despite the advanced season and chilly air, were performing solemnly their pious ablutions. These were fervent Brahmins, the bitterest foes of Buddhism, their deities being Vishnu, the solar god, Shiva, the divine impersonation of natural forces, and Brahma, the supreme ruler of priests and legislators. What would these divinities think of India, anglicised as it is to-day, with steamers whistling and scudding along the Ganges, frightening the gulls which float upon its surface, the turtles swarming along its banks, and the faithful dwelling upon its borders?\nThe panorama passed before their eyes like a flash, save when the steam concealed it fitfully from the view; the travellers could scarcely discern the fort of Chupenie, twenty miles south-westward from Benares, the ancient stronghold of the rajahs of Behar; or Ghazipur and its famous rose-water factories; or the tomb of Lord Cornwallis, rising on the left bank of the Ganges; the fortified town of Buxar, or Patna, a large manufacturing and trading-place, where is held the principal opium market of India; or Monghir, a more than European town, for it is as English as Manchester or Birmingham, with its iron foundries, edgetool factories, and high chimneys puffing clouds of black smoke heavenward.\nNight came on; the train passed on at full speed, in the midst of the roaring of the tigers, bears, and wolves which fled before the locomotive; and the marvels of Bengal, Golconda ruined Gour, Murshedabad, the ancient capital, Burdwan, Hugly, and the French town of Chandernagor, where Passepartout would have been proud to see his country’s flag flying, were hidden from their view in the darkness.\nCalcutta was reached at seven in the morning, and the packet left for Hong Kong at noon; so that Phileas Fogg had five hours before him.\nAccording to his journal, he was due at Calcutta on the 25th of October, and that was the exact date of his actual arrival.

Elephants were seen bathing in the sacred river, and despite the late season and cool air, groups of Indians were solemnly performing their religious washing rites. These were devout Brahmins, fierce adversaries of Buddhism, whose gods included Vishnu, the solar deity, Shiva, the divine embodiment of natural power, and Brahma, the ultimate authority for priests and lawmakers. One wonders how these divinities would perceive today's India, influenced by British culture, with steamships traversing the Ganges, their whistles startling the gulls on the water's surface, turtles congregating along the banks, and the faithful residing near its shores. The landscape appeared like a fleeting image, sometimes momentarily obscured by steam. The passengers found it difficult to make out landmarks such as the fort of Chupenie, situated twenty miles southwest of Benares and historically the fort of the rajahs of Behar; or Ghazipur, known for its prominent rose-water production facilities; or the tomb of Lord Cornwallis, located on the left bank of the Ganges; the fortified settlement of Buxar; or Patna, a large centre for manufacturing and trade, hosting India's primary opium market; or Monghir, which seemed more European than many European towns, being as industrialized as Manchester or Birmingham with its iron foundries, tool factories, and tall chimneys emitting plumes of dark smoke upwards. Night descended; the train continued at high speed, amid the roars of tigers, bears, and wolves fleeing before the locomotive; and the notable locations of Bengal, including the ruined Gour (once Golconda), Murshedabad, the former capital, Burdwan, Hugly, and the French town of Chandernagor, where Passepartout would have been proud to see his nation's flag, were concealed from their sight by the darkness. They reached Calcutta at seven in the morning, and the steamship for Hong Kong departed at noon, leaving Phileas Fogg with five hours available. According to his diary, he was scheduled to arrive in Calcutta on October 25th, which was the precise date of his actual arrival. Thus, he was neither behind schedule nor ahead of it. The two days gained between London and Bombay had been consumed, as previously mentioned, during the transit across India.

Trying to hide her emotion, Aouda turned to Mr. Fogg and said, \"Sir, you must let me face the consequences alone. You are in this situation because you saved me.\" Phileas Fogg simply replied that this was out of the question. He found it hard to believe that he could be detained for stopping a suttee; he doubted the accusers would risk bringing such a claim. He was sure there had been a misunderstanding. Regardless, he insisted he would not leave Aouda behind and would see her safely to Hong Kong. \"But the steamer departs at noon!\" Passepartout said anxiously. \"We will be on the boat by noon,\" his master replied calmly. The certainty in Fogg’s voice made Passepartout mutter, \"Indeed, we’ll be on board before noon.\" Still, he was not comforted."

Immediately afterward, Judge Obadiah, a stout, round individual, entered, followed by the clerk.

Soon after, Judge Obadiah, a plump, round man, came in with the clerk. The judge quickly grabbed a wig from a hook and put it on, only to realize it wasn’t his. He exclaimed when he noticed the mistake, and the clerk clarified that it was his own wig. The judge commented on how difficult it was to rule wisely in a clerk’s wig, and they switched wigs. Meanwhile, Passepartout grew anxious as the clock above the judge seemed to move alarmingly fast. Judge Obadiah called for the first case again. The clerk, Mr. Oysterpuff, called for Phileas Fogg and Passepartout, who both responded. The judge noted that they had been sought for two days on the trains from Bombay. Passepartout impatiently asked what they were accused of, and the judge replied they would soon find out. Mr. Fogg insisted on his rights as a British subject, but the judge asked if he had been mistreated, to which Mr. Fogg said he had not. The judge then instructed for the complainants to be brought in."

The judge continued, stating that since English law strictly protects the religious practices of the Indian populace, and since Passepartout admitted to trespassing in the sacred pagoda on Malabar Hill in Bombay on October 20th, he sentenced Passepartout to a fifteen-day jail term and a fine of three hundred pounds. \"Three hundred pounds!\" Passepartout exclaimed, astonished by the large sum. \"Silence!\" the constable yelled.

The judge went on: given that there was no proof the master was unaware of the act, and since a master is liable for his servant's conduct, Mr. Fogg was sentenced to one week in jail and a fine of one hundred and fifty pounds. Fix, the detective, was pleased; a week’s delay in Calcutta would surely be enough for the warrant to arrive.

The judge noted that this sum would be returned upon their release, and that in the meantime, they were free on bail. “Let’s go,” Fogg told Passepartout, who complained, “At least let me have my shoes back!” as they were returned to him. “These are some very expensive shoes,” he muttered, “over a thousand pounds each—and they squeeze my feet.”"

If the arrest warrant arrived in time at Hong Kong, Fix could detain Fogg and hand him over to the local authorities, avoiding further complications. However, if Fogg got beyond Hong Kong, a simple warrant would not be effective; he would need an extradition warrant, which would only cause delays and give Fogg the chance to evade capture. While spending long hours alone in his cabin, Fix kept turning these scenarios over in his mind, repeatedly telling himself, \"Either the warrant will be in Hong Kong and I’ll arrest him, or it won’t be, and I must find a way to delay his departure. I’ve already failed in Bombay and Calcutta; if I fail again in Hong Kong, my career is ruined. Whatever it takes, I must succeed! But if delaying him becomes my only option, how can I possibly manage it?\""

But this method was a dangerous one, only to be employed when everything else had failed. A word from Passepartout to his master would ruin all. The detective was therefore in a sore strait. But suddenly a new idea struck him. The presence of Aouda on the “Rangoon,” in company with Phileas Fogg, gave him new material for reflection.\nWho was this woman? What combination of events had made her Fogg’s travelling companion? They had evidently met somewhere between Bombay and Calcutta; but where? Had they met accidentally, or had Fogg gone into the interior purposely in quest of this charming damsel? Fix was fairly puzzled. He asked himself whether there had not been a wicked elopement; and this idea so impressed itself upon his mind that he determined to make use of the supposed intrigue.

However, this was a risky strategy, to be used only when all else failed, as even a brief mention from Passepartout to his master could ruin everything. Consequently, the detective found himself in a difficult predicament. But then, a new thought occurred to him. Aouda's presence aboard the 'Rangoon' alongside Phileas Fogg provided fresh material for contemplation. Who was this woman? What circumstances had led her to become Fogg's travel partner? They had clearly met somewhere between Bombay and Calcutta, but precisely where? Had their meeting been accidental, or had Fogg intentionally ventured inland seeking this appealing young woman? Fix was genuinely bewildered. He contemplated if it wasn't perhaps an illicit elopement, and this notion took such a strong hold on him that he resolved to capitalize on the supposed affair. Whether the young woman was married or not, he believed he could create such significant obstacles for Mr. Fogg in Hong Kong that he wouldn't be able to escape, regardless of the sum of money he might offer.",

However, this was a risky strategy, only to be tried if all else failed, since a single word from Passepartout to Fogg would wreck Fix's plans. As Fix pondered these options, a new idea occurred to him: the fact that Aouda was traveling on the \"Rangoon\" with Phileas Fogg gave him new things to consider. He wondered who she was, how she had become Fogg's companion, and whether they had met by chance or if Fogg had specifically sought her out. Fix was confused and even considered if there had been a scandalous elopement, an idea that took root in his mind. He resolved to exploit this supposed intrigue, reasoning that, regardless of whether Aouda was married, he could find ways to cause trouble for Fogg in Hong Kong that no amount of money could solve."

Fix, who was familiar with the last events, seemed to be equally ignorant of all that Passepartout related; and the later was charmed to find so interested a listener.\n“But does your master propose to carry this young woman to Europe?”\n“Not at all.

Are you also making a journey around the world?” Fix answered that he was only going as far as Hong Kong, intending to stay there for a few days.

Fix explained that he had been seasick and confined to his bed, claiming the Gulf of Bengal didn’t agree with him as well as the Indian Ocean. Passepartout then reported that Mr. Fogg was as punctual as ever and mentioned there was a young woman traveling with them. Fix seemed confused, so Passepartout explained all about Aouda: her rescue from the pagoda in Bombay, the elephant they bought for £2,000, their capture, trial, and eventual release on bail in Calcutta. Although Fix already knew some of this, he pretended to hear it all for the first time, which gratified Passepartout. When asked if Fogg intended to bring Aouda to Europe, Passepartout clarified that the plan was just to bring her safely to a relative in Hong Kong.

It was really worth considering why this certainly very amiable and complacent person, whom he had first met at Suez, had then encountered on board the “Mongolia,” who disembarked at Bombay, which he announced as his destination, and now turned up so unexpectedly on the “Rangoon,” was following Mr. Fogg’s tracks step by step.

He never could have imagined that Phileas Fogg was being tracked as a robber around the globe. But, as it is in human nature to attempt the solution of every mystery, Passepartout suddenly discovered an explanation of Fix’s movements, which was in truth far from unreasonable.

He found it truly remarkable that this seemingly pleasant and agreeable individual, first encountered in Suez, then on the \"Mongolia,\" who had left the ship in Bombay, announcing it as his destination, was now unexpectedly present on the \"Rangoon,\" tracing Mr. Fogg's steps one by one. What exactly was Fix's purpose? Passepartout was ready to bet his carefully preserved Indian shoes that Fix would also depart from Hong Kong alongside them, likely on the very same steamer. Passepartout could have pondered for ages without figuring out the detective's actual objective. He could never have conceived that Phileas Fogg was being pursued globally as a robber. However, as it is inherent in human nature to seek answers to every puzzle, Passepartout abruptly arrived at an explanation for Fix's actions that, in truth, was far from implausible. Fix, he concluded, could only be an agent dispatched by Mr. Fogg's friends at the Reform Club, tasked with monitoring him and verifying that he was indeed traveling around the world as stipulated. \"It's crystal clear!\" the dedicated servant muttered to himself, proud of his insight. \"He's a surveillance agent sent to watch us!

Passepartout started to seriously wonder why Fix continued to follow the same route as his master. It seemed odd that this agreeable man, whom Passepartout had first met in Suez before running into him on the Mongolia, then seeing him disembark at Bombay—his stated destination—was now unexpectedly aboard the Rangoon, again mirroring Mr. Fogg’s journey. Passepartout suspected that Fix would also leave Hong Kong at the same moment as them, most likely even on the same boat, and was so confident in this that he would have bet his cherished Indian shoes on it. Yet, no matter how much Passepartout thought it over, he could never have guessed the real reason for Fix’s pursuit—that Fix was a detective following Fogg under suspicion of robbery. Still, driven by human curiosity, Passepartout eventually settled on a plausible explanation: he concluded that Fix must be a representative of Fogg’s associates at the Reform Club, tasked with making sure the journey around the world was actually completed as agreed. Feeling quite clever, Passepartout told himself, “Of course! He’s a spy put here to keep an eye on us! It’s not exactly right to be spying on Mr. Fogg, who is such an honorable gentleman.

Still, Passepartout looked forward to teasing Fix with vague hints—but without giving away his true doubts. On the afternoon of Wednesday, October 30th, the \"Rangoon\" sailed into the Strait of Malacca, which divides the Malay Peninsula from Sumatra. The island’s stunning scenery was hidden from the passengers by the steep, jagged islets. Early the next morning at four o'clock, the \"Rangoon\" stopped at Singapore to refuel with coal, having arrived half a day ahead of schedule. Phileas Fogg recorded this time gain in his log and, along with Aouda—who appeared eager for a walk on land—left the ship.

An agent of the Peninsular Company, you know, can’t stop on the way! You were only going to Bombay, and here you are in China. America is not far off, and from America to Europe is only a step.”\nFix looked intently at his companion, whose countenance was as serene as possible, and laughed with him.

Fix spent several hours turning these things over in his mind, sometimes thinking that all was lost, then persuading himself that Fogg was ignorant of his presence, and then undecided what course it was best to take.\nNevertheless, he preserved his coolness of mind, and at last resolved to deal plainly with Passepartout. If he did not find it practicable to arrest Fogg at Hong Kong, and if Fogg made preparations to leave that last foothold of English territory, he, Fix, would tell Passepartout all. Either the servant was the accomplice of his master, and in this case the master knew of his operations, and he should fail; or else the servant knew nothing about the robbery, and then his interest would be to abandon the robber.\nSuch was the situation between Fix and Passepartout.",

As an agent for the Peninsular Company, you can't possibly stop midway! You were only supposed to go to Bombay, and now you've reached China. America isn't far off, and getting from America to Europe is just a hop.\"\n\nFix scrutinized his companion, who maintained an utterly calm expression, and shared a laugh with him. However, Passepartout kept teasing him, inquiring if he earned a good living from his current occupation.\n\n\"It's a mixed bag,\" Fix responded; \"sometimes you do well, sometimes you don't. But you should know I'm not funding these travels myself.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm absolutely certain of that!\" exclaimed Passepartout, bursting into laughter.\n\nUtterly bewildered, Fix retreated to his cabin to ponder the situation.

Fix spent many hours mulling over these possibilities, at times believing he had failed, then convincing himself that Fogg was unaware of his presence, and then becoming indecisive about the best course of action.\n\nDespite this, he kept his composure and eventually resolved to be direct with Passepartout. If arresting Fogg in Hong Kong proved impractical, and if Fogg prepared to leave that last piece of British soil, Fix decided he would tell Passepartout everything. Either the servant was Fogg's accomplice, in which case Fogg would know about Fix's plan and he would fail; or the servant knew nothing about the theft, and then it would be in his best interest to abandon the person who committed the robbery.\n\nThis was the state of affairs between Fix and Passepartout.",

He jokingly asked Fix if they would lose his company when they reached Hong Kong. Fix replied, a bit flustered, that he wasn’t certain. Passepartout playfully suggested that Fix could keep traveling with them, hinting that although Fix was supposed to go only as far as Bombay, he’d somehow made it to China already—and America was just a short hop away.\n\nFix observed Passepartout closely, but the servant’s face showed only calm cheerfulness, even as he continued to poke fun by asking if Fix earned much in his current line of work. Fix admitted that his income varied, explaining that he didn’t travel at his own expense. Passepartout joked that he was sure of that, and laughed heartily.\n\nPerplexed, Fix retreated to his cabin to think things over. He was certain Passepartout suspected him of being a detective, but wondered whether Passepartout had told his master, Mr. Fogg. He puzzled over Passepartout’s role—was he helping Fogg, or was he unaware of the situation? Fix oscillated between believing that everything was lost because he’d been discovered, and convincing himself that Fogg was still unaware of his presence. He didn’t know what to do next.\n\nDespite these doubts, Fix stayed calm, eventually deciding to speak openly to Passepartout. If he couldn’t manage to arrest Fogg in Hong Kong, and Fogg was preparing to leave British territory, Fix would confess everything to Passepartout. If Passepartout was in on the secret, then Fogg already knew and Fix’s mission would fail; but if the servant was ignorant of the crime, it would be in his best interest to abandon a suspected criminal. \n\nThat summed up the current, uncertain relationship between Fix and Passepartout."

There was clearly no sign that the journey had aroused any sentiment in him, while poor Passepartout was perpetually lost in his own thoughts and fantasies. One day, as he leaned on the railing in the engine-room, observing the machinery, a sudden sway of the ship lifted the propeller out of the water. Steam loudly escaped the valves, which infuriated Passepartout. 'The valves aren't sufficiently loaded!' he exclaimed. 'We're making no speed! Oh, these English! If this were an American vessel, we might blow up, maybe, but we would certainly be moving faster!'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "During this time, Phileas Fogg maintained an air of calm detachment as he continued his systematic journey around the globe, seemingly unaffected by the people around him. There was, however, someone close by who could have stirred his feelings, as astronomers might refer to a disruptive celestial body—but Aouda's allure did not appear to influence Fogg, much to Passepartout's astonishment. Any possible emotional turmoil in Fogg would have been even harder to detect than the astronomical disturbances that led to the finding of Neptune. Each day, Passepartout was increasingly amazed as he noticed the deep gratitude in Aouda’s eyes for Fogg. Despite Fogg’s courage and courtesy, Passepartout believed his master must lack a heart, for there was no sign of any emotion stirred by their travels, while Passepartout himself was always lost in his thoughts. On one occasion, as Passepartout rested by the engine-room’s railing watching the machinery, a sudden lurch of the ship lifted the propeller out of the water, causing steam to whistle from the valves. This frustrated Passepartout, who complained, 'The valves aren’t charged enough! We’re not making progress. Oh, these English! If this were an American vessel, we might explode, but at least we’d be going faster!'"

The “Rangoon” rolled heavily and the passengers became impatient of the long, monstrous waves which the wind raised before their path. A sort of tempest arose on the 3rd of November, the squall knocking the vessel about with fury, and the waves running high. The “Rangoon” reefed all her sails, and even the rigging proved too much, whistling and shaking amid the squall. The steamer was forced to proceed slowly, and the captain estimated that she would reach Hong Kong twenty hours behind time, and more if the storm lasted.\nPhileas Fogg gazed at the tempestuous sea, which seemed to be struggling especially to delay him, with his habitual tranquillity. He never changed countenance for an instant, though a delay of twenty hours, by making him too late for the Yokohama boat, would almost inevitably cause the loss of the wager. But this man of nerve manifested neither impatience nor annoyance; it seemed as if the storm were a part of his programme, and had been foreseen. Aouda was amazed to find him as calm as he had been from the first time she saw him.\nFix did not look at the state of things in the same light. The storm greatly pleased him. His satisfaction would have been complete had the “Rangoon” been forced to retreat before the violence of wind and waves. Each delay filled him with hope, for it became more and more probable that Fogg would be obliged to remain some days at Hong Kong; and now the heavens themselves became his allies, with the gusts and squalls. It mattered not that they made him sea-sick—he made no account of this inconvenience; and, whilst his body was writhing under their effects, his spirit bounded with hopeful exultation.\nPassepartout was enraged beyond expression by the unpropitious weather. Everything had gone so well till now! Earth and sea had seemed to be at his master’s service; steamers and railways obeyed him; wind and steam united to speed his journey. Had the hour of adversity come? Passepartout was as much excited as if the twenty thousand pounds were to come from his own pocket. The storm exasperated him, the gale made him furious, and he longed to lash the obstinate sea into obedience. Poor fellow! Fix carefully concealed from him his own satisfaction, for, had he betrayed it, Passepartout could scarcely have restrained himself from personal violence.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "As the voyage neared its end, the weather turned severe. A persistent strong wind from the north-west blew a gale, slowing down the steamer \"Rangoon.\" The ship rolled violently, and passengers grew weary of the large, intimidating waves the wind created in their path. On November 3rd, a storm erupted, furiously battering the vessel, with waves running high. The \"Rangoon\" had to reduce all its sails, and even the rigging was stressed, whistling and shaking in the squall. The steamer was forced to proceed slowly, and the captain estimated they would reach Hong Kong at least twenty hours behind schedule, possibly longer if the storm continued. Phileas Fogg observed the stormy sea, which seemed deliberately hindering him, with his usual composure. His expression never wavered for a moment, despite a twenty-hour delay potentially causing him to miss the ship to Yokohama and almost certainly losing his wager. But this resolute man displayed neither impatience nor frustration; it was as if the storm was part of his plan and anticipated. Aouda was amazed to see him as calm as he had been since she first met him. Fix, however, saw the situation differently. He was greatly pleased by the storm. His satisfaction would have been complete if the \"Rangoon\" had been forced to turn back from the violent wind and waves. Each delay filled him with hope, making it increasingly likely that Fogg would have to stay in Hong Kong for several days; now, he felt the heavens themselves, with their gusts and squalls, were his allies. He paid no mind to the fact that they made him seasick—this inconvenience didn't matter to him; and while his body suffered from the effects, his spirit leaped with hopeful elation. Passepartout was incredibly angered by the unfortunate weather. Everything had gone so well until this point! It had seemed as though the land and sea were at his master's command; steamers and railways obeyed him; wind and steam combined to speed his journey. Had their luck run out? Passepartout was as agitated as if the twenty thousand pounds were coming out of his own pocket. The storm exasperated him, the gale enraged him, and he longed to force the stubborn sea into submission. The poor fellow! Fix carefully concealed his own satisfaction from him, knowing that if he revealed it, Passepartout would likely have resorted to physical violence.",

The 'Rangoon' was tossed around by the large waves, causing the passengers to grow restless as they endured the rough sea. On November 3rd, a full storm hit, violently shaking the ship and tossing it about as the waves grew even higher. The crew had to lower all sails, but even the ropes strained and whistled in the wind. The ship crawled forward slowly, and the captain predicted they would arrive in Hong Kong at least twenty hours late, or more if the storm continued.\n\nPhileas Fogg watched the raging sea calmly, as if the storm was just something he had expected. Although a delay of twenty hours might mean he would miss the boat to Yokohama and lose the bet, his face showed no emotion or frustration. Aouda was amazed at how composed he remained under such pressure, just as he had always been.\n\nOn the other hand, Fix was glad for the delay. He secretly hoped the storm would force the 'Rangoon' to turn back. With each hour lost, his hopes grew that Fogg would be stuck in Hong Kong for several days. Even though the rough seas made Fix seasick, he hardly noticed his discomfort because he was so encouraged by the delay.\n\nPassepartout, however, was furious with the bad weather. Everything had gone smoothly up until now, as if the world itself wanted to help his master. Now, he was upset and frustrated that such trouble had come. He was as anxious as if he were personally responsible for the twenty thousand pounds at stake. The raging sea made him wish he could force it to behave. Fix kept his delight hidden from Passepartout, knowing that if Passepartout found out, he might even try to attack him."

Mr. Fogg was, it is true, twenty-four hours behind his time; but this could not seriously imperil the remainder of his tour.\nThe steamer which crossed the Pacific from Yokohama to San Francisco made a direct connection with that from Hong Kong, and it could not sail until the latter reached Yokohama; and if Mr. Fogg was twenty-four hours late on reaching Yokohama, this time would no doubt be easily regained in the voyage of twenty-two days across the Pacific.

While Mr. Fogg was indeed twenty-four hours behind his original timeline, this delay wasn't anticipated to cause major problems for the rest of his round-the-world trip. The ship traversing the Pacific from Yokohama to San Francisco coordinated its departure with the arrival of the steamer from Hong Kong. Since the Pacific vessel wouldn't leave Yokohama until the Hong Kong ship arrived, Mr. Fogg's twenty-four-hour delay in reaching Yokohama was expected to be recovered without difficulty during the subsequent twenty-two-day Pacific crossing. Therefore, thirty-five days after setting off from London, he was running approximately twenty-four hours behind schedule.

It spread from the wealthy, its initial exclusive users, to the lower classes, after which its destructive effects became unstoppable.

Ah! that’s very good. But go on, go on. First, though, let me tell you that those gentlemen have put themselves to a useless expense.”\n“Useless!” said Fix. “You speak confidently. It’s clear that you don’t know how large the sum is.”\n“Of course I do,” returned Passepartout.",

They chatted about their trip, and Passepartout was particularly happy about the idea that Fix would continue the journey with them. However, once the bottles were empty, he got up to leave and inform his employer about the change in the departure time for the 'Carnatic' ship. Fix stopped him by grabbing his arm and asked him to wait a moment. Passepartout questioned the reason, and Fix explained that he wanted to have a serious conversation. \"A serious talk!\" Passepartout exclaimed, quickly finishing the last bit of wine in his glass. \"All right, we can discuss it tomorrow; I don't have time right now.\" Fix insisted, \"Stay! What I need to say concerns your master.\" Hearing this, Passepartout looked carefully at his companion. Fix's expression seemed unusual. He sat back down. \"What is it you have to say?\" Passepartout asked. Fix placed his hand on Passepartout's arm and, lowering his voice, asked, \"Have you figured out who I am?\" \"Of course!\" Passepartout replied with a smile. \"Then I'm going to tell you everything—\" Fix began. \"Now that I know everything, my friend!\" Passepartout interrupted. \"Ah, that's very good. But please go on. First, though, let me inform you that those individuals have incurred a pointless expense.\" \"Pointless!\" Fix repeated. \"You sound very confident.

After they finished the wine, Passepartout got up to inform his master about the change in the departure time of the \"Carnatic.\" Fix grabbed his arm and asked him to wait. Passepartout asked why, and Fix replied that he wanted to discuss something serious. Passepartout, finishing his wine, suggested postponing the conversation to the next day since he was in a hurry, but Fix insisted, saying it was about his master. This caught Passepartout's attention, so he sat back down and asked what Fix wanted to say. Fix put his hand on Passepartout's arm and lowered his voice, asking if Passepartout had figured out his identity. Passepartout, smiling, replied affirmatively. Fix then said he was going to tell him everything, to which Passepartout responded that he already knew, though he encouraged Fix to continue. Passepartout also mentioned that the gentlemen had spent their money unnecessarily. Fix questioned this belief, implying Passepartout didn't know the amount, but Passepartout confidently claimed he did."

Well, there’s all the more reason for not losing an instant,” he continued, getting up hastily.\nFix pushed Passepartout back in his chair, and resumed: “Fifty-five thousand pounds; and if I succeed, I get two thousand pounds. If you’ll help me, I’ll let you have five hundred of them.”\n“Help you?” cried Passepartout, whose eyes were standing wide open.\n“Yes; help me keep Mr. Fogg here for two or three days.”\n“Why, what are you saying? Those gentlemen are not satisfied with following my master and suspecting his honour, but they must try to put obstacles in his way! I blush for them!”\n“What do you mean?”\n“I mean that it is a piece of shameful trickery. They might as well waylay Mr. Fogg and put his money in their pockets!”\n“That’s just what we count on doing.”\n“It’s a conspiracy, then,” cried Passepartout, who became more and more excited as the liquor mounted in his head, for he drank without perceiving it. “A real conspiracy! And gentlemen, too. Bah!”\nFix began to be puzzled.\n“Members of the Reform Club!” continued Passepartout. “You must know, Monsieur Fix, that my master is an honest man, and that, when he makes a wager, he tries to win it fairly!”\n“But who do you think I am?” asked Fix, looking at him intently.\n“Parbleu! An agent of the members of the Reform Club, sent out here to interrupt my master’s journey. But, though I found you out some time ago, I’ve taken good care to say nothing about it to Mr. Fogg.”\n“He knows nothing, then?”\n“Nothing,” replied Passepartout, again emptying his glass.\nThe detective passed his hand across his forehead, hesitating before he spoke again. What should he do? Passepartout’s mistake seemed sincere, but it made his design more difficult. It was evident that the servant was not the master’s accomplice, as Fix had been inclined to suspect.\n“Well,” said the detective to himself, “as he is not an accomplice, he will help me.”\nHe had no time to lose: Fogg must be detained at Hong Kong, so he resolved to make a clean breast of it.\n“Listen to me,” said Fix abruptly. “I am not, as you think, an agent of the members of the Reform Club—”\n“Bah!” retorted Passepartout, with an air of raillery.\n“I am a police detective, sent out here by the London office.”\n“You, a detective?”\n“I will prove it. Here is my commission.”\nPassepartout was speechless with astonishment when Fix displayed this document, the genuineness of which could not be doubted.\n“Mr. Fogg’s wager,” resumed Fix, “is only a pretext, of which you and the gentlemen of the Reform are dupes. He had a motive for securing your innocent complicity.”\n“But why?”\n“Listen. On the 28th of last September a robbery of fifty-five thousand pounds was committed at the Bank of England by a person whose description was fortunately secured. Here is his description; it answers exactly to that of Mr. Phileas Fogg.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Fix responded, boosting the amount, 'Fifty-five thousand!' while squeezing his companion's hand. The Frenchman exclaimed, 'What! Mr. Fogg dared bet fifty-five thousand pounds! Well, that's even more reason to not waste a second,' he added, quickly standing up. Fix gently pushed Passepartout back into his seat and reiterated, 'Fifty-five thousand pounds; and if I succeed, I get two thousand pounds. If you help me, I'll give you five hundred.' 'Help you?' cried Passepartout, eyes wide in disbelief. 'Yes; help me detain Mr. Fogg here for a couple of days.' 'What are you talking about?' Passepartout questioned. 'Those gentlemen aren't content with just following my master and doubting his character, they must also try to obstruct him! I'm ashamed of them!' 'What exactly do you mean?' Fix asked. 'I mean it's a disgracefully deceptive tactic. They might as well ambush Mr. Fogg and steal his money directly!' 'That's precisely what we're planning,' Fix confirmed. 'It's a conspiracy, then,' declared Passepartout, his agitation growing as the alcohol, which he was consuming without realizing, took effect. 'A genuine conspiracy! And by gentlemen, no less! Ridiculous!' Fix started to feel perplexed. 'Members of the Reform Club!' Passepartout continued. 'You should know, Monsieur Fix, that my master is an honorable man, and when he makes a bet, he aims to win fairly!' 'But who do you think I am?' Fix inquired, looking intently at him. 'Heavens! An agent of the Reform Club members, sent here to sabotage my master's journey. But, although I figured you out a while ago, I've been careful not to mention it to Mr. Fogg.' 'He knows nothing, then?' Fix pressed. 'Nothing,' Passepartout replied, draining his glass again. The detective rubbed his forehead, pausing before speaking further. What was his next move? Passepartout's misinterpretation seemed genuine, but it complicated his plan. It was clear the servant wasn't his master's accomplice, a possibility Fix had considered. 'Well,' the detective thought to himself, 'since he's not an accomplice, he'll assist me.' He couldn't afford delay; Fogg had to be held in Hong Kong. So he decided to reveal the truth. 'Listen to me,' Fix stated abruptly. 'I am not, as you believe, an agent for the Reform Club members—' 'Nonsense!' Passepartout scoffed dismissively. 'I am a police detective, dispatched here by the London office.' 'You, a detective?' Passepartout reacted. 'I'll prove it. Here is my official papers.' Passepartout was left utterly speechless in shock as Fix presented the document, whose authenticity was undeniable. 'Mr. Fogg's wager,' Fix resumed, 'is merely a cover story. You and the Reform Club gentlemen have been misled. He needed your unwitting involvement for a specific reason.' 'But why?' Passepartout asked. 'Listen. On the 28th of last September, fifty-five thousand pounds were stolen from the Bank of England by someone whose appearance was fortunately recorded. Here is the description; it matches Mr. Phileas Fogg exactly.'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"Twenty thousand pounds.\" \n\"Fifty-five thousand!\" Fix replied, gripping his companion’s hand tightly. \n\"What!\" exclaimed the Frenchman. \"Did Mr. Fogg actually risk fifty-five thousand pounds? Then it’s even more urgent that we act quickly,\" he said, rising suddenly. \nFix pulled Passepartout back into his seat and continued, \"Fifty-five thousand pounds. And if I succeed, I’ll receive two thousand pounds myself. If you’ll assist me, I’ll give you five hundred.\" \n\"Help you?\" Passepartout exclaimed, his eyes wide with disbelief. \n\"Yes; help me delay Mr. Fogg here for two or three days.\" \n\"What are you talking about? It's not enough for those gentlemen to follow my master and cast doubt on his integrity, now they also want to hinder him! I am ashamed for them!\" \n\"What do you mean?\" \n\"I mean it’s a disgraceful scheme. They might as well rob Mr. Fogg themselves!\" \n\"That’s essentially our plan,\" Fix said. \n\"A conspiracy, then!\" cried Passepartout, growing angrier as he unknowingly drank more. \"A real conspiracy! And men who call themselves gentlemen. Ridiculous!\" \nFix began to feel confused. \n\"Members of the Reform Club!\" Passepartout continued. \"You should know, Monsieur Fix, that my master is an honest man, and when he makes a wager, he plays by the rules!\" \n\"Who do you think I am?\" Fix asked, scrutinizing him. \n\"Why, clearly, you’re an agent for the Reform Club, sent to interfere with my master’s journey. I figured you out a while ago, but I’ve taken care not to mention it to Mr. Fogg.\" \n\"So he knows nothing?\" \n\"Nothing,\" Passepartout replied, draining his glass again. \nFix passed his hand over his forehead, unsure how to proceed. Passepartout seemed genuinely mistaken, which made Fix’s task harder. It was clear now that the servant was not Mr. Fogg’s accomplice, contrary to Fix’s original suspicion. \n\"Well,\" Fix thought, \"since he’s not in on it, he might help me.\" He knew he couldn’t waste time—Fogg had to be stopped in Hong Kong, so he decided to confess everything. \n\"Listen to me carefully,\" Fix said impatiently. \"I’m not, as you think, a Reform Club agent—\" \n\"Nonsense!\" interrupted Passepartout mockingly. \n\"I’m a police detective, sent here by the London force.\" \n\"You, a detective?\" \n\"I’ll prove it. Here is my commission.\" \nPassepartout was stunned into silence when Fix produced his credentials, which were clearly legitimate. \n\"Mr. Fogg’s wager,\" Fix continued, \"is just a cover—you and the Reform gentlemen are being deceived. He needed your innocent help for his own purposes.\" \n\"But why?\" \n\"I’ll explain. On September 28th, fifty-five thousand pounds was stolen from the Bank of England by a man whose description was recorded. That description matches Mr. Phileas Fogg exactly.\""

You went into his service the day he came away; and he came away on a foolish pretext, without trunks, and carrying a large amount in banknotes. And yet you are bold enough to assert that he is an honest man!”\n“Yes, yes,” repeated the poor fellow, mechanically.\n“Would you like to be arrested as his accomplice?”\nPassepartout, overcome by what he had heard, held his head between his hands, and did not dare to look at the detective. Phileas Fogg, the saviour of Aouda, that brave and generous man, a robber! And yet how many presumptions there were against him! Passepartout essayed to reject the suspicions which forced themselves upon his mind; he did not wish to believe that his master was guilty.\n“Well, what do you want of me?” said he, at last, with an effort.\n“See here,” replied Fix; “I have tracked Mr. Fogg to this place, but as yet I have failed to receive the warrant of arrest for which I sent to London. You must help me to keep him here in Hong Kong—”\n“I! But I—”\n“I will share with you the two thousand pounds reward offered by the Bank of England.”\n“Never!” replied Passepartout, who tried to rise, but fell back, exhausted in mind and body.\n“Mr. Fix,” he stammered, “even should what you say be true—if my master is really the robber you are seeking for—which I deny—I have been, am, in his service; I have seen his generosity and goodness; and I will never betray him—not for all the gold in the world. I come from a village where they don’t eat that kind of bread!”\n“You refuse?”\n“I refuse.”\n“Consider that I’ve said nothing,” said Fix; “and let us drink.”\n“Yes; let us drink!”\nPassepartout felt himself yielding more and more to the effects of the liquor. Fix, seeing that he must, at all hazards, be separated from his master, wished to entirely overcome him. Some pipes full of opium lay upon the table. Fix slipped one into Passepartout’s hand. He took it, put it between his lips, lit it, drew several puffs, and his head, becoming heavy under the influence of the narcotic, fell upon the table.\n“At last!” said Fix, seeing Passepartout unconscious. “Mr. Fogg will not be informed of the ‘Carnatic’s’ departure; and, if he is, he will have to go without this cursed Frenchman!”\nAnd, after paying his bill, Fix left the tavern.",

You hardly know him. You only started working for him the day he left; and he departed on a flimsy excuse, without luggage, carrying a large amount of cash. Despite this, you confidently claim he is honest!”\n“Yes, absolutely,” the bewildered man repeated automatically.\n“Would you be willing to be arrested as his accomplice?”\nOverwhelmed by these words, Passepartout buried his face in his hands, afraid to look at the detective. Phileas Fogg, the one who saved Aouda, that courageous and kind individual, a thief! Yet, there were so many things pointing to his guilt! Passepartout tried to dismiss the suspicions creeping into his mind; he desperately wanted to believe his master was innocent.\n“Alright, what do you want from me?” he finally asked with difficulty.\n“Listen,” Fix responded; “I’ve traced Mr. Fogg here, but I haven’t yet received the arrest warrant I requested from London. You must help me keep him here in Hong Kong—”\n“Me! But I—”\n“I will give you half of the two thousand pounds reward offered by the Bank of England.”\n“Never!” declared Passepartout, attempting to stand but collapsing back down, utterly drained mentally and physically.\n“Mr. Fix,” he stuttered, “even if what you say were true—if my master is indeed the criminal you’re after—which I don’t believe—I have been, and still am, in his service; I have witnessed his generosity and kindness; and I will never betray him—not for all the money in the world.

Fix, realizing he absolutely had to keep Passepartout separate from his master, decided to incapacitate him completely. Some opium pipes were lying on the table. Fix discreetly put one into Passepartout’s hand. Passepartout took it, placed it to his lips, lit it, inhaled several times, and his head, heavy from the drug, slumped onto the table.\n“Finally!” Fix exclaimed, seeing Passepartout unconscious. “Mr. Fogg won’t be told about the ‘Carnatic’s’ departure; and even if he finds out, he’ll have to leave without this annoying Frenchman!”\nAfter settling his bill, Fix departed the establishment.",

The idea that Phileas Fogg, Aouda's rescuer—so brave and kind—might be a thief was unthinkable. Still, there seemed to be plenty of reasons for suspicion. Passepartout struggled to push away the doubts creeping into his mind; he did not want to accept that his master might be guilty.\n\"So, what do you want me to do?\" he finally asked, mustering his strength.\n\"Listen,\" Fix answered, \"I've followed Mr. Fogg here, but I'm still waiting for the arrest warrant from London. You must help me keep him in Hong Kong—\"\n\"Me? But—\"\n\"I'll split the £2,000 reward from the Bank of England with you.\"\n\"Never!\" Passepartout said, trying to stand but sinking back, drained and overwhelmed.\n\"Mr. Fix,\" he said haltingly, \"even if what you say is true—even if my master is the robber you seek, though I deny it—I've worked for him, seen his kindness, and I will never betray him. Not for any amount of money! I come from a place where people don't do such things.\"\n\"So you refuse?\"\n\"I refuse.\"\n\"Let's pretend this conversation never happened,\" Fix said, \"and have a drink.\"\n\"Yes, let's drink!\"\nPassepartout felt more and more affected by the alcohol. Fix, determined to separate him from his master at all costs, needed to finish the job. He slipped a pipe full of opium to Passepartout, who accepted it, lit it, took a few puffs, and then, succumbing to the drug, collapsed on the table.\n\"At last!\" said Fix, seeing Passepartout unconscious. \"Mr. Fogg won't find out about the Carnatic's departure; and even if he does, he'll have to go without this troublesome Frenchman!\"\nFix paid for the drinks and left the tavern."

He completed his shopping with his usual calm and always answered Aouda’s objections—she was both bewildered and grateful for his patience and kindness—by saying, “It’s part of my plan and necessary for my trip.” After finishing their shopping, they went back to their hotel, enjoyed an elegant dinner, and then Aouda, following English custom, shook Fogg’s hand and went to her room to rest. Meanwhile, Mr. Fogg spent his evening reading the Times and the Illustrated London News."

Besides, we could not reach Yokohama in time, for it is sixteen hundred and sixty miles from Hong Kong.”\n“Only sixteen hundred,” said Mr. Fogg.\n“It’s the same thing.”\nFix breathed more freely.\n“But,” added the pilot, “it might be arranged another way.”\nFix ceased to breathe at all.\n“How?” asked Mr. Fogg.\n“By going to Nagasaki, at the extreme south of Japan, or even to Shanghai, which is only eight hundred miles from here. In going to Shanghai we should not be forced to sail wide of the Chinese coast, which would be a great advantage, as the currents run northward, and would aid us.”\n“Pilot,” said Mr. Fogg, “I must take the American steamer at Yokohama, and not at Shanghai or Nagasaki.”\n“Why not?” returned the pilot. “The San Francisco steamer does not start from Yokohama. It puts in at Yokohama and Nagasaki, but it starts from Shanghai.”\n“You are sure of that?”\n“Perfectly.”\n“And when does the boat leave Shanghai?”\n“On the 11th, at seven in the evening. We have, therefore, four days before us, that is ninety-six hours; and in that time, if we had good luck and a south-west wind, and the sea was calm, we could make those eight hundred miles to Shanghai.”\n“And you could go—”\n“In an hour; as soon as provisions could be got aboard and the sails put up.”\n“It is a bargain. Are you the master of the boat?”\n“Yes; John Bunsby, master of the ‘Tankadere.’”\n“Would you like some earnest-money?”\n“If it would not put your honour out—”\n“Here are two hundred pounds on account sir,” added Phileas Fogg, turning to Fix, “if you would like to take advantage—”\n“Thanks, sir; I was about to ask the favour.”",

The sailor asked if it was for a short excursion, to which Fogg replied it was for a voyage to Yokohama. Surprised, the sailor leaned on the railing and asked if Fogg was serious. Fogg explained that he had missed the 'Carnatic' and needed to reach Yokohama by the 14th at the latest to catch the San Francisco steamer. The sailor initially stated it was impossible, expressing regret. Fogg then offered a fee of one hundred pounds per day, plus a bonus of two hundred pounds if they arrived in Yokohama on time. The sailor, clearly considering the large sum but hesitant about the long journey, walked away briefly, gazing out at the sea, a moment of intense suspense for Fix, who was observing. Fogg turned to Aouda, asking if she would be afraid, to which she replied, 'Not with you, Mr. Fogg.' The pilot returned, fiddling with his hat, and stated that he couldn't risk his crew or his small, twenty-ton boat on such a long voyage at that time of year, adding that reaching Yokohama, which he estimated was sixteen hundred and sixty miles away, in time was impossible. Fogg corrected him, saying it was only sixteen hundred miles, but the pilot maintained it was the same problem. Fix felt a sense of relief. However, the pilot then added that another arrangement might be possible, causing Fix's relief to vanish. Fogg asked how, and the pilot suggested sailing instead to Nagasaki, in southern Japan, or even Shanghai, which was only eight hundred miles away. He noted that sailing to Shanghai would allow them to stay closer to the Chinese coast, benefiting from the northward currents. Fogg insisted he needed to catch the American steamer in Yokohama, not Shanghai or Nagasaki. The pilot corrected him, explaining that the San Francisco steamer actually departed from Shanghai, making stops in Yokohama and Nagasaki. Fogg confirmed this information was accurate. The pilot added that the ship left Shanghai on the 11th at 7 p.m., giving them four days, or ninety-six hours, to cover the eight hundred miles to Shanghai, which was feasible with good luck, a southwest wind, and calm seas. Fogg asked how soon they could depart, and the pilot replied in an hour, once provisions and sails were ready. Fogg agreed, asking if the pilot was the boat's master.

The sailor confidently replied that boat number 43, a pilot-boat reputed to be the best in the harbor, was ready, capable of speeds between eight and nine knots per hour, and offered to let Fogg inspect it. Fogg agreed and explained his need was not for a short sea trip, but for a longer voyage. The sailor was surprised when Fogg requested to be taken all the way to Yokohama. Fogg explained he had missed the ‘Carnatic’ and needed to reach Yokohama by the 14th at the latest to board a ship to San Francisco, offering the sailor generous payment—one hundred pounds per day and a bonus of two hundred pounds for timely arrival. The sailor hesitated, torn between the lucrative offer and the dangers of such a long journey in his small vessel. Fogg reassured his companion, Aouda, who confirmed she had no fear traveling with him. The sailor explained he could not risk such a voyage in his small, twenty-ton boat, emphasizing the considerable distance of 1,660 miles to Yokohama and the improbability of arriving on time. However, he proposed an alternative—sailing to Nagasaki or, more feasibly, Shanghai, which was only 800 miles away and easier to reach due to favorable currents near the coast. Fogg insisted he must catch the American steamship departing from Yokohama, but the sailor corrected him, saying the ship actually originated from Shanghai and only stopped at Yokohama and Nagasaki. The sailor assured Fogg the steamer left Shanghai on the 11th at seven in the evening, giving them four days—or 96 hours—to make the journey, which was possible with favorable winds and weather. The sailor, introducing himself as John Bunsby, the master of the ‘Tankadere,’ agreed to prepare immediately.

John Bunsby, himself, a man of forty-five or thereabouts, vigorous, sunburnt, with a sprightly expression of the eye, and energetic and self-reliant countenance, would have inspired confidence in the most timid.\nPhileas Fogg and Aouda went on board, where they found Fix already installed. Below deck was a square cabin, of which the walls bulged out in the form of cots, above a circular divan; in the centre was a table provided with a swinging lamp. The accommodation was confined, but neat.\n“I am sorry to have nothing better to offer you,” said Mr. Fogg to Fix, who bowed without responding.\nThe detective had a feeling akin to humiliation in profiting by the kindness of Mr. Fogg.\n“It’s certain,” thought he, “though rascal as he is, he is a polite one!”\nThe sails and the English flag were hoisted at ten minutes past three. Mr. Fogg and Aouda, who were seated on deck, cast a last glance at the quay, in the hope of espying Passepartout. Fix was not without his fears lest chance should direct the steps of the unfortunate servant, whom he had so badly treated, in this direction; in which case an explanation the reverse of satisfactory to the detective must have ensued. But the Frenchman did not appear, and, without doubt, was still lying under the stupefying influence of the opium.\nJohn Bunsby, master, at length gave the order to start, and the “Tankadere,” taking the wind under her brigantine, foresail, and standing-jib, bounded briskly forward over the waves.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“Alright. We will board in half an hour.”\n“But what about poor Passepartout?” asked Aouda, clearly upset by the servant's absence.\n“I will spare no effort in searching for him,” Phileas Fogg replied.\nWhile Fix, in a visibly anxious state, hurried to the pilot boat, the others made their way to the police station in Hong Kong. There, Phileas Fogg provided a description of Passepartout and left a sum of money to fund the search. After completing the same procedure at the French consulate and stopping at the hotel via palanquin to retrieve their luggage, which had been sent back, they returned to the dock.\nIt was now three o'clock. Pilot boat number 43, fully crewed and provisioned, was ready to set sail.\nThe “Tankadere” was a tidy little vessel of twenty tons, built with the sleek lines of a racing yacht. Her gleaming copper bottom, galvanized iron fittings, and deck, as white as ivory, showcased John Bunsby's pride in maintaining her appearance. Her two masts tilted slightly aft; she was equipped with a brigantine, foresail, storm-jib, and standing-jib, ideally rigged for running with the wind. She looked capable of significant speed, a fact confirmed by her victories in past pilot-boat races. The crew of the “Tankadere” consisted of John Bunsby, the captain, and four seasoned sailors familiar with the Chinese seas. John Bunsby himself, a man of approximately forty-five years, robust, sun-tanned, with lively eyes and a determined, self-assured face, would have instilled confidence in anyone, even the most timid.\nPhileas Fogg and Aouda came aboard, finding Fix already settled. Below deck was a square cabin whose walls curved outwards to form berths above a circular sofa. A table with a suspended lamp occupied the center. The space was limited but tidy.\n“I regret having nothing better to offer you,” Mr. Fogg said to Fix, who bowed silently.\nThe detective felt a sense of humiliation benefiting from Mr. Fogg’s generosity. \"It's certain,\" he mused, \"even though he's a scoundrel, he's a courteous one!\"\nThe sails were hoisted and the English flag raised at ten minutes past three. Mr. Fogg and Aouda, seated on deck, took a final look at the quay, hoping to catch sight of Passepartout. Fix harbored fears that the unfortunate servant, whom he had treated so poorly, might by chance appear, leading to an explanation that would be far from favorable for the detective. However, the Frenchman did not show up, undoubtedly still under the numbing effects of the opium.\nJohn Bunsby, the captain, finally gave the command to depart, and the “Tankadere,” catching the wind in her brigantine, foresail, and standing-jib, leaped forward over the waves with brisk speed.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"All right. We'll board the ship in half an hour,\" said Fogg. \n\nAouda, worried about their missing companion, asked anxiously about Passepartout. Fogg reassured her, \"I'll do everything I can to find him.\" \n\nMeanwhile, a tense and agitated Fix headed to the pilot-boat, while Fogg and Aouda made their way to the Hong Kong police station. There, Fogg left a description of Passepartout, along with some money to aid the search. They then followed the same procedure at the French consulate. Once they'd stopped by the hotel to retrieve their luggage, they headed back to the wharf.\n\nBy 3 o'clock, pilot-boat No. 43 was fully supplied and ready to set sail. The 'Tankadere' was a stylish twenty-ton vessel, built as elegantly as a racing yacht. Its polished copper and glimmering ironwork, with a deck white as ivory, showed John Bunsby's careful upkeep. The boat was equipped with two slightly raked masts, carrying a brigantine, foresail, storm-jib, and standing-jib – all suited for speedy sailing. Indeed, she had already proven her speed in pilot-boat competitions. The crew of the 'Tankadere' included John Bunsby, her captain, and four seasoned sailors who knew the Chinese waters well. Bunsby himself, robust and weather-beaten, exuded energy and self-confidence, inspiring trust even in the most anxious passengers.\n\nFogg and Aouda boarded and found Fix already aboard. Below deck was a compact but well-kept square cabin, with cots built into the wall above a round divan, and a central table with a swinging lamp. \"I regret that I can't offer you better accommodations,\" Fogg told Fix, who replied with a silent bow, feeling somewhat humbled by Fogg's generosity. \"Even if he's a scoundrel, he is a courteous one,\" Fix reflected.\n\nAt ten minutes after three, the sails were raised and the British flag unfurled. Seated on deck, Fogg and Aouda looked back at the quay, still hoping to catch sight of Passepartout. Fix worried that the missing man might materialize and that an uncomfortable confrontation would follow, since Fix had treated him poorly. However, Passepartout did not show up, likely still unconscious from the opium.\n\nAt last, John Bunsby gave the command, and the 'Tankadere' caught the wind in her sails and sped swiftly across the waves."

          "text_segment": "This voyage of eight hundred miles was a perilous venture on a craft of twenty tons, and at that season of the year. The Chinese seas are usually boisterous, subject to terrible gales of wind, and especially during the equinoxes; and it was now early November.\nIt would clearly have been to the master’s advantage to carry his passengers to Yokohama, since he was paid a certain sum per day; but he would have been rash to attempt such a voyage, and it was imprudent even to attempt to reach Shanghai. But John Bunsby believed in the “Tankadere,” which rode on the waves like a seagull; and perhaps he was not wrong.\nLate in the day they passed through the capricious channels of Hong Kong, and the “Tankadere,” impelled by favourable winds, conducted herself admirably.\n“I do not need, pilot,” said Phileas Fogg, when they got into the open sea, “to advise you to use all possible speed.”\n“Trust me, your honour. We are carrying all the sail the wind will let us. The poles would add nothing, and are only used when we are going into port.”\n“It’s your trade, not mine, pilot, and I confide in you.”\nPhileas Fogg, with body erect and legs wide apart, standing like a sailor, gazed without staggering at the swelling waters. The young woman, who was seated aft, was profoundly affected as she looked out upon the ocean, darkening now with the twilight, on which she had ventured in so frail a vessel. Above her head rustled the white sails, which seemed like great white wings. The boat, carried forward by the wind, seemed to be flying in the air.\nNight came. The moon was entering her first quarter, and her insufficient light would soon die out in the mist on the horizon. Clouds were rising from the east, and already overcast a part of the heavens.\nThe pilot had hung out his lights, which was very necessary in these seas crowded with vessels bound landward; for collisions are not uncommon occurrences, and, at the speed she was going, the least shock would shatter the gallant little craft.\nFix, seated in the bow, gave himself up to meditation. He kept apart from his fellow-travellers, knowing Mr. Fogg’s taciturn tastes; besides, he did not quite like to talk to the man whose favours he had accepted. He was thinking, too, of the future. It seemed certain that Fogg would not stop at Yokohama, but would at once take the boat for San Francisco; and the vast extent of America would ensure him impunity and safety. Fogg’s plan appeared to him the simplest in the world. Instead of sailing directly from England to the United States, like a common villain, he had traversed three quarters of the globe, so as to gain the American continent more surely; and there, after throwing the police off his track, he would quietly enjoy himself with the fortune stolen from the bank. But, once in the United States, what should he, Fix, do? Should he abandon this man? No, a hundred times no! Until he had secured his extradition, he would not lose sight of him for an hour. It was his duty, and he would fulfil it to the end. At all events, there was one thing to be thankful for; Passepartout was not with his master; and it was above all important, after the confidences Fix had imparted to him, that the servant should never have speech with his master.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Traveling eight hundred miles in this twenty-ton boat during this period of the year was a dangerous undertaking. The seas around China are often rough, experiencing violent storms, particularly during the equinoxes; it was currently early November. It would have been beneficial for the captain to take his passengers to Yokohama, as he earned a daily rate; however, attempting such a journey would have been reckless, and even trying to get to Shanghai was ill-advised. Yet, John Bunsby had faith in the \"Tankadere,\" which sailed over the waves as gracefully as a seagull, and perhaps his confidence was justified. Later that day, they navigated the unpredictable waterways of Hong Kong, and with the help of favourable winds, the \"Tankadere\" performed excellently. Once they were in the open ocean, Phileas Fogg remarked to the pilot, \"I don't need to tell you to go as fast as you can.\" The pilot replied, \"Trust me, sir. We have as much sail up as the wind allows. The poles wouldn't help at all and are only for entering harbour.\" Fogg responded, \"This is your profession, not mine, pilot, and I trust your judgment.\" Phileas Fogg, standing steadily like a sailor with his body upright and legs apart, watched the rising waves without losing his balance. The young woman, sitting at the back of the boat, was deeply moved as she looked at the ocean, which was now growing dark with the evening light, realizing she had set out on it in such a fragile boat. Above her, the white sails rustled, appearing like huge white wings. Carried by the wind, the boat seemed to be soaring through the air. As night fell, the moon was just starting its first quarter phase, and its weak light would soon vanish into the mist on the horizon. Clouds were forming in the east, already covering a portion of the sky. The pilot had put up his lights, which was essential in these waters busy with ships heading towards shore. Collisions were frequent occurrences, and given the speed of their boat, even a minor impact could destroy the brave little vessel. Fix sat in the front of the boat, lost in thought. He stayed separate from the others, aware of Mr. Fogg's quiet nature; additionally, he felt awkward speaking to the person from whom he had accepted help. He was also contemplating what lay ahead. It seemed clear that Fogg wouldn't pause in Yokohama but would immediately board a ship for San Francisco. The sheer size of America would guarantee him freedom from capture and safety. Fix saw Fogg's strategy as astonishingly simple. Instead of sailing directly from England to the US, like a typical criminal, he had traveled three-quarters of the world to reach the American continent more reliably. Once there, after evading the authorities, he could comfortably live on the money stolen from the bank. But what should Fix do once they reached the United States? Should he leave this man? Absolutely not, never! He decided he would not let Fogg out of his sight for a moment until he could arrange his extradition. This was his obligation, and he intended to see it through. However, there was one positive aspect: Passepartout was not with his employer. It was critically important, especially after the personal information Fix had shared with him, that the servant and master not speak to each other.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The journey of eight hundred miles was a dangerous undertaking on a twenty-ton boat, particularly given the season. The Chinese seas are normally rough and prone to violent storms, especially around the time of the equinoxes, and it was now early November. It would have benefited the captain financially to take his passengers all the way to Yokohama, since he earned a daily rate, but trying such a journey would have been reckless, and even making for Shanghai was risky. However, John Bunsby had faith in the “Tankadere,” which handled the waves gracefully like a seagull—perhaps his confidence was justified. Late in the day, they navigated the unpredictable waterways around Hong Kong, and, driven by favorable winds, the “Tankadere” performed excellently. Once in open water, Phileas Fogg told the pilot he wanted maximum speed. The pilot assured him they were using as much sail as possible; the poles were only needed for docking. Fogg relied on the pilot's expertise. Standing firm on the pitching deck like a true sailor, Fogg looked steadily at the rolling sea. The young woman at the back of the boat was deeply moved by the sight of the darkening ocean, which she was braving in such a small vessel. Above her, the white sails rustled like giant wings, and the boat, powered by the wind, seemed almost to fly. Night fell; the moon was in its first quarter and would soon disappear behind mist at the horizon. Clouds from the east began to cover the sky. The pilot put out navigation lights, which was crucial in these crowded waters, as collisions were common and any accident at their speed would destroy the little ship. Fix, sitting alone at the bow, was lost in thought. He kept away from the others, aware of Fogg’s reserved nature and uneasy about their relationship, since he had accepted Fogg's hospitality. He was pondering the future, thinking that Fogg would probably head straight for San Francisco from Yokohama, using the vastness of America as a shield. To Fix, Fogg's plan seemed simple: instead of a direct voyage from England to America, he travelled around the world to reach the continent more surely, losing the pursuing police and then enjoying the stolen fortune. However, Fix resolved that he would not abandon Fogg until he had secured his extradition. This, he felt, was his duty and he would see it through. At least there was the consolation that Passepartout was not with his master; after what Fix had confided to him, it was vital that the servant not have a chance to speak with Fogg."

They might then find him at Yokohama; for, if the “Carnatic” was carrying him thither, it would be easy to ascertain if he had been on board.\nA brisk breeze arose about ten o’clock; but, though it might have been prudent to take in a reef, the pilot, after carefully examining the heavens, let the craft remain rigged as before. The “Tankadere” bore sail admirably, as she drew a great deal of water, and everything was prepared for high speed in case of a gale.\nMr. Fogg and Aouda descended into the cabin at midnight, having been already preceded by Fix, who had lain down on one of the cots.

Aouda agreed with this perspective and felt great sorrow over the loss of the competent individual to whom she was so beholden. They entertained the hope of locating him in Yokohama; should the \"Carnatic\" have transported him there, it would be simple to verify if he had been aboard.\n\nA strong wind began blowing around ten o'clock. Despite the potentially wise decision to shorten sail, the pilot, after a thorough inspection of the sky, opted to keep the boat rigged as it was. The \"Tankadere\" managed its sails excellently, helped by its significant draft, and was prepared for high speeds if they encountered a strong gale.\n\nMr. Fogg and Aouda went below to the cabin at midnight, following Fix, who had already settled onto one of the available berths.

They hoped they could meet him again in Yokohama, since if Passepartout had indeed sailed on the Carnatic, it would be easy to confirm whether he was on board. Around ten o’clock, a lively wind picked up, but even though it might have been wise to reduce the sails, the pilot checked the sky and decided not to make any changes. The \"Tankadere\" handled the wind impressively, as she had a deep draught, and everything was set for fast travel if the weather worsened. By midnight, Mr. Fogg and Aouda went down to the cabin, following Fix, who had already gone to sleep on one of the beds, while the pilot and crew stayed on deck through the night."

The “Tankadere” still carried all sail, and was accomplishing her greatest capacity of speed. If the wind held as it was, the chances would be in her favour. During the day she kept along the coast, where the currents were favourable; the coast, irregular in profile, and visible sometimes across the clearings, was at most five miles distant. The sea was less boisterous, since the wind came off land—a fortunate circumstance for the boat, which would suffer, owing to its small tonnage, by a heavy surge on the sea.\nThe breeze subsided a little towards noon, and set in from the south-west. The pilot put up his poles, but took them down again within two hours, as the wind freshened up anew.\nMr. Fogg and Aouda, happily unaffected by the roughness of the sea, ate with a good appetite, Fix being invited to share their repast, which he accepted with secret chagrin.

Still, he was obliged to eat, and so he ate.\nWhen the meal was over, he took Mr. Fogg apart, and said, “sir”—this “sir” scorched his lips, and he had to control himself to avoid collaring this “gentleman”—“sir, you have been very kind to give me a passage on this boat. But, though my means will not admit of my expending them as freely as you, I must ask to pay my share—”\n“Let us not speak of that, sir,” replied Mr. Fogg.\n“But, if I insist—”\n“No, sir,” repeated Mr. Fogg, in a tone which did not admit of a reply. “This enters into my general expenses.”\nFix, as he bowed, had a stifled feeling, and, going forward, where he ensconced himself, did not open his mouth for the rest of the day.",

The coastline, which was irregularly shaped and occasionally visible through clearings, was no more than five miles away. The sea was less rough because the wind was blowing from land, which was fortunate for the small boat, as it would have struggled with heavy waves due to its modest size. Around midday, the breeze lessened slightly and shifted to the south-west. The pilot raised the poles but lowered them again within two hours as the wind picked up strength. Mr. Fogg and Aouda, unaffected by the choppy sea, ate heartily, with Fix also invited to join their meal. Fix accepted, but felt a secret annoyance. He found it difficult to accept travelling at Mr. Fogg’s expense and consuming his supplies, yet he was compelled to eat, so he did. After eating, he pulled Mr. Fogg aside and addressed him as “sir”—a word that felt bitter on his tongue, requiring him to suppress the urge to grab the man by the collar. He said, “Sir, I am grateful for your kindness in offering me passage on this boat. However, despite my limited financial means compared to yours, I must insist on contributing my share.” Mr. Fogg responded, “Let us not discuss that, sir.” Fix pressed, “But, if I insist—” “No, sir,” Mr. Fogg repeated with a finality that left no room for argument. “This is included in my overall costs.” Fix felt stifled as he bowed, then went forward and settled down, remaining silent for the rest of the day.",

Throughout the day, they sailed near the coast, benefiting from favorable currents. The shoreline, which was uneven and occasionally visible through clearings, was never more than five miles away.

          "text_segment": "Meanwhile they were progressing famously, and John Bunsby was in high hope. He several times assured Mr. Fogg that they would reach Shanghai in time; to which that gentleman responded that he counted upon it. The crew set to work in good earnest, inspired by the reward to be gained. There was not a sheet which was not tightened, not a sail which was not vigorously hoisted; not a lurch could be charged to the man at the helm. They worked as desperately as if they were contesting in a Royal yacht regatta.\nBy evening, the log showed that two hundred and twenty miles had been accomplished from Hong Kong, and Mr. Fogg might hope that he would be able to reach Yokohama without recording any delay in his journal; in which case, the many misadventures which had overtaken him since he left London would not seriously affect his journey.\nThe “Tankadere” entered the Straits of Fo-Kien, which separate the island of Formosa from the Chinese coast, in the small hours of the night, and crossed the Tropic of Cancer. The sea was very rough in the straits, full of eddies formed by the counter-currents, and the chopping waves broke her course, whilst it became very difficult to stand on deck.\nAt daybreak the wind began to blow hard again, and the heavens seemed to predict a gale. The barometer announced a speedy change, the mercury rising and falling capriciously; the sea also, in the south-east, raised long surges which indicated a tempest. The sun had set the evening before in a red mist, in the midst of the phosphorescent scintillations of the ocean.\nJohn Bunsby long examined the threatening aspect of the heavens, muttering indistinctly between his teeth. At last he said in a low voice to Mr. Fogg, “Shall I speak out to your honour?”\n“Of course.”\n“Well, we are going to have a squall.”\n“Is the wind north or south?” asked Mr. Fogg quietly.\n“South. Look! a typhoon is coming up.”\n“Glad it’s a typhoon from the south, for it will carry us forward.”\n“Oh, if you take it that way,” said John Bunsby, “I’ve nothing more to say.” John Bunsby’s suspicions were confirmed. At a less advanced season of the year the typhoon, according to a famous meteorologist, would have passed away like a luminous cascade of electric flame; but in the winter equinox it was to be feared that it would burst upon them with great violence.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Their journey was proceeding very well, and John Bunsby was quite hopeful. He repeatedly assured Mr. Fogg that they would arrive in Shanghai on schedule, to which Mr. Fogg simply replied that he was counting on it. Motivated by the promised reward, the crew worked diligently. Every rope was pulled taut, every sail was raised with energy, and the helmsman steered perfectly without any sudden swerves. They worked as intensely as if they were competing in a prestigious boat race.\nBy that evening, the ship's log indicated they had covered two hundred and twenty miles since leaving Hong Kong. Mr. Fogg began to feel optimistic that he might reach Yokohama without having to note any delays in his logbook. If this proved true, the numerous setbacks he had faced since departing London would not significantly impact his overall journey time.\nThe 'Tankadere' entered the Straits of Fo-Kien, which lie between Formosa island and the Chinese coast, during the early hours of the night. They also crossed the Tropic of Cancer. The sea in the straits was very turbulent, marked by swirling currents creating choppy waves that hindered their progress, making it extremely difficult to maintain balance on deck.\nAs dawn broke, the wind picked up strongly again, and the sky seemed to foreshadow a storm. The barometer readings fluctuated unpredictably, signaling an imminent change in weather. In the southeast, the sea began to show long swells, indicating an approaching tempest. The previous evening, the sun had set behind a reddish haze, amidst the shimmering, phosphorescent glow of the ocean.\nJohn Bunsby carefully observed the threatening appearance of the sky for a long time, muttering quietly to himself. Eventually, he spoke softly to Mr. Fogg, asking, \"Would you like me to be frank with your honour?\"\nMr. Fogg replied, \"Naturally.\"\n\"Well, we're heading into a squall,\" Bunsby stated.\n\"Is the wind from the north or the south?\" Mr. Fogg inquired calmly.\n\"From the south. Look! A typhoon is approaching.\"\nMr. Fogg responded, \"I'm pleased it's a southern typhoon, as it will push us forward.\"\n\"Oh, if that's how you view it,\" John Bunsby said, \"then I have nothing further to add.\" John Bunsby's suspicions were confirmed. According to a well-known meteorologist, a typhoon earlier in the year would have merely passed by like a brilliant flash of electrical light. However, during the winter equinox, there was a significant risk that it would strike with considerable force.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As they continued their journey, things were going well and John Bunsby was optimistic. He repeatedly told Mr. Fogg that they would arrive in Shanghai on schedule, and Mr. Fogg expressed his confidence in this. Motivated by the promised reward, the crew worked with great determination; every sail was secured tightly, every sheet pulled taut, and the helmsman steered perfectly. Their efforts were as intense as if they were racing in a prestigious yacht competition.\n\nBy nightfall, the ship’s log showed they had travelled two hundred and twenty miles from Hong Kong. Mr. Fogg was hopeful that he could reach Yokohama without noting any delay in his journal, meaning the various mishaps since leaving London wouldn't pose a serious setback.\n\nDuring the night, the “Tankadere” navigated through the Straits of Fo-Kien, which lie between Formosa and mainland China, and crossed the Tropic of Cancer. The waters were turbulent in the strait, with swirling currents and choppy waves making the ship's progress difficult and making it hard to stand on deck.\n\nAt dawn, the wind grew stronger and the sky suggested a storm was coming. The barometer’s fluctuating readings pointed to an imminent change, and large waves from the southeast warned of a storm. The previous evening, the sun had set in a red haze, amid the glowing lights of the sea.\n\nJohn Bunsby watched the ominous sky for a long time, mumbling to himself, before finally saying quietly to Mr. Fogg, \"Shall I speak frankly to you, sir?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" replied Mr. Fogg.\n\n\"We're about to get hit by a squall.\"\n\n\"Is the wind coming from the north or south?\" Mr. Fogg inquired calmly.\n\n\"South. See, there’s a typhoon approaching.\"\n\n\"I’m glad the typhoon is from the south; it will help push us ahead.\"\n\n“If that's how you see it,” replied John Bunsby, “I have nothing else to add.” His concerns were soon validated. At a different time of year, experts said such a typhoon might have simply illuminated the sky with electric light, but during the winter equinox, there was a real danger that it would hit them with full force."

A single triangular sail, of strong canvas, was hoisted as a storm-jib, so as to hold the wind from behind. Then they waited.\nJohn Bunsby had requested his passengers to go below; but this imprisonment in so narrow a space, with little air, and the boat bouncing in the gale, was far from pleasant. Neither Mr. Fogg, Fix, nor Aouda consented to leave the deck.\nThe storm of rain and wind descended upon them towards eight o’clock. With but its bit of sail, the “Tankadere” was lifted like a feather by a wind, an idea of whose violence can scarcely be given. To compare her speed to four times that of a locomotive going on full steam would be below the truth.\nThe boat scudded thus northward during the whole day, borne on by monstrous waves, preserving always, fortunately, a speed equal to theirs. Twenty times she seemed almost to be submerged by these mountains of water which rose behind her; but the adroit management of the pilot saved her. The passengers were often bathed in spray, but they submitted to it philosophically. Fix cursed it, no doubt; but Aouda, with her eyes fastened upon her protector, whose coolness amazed her, showed herself worthy of him, and bravely weathered the storm. As for Phileas Fogg, it seemed just as if the typhoon were a part of his programme.\nUp to this time the “Tankadere” had always held her course to the north; but towards evening the wind, veering three quarters, bore down from the north-west. The boat, now lying in the trough of the waves, shook and rolled terribly; the sea struck her with fearful violence. At night the tempest increased in violence. John Bunsby saw the approach of darkness and the rising of the storm with dark misgivings. He thought awhile, and then asked his crew if it was not time to slacken speed. After a consultation he approached Mr. Fogg, and said, “I think, your honour, that we should do well to make for one of the ports on the coast.”\n“I think so too.”\n“Ah!” said the pilot. “But which one?”\n“I know of but one,” returned Mr. Fogg tranquilly.\n“And that is—”\n“Shanghai.”\nThe pilot, at first, did not seem to comprehend; he could scarcely realise so much determination and tenacity. Then he cried, “Well—yes! Your honour is right. To Shanghai!”\nSo the “Tankadere” kept steadily on her northward track.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The boat's captain took necessary precautions beforehand. He reduced the sails to their minimum, removed the tall masts, and had everyone move to the front of the vessel. A single sturdy, triangular sail was raised at the front to act as a storm jib, helping the boat maintain its position relative to the wind coming from behind. Then they waited. John Bunsby had advised his passengers to stay below deck, but being confined to such a small, stuffy space with the boat violently pitching in the strong wind was very uncomfortable. Neither Mr. Fogg, Fix, nor Aouda agreed to leave the deck. The severe rain and wind storm hit them around eight o'clock. With only its small sail, the \"Tankadere\" was tossed about like a feather by a wind whose power is hard to describe. Comparing its speed to four times that of a fully steaming train would be an understatement. The boat was driven rapidly northward all day by enormous waves, fortunately always managing to keep pace with them. Numerous times it appeared on the verge of being swallowed by the towering walls of water that rose behind it, but the pilot's expert handling saved them. The passengers were frequently drenched by spray, but they accepted it calmly. Fix no doubt grumbled about it, but Aouda, captivated by her protector's astonishing composure, proved her courage and endured the storm bravely. As for Phileas Fogg, the intense storm seemed as if it were a planned part of his trip. Up to this point, the \"Tankadere\" had consistently held its northern course, but towards evening, the wind shifted three quarters, now blowing from the north-west. The boat, now lying in the trough between waves, shuddered and rolled violently; the sea pounded against it with terrifying force. As night fell, the tempest grew even fiercer. John Bunsby watched the darkness and the worsening storm approach with serious worries. He considered the situation for a moment before asking his crew if it was time to slow down. After discussing it, he approached Mr. Fogg and said, \"I believe, sir, we should consider making for one of the ports along the coast.\" \"I agree,\" Mr. Fogg replied. \"Ah!\" exclaimed the pilot. \"But which one?\" \"I only know of one,\" Mr. Fogg stated calmly. \"And that would be-\" \"Shanghai.\" The pilot initially seemed confused, finding it hard to believe such determination and persistence. Then he exclaimed, \"Well, yes! You are right, sir. To Shanghai!\" And so, the \"Tankadere\" maintained its steady path northward.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The pilot prepared for the storm by taking necessary precautions: he reduced the sails, removed the pole-masts, and had everyone move to the front of the boat. Only a sturdy triangular storm-jib remained up to catch the wind from behind. John Bunsby, the pilot, asked his passengers to go below deck for safety, but the cramped, stuffy conditions and the boat's rough motion made this unappealing; Fogg, Fix, and Aouda all decided to stay on deck. Around eight o'clock, heavy rain and strong winds struck. With just its storm-jib, the Tankadere was whisked along by a wind so powerful that even describing it as four times faster than a full-speed locomotive would be an understatement. All day, the boat sped northward, riding the gigantic waves and somehow matching their speed. Many times, it seemed the vessel would be swamped by the towering waves, but the pilot's skilled handling kept it afloat. The passengers were frequently drenched with spray, but endured it patiently. Fix was unhappy about the situation, while Aouda, visibly in awe of Fogg's unfaltering composure, bravely faced the storm. For Fogg, it appeared as though even the typhoon was part of his plan. Up until this point, the Tankadere had maintained a northward course, but in the evening, a major shift in the wind brought it from the northwest and sent the boat into the troughs of the waves, causing it to pitch violently. The storm worsened after sunset. Seeing night fall and the storm intensify, John Bunsby grew anxious and consulted his crew about reducing speed. After talking it over, he approached Mr. Fogg, suggesting they should head for a port on the coast. Fogg agreed, and when Bunsby asked which port he had in mind, Fogg calmly replied, 'Shanghai.' At first, the pilot couldn't quite believe Fogg's unwavering resolve, but then he agreed. The Tankadere therefore continued steadily towards the north, aiming for Shanghai."

More than once Mr. Fogg rushed to protect her from the violence of the waves.\nDay reappeared. The tempest still raged with undiminished fury; but the wind now returned to the south-east. It was a favourable change, and the “Tankadere” again bounded forward on this mountainous sea, though the waves crossed each other, and imparted shocks and counter-shocks which would have crushed a craft less solidly built. From time to time the coast was visible through the broken mist, but no vessel was in sight. The “Tankadere” was alone upon the sea.\nThere were some signs of a calm at noon, and these became more distinct as the sun descended toward the horizon. The tempest had been as brief as terrific.

Mr. Fogg frequently stepped in to protect her from the force of the waves. Day broke, and the storm continued its intense onslaught, but the wind had now turned to the south-east. This was a welcome change, and the \"Tankadere\" resumed its progress across the turbulent, crisscrossing waves, which delivered powerful impacts that would have shattered a boat not as sturdily constructed. Glimpses of the coast appeared now and then through the clearing mist, but no other ships were anywhere in sight; the \"Tankadere\" was isolated on the water. By midday, signs of the storm abating began to show, becoming more pronounced as the sun lowered towards the horizon. The tempest, though brief, had been fierce. The passengers, utterly fatigued, were finally able to eat a little and get some rest. The night that followed was considerably calmer. Some sails were set again, and the boat achieved good speed. The next morning at sunrise, they spotted the coast, and John Bunsby confidently stated they were less than a hundred miles from Shanghai. A hundred miles, with only a single day to cover them!

The “Tankadere” surged forward again over the turbulent waves, enduring collisions that would have destroyed a weaker ship. Occasionally, glimpses of the shoreline appeared through breaks in the mist, but no other vessels could be seen—the “Tankadere” was utterly alone at sea.\n\nAround midday, there were hints that the storm might be ending, and as the sun set, these signs grew clearer.

The boat must keep up an average of nine miles an hour, and the wind was becoming calmer every moment! It was a capricious breeze, coming from the coast, and after it passed the sea became smooth. Still, the “Tankadere” was so light, and her fine sails caught the fickle zephyrs so well, that, with the aid of the currents John Bunsby found himself at six o’clock not more than ten miles from the mouth of Shanghai River. Shanghai itself is situated at least twelve miles up the stream. At seven they were still three miles from Shanghai. The pilot swore an angry oath; the reward of two hundred pounds was evidently on the point of escaping him. He looked at Mr. Fogg.

And the booming of the little cannon resounded in the air.",

The boat needed to average nine miles per hour, yet the wind was diminishing by the minute! It was an unpredictable breeze coming from the coast, and after it passed, the sea became smooth.

The pilot let out an angry curse; the two hundred pound reward was clearly about to slip from his grasp. He looked towards Mr. Fogg, who remained completely serene, even though his entire fortune hung in the balance at that moment. Just then, a tall black smokestack, topped with plumes of smoke, appeared on the horizon. It was the American steamer, departing for Yokohama exactly on schedule. \"Damn it!\" cried John Bunsby, violently shoving the rudder back. \"Signal to her!\" Phileas Fogg said quietly. A small brass cannon, used for signaling in fog, was located on the \"Tankadere's\" forward deck. It was fully loaded; but just as the pilot was about to use a red-hot coal to ignite the charge, Mr. Fogg instructed, \"Raise your flag!\" The flag was hoisted halfway up the mast, which is a signal of distress. The hope was that the American steamer, upon seeing it, would slightly alter its course to assist the pilot-boat. \"Fire!\" ordered Mr. Fogg. And the sound of the little cannon firing echoed through the air.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The wind became much calmer, and fortunately, the waves also subsided. The crew set all the sails, and by midday, the 'Tankadere' was only forty-five miles from Shanghai. They had six hours left to travel that distance. Everyone on board, except perhaps Phileas Fogg, doubted whether they could make it in time, and they were all anxious. To succeed, the boat needed to travel at an average speed of nine miles per hour, but the wind was dying down more and more. The breeze was unpredictable and came from the land, calming the sea further after it passed. Nevertheless, the 'Tankadere,' being very light and with well-designed sails, managed to harness even the variable breezes and, helped by currents, by six o’clock was only ten miles from the mouth of the Shanghai River. However, the city itself was still at least twelve miles farther upstream. At seven o’clock, they were still three miles short of Shanghai. The pilot cursed in frustration, fearing he would lose out on the promised two hundred pound reward. He glanced at Mr. Fogg, who remained completely calm, though everything he owned was at risk at that moment.\n\nJust then, a steamer with a tall black smokestack appeared on the horizon, trailing smoke. It was the American ship departing for Yokohama right on schedule. “Blast that ship!” shouted John Bunsby, yanking desperately at the rudder. “Signal to her!” Phileas Fogg calmly instructed. There was a small brass cannon on the front deck of the 'Tankadere' for sending fog signals, and it was already loaded. As the pilot was about to ignite the cannon, Mr. Fogg told him to raise the flag instead. They hoisted their flag at half-mast, signaling distress, hoping that the American steamer would notice and turn off course to help. “Fire!” ordered Mr. Fogg, and the loud report of the cannon echoed through the air."

She carried a large cargo and a well-filled cabin of passengers. Two state-rooms in the rear were, however, unoccupied—those which had been engaged by Phileas Fogg.\nThe next day a passenger with a half-stupefied eye, staggering gait, and disordered hair, was seen to emerge from the second cabin, and to totter to a seat on deck.\nIt was Passepartout; and what had happened to him was as follows: Shortly after Fix left the opium den, two waiters had lifted the unconscious Passepartout, and had carried him to the bed reserved for the smokers. Three hours later, pursued even in his dreams by a fixed idea, the poor fellow awoke, and struggled against the stupefying influence of the narcotic. The thought of a duty unfulfilled shook off his torpor, and he hurried from the abode of drunkenness. Staggering and holding himself up by keeping against the walls, falling down and creeping up again, and irresistibly impelled by a kind of instinct, he kept crying out, “The ‘Carnatic!’ the ‘Carnatic!’”\nThe steamer lay puffing alongside the quay, on the point of starting. Passepartout had but few steps to go; and, rushing upon the plank, he crossed it, and fell unconscious on the deck, just as the “Carnatic” was moving off. Several sailors, who were evidently accustomed to this sort of scene, carried the poor Frenchman down into the second cabin, and Passepartout did not wake until they were one hundred and fifty miles away from China. Thus he found himself the next morning on the deck of the “Carnatic,” and eagerly inhaling the exhilarating sea-breeze. The pure air sobered him. He began to collect his sense, which he found a difficult task; but at last he recalled the events of the evening before, Fix’s revelation, and the opium-house.\n",

It was laden with a substantial cargo and had many passengers, although two staterooms at the back, reserved by Phileas Fogg, remained empty. The following day, a passenger who looked dazed, walked unsteadily, and had messy hair, was observed emerging from the second-class cabin and weakly making his way to a deck seat. This was Passepartout, and here’s what had occurred: Shortly after Fix departed the opium den, two servers had lifted the unconscious Passepartout and placed him on a bed designated for smokers. Approximately three hours later, still preoccupied by a persistent thought even in his sleep, the poor man awoke and struggled against the numbing effects of the drug. The realization of an unfulfilled duty spurred him from his sluggish state, and he quickly left the place of intoxication. Stumbling and using the walls for support, falling and getting back up repeatedly, and driven by a forceful instinct, he kept shouting, “The ‘Carnatic!’ the ‘Carnatic!’” The steamboat sat alongside the dock, engines running, on the verge of departure. Passepartout was only a short distance away; rushing onto the gangplank, he crossed it and collapsed unconscious on the deck just as the “Carnatic” began to pull away. Several sailors, clearly familiar with such occurrences, carried the poor Frenchman down into the second cabin, and Passepartout didn’t regain consciousness until they were one hundred and fifty miles from China. Consequently, the next morning he found himself on the “Carnatic’s” deck, eagerly breathing in the invigorating sea air. The fresh air helped him clear his mind. He began the difficult process of regaining his full senses, but eventually recalled the events of the previous evening, including Fix’s confession and his visit to the opium house.",

The following day, a disheveled and unsteady passenger with confused eyes appeared on deck from the second cabin. This was Passepartout. Here is what happened to him: After Fix had left the opium den, two attendants carried the unconscious Passepartout to a bed meant for smokers. About three hours later, he awoke, still under the influence of the drug but motivated by the memory of an unfinished task. Forcing himself up, he staggered out of the den, clinging to the walls, sometimes stumbling and getting up again, always repeating, \"The 'Carnatic!' the 'Carnatic!'\" The ship was still docked, about to depart. With only a short distance to cover, Passepartout hurried across the boarding ramp and collapsed onto the deck just as the vessel was leaving. Sailors, apparently used to such occurrences, carried him below to the second cabin, where he remained unconscious until the ship was far from China. The next morning, Passepartout found himself on deck, breathing in the fresh ocean air, which helped clear his senses.

Pshaw! Mr. Fogg is no more a robber than I am a murderer.”\nShould he divulge Fix’s real errand to his master? Would it do to tell the part the detective was playing? Would it not be better to wait until Mr. Fogg reached London again, and then impart to him that an agent of the metropolitan police had been following him round the world, and have a good laugh over it? No doubt; at least, it was worth considering. The first thing to do was to find Mr. Fogg, and apologise for his singular behaviour.\nPassepartout got up and proceeded, as well as he could with the rolling of the steamer, to the after-deck. He saw no one who resembled either his master or Aouda. “Good!” muttered he; “Aouda has not got up yet, and Mr. Fogg has probably found some partners at whist.”\nHe descended to the saloon. Mr. Fogg was not there. Passepartout had only, however, to ask the purser the number of his master’s state-room. The purser replied that he did not know any passenger by the name of Fogg.\n“I beg your pardon,” said Passepartout persistently. “He is a tall gentleman, quiet, and not very talkative, and has with him a young lady—”\n“There is no young lady on board,” interrupted the purser. “Here is a list of the passengers; you may see for yourself.”\nPassepartout scanned the list, but his master’s name was not upon it.

He saw it all now. He remembered that the time of sailing had been changed, that he should have informed his master of that fact, and that he had not done so. It was his fault, then, that Mr. Fogg and Aouda had missed the steamer. Yes, but it was still more the fault of the traitor who, in order to separate him from his master, and detain the latter at Hong Kong, had inveigled him into getting drunk! He now saw the detective’s trick; and at this moment Mr. Fogg was certainly ruined, his bet was lost, and he himself perhaps arrested and imprisoned! At this thought Passepartout tore his hair. Ah, if Fix ever came within his reach, what a settling of accounts there would be!",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "He said to himself, \"Clearly, I was disgustingly drunk! What will Mr. Fogg say? At least I didn't miss the steamer, which is the most crucial thing.\" Then, remembering Fix, he added: \"As for that villain, I hope we are finally free of him, and that he didn't dare, as he threatened, to follow us aboard the 'Carnatic'. A detective trailing Mr. Fogg, accused of robbing the Bank of England! Nonsense! Mr. Fogg is no more a robber than I am a murderer.\" He debated whether to tell his master about Fix's real mission. Would it be right to reveal the detective's actions? Wouldn't it be better to wait until Mr. Fogg was back in London and then inform him that a metropolitan police agent had been following him around the globe, sharing a good laugh about it? Undoubtedly; it was certainly worth considering. The first task was to find Mr. Fogg and apologize for his peculiar behavior. Passepartout stood up and, navigating the ship's movement as best he could, headed to the aft deck. He saw no one resembling either his master or Aouda. \"Good!\" he mumbled, \"Aouda hasn't gotten up yet, and Mr. Fogg has probably found some bridge partners.\" He went down to the saloon. Mr. Fogg wasn't there. However, Passepartout only needed to ask the purser for his master's cabin number. The purser replied that he didn't know any passenger named Fogg. \"I beg your pardon,\" Passepartout insisted, \"He is a tall gentleman, quiet, and not very talkative, and he has a young lady with him—\" \"There is no young lady on board,\" the purser interrupted. \"Here is a list of the passengers; you can see for yourself.\" Passepartout scanned the list, but his master's name was not on it. Suddenly, an idea struck him. \"Ah! Am I on the 'Carnatic'?\" \"Yes.\" \"Going to Yokohama?\" \"Certainly.\" For a moment, Passepartout had feared he was on the wrong vessel; but while he was indeed on the 'Carnatic', his master was not. He collapsed onto a seat, thunderstruck. He understood everything now. He remembered that the departure time had been altered, that he should have informed his master of this fact, and that he had failed to do so. It was his fault, then, that Mr. Fogg and Aouda had missed the steamer. Yes, but it was even more the fault of the betrayer who, in order to separate him from his master and delay the latter in Hong Kong, had tricked him into getting drunk! He now saw the detective's cunning plan; and at this instant, Mr. Fogg was surely ruined, his bet was lost, and he himself perhaps arrested and imprisoned! At this realization, Passepartout tore at his hair. Oh, if Fix ever came within his reach, there would be a serious reckoning!",

At least I haven’t missed the ship, which is the most important thing.\" When Fix came to his mind, he continued, \"As for that scoundrel, I hope we’ve finally gotten rid of him, and that he hasn’t dared to follow us onto the Carnatic like he said he might. A detective chasing Mr. Fogg, suspecting him of robbing the Bank of England! Nonsense! Mr. Fogg is as much a thief as I am a killer.\" Passepartout wondered if he should tell his master about Fix's true mission or wait until they returned to London, then reveal that a police detective had followed them around the world and have a good laugh about it. For now, his priority was to find Mr. Fogg and apologize for his strange behavior. Passing through the unsteady motion of the ship, Passepartout made his way to the after-deck but couldn’t find either his master or Aouda. \"Good,\" he muttered, \"Aouda must not be up yet, and Mr. Fogg is probably playing cards.\" He went down to the saloon, but Mr. Fogg wasn’t there. Passepartout then asked the purser for Mr. Fogg’s cabin number. The purser replied that there was no passenger by that name. Persistent, Passepartout added that he was looking for a tall, quiet gentleman traveling with a young lady. The purser interrupted, saying there was no young lady aboard and invited Passepartout to check the passenger list. Passepartout scanned the list but didn’t find his master’s name. Suddenly, he wondered, \"Wait, is this the Carnatic?\" The reply was yes, and that the ship was en route to Yokohama. Although Passepartout briefly feared he was on the wrong vessel, he now realized he was indeed on the Carnatic, but his master wasn’t. Shocked, it dawned on him: he remembered there had been a change in the ship's departure time, which he had failed to inform Mr. Fogg about. It was his fault that Mr. Fogg and Aouda missed the steamer, but even more so, it was the detective’s fault for tricking him into drinking and causing the separation. Now, understanding Fix’s plot, Passepartout was shattered as he imagined Mr. Fogg now ruined, the wager lost, and himself in danger of arrest or imprisonment. At this thought, he tore at his hair in despair, vowing vengeance if he ever met Fix again."

Initially, he wandered through a distinctly European district, where the buildings had low facades furnished with verandas and glimpses of tidy peristyles could be seen beneath them. This area, located between the “promontory of the Treaty” and the river, contained streets, squares, harbors, and warehouses. Like in Hong Kong and Calcutta, people of many nations mingled there—Americans, English, Chinese, Dutch—mostly merchants engaged in trade. Among them, Passepartout felt completely isolated, as if he had suddenly found himself among strangers in a far-off land."

But he shrank from telling the story of his adventures, intimately connected as it was with that of his master; and, before doing so, he determined to exhaust all other means of aid. As chance did not favour him in the European quarter, he penetrated that inhabited by the native Japanese, determined, if necessary, to push on to Yeddo.\nThe Japanese quarter of Yokohama is called Benten, after the goddess of the sea, who is worshipped on the islands round about. There Passepartout beheld beautiful fir and cedar groves, sacred gates of a singular architecture, bridges half hid in the midst of bamboos and reeds, temples shaded by immense cedar-trees, holy retreats where were sheltered Buddhist priests and sectaries of Confucius, and interminable streets, where a perfect harvest of rose-tinted and red-cheeked children, who looked as if they had been cut out of Japanese screens, and who were playing in the midst of short-legged poodles and yellowish cats, might have been gathered.\nThe streets were crowded with people. Priests were passing in processions, beating their dreary tambourines; police and custom-house officers with pointed hats encrusted with lac and carrying two sabres hung to their waists; soldiers, clad in blue cotton with white stripes, and bearing guns; the Mikado’s guards, enveloped in silken doubles, hauberks and coats of mail; and numbers of military folk of all ranks—for the military profession is as much respected in Japan as it is despised in China—went hither and thither in groups and pairs. Passepartout saw, too, begging friars, long-robed pilgrims, and simple civilians, with their warped and jet-black hair, big heads, long busts, slender legs, short stature, and complexions varying from copper-colour to a dead white, but never yellow, like the Chinese, from whom the Japanese widely differ. He did not fail to observe the curious equipages—carriages and palanquins, barrows supplied with sails, and litters made of bamboo; nor the women—whom he thought not especially handsome—who took little steps with their little feet, whereon they wore canvas shoes, straw sandals, and clogs of worked wood, and who displayed tight-looking eyes, flat chests, teeth fashionably blackened, and gowns crossed with silken scarfs, tied in an enormous knot behind an ornament which the modern Parisian ladies seem to have borrowed from the dames of Japan.\n",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Facing his predicament, Passepartout's fallback was to seek aid from the French and English consuls in Yokohama. However, he was reluctant to reveal the details of his journey, which were closely tied to his master's affairs. Preferring to exhaust all other possibilities before approaching the consuls, he decided to explore further. Since he found no luck in the European area, he ventured into the section inhabited by the Japanese natives, prepared to travel all the way to Yeddo if necessary.\n\nThe Japanese section of Yokohama is known as Benten, named after the sea goddess honored on the surrounding islands. In Benten, Passepartout observed beautiful groves of fir and cedar trees, distinctively designed sacred gates, bridges partially concealed by bamboo and reeds, temples shaded by giant cedars, peaceful sanctuaries sheltering Buddhist monks and Confucian followers, and seemingly endless streets. These streets were populated by countless rosy-cheeked children, resembling figures from Japanese screens, playing among small dogs and yellowish cats.\n\nThe streets were bustling with activity. Processions of priests passed by, beating their somber tambourines. Police and customs officials, wearing conical hats adorned with lacquer and carrying two swords at their waists, were present. Soldiers in blue cotton uniforms with white stripes and armed with guns could be seen. The Mikado's guards, wrapped in layered silk garments, chainmail, and armor, also moved about. Military personnel of various ranks were everywhere, either alone or in groups, reflecting the high esteem for the military profession in Japan, a stark contrast to its low regard in China. Passepartout also encountered mendicant monks, long-robed pilgrims, and ordinary citizens. These civilians had distinctive appearances: dark, often styled hair, large heads, long torsos, slender legs, short stature, and skin tones ranging from coppery to pale white, notably never yellow like the Chinese, from whom the Japanese significantly differ. He did not miss the unusual forms of transport – carriages and palanquins, carts equipped with sails, and bamboo litters. Nor did he overlook the women, whom he found not particularly attractive, taking tiny steps with their small feet shod in canvas shoes, straw sandals, or carved wooden clogs. They had narrow eyes, flat chests, teeth fashionably stained black, and gowns fastened with silk sashes tied in a large knot at the back – a style that seemed to Passepartout to have been adopted by modern Parisian women from their Japanese counterparts.",

He wandered through endless streets full of rosy-cheeked children who seemed as if they had come straight out of Japanese artwork, playing among short-legged poodles and pale-yellow cats. The streets were bustling: priests processing and beating drums, officials with decorated hats and swords, soldiers dressed in blue-and-white carrying rifles, guards of the Mikado in elaborate silk garments and armor, and many other military figures—since being a soldier was highly respected in Japan unlike in China. He also saw mendicant monks, long-robed pilgrims, and civilians with distinctive black hair, large heads, short height, and skin ranging from copper to pale white, but never yellow like the Chinese. Passepartout noticed various unique vehicles too, such as carriages, palanquins, wheeled carts with sails, and bamboo sedans. He observed the women, whom he did not find particularly attractive, moving with tiny steps in special footwear—canvas shoes, straw sandals, and carved wooden clogs. They had narrow-looking eyes, flattened chests, blackened teeth (considered stylish), and wore robes tied with broad silk sashes in prominent knots at the back, a style later adopted by Parisian women."

He went on till he found himself in the fields, in the midst of vast rice plantations. There he saw dazzling camellias expanding themselves, with flowers which were giving forth their last colours and perfumes, not on bushes, but on trees, and within bamboo enclosures, cherry, plum, and apple trees, which the Japanese cultivate rather for their blossoms than their fruit, and which queerly-fashioned, grinning scarecrows protected from the sparrows, pigeons, ravens, and other voracious birds. On the branches of the cedars were perched large eagles; amid the foliage of the weeping willows were herons, solemnly standing on one leg; and on every hand were crows, ducks, hawks, wild birds, and a multitude of cranes, which the Japanese consider sacred, and which to their minds symbolise long life and prosperity.\nAs he was strolling along, Passepartout espied some violets among the shrubs.\n“Good!” said he; “I’ll have some supper.”\nBut, on smelling them, he found that they were odourless.\n“No chance there,” thought he.\nThe worthy fellow had certainly taken good care to eat as hearty a breakfast as possible before leaving the “Carnatic;” but, as he had been walking about all day, the demands of hunger were becoming importunate. He observed that the butchers stalls contained neither mutton, goat, nor pork; and, knowing also that it is a sacrilege to kill cattle, which are preserved solely for farming, he made up his mind that meat was far from plentiful in Yokohama—nor was he mistaken; and, in default of butcher’s meat, he could have wished for a quarter of wild boar or deer, a partridge, or some quails, some game or fish, which, with rice, the Japanese eat almost exclusively. But he found it necessary to keep up a stout heart, and to postpone the meal he craved till the following morning. Night came, and Passepartout re-entered the native quarter, where he wandered through the streets, lit by vari-coloured lanterns, looking on at the dancers, who were executing skilful steps and boundings, and the astrologers who stood in the open air with their telescopes.

He continued his walk until he reached the open fields, amidst vast expanses of rice paddies. There, he saw brilliant camellias in full bloom, their final colors and scents emanating not from bushes but from trees, and within bamboo enclosures, cherry, plum, and apple trees, which the Japanese cultivated more for their blossoms than their fruit. These trees were protected from sparrows, pigeons, ravens, and other hungry birds by bizarrely shaped, grinning scarecrows. Large eagles perched on the branches of cedar trees; herons stood solemnly on one leg among the leaves of weeping willows. Crows, ducks, hawks, wild birds, and numerous cranes were visible everywhere, the latter considered sacred by the Japanese, symbolizing long life and prosperity in their minds.\n\nWhile strolling along, Passepartout spotted some violets among the bushes. “Great!” he thought; “I’ll gather some for supper.” But when he smelled them, he found they had no fragrance. “No luck there,” he mused. The poor fellow had certainly made sure to eat a very large breakfast before leaving the “Carnatic.” However, after walking around all day, his hunger was becoming insistent. He noticed that the butcher stalls offered neither mutton, goat, nor pork. Knowing also that it was forbidden to kill cattle, which were kept exclusively for farming, he concluded that meat was quite scarce in Yokohama—and he was correct. Lacking butcher’s meat, he would have been content with a portion of wild boar or deer, a partridge, some quail, or any game or fish, as the Japanese ate these items almost exclusively with rice. But he understood he needed to remain cheerful and postpone the meal he desired until the following morning. Night arrived, and Passepartout returned to the native part of town, where he wandered through the streets lit by multi-colored lanterns, watching dancers performing skillful steps and leaps, and astrologers standing outdoors with their telescopes.

There he noticed vibrant camellias blooming on trees rather than bushes, along with cherry, plum, and apple trees that the Japanese grow mainly for their flowers, not their fruit, all protected by oddly-shaped, grinning scarecrows from the birds.

He might, indeed, sell his watch; but he would have starved first. Now or never he must use the strong, if not melodious voice which nature had bestowed upon him. He knew several French and English songs, and resolved to try them upon the Japanese, who must be lovers of music, since they were for ever pounding on their cymbals, tam-tams, and tambourines, and could not but appreciate European talent.\nIt was, perhaps, rather early in the morning to get up a concert, and the audience prematurely aroused from their slumbers, might not possibly pay their entertainer with coin bearing the Mikado’s features. Passepartout therefore decided to wait several hours; and, as he was sauntering along, it occurred to him that he would seem rather too well dressed for a wandering artist. The idea struck him to change his garments for clothes more in harmony with his project; by which he might also get a little money to satisfy the immediate cravings of hunger. The resolution taken, it remained to carry it out.\nIt was only after a long search that Passepartout discovered a native dealer in old clothes, to whom he applied for an exchange.

Selling his watch was an option, but he would endure starvation before doing that. He concluded that the time had come to utilize the strong, if perhaps not beautiful, singing voice nature had given him. Knowing several French and English songs, he intended to perform them for the Japanese, assuming they were music lovers given their constant playing of cymbals, tam-tams, and tambourines, and would surely appreciate European skills. However, he realized it was likely too early to start a performance, and people woken up prematurely might not be inclined to pay him. Therefore, Passepartout chose to wait a few hours. As he strolled around, he thought that his current attire was too respectable for a street artist. This led him to the idea of trading his clothes for something more suitable for his plan, which would also hopefully provide him with some money for his immediate hunger. Having made this decision, he set out to execute it. After a considerable search, Passepartout located a local used clothing vendor and proposed a swap.

Since he knew a number of French and English songs, he thought he could perform them for the Japanese, who surely enjoyed music, judging by how often they played their percussion instruments. However, it was still quite early to put on a performance, and waking people up for music might not earn him any money. So, he chose to wait a few hours. As he wandered, he realized his attire made him stand out too much to pass as a street performer, so he resolved to swap his outfit for something more appropriate, and perhaps earn some money as well. After a lengthy search, he found a local dealer in second-hand clothes and traded his European suit for a worn Japanese coat and an old, lopsided turban.

I can’t sell this costume again for one still more Japanese. I must consider how to leave this country of the Sun, of which I shall not retain the most delightful of memories, as quickly as possible.”\nIt occurred to him to visit the steamers which were about to leave for America. He would offer himself as a cook or servant, in payment of his passage and meals. Once at San Francisco, he would find some means of going on. The difficulty was, how to traverse the four thousand seven hundred miles of the Pacific which lay between Japan and the New World.\nPassepartout was not the man to let an idea go begging, and directed his steps towards the docks. But, as he approached them, his project, which at first had seemed so simple, began to grow more and more formidable to his mind. What need would they have of a cook or servant on an American steamer, and what confidence would they put in him, dressed as he was? What references could he give?\nAs he was reflecting in this wise, his eyes fell upon an immense placard which a sort of clown was carrying through the streets. This placard, which was in English, read as follows:\nACROBATIC JAPANESE TROUPE,\nHONOURABLE WILLIAM BATULCAR, PROPRIETOR,\nLAST REPRESENTATIONS,\nPRIOR TO THEIR DEPARTURE TO THE UNITED STATES,\nOF THE\nLONG NOSES!

I'll pretend this is a carnival!\" His immediate priority after being dressed in the Japanese style was to find an unassuming tea-house. There, he ate a small breakfast of half a bird and some rice, dining like someone unsure where his next meal would come from. After finishing his meal, he thought, \"Right, I need to keep calm. I can't trade this outfit for an even more Japanese one. I have to figure out how to escape this country, which I won't remember fondly, as soon as possible.\" He got the idea to check the steamships preparing to sail for America. His plan was to offer his services as a cook or servant in exchange for travel and food. From San Francisco, he could figure out how to continue his journey. The major challenge was the huge expanse of the Pacific Ocean, roughly 4,700 miles separating Japan from the Americas. Passepartout was someone who acted on his ideas, so he headed towards the waterfront. However, as he got closer, his plan, which initially appeared straightforward, started to seem increasingly difficult. He wondered why an American ship would need a cook or servant like him, especially dressed as he was, and what credentials he could possibly offer. While he was deep in thought about these problems, his attention was caught by a huge poster being carried through the streets by a person who looked like a clown. The sign, written in English, announced: ACROBATIC JAPANESE TROUPE, MANAGED BY THE HONOURABLE WILLIAM BATULCAR, FINAL PERFORMANCES, BEFORE THEY LEAVE FOR THE UNITED STATES, PRESENTING THE LONG NOSES!

          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"Excellent!\" he said to himself. \"I'll pretend I'm at a festival!\" Once he had been dressed to blend in like a Japanese, his first priority was to find a modest tea-house, where he ate a simple breakfast of rice and part of a bird, since he still had no idea what he would do for dinner. After eating well, he resolved to remain calm. Realizing he could not exchange his current disguise for an even more authentic Japanese outfit, he thought about how he could leave Japan—where he hadn't had the best experiences—as quickly as possible. He considered seeking out ships bound for America, planning to offer his services as a cook or servant in exchange for passage and food. Once he arrived in San Francisco, he hoped to find a way to continue his journey. The real challenge, however, was crossing the nearly five thousand miles of ocean separating Japan from America. Since Passepartout was not one to let a good idea go to waste, he headed for the docks. However, as he got closer, the simplicity of his plan began to unravel—why would American steamer crews need his services? Would they trust a man dressed as he was, and what kind of references could he provide? Just as he pondered these problems, he noticed a huge sign being carried by a clown-like figure through the street. Written in English, the sign announced: ACROBATIC JAPANESE TROUPE, HONOURABLE WILLIAM BATULCAR, PROPRIETOR, FINAL SHOWS BEFORE LEAVING FOR AMERICA, FEATURING THE LONG NOSES UNDER THE PATRONAGE OF THE GOD TINGOU, GREAT ATTRACTION! On seeing the mention of the United States, Passepartout exclaimed, \"That's exactly what I need!\""

A quarter of an hour later he stopped before a large cabin, adorned with several clusters of streamers, the exterior walls of which were designed to represent, in violent colours and without perspective, a company of jugglers.\nThis was the Honourable William Batulcar’s establishment. That gentleman was a sort of Barnum, the director of a troupe of mountebanks, jugglers, clowns, acrobats, equilibrists, and gymnasts, who, according to the placard, was giving his last performances before leaving the Empire of the Sun for the States of the Union.\nPassepartout entered and asked for Mr. Batulcar, who straightway appeared in person.\n“What do you want?” said he to Passepartout, whom he at first took for a native.\n“Would you like a servant, sir?” asked Passepartout.\n“A servant!” cried Mr. Batulcar, caressing the thick grey beard which hung from his chin. “I already have two who are obedient and faithful, have never left me, and serve me for their nourishment and here they are,” added he, holding out his two robust arms, furrowed with veins as large as the strings of a bass-viol.\n“So I can be of no use to you?”\n“None.”\n“The devil! I should so like to cross the Pacific with you!”\n“Ah!” said the Honourable Mr. Batulcar. “You are no more a Japanese than I am a monkey! Who are you dressed up in that way?”\n“A man dresses as he can.”\n“That’s true. You are a Frenchman, aren’t you?”\n“Yes; a Parisian of Paris.”\n“Then you ought to know how to make grimaces?”\n“Why,” replied Passepartout, a little vexed that his nationality should cause this question, “we Frenchmen know how to make grimaces, it is true but not any better than the Americans do.”\n“True. Well, if I can’t take you as a servant, I can as a clown. You see, my friend, in France they exhibit foreign clowns, and in foreign parts French clowns.”\n“Ah!”\n“You are pretty strong, eh?”\n“Especially after a good meal.”\n“And you can sing?”\n“Yes,” returned Passepartout, who had formerly been wont to sing in the streets.\n“But can you sing standing on your head, with a top spinning on your left foot, and a sabre balanced on your right?”\n“Humph! I think so,” replied Passepartout, recalling the exercises of his younger days.\n“Well, that’s enough,” said the Honourable William Batulcar.\nThe engagement was concluded there and then.\nPassepartout had at last found something to do. He was engaged to act in the celebrated Japanese troupe.",

About fifteen minutes later, he paused in front of a large structure decorated with numerous ribbon clusters. Its exterior walls were vividly and unrealistically painted to depict a group of performers.\nThis was the location of the respected William Batulcar's enterprise. Mr. Batulcar was a showman akin to Barnum, managing a company of entertainers including acrobats, jugglers, comedians, balance artists, and gymnasts. According to the advertisements, he was presenting his final shows before departing the country of the Rising Sun for the United States.\nPassepartout went inside and requested to see Mr. Batulcar, who promptly appeared in person.\n“What is it you want?” Batulcar asked Passepartout, initially mistaking him for a local.\n“Are you looking for a servant, sir?” Passepartout inquired.\n“A servant!” exclaimed Mr. Batulcar, stroking the thick grey beard hanging from his chin. “I already have two who are obedient and reliable, have never left me, and work only for their sustenance—here they are,” he added, extending his two strong arms, marked by veins as prominent as cello strings.\n“So, there's no way I can be of use to you?”\n“None whatsoever.”\n“Confound it! I was really hoping to cross the Pacific with your group!”\n“Ah!” said the Honourable Mr. Batulcar. “You are no more Japanese than I am an ape! Why are you dressed in that manner?”\n“A man makes do with what he has for clothing.”\n“That's a fair point. You're French, aren't you?”\n“Yes; a Parisian from Paris.”\n“Then you should know how to pull faces?”\n“Well,” replied Passepartout, slightly annoyed that his nationality prompted this question, “it's true that we Frenchmen know how to make faces, but not any better than Americans do.”\n“Indeed. Alright, if I can't hire you as a servant, I can take you on as a clown. You see, my friend, in France they feature foreign clowns, and abroad they feature French clowns.”\n“Oh!”\n“You seem quite strong, eh?”\n“Especially after a good meal.”\n“And you can sing?”\n“Yes,” answered Passepartout, recalling his earlier days singing in the streets.\n“But can you sing while balancing on your head, with a top spinning on your left foot, and a sword poised on your right?”\n“Hmm! I believe so,” replied Passepartout, remembering the physical feats of his youth.\n“Well, that's sufficient,” said the Honourable William Batulcar.\nThe agreement was sealed immediately.\nPassepartout had finally secured employment.

This was the establishment of the Honourable William Batulcar, a showman resembling Barnum who led a troupe that included performers such as jugglers, clowns, acrobats, and gymnasts. A sign stated that the troupe would soon give their final shows before leaving Japan for America. Passepartout went inside and asked to see Mr. Batulcar, who promptly appeared. \"What do you need?\" Batulcar asked, at first thinking Passepartout was a local. Passepartout offered his services as a servant. Batulcar refused, joking that his two strong arms had served him faithfully and were all he needed. Disappointed, Passepartout remarked he wished he could cross the Pacific with the troupe. Batulcar, noticing Passepartout's disguise, deduced he was French, not Japanese, and asked if he was good at making funny faces, since French people were known for that. Passepartout agreed, though he pointed out Americans were just as skilled. Batulcar said he could at least take Passepartout as a clown, explaining that audiences liked to see foreign clowns, depending on the country. He questioned Passepartout's strength and singing ability, then challenged him further by asking if he could sing while standing on his head, spinning a top with one foot, and balancing a sabre with the other. Passepartout recalled his youthful days and believed he could manage. Satisfied, Batulcar hired him on the spot. Thus, Passepartout finally found employment, joining the famous Japanese troupe as a performer."

Passepartout, though he had not been able to study or rehearse a part, was designated to lend the aid of his sturdy shoulders in the great exhibition of the “human pyramid,” executed by the Long Noses of the god Tingou. This “great attraction” was to close the performance.\nBefore three o’clock the large shed was invaded by the spectators, comprising Europeans and natives, Chinese and Japanese, men, women and children, who precipitated themselves upon the narrow benches and into the boxes opposite the stage. The musicians took up a position inside, and were vigorously performing on their gongs, tam-tams, flutes, bones, tambourines, and immense drums.\nThe performance was much like all acrobatic displays; but it must be confessed that the Japanese are the first equilibrists in the world.\nOne, with a fan and some bits of paper, performed the graceful trick of the butterflies and the flowers; another traced in the air, with the odorous smoke of his pipe, a series of blue words, which composed a compliment to the audience; while a third juggled with some lighted candles, which he extinguished successively as they passed his lips, and relit again without interrupting for an instant his juggling. Another reproduced the most singular combinations with a spinning-top; in his hands the revolving tops seemed to be animated with a life of their own in their interminable whirling; they ran over pipe-stems, the edges of sabres, wires and even hairs stretched across the stage; they turned around on the edges of large glasses, crossed bamboo ladders, dispersed into all the corners, and produced strange musical effects by the combination of their various pitches of tone. The jugglers tossed them in the air, threw them like shuttlecocks with wooden battledores, and yet they kept on spinning; they put them into their pockets, and took them out still whirling as before.\nIt is useless to describe the astonishing performances of the acrobats and gymnasts. The turning on ladders, poles, balls, barrels, &c., was executed with wonderful precision.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Although it wasn't a particularly dignified job, Passepartout knew he would be heading to San Francisco within a week. The performance, heavily publicized by the Honourable Mr. Batulcar, was set to begin at three o'clock, and the loud sounds of a Japanese orchestra soon echoed from the entrance. Passepartout, despite having no time to learn or practice a role, was assigned to use his strong shoulders for the impressive \"human pyramid\" act, performed by the group known as the Long Noses of the god Tingou. This \"main attraction\" was scheduled to conclude the show. Before three o'clock, the large temporary building was packed with onlookers, including Europeans, natives, Chinese, and Japanese individuals of all ages, who quickly filled the narrow benches and the boxes facing the stage. The musicians positioned themselves inside and were energetically playing their gongs, tam-tams, flutes, bones, tambourines, and enormous drums. The show was similar to typical acrobatic displays, but it must be acknowledged that the Japanese are the best balance performers in the world. One performer used a fan and paper scraps to create a graceful illusion of butterflies and flowers; another formed a series of blue words in the air with fragrant pipe smoke, intended as a compliment to the audience; while a third juggled lit candles, extinguishing them one by one as they passed his lips and immediately relighting them without interrupting his juggling. Another artist produced remarkable routines with a spinning top; under his manipulation, the spinning tops seemed to possess their own vitality in their continuous motion; they moved along pipe stems, sword edges, wires, and even strands of hair stretched across the stage; they spun on the rims of large glasses, traversed bamboo ladders, spread into all areas, and created unique musical effects through the combined sounds of their various pitches. The performers tossed them into the air, hit them like shuttlecocks with wooden paddles, and they continued to spin; they even put them in their pockets and took them out still spinning as before. Describing the amazing feats of the other acrobats and gymnasts is unnecessary. Their balancing acts on ladders, poles, balls, barrels, and so forth, were executed with remarkable precision.",

The show, loudly introduced by the Honourable Mr. Batulcar, was scheduled to begin at three o’clock, heralded by the booming music of a Japanese orchestra outside. Passepartout, though he hadn’t learned or practiced any routines, was assigned to use his strong shoulders in the grand finale of the performance: participating in the 'human pyramid' performed by the Long Noses, devotees of the god Tingou. This act was to be the highlight that concluded the entertainment.\n\nBefore three o’clock, the large hall filled up with spectators—Europeans, locals, Chinese, Japanese, men, women, and children—who rushed to claim seats on the benches or in the boxes facing the stage. The musicians took their places inside, playing loudly on an array of instruments like gongs, tam-tams, flutes, bones, tambourines, and huge drums.\n\nThe show followed the traditional style of acrobatic exhibitions, yet it must be admitted that the Japanese excel as the world’s finest balance artists. One performer used a fan and scraps of paper to elegantly imitate butterflies among flowers. Another created blue letters in the air with fragrant pipe smoke, forming a compliment for the audience. A third expertly juggled lit candles, skillfully extinguishing each as it passed his lips and relighting them without once pausing in his act. Another acrobat performed fascinating feats with spinning-tops, making them appear almost alive as they spun endlessly—rolling across pipes, saber edges, wires, and even hairs strung across the stage. These tops spun on glass rims, traversed bamboo ladders, scattered throughout the stage’s corners, and produced unique musical tones by varying their pitches. The jugglers launched them into the air, bounced them with wooden paddles like shuttlecocks, and somehow kept them spinning the entire time—even when stuffed into pockets, they emerged still twirling.\n\nThere’s little need to detail the amazing stunts of the acrobats and gymnasts: their performances on ladders, poles, balls, barrels, and so on were all carried out with remarkable skill."

          "text_segment": "But the principal attraction was the exhibition of the Long Noses, a show to which Europe is as yet a stranger.\nThe Long Noses form a peculiar company, under the direct patronage of the god Tingou. Attired after the fashion of the Middle Ages, they bore upon their shoulders a splendid pair of wings; but what especially distinguished them was the long noses which were fastened to their faces, and the uses which they made of them. These noses were made of bamboo, and were five, six, and even ten feet long, some straight, others curved, some ribboned, and some having imitation warts upon them. It was upon these appendages, fixed tightly on their real noses, that they performed their gymnastic exercises. A dozen of these sectaries of Tingou lay flat upon their backs, while others, dressed to represent lightning-rods, came and frolicked on their noses, jumping from one to another, and performing the most skilful leapings and somersaults.\nAs a last scene, a “human pyramid” had been announced, in which fifty Long Noses were to represent the Car of Juggernaut. But, instead of forming a pyramid by mounting each other’s shoulders, the artists were to group themselves on top of the noses. It happened that the performer who had hitherto formed the base of the Car had quitted the troupe, and as, to fill this part, only strength and adroitness were necessary, Passepartout had been chosen to take his place.\nThe poor fellow really felt sad when—melancholy reminiscence of his youth!—he donned his costume, adorned with vari-coloured wings, and fastened to his natural feature a false nose six feet long. But he cheered up when he thought that this nose was winning him something to eat.\nHe went upon the stage, and took his place beside the rest who were to compose the base of the Car of Juggernaut. They all stretched themselves on the floor, their noses pointing to the ceiling. A second group of artists disposed themselves on these long appendages, then a third above these, then a fourth, until a human monument reaching to the very cornices of the theatre soon arose on top of the noses. This elicited loud applause, in the midst of which the orchestra was just striking up a deafening air, when the pyramid tottered, the balance was lost, one of the lower noses vanished from the pyramid, and the human monument was shattered like a castle built of cards!\nIt was Passepartout’s fault. Abandoning his position, clearing the footlights without the aid of his wings, and, clambering up to the right-hand gallery, he fell at the feet of one of the spectators, crying, “Ah, my master! my master!”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The main spectacle was the Long Noses exhibition, a performance style completely unknown in Europe. This unusual company, reportedly sponsored by the god Tingou, wore attire reminiscent of the Middle Ages and had impressive wings on their shoulders. However, their most striking feature was the long, artificial noses attached to their faces, and the way they used them. These noses, made of bamboo, measured five, six, or even ten feet in length, varying in shape – some straight, others curved, some adorned with ribbons or fake warts. It was on these appendages, securely fastened over their actual noses, that they performed their acrobatic routines. For instance, a dozen performers would lie flat on their backs, while others, dressed as lightning rods, would jump, frolic, and execute skilled leaps and somersaults on the noses of those lying down. The grand finale announced was a “human pyramid,” featuring fifty Long Noses who were to represent the Car of Juggernaut. Instead of stacking themselves on shoulders, the artists would arrange themselves on top of the noses. Since the performer who usually formed the base of the Car had left the troupe, and the role primarily required strength and agility, Passepartout was chosen to fill the vacant spot. The poor man felt genuinely saddened—a sorrowful memory of his younger days!—when he donned the costume with multi-coloured wings and attached a six-foot fake nose to his face. Yet, he brightened up at the thought that this nose would earn him something to eat. He stepped onto the stage and took his position alongside the others forming the base of the Car of Juggernaut. They all lay down on the floor, their noses pointing towards the ceiling. A second group of artists then positioned themselves on these long appendages, followed by a third group above them, and then a fourth, until a human structure reaching almost to the theatre's upper edge rose on top of the noses. This drew loud applause, and as the orchestra began playing a deafening tune, the pyramid swayed, lost its balance, one of the bottom noses disappeared from the formation, and the entire human structure shattered like a castle made of cards! It was Passepartout’s fault. Abandoning his place, he leapt over the footlights without using his wings, climbed up to the right-hand gallery, and fell at the feet of a spectator, crying out, “Ah, my master! my master!”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "However, the main draw was the performance by the Long Noses, an act still unfamiliar to European audiences. This unique group, who received the blessing of the god Tingou, wore medieval-style costumes complete with elaborate wings attached to their backs. Their most remarkable feature, though, were the lengthy bamboo noses affixed to their faces, measuring from five to as much as ten feet, sometimes straight, sometimes curved, some decorated with ribbons or bumps. These extensions served as apparatuses for their acrobatic feats. A dozen worshippers of Tingou would lie on their backs while others, costumed as lightning rods, performed on the noses—leaping, flipping, and showing off their agility as they bounced from one to another. The grand finale was the construction of a 'human pyramid,' intended to depict the Car of Juggernaut. Rather than climbing atop each other's shoulders, performers were to stack themselves atop the bamboo noses. Since the usual base had left the troupe and the role required only strength and skill, Passepartout was selected to fill in. Though donning the colorful, winged outfit and attaching a six-foot nose brought back sad memories of his past, he took heart knowing the performance would earn him his supper. He positioned himself on stage alongside the others forming the pyramid's foundation, all lying on the ground with noses raised skyward. More performers climbed atop these noses, and then others above them, so that soon a towering structure reaching to the theater's cornice was assembled. The audience applauded raucously, but just as the orchestra began a loud tune, the pyramid wobbled—a lower nose slipped from its place, and the whole human construction collapsed as if it were a house of cards. Passepartout was to blame; he had left his spot, vaulted over the stage lights, hurried up to the gallery, and flung himself at one of the theatergoers, exclaiming, “Ah, my master! my master!”"

The “General Grant” passed, on the 23rd of November, the one hundred and eightieth meridian, and was at the very antipodes of London. Mr. Fogg had, it is true, exhausted fifty-two of the eighty days in which he was to complete the tour, and there were only twenty-eight left. But, though he was only half-way by the difference of meridians, he had really gone over two-thirds of the whole journey; for he had been obliged to make long circuits from London to Aden, from Aden to Bombay, from Calcutta to Singapore, and from Singapore to Yokohama. Could he have followed without deviation the fiftieth parallel, which is that of London, the whole distance would only have been about twelve thousand miles; whereas he would be forced, by the irregular methods of locomotion, to traverse twenty-six thousand, of which he had, on the 23rd of November, accomplished seventeen thousand five hundred. And now the course was a straight one, and Fix was no longer there to put obstacles in their way!\nIt happened also, on the 23rd of November, that Passepartout made a joyful discovery. It will be remembered that the obstinate fellow had insisted on keeping his famous family watch at London time, and on regarding that of the countries he had passed through as quite false and unreliable. Now, on this day, though he had not changed the hands, he found that his watch exactly agreed with the ship’s chronometers. His triumph was hilarious. He would have liked to know what Fix would say if he were aboard!\n“The rogue told me a lot of stories,” repeated Passepartout, “about the meridians, the sun, and the moon! Moon, indeed! moonshine more likely! If one listened to that sort of people, a pretty sort of time one would keep! I was sure that the sun would some day regulate itself by my watch!”\nPassepartout was ignorant that, if the face of his watch had been divided into twenty-four hours, like the Italian clocks, he would have no reason for exultation; for the hands of his watch would then, instead of as now indicating nine o’clock in the morning, indicate nine o’clock in the evening, that is, the twenty-first hour after midnight precisely the difference between London time and that of the one hundred and eightieth meridian. But if Fix had been able to explain this purely physical effect, Passepartout would not have admitted, even if he had comprehended it. Moreover, if the detective had been on board at that moment, Passepartout would have joined issue with him on a quite different subject, and in an entirely different manner.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "After nine days at sea since departing Yokohama, Phileas Fogg had completed precisely half of his journey around the world. On November 23rd, the 'General Grant' ship crossed the 180th meridian, placing them exactly on the opposite side of the globe from London. While it was true that Mr. Fogg had used up fifty-two of the eighty days allotted for the trip, leaving only twenty-eight remaining, his progress in terms of distance was further ahead. Though only halfway based on longitude, he had actually covered roughly two-thirds of the total planned distance because he had been compelled to take extended routes from London to Aden, Aden to Bombay, Calcutta to Singapore, and Singapore to Yokohama. Had he been able to travel a direct path along the 50th parallel (London's latitude), the total distance would have been around twelve thousand miles. However, due to the required modes of travel, the actual route necessitated covering about twenty-six thousand miles, of which he had successfully navigated seventeen thousand five hundred by November 23rd. From this point forward, the path was straight, and without Fix present, there were no longer any deliberate hindrances in their way.\n\nAlso on November 23rd, Passepartout made a delightful discovery. It's worth noting that the stubborn fellow had insisted on keeping his well-known family watch set to London time throughout the journey, dismissing the local times of the places they visited as incorrect. However, on this particular day, without having adjusted the hands, he noticed his watch perfectly matched the ship's chronometers. His joy was immense. He expressed how he wished Fix could have witnessed this moment.\n\n“That swindler told me so many tall tales,” Passepartout muttered, “about meridians, the sun, and the moon! The moon, honestly! More likely nonsense! If anyone listened to people like that, what a mess of timekeeping they’d have! I knew the sun would eventually align itself with my watch!”\n\nPassepartout was unaware that his elation stemmed from a simple physical phenomenon. Had his watch face been marked with twenty-four hours, like Italian clocks, it would have shown nine o'clock in the evening (the twenty-first hour), rather than nine o'clock in the morning, exactly representing the twelve-hour difference between London and the 180th meridian. Even if Fix had been able to explain this straightforward effect, Passepartout would likely not have accepted it, even if he understood. Furthermore, had the detective been on board at that moment, Passepartout would have undoubtedly engaged him in a completely different argument, and in a completely different manner.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Nine days after departing Yokohama, Phileas Fogg had reached the halfway mark around the world. On November 23rd, the General Grant crossed the 180th meridian, placing it directly opposite London on the globe. Fogg had already used up fifty-two of the eighty days allotted for his journey, leaving twenty-eight days to finish. Although geographically at the halfway point, Fogg had actually traveled two-thirds of the entire route due to several long detours—from London to Aden, Aden to Bombay, Calcutta to Singapore, and Singapore to Yokohama. Had he been able to follow the straight forty-ninth parallel, like London's latitude, the trip would have been roughly twelve thousand miles, but the roundabout routes required him to travel twenty-six thousand miles, seventeen thousand five hundred of which he had completed by November 23rd. Now, the journey ahead was direct and there were no more disruptions from Fix. That same day, Passepartout was delighted to find that his trusty watch, which he had stubbornly kept on London time, now matched the ship's clocks exactly. He was amused by this and wondered what Fix would say if he were still with them. Passepartout recalled all the stories Fix had told him about time and the sun and dismissed them, feeling vindicated that his watch had proven reliable. Unbeknownst to Passepartout, had his watch used a twenty-four-hour format, it would have shown nine o’clock in the evening instead of the morning, matching the time shift between London and the 180th meridian. Even if Fix could have explained this scientific fact, Passepartout would not have accepted it. Furthermore, if Fix had been aboard, Passepartout would have argued a different issue altogether."

Put out of countenance by the manner in which he thus “set foot” upon the New World, he uttered a loud cry, which so frightened the innumerable cormorants and pelicans that are always perched upon these movable quays, that they flew noisily away.\nMr. Fogg, on reaching shore, proceeded to find out at what hour the first train left for New York, and learned that this was at six o’clock p.m.; he had, therefore, an entire day to spend in the Californian capital. Taking a carriage at a charge of three dollars, he and Aouda entered it, while Passepartout mounted the box beside the driver, and they set out for the International Hotel.\nFrom his exalted position Passepartout observed with much curiosity the wide streets, the low, evenly ranged houses, the Anglo-Saxon Gothic churches, the great docks, the palatial wooden and brick warehouses, the numerous conveyances, omnibuses, horse-cars, and upon the side-walks, not only Americans and Europeans, but Chinese and Indians. Passepartout was surprised at all he saw. San Francisco was no longer the legendary city of 1849—a city of banditti, assassins, and incendiaries, who had flocked hither in crowds in pursuit of plunder; a paradise of outlaws, where they gambled with gold-dust, a revolver in one hand and a bowie-knife in the other: it was now a great commercial emporium.\n",

This cry startled the many cormorants and pelicans constantly perched on the movable docks, causing them to fly away noisily. Upon reaching the shore, Mr. Fogg immediately sought information about the departure time of the first train heading to New York. He discovered it was scheduled for six o'clock in the evening, leaving him an entire day to spend in the capital of California. Hiring a carriage for three dollars, he and Aouda got inside, while Passepartout took a seat next to the driver on the box. They then proceeded towards the International Hotel. From his elevated perch, Passepartout curiously observed the wide streets, the uniformly low houses, the Anglo-Saxon Gothic-style churches, the large docks, the grand wooden and brick warehouses, the many types of transport including omnibuses and horse-drawn cars, and the people on the sidewalks, who were not only Americans and Europeans but also Chinese and Indians. Passepartout was astonished by everything he saw. San Francisco was no longer the fabled city of 1849—a place known for bandits, murderers, and arsonists who had gathered there in search of loot; a haven for criminals where they gambled with gold dust, holding a revolver in one hand and a bowie knife in the other.

He hired a carriage for three dollars, and set off to the International Hotel with Aouda while Passepartout rode up front with the driver. \n\nAs they journeyed through the city, Passepartout, from his elevated seat, eagerly took in the sights: the broad avenues, the uniformly constructed low houses, the Gothic churches typical of Anglo-Saxon architecture, the impressive docks, grand warehouses made of wood and brick, the many types of vehicles, omnibuses, and horse-cars, and on the sidewalks, he saw not only Americans and Europeans, but also Chinese and Native Americans. Everything was a surprise to Passepartout. San Francisco was no longer the wild and lawless city of 1849, teeming with criminals and fortune-seekers, where people gambled with gold-dust, brandishing pistols and knives. Instead, it had become a major center of commerce."

Opposite them, on the other side of the street, between a coal wharf and a petroleum warehouse, a large platform had been erected in the open air, towards which the current of the crowd seemed to be directed.\nFor what purpose was this meeting? What was the occasion of this excited assemblage? Phileas Fogg could not imagine. Was it to nominate some high official—a governor or member of Congress? It was not improbable, so agitated was the multitude before them.\nJust at this moment there was an unusual stir in the human mass. All the hands were raised in the air. Some, tightly closed, seemed to disappear suddenly in the midst of the cries—an energetic way, no doubt, of casting a vote. The crowd swayed back, the banners and flags wavered, disappeared an instant, then reappeared in tatters.

Fix, speculating it was a political rally, advised Mr. Fogg, \"Perhaps we should avoid joining the throng. There might be risks involved.\" Mr. Fogg responded, \"Indeed, and impacts, regardless of their political nature, are still impacts.\" Fix subtly smiled at this comment. To get a better view without being shoved, the group positioned themselves at the top of a set of stairs at the far end of Montgomery Street. Opposite them, across the road, between a coal yard and an oil storehouse, a large outdoor stage had been constructed, towards which the mass of people seemed to be gravitating. Phileas Fogg was puzzled as to the purpose of this assembly and the reason for the intense excitement.

At that exact moment, a significant commotion rippled through the crowd. Everyone's hands went up; some, clenched tightly, appeared to vanish abruptly amidst the noise – likely a forceful method of casting a vote. The crowd surged backward, flags and banners swayed, briefly disappearing before reappearing tattered. The waves of people reached the steps, their heads bobbing on the surface like a rough sea during a storm.

It was clear one group had been pushed back, but bystanders couldn’t tell if it was Mandiboy or Camerfield’s supporters who had won. \n\n“We should get out of here,” Fix urged, worried about Mr. Fogg’s safety, at least until they returned to London. “If anything here is about England and we are recognized, we could be in trouble.”\n\n“An English citizen—” Mr. Fogg began, but he couldn’t finish because a wild uproar broke out behind them, with people shouting “Hurrah for Mandiboy! Hip, hip, hurrah!”\n\nVoters backing Mandiboy had arrived to support their friends, attacking Camerfield’s group from the side. Trapped between two fighting crowds, Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Fix could not escape. The rush of armed men was overwhelming. Fogg and Fix struggled to shield Aouda, with Mr. Fogg remaining calm and trying to fend off attackers with his fists, but it was hopeless. Suddenly, a large, red-bearded man, apparently the leader, tried to punch Mr. Fogg, but Fix stepped in and was struck instead, receiving a painful bruise and a smashed hat.\n\n\"Yankee!\" Mr. Fogg exclaimed angrily at the attacker.\n\n\"Englishman!\" the other replied. \"We shall meet again!\"\n\n\"Whenever you wish.\"\n\n\"Your name?\"\n\n\"Phileas Fogg. And yours?\"\n\n\"Colonel Stamp Proctor.\""

          "text_segment": "“From ocean to ocean”—so say the Americans; and these four words compose the general designation of the “great trunk line” which crosses the entire width of the United States. The Pacific Railroad is, however, really divided into two distinct lines: the Central Pacific, between San Francisco and Ogden, and the Union Pacific, between Ogden and Omaha. Five main lines connect Omaha with New York.\nNew York and San Francisco are thus united by an uninterrupted metal ribbon, which measures no less than three thousand seven hundred and eighty-six miles. Between Omaha and the Pacific the railway crosses a territory which is still infested by Indians and wild beasts, and a large tract which the Mormons, after they were driven from Illinois in 1845, began to colonise.\nThe journey from New York to San Francisco consumed, formerly, under the most favourable conditions, at least six months. It is now accomplished in seven days.\nIt was in 1862 that, in spite of the Southern Members of Congress, who wished a more southerly route, it was decided to lay the road between the forty-first and forty-second parallels. President Lincoln himself fixed the end of the line at Omaha, in Nebraska. The work was at once commenced, and pursued with true American energy; nor did the rapidity with which it went on injuriously affect its good execution. The road grew, on the prairies, a mile and a half a day. A locomotive, running on the rails laid down the evening before, brought the rails to be laid on the morrow, and advanced upon them as fast as they were put in position.\nThe Pacific Railroad is joined by several branches in Iowa, Kansas, Colorado, and Oregon. On leaving Omaha, it passes along the left bank of the Platte River as far as the junction of its northern branch, follows its southern branch, crosses the Laramie territory and the Wahsatch Mountains, turns the Great Salt Lake, and reaches Salt Lake City, the Mormon capital, plunges into the Tuilla Valley, across the American Desert, Cedar and Humboldt Mountains, the Sierra Nevada, and descends, viâ Sacramento, to the Pacific—its grade, even on the Rocky Mountains, never exceeding one hundred and twelve feet to the mile.\nSuch was the road to be traversed in seven days, which would enable Phileas Fogg—at least, so he hoped—to take the Atlantic steamer at New York on the 11th for Liverpool.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Americans often refer to it as \"From ocean to ocean\"; this phrase serves as the common name for the expansive main railway line that spans the entire width of the United States. However, the Pacific Railroad is actually composed of two separate sections: the Central Pacific, running between San Francisco and Ogden, and the Union Pacific, extending from Ogden to Omaha. Five distinct main routes link Omaha to New York.\nThus, New York and San Francisco are joined by an unbroken stretch of railway track measuring a substantial three thousand seven hundred and eighty-six miles. The area traversed by the railway between Omaha and the Pacific is still populated by Native American tribes and wild animals, and includes a large region that was settled by the Mormons after they were expelled from Illinois in 1845.\nPreviously, traveling from New York to San Francisco took at least six months, even under the most favourable conditions. This same journey can now be completed in just seven days.\nIn 1862, despite opposition from Southern Congressmen who preferred a more southerly alignment, the decision was made to build the line between the forty-first and forty-second parallels. President Lincoln personally designated Omaha, Nebraska, as the railway's eastern endpoint. Construction began immediately and was carried out with characteristic American energy and speed; remarkably, the rapid progress did not compromise the quality of the work. The track was extended across the prairies at a rate of one and a half miles per day. A locomotive, operating on the rails laid the previous evening, would deliver the materials needed for the next day and advance along the track as it was being put into place.\nThe Pacific Railroad is connected by several branch lines in Iowa, Kansas, Colorado, and Oregon. Leaving Omaha, the route follows the left bank of the Platte River until it meets its northern fork, then follows the southern fork. It crosses the Laramie territory and the Wahsatch Mountains, goes around the Great Salt Lake to reach Salt Lake City, the Mormon capital. It then proceeds through the Tuilla Valley, across the American Desert, the Cedar and Humboldt Mountains, and the Sierra Nevada, before descending via Sacramento to the Pacific coast. Even in the Rocky Mountains, the slope never exceeds one hundred and twelve feet per mile.\nThis was the seven-day route that Phileas Fogg planned to take, hoping it would allow him to board the Atlantic steamer in New York on the 11th bound for Liverpool.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Americans often refer to their vast transcontinental railway as stretching \"from ocean to ocean.\" This phrase generally describes the major railroad that spans the United States from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The Pacific Railroad, though often thought of as a single route, is actually made up of two separate sections: the Central Pacific, between San Francisco and Ogden, and the Union Pacific, between Ogden and Omaha. From Omaha, five significant rail lines connect all the way to New York. As a result, New York and San Francisco are linked by a continuous rail line that is 3,786 miles long. On the section between Omaha and the Pacific, the railroad passes through lands still home to wild animals and Native Americans, as well as through areas settled by Mormons after they left Illinois in 1845. Previously, traveling from New York to San Francisco would have taken at least six months under optimal conditions, but now the trip can be made in just seven days. The route itself was chosen in 1862, despite opposition from Southern Congress members who preferred a more southern path. President Lincoln selected Omaha, Nebraska as an endpoint, and construction began immediately, carried out with notable American zeal and efficiency—at a rate of about one and a half miles per day. Trains delivered new rails to the latest completed section, enabling work to continue at a rapid pace. Several branch lines connect to the main railroad from Iowa, Kansas, Colorado, and Oregon. Leaving Omaha, the railway runs alongside the Platte River, passes through the Laramie territory and the Wahsatch Mountains, skirts the Great Salt Lake to reach Salt Lake City, continues over the American Desert, the Cedar and Humboldt Mountains, then climbs the Sierra Nevada before descending via Sacramento to the Pacific, always maintaining a gentle gradient—even across the Rocky Mountains, the steepest incline is only 112 feet per mile. This was the route that Phileas Fogg intended to cross in seven days, hoping to arrive in New York in time to catch the Atlantic steamer sailing for Liverpool on the 11th."

At eight o'clock, a steward entered the carriage to announce that it was time for bed, and in just a few minutes, the car was transformed into a sleeping compartment. The backs of the seats were folded down, cleverly stored beds were wheeled out, temporary sleeping spaces were quickly set up, and soon each passenger had a comfortable bed at their disposal, shielded from view by thick curtains. The bedding was clean and the pillows soft. All that remained was to lie down and sleep, which everyone did, as the train continued its journey across the state of California.",

After what had happened, their relationship had become distant; any former friendliness or closeness was gone. Fix behaved as usual, but Passepartout was withdrawn, feeling so tense he could have attacked his former friend if provoked. About an hour after they left, it began to snow lightly, though fortunately not enough to stop the train. Outside, all that could be seen was a wide expanse of white, the train’s smoke showing gray against the snow. At eight, a steward came into the carriage and said it was bedtime. In a short time, the carriage was turned into a sleeping area: seats were laid back, beds unfolded, berths were set up, and everyone soon had a cozy bed with thick curtains for privacy. The sheets were fresh, and the pillows were soft. All that was left was to go to sleep—which everyone did as the train continued across California."

          "text_segment": "The train entered the State of Nevada through the Carson Valley about nine o’clock, going always northeasterly; and at midday reached Reno, where there was a delay of twenty minutes for breakfast.\nFrom this point the road, running along Humboldt River, passed northward for several miles by its banks; then it turned eastward, and kept by the river until it reached the Humboldt Range, nearly at the extreme eastern limit of Nevada.\nHaving breakfasted, Mr. Fogg and his companions resumed their places in the car, and observed the varied landscape which unfolded itself as they passed along the vast prairies, the mountains lining the horizon, and the creeks, with their frothy, foaming streams. Sometimes a great herd of buffaloes, massing together in the distance, seemed like a moveable dam. These innumerable multitudes of ruminating beasts often form an insurmountable obstacle to the passage of the trains; thousands of them have been seen passing over the track for hours together, in compact ranks. The locomotive is then forced to stop and wait till the road is once more clear.\nThis happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling. About twelve o’clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to clear the way with its cow-catcher; but the mass of animals was too great. The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now and then deafening bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain.\nThe travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had the most reason of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should please the buffaloes to get out of the way.\nPassepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon them.\n“What a country!” cried he. “Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession, just as if they were not impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme! And here’s an engineer who doesn’t dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts!”\nThe engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle, and he was wise. He would have crushed the first buffaloes, no doubt, with the cow-catcher; but the locomotive, however powerful, would soon have been checked, the train would inevitably have been thrown off the track, and would then have been helpless.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Around nine in the morning, the train entered Nevada through the Carson Valley, continuing its journey northeastward. By midday, it arrived in Reno, where there was a twenty-minute break for breakfast. From Reno, the railway line followed the Humboldt River northward for several miles before turning east and running alongside the river until it reached the Humboldt Range, situated near the eastern edge of Nevada. After their meal, Mr. Fogg and his companions returned to their seats in the carriage and observed the changing scenery outside. As they travelled across the vast prairies, they saw mountains on the horizon and frothy, fast-flowing creeks. Occasionally, a large group of buffalo gathered in the distance, resembling a moving barrier. These enormous numbers of grazing animals frequently create an impassable obstruction for trains; it's not uncommon to see thousands of them crossing the tracks in dense formations for hours at a time. In such cases, the locomotive is forced to halt and wait for the track to clear. This very situation occurred with the train carrying Mr. Fogg. Around noon, the track was blocked by a herd estimated to be ten to twelve thousand buffalo. The locomotive slowed down and attempted to push them aside with its cow-catcher, but the sheer size of the herd was too great. The buffaloes walked on calmly, occasionally letting out loud bellows. Trying to force them to move was futile because once they set a direction, nothing can easily alter or stop their course; they are like a powerful current of living bodies that no barrier could hold back. While most passengers watched this unusual sight from the platforms, Phileas Fogg, who had the most urgent need to be on time, remained seated and calmly waited for the buffaloes to eventually leave the track. Passepartout was greatly annoyed by the delay and wished he could use his revolvers on the animals. \"What a country!\" he exclaimed. \"Just plain cattle stopping trains and walking past in a procession as if they weren't causing any trouble! Blast it all! I'd like to know if Mr. Fogg included this kind of problem in his schedule! And look at this engineer who's afraid to drive the locomotive into this mass of animals!\" The engineer wisely chose not to try and overcome the obstacle. While he might have crushed the first few buffaloes with the cow-catcher, the locomotive, no matter how strong, would soon have been stopped, inevitably causing the train to derail and become stranded.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Around nine o'clock, the train crossed into Nevada via Carson Valley, heading consistently northeast, and stopped in Reno around midday for a twenty-minute breakfast break. Afterward, the train followed the Humboldt River north for a while before turning east alongside the river all the way to the Humboldt Range near Nevada's eastern border. Once they had eaten, Mr. Fogg and his party returned to their seats and watched the changing scenery of open prairies, mountains, and foaming creeks. Occasionally, they saw huge herds of buffalo in the distance, moving together like a living barrier. These vast groups of animals sometimes block train tracks for hours, with thousands walking across in tight formation. When this happens, the train has no choice but to stop until the herd passes.\n\nSuch an event occurred on Mr. Fogg's journey around noon, when a herd of ten to twelve thousand buffalo blocked their way. The train slowed and tried to use its cow-catcher to move them, but there were simply too many animals. The buffalo advanced calmly, letting out loud bellows. There was no way to influence them—they moved like an unstoppable river of creatures. The travelers watched from the platforms in fascination, but Fogg, who was most concerned about keeping to schedule, stayed in his seat, waiting patiently for the animals to move on.\n\nPassepartout, however, was frustrated by the hold-up and wished he could use his guns on the herd. “What a country!” he exclaimed. “Cattle block the trains as if they own the tracks! I wonder if Mr. Fogg anticipated this in his plans! And the engineer won’t even try to drive through them!”\n\nBut the engineer wisely chose not to force a passage. If he had tried, the locomotive could have struck and killed a few buffalo, but the train would quickly be halted, potentially derailed, and left stranded."

Who dares to say the contrary?”\nNo one ventured to gainsay the missionary, whose excited tone contrasted curiously with his naturally calm visage. No doubt his anger arose from the hardships to which the Mormons were actually subjected. The government had just succeeded, with some difficulty, in reducing these independent fanatics to its rule. It had made itself master of Utah, and subjected that territory to the laws of the Union, after imprisoning Brigham Young on a charge of rebellion and polygamy. The disciples of the prophet had since redoubled their efforts, and resisted, by words at least, the authority of Congress. Elder Hitch, as is seen, was trying to make proselytes on the very railway trains.\nThen, emphasising his words with his loud voice and frequent gestures, he related the history of the Mormons from Biblical times: how that, in Israel, a Mormon prophet of the tribe of Joseph published the annals of the new religion, and bequeathed them to his son Mormon; how, many centuries later, a translation of this precious book, which was written in Egyptian, was made by Joseph Smith, junior, a Vermont farmer, who revealed himself as a mystical prophet in 1825; and how, in short, the celestial messenger appeared to him in an illuminated forest, and gave him the annals of the Lord.\nSeveral of the audience, not being much interested in the missionary’s narrative, here left the car; but Elder Hitch, continuing his lecture, related how Smith, junior, with his father, two brothers, and a few disciples, founded the church of the “Latter Day Saints,” which, adopted not only in America, but in England, Norway and Sweden, and Germany, counts many artisans, as well as men engaged in the liberal professions, among its members; how a colony was established in Ohio, a temple erected there at a cost of two hundred thousand dollars, and a town built at Kirkland; how Smith became an enterprising banker, and received from a simple mummy showman a papyrus scroll written by Abraham and several famous Egyptians.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Word quickly got around the train, which carried about a hundred passengers. Of these, maybe thirty were attracted by the announcement and settled into car No. 117. Passepartout took a seat near the front. Neither Mr. Fogg nor Fix seemed interested in attending. At the scheduled time, Elder William Hitch stood up. Speaking in an annoyed tone, as if already contradicted, he stated, “I declare that Joe Smith is a martyr, his brother Hiram is a martyr, and the persecutions by the United States Government against the prophets will also make Brigham Young a martyr. Who dares to challenge this?” No one ventured to dispute the missionary, whose agitated voice sharply contrasted with his naturally calm face. His irritation likely stemmed from the hardships the Mormons were currently experiencing. The government had recently managed, with some effort, to bring these independent religious enthusiasts under its rule. It had taken control of Utah and subjected that territory to the laws of the Union, after imprisoning Brigham Young on accusations of rebellion and having multiple wives. Since then, the prophet's followers had intensified their resistance, at least verbally, to the authority of Congress. As is evident, Elder Hitch was attempting to gain converts right there on the trains. Then, emphasizing his points with his loud voice and frequent hand movements, he recounted the history of the Mormons from ancient times: how, in Israel, a Mormon prophet from the tribe of Joseph documented the history of the new faith and passed it down to his son Mormon; how, centuries later, a translation of this precious book, originally in Egyptian, was made by Joseph Smith, junior, a farmer from Vermont, who presented himself as a spiritual prophet in 1825; and ultimately, how a celestial messenger appeared to him in a brightly lit forest and gave him the records of the Lord. Several members of the audience, not particularly interested in the missionary’s account, left the car at this point; but Elder Hitch continued his discourse, explaining how Smith, junior, along with his father, two brothers, and a few disciples, founded the church of the “Latter Day Saints,” which, adopted not only in America but also in England, Norway and Sweden, and Germany, includes many working people as well as those in professional fields among its members; how a colony was established in Ohio, a temple built there at a cost of two hundred thousand dollars, and a town founded at Kirkland; how Smith became an active banker, and acquired from a simple vendor of mummies a papyrus scroll allegedly written by Abraham and several other notable Egyptians.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Word of the event rapidly circulated among the roughly one hundred train passengers, though only about thirty, curious after reading the notice, gathered in car number 117. Passepartout sat near the front, while Mr. Fogg and Fix chose not to attend. At the scheduled time, Elder William Hitch stood up and, sounding agitated as if expecting opposition, declared, “Joe Smith is a martyr; his brother Hiram is a martyr, and the persecution of the United States Government will also make Brigham Young a martyr. Who will dare disagree?” No one answered, as the missionary’s fervent manner stood out against his otherwise calm appearance, likely fueled by the genuine hardships facing the Mormons. The government had only just managed, after some difficulty, to bring these independent zealots under its control, asserting authority over Utah, enforcing federal law, and imprisoning Brigham Young for alleged rebellion and polygamy. In response, the followers of the Mormon prophet had increased their resistance—at least verbally—toward Congress. Elder Hitch, as shown, was eager to recruit new converts even during the train journey.\n\nHe then passionately recounted Mormon history: describing how, according to their tradition, in biblical times a prophet from the tribe of Joseph wrote the foundation of the faith and left it to his son Mormon; and how, centuries later, Joseph Smith Jr., a Vermont farmer, translated this sacred text written in Egyptian after a divine encounter in a glowing forest in 1825, and received the records directly from a heavenly messenger. Some listeners lost interest and left, but Elder Hitch pressed on, telling how Smith, along with his family and disciples, established the Church of the Latter Day Saints—a movement that gained followers not only in America but also in England, Norway, Sweden, and Germany, including many skilled workers and professionals. He described their settlement in Ohio, the expensive construction of a temple, the founding of the town of Kirkland, Smith’s ventures into banking, and his acquisition of ancient papyrus writings from a travelling mummy exhibitor."

It is a picturesque expanse, framed in lofty crags in large strata, encrusted with white salt—a superb sheet of water, which was formerly of larger extent than now, its shores having encroached with the lapse of time, and thus at once reduced its breadth and increased its depth.\nThe Salt Lake, seventy miles long and thirty-five wide, is situated three miles eight hundred feet above the sea. Quite different from Lake Asphaltite, whose depression is twelve hundred feet below the sea, it contains considerable salt, and one quarter of the weight of its water is solid matter, its specific weight being 1,170, and, after being distilled, 1,000. Fishes are, of course, unable to live in it, and those which descend through the Jordan, the Weber, and other streams soon perish.\nThe country around the lake was well cultivated, for the Mormons are mostly farmers; while ranches and pens for domesticated animals, fields of wheat, corn, and other cereals, luxuriant prairies, hedges of wild rose, clumps of acacias and milk-wort, would have been seen six months later.

It offers a scenic view, bordered by high, stratified cliffs covered in a crust of white salt—a magnificent sheet of water. It was formerly more extensive than it is currently; its shores have contracted with the passage of time, thus simultaneously decreasing its width and increasing its depth.

Up to Great Salt Lake, the railroad had reached its highest point; beyond this, it curved downward into Bitter Creek Valley before climbing again over the watershed dividing the Atlantic and Pacific drainages.

Aouda understood whist sufficiently well, and even received some compliments on her playing from Mr. Fogg. As for the detective, he was simply an adept, and worthy of being matched against his present opponent.\n“Now,” thought Passepartout, “we’ve got him. He won’t budge.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The conversation ceased. Mr. Fogg, having recently woken, was observing the scenery outside the window. Soon after, Passepartout, unheard by his employer or Aouda, quietly inquired of the detective, \"Would you actually protect him in a fight?\" \"I would do anything,\" Fix replied with a voice full of resolve, \"to see him returned alive to Europe!\" A shiver ran through Passepartout, but his trust in his master remained complete. Was there a way to keep Mr. Fogg inside the carriage to avoid him encountering the colonel? This shouldn't be too difficult, given Mr. Fogg's naturally inactive and incurious disposition. The detective, at least, seemed to have conceived a plan; after a few moments, he remarked to Mr. Fogg, \"These hours on the train feel very extended and slow, sir.\" \"Yes,\" Mr. Fogg acknowledged; \"but time passes.\" \"You were accustomed to playing whist,\" Fix continued, \"when you were on the steamers.\" \"Yes; but that would be hard here. I have neither cards nor partners.\" \"Oh, we can easily get some cards, as they're sold on all American trains. And regarding partners, if the lady plays—\" \"Certainly, sir,\" Aouda quickly responded; \"I understand whist. It is a required part of an English education.\" \"I myself feel I play quite well. Well, here we have three of us, plus a dummy hand—\" \"As you wish, sir,\" Phileas Fogg replied, genuinely happy to resume his favourite leisure activity even while on the railway. Passepartout was sent to find the steward and quickly came back with two decks of cards, some pins, counters, and a cloth-covered playing board. The game began. Aouda played whist competently, even receiving praise for her play from Mr. Fogg. As for the detective, he was clearly skilled, a worthy adversary for his current opponent. \"Now,\" thought Passepartout, \"we have him occupied. He won't leave his seat.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The conversation ended as Mr. Fogg, having just woken up, gazed out the window. Not long after, Passepartout quietly whispered to the detective, out of earshot of Mr. Fogg and Aouda, \"Would you truly defend him?\" Fix replied, showing resolve in his voice, \"I would do anything to bring him back alive to Europe!\" Passepartout felt a chill run through him but continued to trust his master. He wondered if there was a way to keep Mr. Fogg in the train car and avoid him encountering the colonel, which shouldn't be hard given Fogg's calm and uncurious nature. The detective seemed to have come up with a solution, for after a while he said, \"These hours on the railway are quite long and dull, sir.\" Mr. Fogg agreed but added that they still pass. Fix brought up playing whist, as they used to on the steamers. Mr. Fogg mentioned lacking cards and players, but Fix responded that cards could be easily bought on American trains and, if Aouda played, they would have enough people. Aouda confirmed that she did indeed play whist, as part of her English upbringing. Fix added that he played well too, so with the three of them and a dummy, they could begin. Mr. Fogg happily agreed, pleased to resume his favorite game. Passepartout went to find the steward and soon returned with two decks of cards, some counters, pins, and a cloth-covered shelf. They started playing, with Aouda performing well enough to earn praise from Mr. Fogg, while Fix proved to be a skilled player himself. Watching this, Passepartout thought, \"Now we have him. He won't be leaving.\""

Although ready to attempt anything to cross Medicine Creek, he found the suggested experiment excessively bold, perhaps typically American. “Besides,” he thought, “there’s a much simpler way, and it hasn't occurred to any of them! Sir,” he said aloud to a passenger, “the engineer’s plan seems a bit hazardous to me, but—” “Eighty percent chance!” the passenger interrupted, turning his back. “I know,” said Passepartout, turning to another passenger, “but a straightforward idea—” “Ideas are useless,” the American replied, shrugging, “as the engineer has assured us we can get through.” “Undoubtedly,” Passepartout pressed, “we can pass, but perhaps it would be more cautious—” “What! Cautious!” exclaimed Colonel Proctor, a word that seemed to infuriate him. “At full speed, don't you see, at full speed!” “I know—I see,” Passepartout repeated, “but it would be, if not more cautious, since that word displeases you, at least more logical—” “Who! What! What is wrong with this fellow?” several people cried out. The poor man didn't know who else he could address. “Are you scared?” Colonel Proctor asked. “Me, scared? Very well; I will show these people that a Frenchman can be just as audacious as they are!” “All aboard!” the conductor shouted. “Yes, everyone aboard!” Passepartout echoed instantly. “But they cannot prevent me from thinking it would be more sensible for us to walk across the bridge first and let the train follow!”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Passepartout halted and listened intently to what the engineer had to say. The conductor tried to object, saying the bridge wasn't safe, but Forster, the engineer, insisted that if they crossed at the highest possible speed, there was a chance they'd make it. Passepartout muttered an exclamation of surprise. Several passengers, drawn to the risky suggestion, supported this idea—Colonel Proctor especially thought it was a promising plan and shared tales of daring engineers who had sped trains over gaps by simply accelerating. Many in the group agreed with such confidence, estimating their odds of success as high as fifty, eighty, even ninety percent. Passepartout was shocked by their enthusiasm, and although he was willing to risk anything to get across Medicine Creek, he thought such a daredevil method was rather characteristically American. He also noted to himself that there was an easier solution, which no one seemed to have considered. Trying to suggest this to other passengers, Passepartout voiced his doubts about the safety of the engineer's plan, only to be dismissed. When he tried to propose his simple idea to another, the American passenger insisted the engineer's judgment was enough. Passepartout persisted, saying they might be wise to be more careful, but this only agitated Colonel Proctor, who insisted speed was the answer. Passepartout conceded their point but hinted that a more straightforward approach might be better. The crowd grew impatient with him, and Colonel Proctor asked if he was scared. Passepartout retorted he would prove that a Frenchman was just as daring as any American. The call to board was given, and Passepartout joined in, though he couldn't help thinking it made more sense to cross the bridge on foot and let the train follow afterward."

The bridge was invisible to them. The train, metaphorically speaking, jumped from one side to the other, and the engineer was unable to stop it until it was five miles past the stopping point.

The engine let out a loud whistle; the driver, by reversing the steam, slowly backed the train almost a mile, preparing as if to get a running start. After blowing the whistle again, he sent the train forward; it picked up speed quickly, soon reaching a terrifying velocity. The locomotive emitted a long, shrill screech, and the piston moved up and down twenty times a second. Those aboard realized that the train, racing along at about a hundred miles an hour, barely seemed to touch the rails. In a blur, they made it across! The bridge was invisible to everyone as the train seemed to fly from one side of the divide to the other, and it wasn't until five miles past the station that the driver could bring it to a stop. Almost immediately after the train crossed the river, the bridge, now completely destroyed, collapsed with a roar into the Medicine Bow rapids below."

The road here attained the highest elevation of the journey, eight thousand and ninety-two feet above the level of the sea. The travellers had now only to descend to the Atlantic by limitless plains, levelled by nature. A branch of the “grand trunk” led off southward to Denver, the capital of Colorado. The country round about is rich in gold and silver, and more than fifty thousand inhabitants are already settled there.\nThirteen hundred and eighty-two miles had been passed over from San Francisco, in three days and three nights; four days and nights more would probably bring them to New York. Phileas Fogg was not as yet behind-hand.\nDuring the night Camp Walbach was passed on the left; Lodge Pole Creek ran parallel with the road, marking the boundary between the territories of Wyoming and Colorado. They entered Nebraska at eleven, passed near Sedgwick, and touched at Julesburg, on the southern branch of the Platte River.\nIt was here that the Union Pacific Railroad was inaugurated on the 23rd of October, 1867, by the chief engineer, General Dodge. Two powerful locomotives, carrying nine cars of invited guests, amongst whom was Thomas C. Durant, vice-president of the road, stopped at this point; cheers were given, the Sioux and Pawnees performed an imitation Indian battle, fireworks were let off, and the first number of the Railway Pioneer was printed by a press brought on the train. Thus was celebrated the inauguration of this great railroad, a mighty instrument of progress and civilisation, thrown across the desert, and destined to link together cities and towns which do not yet exist. The whistle of the locomotive, more powerful than Amphion’s lyre, was about to bid them rise from American soil.\nFort McPherson was left behind at eight in the morning, and three hundred and fifty-seven miles had yet to be traversed before reaching Omaha. The road followed the capricious windings of the southern branch of the Platte River, on its left bank. At nine the train stopped at the important town of North Platte, built between the two arms of the river, which rejoin each other around it and form a single artery, a large tributary, whose waters empty into the Missouri a little above Omaha.\nThe one hundred and first meridian was passed.",

At this point, the railway reached its highest elevation, eight thousand ninety-two feet above sea level. From here, the travelers would descend towards the Atlantic across vast, naturally flattened plains. A southern spur of the main line headed towards Denver, the capital of Colorado, an area abundant in gold and silver, already home to over fifty thousand residents. They had covered thirteen hundred and eighty-two miles from San Francisco in three days and nights and expected to reach New York in approximately four more days and nights. Phileas Fogg was currently on schedule. During the night, the train passed Camp Walbach on the left. Lodge Pole Creek ran alongside the tracks, marking the boundary between Wyoming and Colorado. They entered Nebraska at eleven o'clock, went by Sedgwick, and stopped briefly at Julesburg, situated on the southern branch of the Platte River. This location was significant as it was where the Union Pacific Railroad was officially inaugurated on October 23, 1867, by the chief engineer, General Dodge. The ceremony featured two powerful locomotives pulling nine cars carrying invited guests, including the road's vice-president, Thomas C. Durant. The event included cheering crowds, a simulated battle by Sioux and Pawnee tribes, fireworks, and the printing of the first edition of the *Railway Pioneer* using a press brought on the train. This marked the inauguration of the crucial railway, seen as a powerful force for progress and civilization, built across the wilderness to connect cities and towns that didn't yet exist. The sound of the locomotive's whistle, described as more powerful than Amphion's legendary lyre, was seen as a call for new American settlements to arise from the land. By eight in the morning, they had passed Fort McPherson, with three hundred and fifty-seven miles remaining to Omaha. The route followed the winding path of the southern branch of the Platte River on its left bank. At nine o'clock, the train stopped at North Platte, a notable town situated between the two branches of the river that merge around it to form a single, large tributary flowing into the Missouri River just above Omaha.

The travellers now had a straightforward descent ahead of them, heading for the Atlantic across endless flat plains shaped by nature. At this point, a branch line of the main railway veered south toward Denver, Colorado’s capital, an area famous for its riches in gold and silver and already home to over fifty thousand people.\n\nFrom San Francisco, they had travelled one thousand, three hundred and eighty-two miles in just three days and nights; it seemed likely another four days and nights would take them to New York. Phileas Fogg was still on schedule.\n\nOvernight, they passed Camp Walbach on their left, while Lodge Pole Creek ran alongside the railroad, marking the border between Wyoming and Colorado. By eleven o'clock, they entered Nebraska, passed near Sedgwick, and stopped at Julesburg, which sits on the southern branch of the Platte River.\n\nThis was the site where, on October 23, 1867, General Dodge, the chief engineer, officially opened the Union Pacific Railroad. Two strong locomotives, each pulling nine cars filled with guests—including Thomas C. Durant, the vice-president of the railroad—halted there. The guests cheered, the Sioux and Pawnee tribes held a mock battle, there were fireworks, and the first issue of the Railway Pioneer was printed aboard the train. This marked the celebration of the inauguration of the grand railroad, a huge force for progress and civilization built across the wilderness, designed to connect future cities and settlements. The train’s whistle, more potent than Amphion’s legendary lyre, was about to call these new communities into existence from the American land.\n\nThey passed Fort McPherson at eight in the morning, with three hundred and fifty-seven miles left to reach Omaha. The railway wound along the unpredictable curves of the southern branch of the Platte River, staying on its left bank. By nine, the train stopped in North Platte, an important town located between the river’s two branches, which merge around the town and combine into a wide waterway that feeds into the Missouri River near Omaha.\n\nThey crossed the one hundred and first meridian."

Passepartout was ready to confront the American, who continued to stare defiantly at Fogg, but Fix intervened and addressed the colonel, \"Remember, it's with me you have an issue, sir, since it was me you insulted and struck!\" \"Mr. Fix,\" said Fogg, \"forgive me, but this matter concerns only me. The colonel has now insulted me again by insisting I not play a spade, and I demand satisfaction.\" \"Anytime, anywhere, and with any weapon you choose,\" the American replied. Despite Aouda and the detective's efforts to keep Mr. Fogg out of the fight, and Passepartout's readiness to eject the colonel, Fogg signaled restraint. Fogg left the train car, with the American following onto the platform. \"Sir,\" Fogg said, \"I am in great haste to return to Europe, and cannot afford much delay.\" \"That's not my problem,\" retorted Colonel Proctor. \"Sir, after our last meeting in San Francisco, I resolved to return to America and seek you out once my business in England concluded.\" \"Really?\" \"Will you agree to a meeting in six months?\" \"Why not in ten years?\" \"Six months,\" Fogg insisted. \"I shall be there without fail.\" \"You're just avoiding this,\" Proctor shouted. \"Now or never!\" \"Very well. Are you headed to New York?\" \"No.\" \"To Chicago?\" \"No.\" \"To Omaha?\" \"Why does it matter? Do you know Plum Creek?\" \"No,\" said Fogg. \"It's the next stop. The train will arrive in an hour and pause for ten minutes. That's ample time for an exchange of revolver fire.\" \"Agreed,\" said Fogg. \"I will stop at Plum Creek.\" \"And I suspect you'll stay there, too,\" added the American with contempt."

Mr. Fogg resumed the interrupted game with perfect calmness.\nAt eleven o’clock the locomotive’s whistle announced that they were approaching Plum Creek station. Mr. Fogg rose, and, followed by Fix, went out upon the platform. Passepartout accompanied him, carrying a pair of revolvers.

          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "\"Who knows?\" Mr. Fogg responded, stepping back into the train car with his usual composure. He then comforted Aouda, assuring her that loud talkers were seldom dangerous and requested Fix to act as his representative in the upcoming duel, a request the detective felt unable to decline. Mr. Fogg smoothly continued the card game that had been interrupted. Around eleven o'clock, the train's horn signaled they were nearing Plum Creek station. Mr. Fogg stood up and, followed by Fix, moved onto the platform. Passepartout went with him, carrying a pair of revolvers. Aouda stayed inside the car, looking extremely pale. The door of the next car opened, and Colonel Proctor emerged onto the platform, accompanied by a fellow American acting as his second. However, just as both sides were about to step off the train, the conductor rushed over, shouting, \"You gentlemen cannot get off!\" \"Why ever not?\" the colonel demanded. \"We are running twenty minutes behind schedule and will not be stopping,\" the conductor replied. \"But I have arranged a duel with this gentleman,\" stated the colonel. \"I regret the inconvenience,\" said the conductor, \"but we are departing immediately. Listen, the bell is ringing now.\" The train began to move. \"Truly, gentlemen, my apologies,\" the conductor continued. \"Under different circumstances, I would have been pleased to assist you. But since there wasn't time for your duel here, why not proceed with it while we're moving?\" \"Perhaps that wouldn't be convenient for this gentleman,\" the colonel remarked mockingly. \"It would be entirely convenient,\" Phileas Fogg stated. \"Well, this is truly America,\" Passepartout thought to himself, \"and the conductor is certainly a fine individual!\" Murmuring this, he followed his employer.",

He tried to soothe Aouda, assuring her that loud and aggressive people were nothing to worry about, and then asked Fix to act as his second in the upcoming duel—a request the detective felt obliged to accept. With complete composure, Mr. Fogg returned to his previously interrupted card game.\n\nAt eleven o'clock, the train's whistle signaled their arrival at Plum Creek station. Mr. Fogg stood up and, with Fix following, stepped onto the platform. Passepartout joined them, carrying two revolvers. Aouda, meanwhile, stayed behind in the carriage, looking as pale as a ghost.\n\nJust then, the door of the next carriage opened and Colonel Proctor emerged onto the platform, accompanied by an American of similar character, chosen as his second. But before the duelists could leave the train, the conductor rushed over and declared, \"You can't get off, gentlemen!\"\n\n\"Why not?\" the colonel demanded.\n\n\"We're running twenty minutes late and won't be stopping.\"\n\n\"But I have a duel to fight with this gentleman.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" the conductor replied, \"but we have to depart right away.

But since you haven't been able to duel here, why not have your fight while the train is moving?\"\n\n\"Perhaps that wouldn't suit this gentleman,\" Colonel Proctor said mockingly.\n\n\"It would suit me perfectly,\" responded Phileas Fogg.\n\nPassepartout thought to himself, \"We must really be in America, and the conductor is the most obliging man one could meet!\" With that, he followed his master."

The final carriage was occupied by only about a dozen passengers, whom the conductor politely requested to temporarily vacate the space, as two gentlemen needed it to settle a matter of honor. The passengers readily complied, promptly moving away onto the platform area of the train. The carriage, which spanned approximately fifty feet, proved very convenient for their purpose. The adversaries could advance towards each other down the aisle and fire with ease. A duel had never been arranged with such simplicity. Mr. Fogg and Colonel Proctor, each carrying two six-shot revolvers, entered the carriage. Their seconds remained outside and closed the door, leaving them inside. They were scheduled to begin firing upon the first sound of the locomotive's whistle. After a two-minute interval, whatever remained of the two gentlemen would be removed from the carriage. Nothing could have been more straightforward. Indeed, the entire setup was so simple that Fix and Passepartout felt their hearts pounding as if they might burst. They were intently listening for the agreed-upon whistle when sudden, fierce shouts echoed, accompanied by gunshots that clearly did not originate from the carriage where the duellists were. The gunfire continued from the front and along the whole length of the train. Cries of terror emanated from within the other carriages. Colonel Proctor and Mr. Fogg, still holding their revolvers, swiftly exited their confinement and rushed towards the area with the most intense noise. They then realized that the train was under attack by a group of Sioux Indians. This was not the first time these audacious Indians had attempted such an act, having ambushed trains on this route on multiple previous occasions.

The car, roughly fifty feet long, proved ideal for the duel, allowing the opponents to walk toward each other and fire comfortably down the aisle. Organizing the duel was remarkably easy. Both Mr. Fogg and Colonel Proctor, each armed with two six-shooters, went inside the car, while their seconds closed the door behind them and stayed outside. The agreed signal to start firing was the train's first whistle; after two minutes, whatever was left of the dueling parties would be removed. The arrangement was straightforward—so much so that Fix and Passepartout found themselves tense with anxiety, waiting for the whistle. Suddenly, wild cries and gunshots rang out—not from the duel car, but from further ahead along the length of the train. Panic and screams arose from the other cars. Mr. Fogg and Colonel Proctor, guns in hand, sprang from their locked car and hurried toward the commotion. They quickly realized that the train was under attack by Sioux warriors. This wasn't their first raid, as these bold Native Americans had previously ambushed trains, leaping aboard while the train was still moving, as nimbly as an acrobat mounting a galloping horse."

A Sioux chief, wishing to stop the train, but not knowing how to work the regulator, had opened wide instead of closing the steam-valve, and the locomotive was plunging forward with terrific velocity.\nThe Sioux had at the same time invaded the cars, skipping like enraged monkeys over the roofs, thrusting open the doors, and fighting hand to hand with the passengers. Penetrating the baggage-car, they pillaged it, throwing the trunks out of the train. The cries and shots were constant. The travellers defended themselves bravely; some of the cars were barricaded, and sustained a siege, like moving forts, carried along at a speed of a hundred miles an hour.\nAouda behaved courageously from the first. She defended herself like a true heroine with a revolver, which she shot through the broken windows whenever a savage made his appearance. Twenty Sioux had fallen mortally wounded to the ground, and the wheels crushed those who fell upon the rails as if they had been worms. Several passengers, shot or stunned, lay on the seats.\nIt was necessary to put an end to the struggle, which had lasted for ten minutes, and which would result in the triumph of the Sioux if the train was not stopped. Fort Kearney station, where there was a garrison, was only two miles distant; but, that once passed, the Sioux would be masters of the train between Fort Kearney and the station beyond.\nThe conductor was fighting beside Mr. Fogg, when he was shot and fell.

The Native Americans had initially climbed onto the locomotive, incapacitating the engineer and stoker by striking them with their muskets. A Sioux leader, intending to halt the train but unfamiliar with the controls, mistakenly opened the steam valve fully instead of closing the regulator, causing the engine to surge forward at an alarming speed. Simultaneously, the Sioux had breached the passenger cars, scrambling like enraged monkeys across the roofs, forcing open doors, and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with those inside. Upon entering the baggage car, they looted it, throwing luggage out of the moving train. The sounds of shouting and gunfire were constant. The passengers defended themselves bravely; some cars were fortified and withstood the assault like mobile strongholds, moving at a rapid pace of one hundred miles per hour. Aouda displayed courage from the start, defending herself capably with a revolver, firing through shattered windows whenever an attacker appeared. Twenty Sioux fell fatally wounded, and the train wheels crushed those who landed on the tracks as if they were insignificant creatures. Several passengers lay injured or unconscious on the seats, either shot or struck. It was crucial to end the conflict, which had gone on for ten minutes and would end in the Sioux's victory if the train couldn't be stopped. Fort Kearney station, which housed a military garrison, was only two miles away; however, once past that point, the Sioux would have complete control of the train until the next station.

While the battle raged and bullets whizzed overhead, he utilized his former acrobatic skills with astonishing agility, navigating his way under the cars by gripping the chains, using the brakes and window frames for leverage, and moving from one car to another with remarkable skill until he reached the front of the train. There, suspended by one hand between the baggage car and the tender, he used his other hand to work on the safety chains.

They broke into the baggage-car, looted it, and tossed luggage out of the moving train. The chaos was constant, with gunfire and shouting everywhere. The travelers fought back valiantly, barricading some cars, which became makeshift moving fortresses as the train hurtled along at a tremendous speed. Aouda showed remarkable bravery, using a revolver to repeatedly fire at attackers through broken windows, injuring or killing several Sioux. Many attackers were either shot or crushed under the wheels if they fell onto the tracks, and some passengers were left injured or unconscious inside the cars. The battle lasted about ten minutes, with the Sioux likely to prevail if the train didn’t stop. Fort Kearney, where soldiers were stationed, was only a couple of miles away; if the train passed it, the Sioux would control it until the next station. During the fight, the conductor, fighting next to Mr. Fogg, was shot but managed to warn that unless the train was stopped within five minutes, they would be doomed. Phileas Fogg declared he would bring the train to a halt, but Passepartout insisted on going instead. Before Fogg could object, Passepartout slipped unnoticed under the train, using his circus skills to maneuver along the underside from car to car amid flying bullets.

Hearing the gunfire, the soldiers from the fort hurried over; the Sioux, surprised by their arrival, quickly retreated before the train had fully stopped. However, as the passengers gathered on the station platform and took a headcount, they discovered that some people were missing, including the brave Frenchman whose selfless act had just saved them."

Do you propose to pursue the Sioux?”\n“That’s a serious thing to do, sir,” returned the captain. “These Indians may retreat beyond the Arkansas, and I cannot leave the fort unprotected.”\n“The lives of three men are in question, sir,” said Phileas Fogg.\n“Doubtless; but can I risk the lives of fifty men to save three?”\n“I don’t know whether you can, sir; but you ought to do so.”\n“Nobody here,” returned the other, “has a right to teach me my duty.”\n“Very well,” said Mr. Fogg, coldly. “I will go alone.”\n“You, sir!” cried Fix, coming up; “you go alone in pursuit of the Indians?”\n“Would you have me leave this poor fellow to perish—him to whom every one present owes his life? I shall go.”\n“No, sir, you shall not go alone,” cried the captain, touched in spite of himself. “No! you are a brave man.

The commanding officer of Fort Kearney was present. A hundred of his soldiers had been positioned defensively in case the Sioux attacked the station. \"Sir,\" Mr. Fogg addressed the captain, \"three passengers are missing.\" \"Are they dead?\" the captain inquired. \"Dead or captured; that is the question we must answer. Do you intend to pursue the Sioux?\" \"That is a very risky undertaking, sir,\" the captain replied. \"These native Americans could retreat beyond the Arkansas, and I cannot leave the fort unprotected.\" \"The lives of three men are at stake, sir,\" Phileas Fogg stated. \"Certainly; but can I jeopardize the lives of fifty men to rescue three?\" \"I am uncertain if you are able to, sir; but you are obligated to do so.\" \"No one here,\" the captain responded, \"has the authority to tell me what my duty is.\" \"Understood,\" Mr. Fogg said coolly. \"I will go alone.\" \"You, sir!\" exclaimed Fix, stepping forward; \"you will go after the Indians by yourself?\" \"Should I abandon this poor man to die—the one to whom everyone here owes their life?

Fogg addressed the captain, stating, \"Three passengers are missing.\" The captain inquired if they were dead, to which Fogg replied that they could either be dead or captured, and the situation needed clarification. Fogg then asked if the captain intended to pursue the Sioux. The captain acknowledged the seriousness of chasing after the Native Americans, explaining that they might have already escaped beyond the Arkansas River, and that he could not risk leaving the fort vulnerable. Fogg insisted, reminding him that three lives were at stake. The captain questioned whether the lives of fifty soldiers should be risked to save just three. Fogg responded he wasn't sure if the captain could, but felt the captain ought to try. The captain retorted that no one there had the right to tell him his duty. Fogg accepted this and declared he would go after them alone. Detective Fix, hearing this, was shocked and questioned whether Fogg meant to pursue the Sioux on his own. Fogg pointed out that he couldn't abandon a man whose bravery had saved everyone present. When Fogg declared his intention, the captain, moved despite himself, said Fogg would not go alone; he called for thirty volunteers, and the whole company stepped forward. Thirty men were selected, led by an experienced sergeant. Fogg thanked the captain, and Fix asked to join the rescue mission, but Fogg suggested he would appreciate it more if Fix stayed with Aouda in case something happened to him. Though conflicted, Fix agreed to stay. Soon after, Fogg entrusted his carpet-bag to Aouda, pressed her hand in farewell, and left with the sergeant and volunteers.

No train was expected from the east, neither had there been time for the succour asked for by telegraph to arrive; the train from Omaha to San Francisco was not due till the next day. The mystery was soon explained.\nThe locomotive, which was slowly approaching with deafening whistles, was that which, having been detached from the train, had continued its route with such terrific rapidity, carrying off the unconscious engineer and stoker. It had run several miles, when, the fire becoming low for want of fuel, the steam had slackened; and it had finally stopped an hour after, some twenty miles beyond Fort Kearney. Neither the engineer nor the stoker was dead, and, after remaining for some time in their swoon, had come to themselves. The train had then stopped. The engineer, when he found himself in the desert, and the locomotive without cars, understood what had happened. He could not imagine how the locomotive had become separated from the train; but he did not doubt that the train left behind was in distress.\nHe did not hesitate what to do. It would be prudent to continue on to Omaha, for it would be dangerous to return to the train, which the Indians might still be engaged in pillaging. Nevertheless, he began to rebuild the fire in the furnace; the pressure again mounted, and the locomotive returned, running backwards to Fort Kearney. This it was which was whistling in the mist.",

A large, dark shape, illuminated by a bright headlight, slowly moved forward, appearing even more massive and eerie due to the mist. No train was scheduled to arrive from the east, and there hadn't been enough time for the telegraphically requested assistance to reach them. The usual train connecting Omaha and San Francisco wasn't expected until the following day. The puzzling situation quickly became clear. The locomotive, sounding deafening whistles as it approached slowly, turned out to be the one that had broken away from the rest of the train and had initially sped off incredibly fast, taking the unconscious engineer and stoker with it. It had traveled many miles before the fire began to die down due to lack of fuel, causing the steam pressure to decrease. Consequently, it eventually came to a halt about an hour later, approximately twenty miles past Fort Kearney. Both the engineer and the stoker were alive; after being unconscious for a period, they had recovered. By this time, the locomotive had stopped. Upon waking up in the desolate area and finding the locomotive detached from the carriages, the engineer realized the situation. Although he couldn't figure out how the separation occurred, he was certain that the train left behind must be in trouble. He made a quick decision. While it might have seemed sensible to proceed towards Omaha, given the risk of encountering Indians potentially still plundering the train, he chose otherwise. Instead, he started to rekindle the fire in the furnace, restoring the steam pressure, and drove the locomotive in reverse back towards Fort Kearney.

The engine that was now coming had earlier separated from its train and raced ahead with great speed, carrying the unconscious engineer and stoker. After running for several miles and running low on fuel, the engine’s steam diminished, and it finally stopped about twenty miles past Fort Kearney after an hour. The engineer and stoker eventually came to and realized they weren’t dead. When the engineer surveyed his situation—stranded in the wilderness with just the engine—he guessed that the train behind must be in trouble, though he didn’t know how they had become uncoupled. Deciding it too risky to head back directly, as the train might still be under attack by Indians, he considered pressing on to Omaha. However, he soon rekindled the engine’s fire, rebuilt steam pressure, and set off in reverse back toward Fort Kearney. It was this engine that let out loud whistles as it returned through the fog."

An instant after, Mr. Fogg and the American, whose name was Mudge, entered a hut built just below the fort.\nThere Mr. Fogg examined a curious vehicle, a kind of frame on two long beams, a little raised in front like the runners of a sledge, and upon which there was room for five or six persons. A high mast was fixed on the frame, held firmly by metallic lashings, to which was attached a large brigantine sail. This mast held an iron stay upon which to hoist a jib-sail. Behind, a sort of rudder served to guide the vehicle. It was, in short, a sledge rigged like a sloop. During the winter, when the trains are blocked up by the snow, these sledges make extremely rapid journeys across the frozen plains from one station to another. Provided with more sails than a cutter, and with the wind behind them, they slip over the surface of the prairies with a speed equal if not superior to that of the express trains.\nMr. Fogg readily made a bargain with the owner of this land-craft. The wind was favourable, being fresh, and blowing from the west. The snow had hardened, and Mudge was very confident of being able to transport Mr. Fogg in a few hours to Omaha. Thence the trains eastward run frequently to Chicago and New York. It was not impossible that the lost time might yet be recovered; and such an opportunity was not to be rejected.",

A moment later, Mr. Fogg and the American, whose name was Mudge, entered a small building situated just below the fort. Inside, Mr. Fogg inspected a peculiar vehicle. It was a frame supported by two long runners, slightly elevated at the front like a sledge's runners, and capable of seating five or six individuals. A tall mast was secured firmly to the frame by metal cables, and a large brigantine sail was attached to it. This mast also held an iron stay for raising a jib-sail. A rudder-like device at the rear was used for steering. Essentially, it was a sledge fitted out like a small sailing boat. In winter, when heavy snow prevents trains from operating, these sledges are used for extremely fast travel across the frozen plains between stations. With more sails than a cutter and propelled by a following wind, they glide over the prairie ground at speeds equal to, or sometimes exceeding, that of express trains. Mr. Fogg swiftly reached an agreement with the owner of this land-craft. The wind was advantageous, blowing strongly from the west. The snow had solidified, and Mudge felt very confident he could take Mr. Fogg to Omaha in just a few hours. From Omaha, eastbound trains to Chicago and New York depart frequently. It seemed plausible that the time they had fallen behind could still be recovered, making this chance one that should not be missed.",

Soon afterward, Fogg and the American, named Mudge, entered a small cabin near the fort. Inside, Fogg inspected an unusual vehicle: it had a frame set upon two long beams that curved up at the front like a sled's runners, and there was space for five or six people. A tall mast was attached securely with metal bindings, carrying a large sail like that of a brigantine. There was also an iron support to raise a smaller sail at the front, and a rudder at the back to steer. It was essentially a sled designed like a sailboat. In winter, when snow blocks the trains, these sled-sailboats can travel at great speeds across the frozen plains between stations, sometimes as fast or even faster than express trains when wind is favorable. Mr. Fogg quickly agreed on terms with the sled's owner. The wind was strong and blowing from the west, the snow was firm, and Mudge was confident he could get Fogg to Omaha in a few hours. Regular trains ran east from there to Chicago and New York, so it was possible they could make up for the time they had lost. This was an opportunity not to be missed."

The railroad which ran through this section ascended from the south-west to the north-west by Great Island, Columbus, an important Nebraska town, Schuyler, and Fremont, to Omaha. It followed throughout the right bank of the Platte River. The sledge, shortening this route, took a chord of the arc described by the railway. Mudge was not afraid of being stopped by the Platte River, because it was frozen. The road, then, was quite clear of obstacles, and Phileas Fogg had but two things to fear—an accident to the sledge, and a change or calm in the wind.\nBut the breeze, far from lessening its force, blew as if to bend the mast, which, however, the metallic lashings held firmly. These lashings, like the chords of a stringed instrument, resounded as if vibrated by a violin bow. The sledge slid along in the midst of a plaintively intense melody.\n“Those chords give the fifth and the octave,” said Mr. Fogg.\nThese were the only words he uttered during the journey. Aouda, cosily packed in furs and cloaks, was sheltered as much as possible from the attacks of the freezing wind. As for Passepartout, his face was as red as the sun’s disc when it sets in the mist, and he laboriously inhaled the biting air. With his natural buoyancy of spirits, he began to hope again. They would reach New York on the evening, if not on the morning, of the 11th, and there were still some chances that it would be before the steamer sailed for Liverpool.\nPassepartout even felt a strong desire to grasp his ally, Fix, by the hand. He remembered that it was the detective who procured the sledge, the only means of reaching Omaha in time; but, checked by some presentiment, he kept his usual reserve. One thing, however, Passepartout would never forget, and that was the sacrifice which Mr. Fogg had made, without hesitation, to rescue him from the Sioux. Mr. Fogg had risked his fortune and his life. No! His servant would never forget that!\nWhile each of the party was absorbed in reflections so different, the sledge flew past over the vast carpet of snow. The creeks it passed over were not perceived. Fields and streams disappeared under the uniform whiteness. The plain was absolutely deserted. Between the Union Pacific road and the branch which unites Kearney with Saint Joseph it formed a great uninhabited island. Neither village, station, nor fort appeared. From time to time they sped by some phantom-like tree, whose white skeleton twisted and rattled in the wind. Sometimes flocks of wild birds rose, or bands of gaunt, famished, ferocious prairie-wolves ran howling after the sledge. Passepartout, revolver in hand, held himself ready to fire on those which came too near. Had an accident then happened to the sledge, the travellers, attacked by these beasts, would have been in the most terrible danger; but it held on its even course, soon gained on the wolves, and ere long left the howling band at a safe distance behind.",

The railroad line traversing this territory followed a course ascending from the southwest to the northwest, passing through Great Island, the significant Nebraska town of Columbus, Schuyler, and Fremont, before reaching Omaha. This railway route generally adhered to the eastern bank of the Platte River. The sledge, however, shortened the journey by taking a straight line, like a chord cutting across the arc of the railway's path. Mudge was unconcerned about being impeded by the Platte River as it was solidly frozen. Thus, the route was entirely free of obstructions, leaving Phileas Fogg to worry only about two potential issues: a mechanical failure of the sledge or a change or cessation of the wind.",

Normally, the railroad would wind up from the southwest to the northwest, passing through towns like Great Island, Columbus, Schuyler, and Fremont before reaching Omaha, staying to the right of the Platte River. Instead, the sledge cut across this bend by following a straighter path, thanks to the Platte River being frozen solid and simple to cross. Thus, their journey faced few obstacles, except for the risks of the sledge breaking down or the wind changing. Fortunately, the wind remained strong, straining the mast but held tight by metal fastenings that vibrated musically in the cold air. Mr. Fogg remarked on the musical notes, but otherwise stayed silent. Aouda was bundled in furs to withstand the cold, while Passepartout’s cheeks were bright red from the chill, but he began to feel hopeful again that they might reach New York in time to catch their ship to Liverpool. He almost wanted to thank Fix, who had helped secure the sledge, but held back due to caution. However, he could never forget Fogg’s brave and selfless rescue during the Sioux attack. As everyone reflected on different thoughts, the sledge sped swiftly across the snowy expanse, where all landmarks disappeared under the snow. The land was empty and wild, save for the occasional ghostly tree, soaring birds, or hungry wolves that gave chase to the sledge, forcing Passepartout to stay on guard with his revolver. Luckily, the sledge outran the wolves, leaving them behind and the travelers safe for now."

Captain Speedy pondered the proposition, rubbing his head. There was a potential gain of eight thousand dollars without altering his route, which made it worthwhile to overcome his reluctance to carry passengers. Furthermore, passengers paying two thousand dollars ceased to be mere passengers and became valuable freight. “I am setting sail at nine o’clock,” Captain Speedy declared simply. “Are you and your group prepared?” Mr. Fogg replied with equal simplicity, “We shall be on board by nine o’clock.”",

Earning eight thousand dollars without changing his planned route was a strong incentive—enough to overcome his dislike of taking on passengers. In fact, at that price, they were more like precious cargo than regular travelers. \"I set sail at nine o'clock,\" Captain Speedy finally said. \"Will you and your group be ready?\"\n\"We will be aboard at nine,\" Fogg replied matter-of-factly."

It might be thought that this was Captain Speedy. Not the least in the world. It was Phileas Fogg, Esquire. As for Captain Speedy, he was shut up in his cabin under lock and key, and was uttering loud cries, which signified an anger at once pardonable and excessive.\nWhat had happened was very simple. Phileas Fogg wished to go to Liverpool, but the captain would not carry him there. Then Phileas Fogg had taken passage for Bordeaux, and, during the thirty hours he had been on board, had so shrewdly managed with his banknotes that the sailors and stokers, who were only an occasional crew, and were not on the best terms with the captain, went over to him in a body. This was why Phileas Fogg was in command instead of Captain Speedy; why the captain was a prisoner in his cabin; and why, in short, the “Henrietta” was directing her course towards Liverpool. It was very clear, to see Mr. Fogg manage the craft, that he had been a sailor.\nHow the adventure ended will be seen anon. Aouda was anxious, though she said nothing. As for Passepartout, he thought Mr. Fogg’s manœuvre simply glorious. The captain had said “between eleven and twelve knots,” and the “Henrietta” confirmed his prediction.\nIf, then—for there were “ifs” still—the sea did not become too boisterous, if the wind did not veer round to the east, if no accident happened to the boat or its machinery, the “Henrietta” might cross the three thousand miles from New York to Liverpool in the nine days, between the 12th and the 21st of December. It is true that, once arrived, the affair on board the “Henrietta,” added to that of the Bank of England, might create more difficulties for Mr. Fogg than he imagined or could desire.",

During that day, it followed the Long Island coastline, passed Fire Island, and quickly made its way eastward. By noon the next day, the person on the bridge checking the ship's position was not Captain Speedy, as might be expected, but Phileas Fogg. Captain Speedy, meanwhile, was locked in his cabin, yelling loudly in what was an understandable yet excessive display of anger. The reason for this situation was simple: Phileas Fogg wanted to sail to Liverpool, but the captain refused. Fogg then booked passage to Bordeaux, but during the thirty hours since coming aboard, he had skillfully used his money to persuade the ship's temporary crew, who were already not on good terms with the captain, to support him. This led to Phileas Fogg taking command instead of Captain Speedy, the captain being imprisoned, and the 'Henrietta' changing course for Liverpool. Mr. Fogg's competence in handling the ship suggested he had prior sailing experience. The outcome of this venture was yet to be revealed. Aouda was silently anxious, while Passepartout considered Mr. Fogg's action absolutely brilliant. The ship maintained the speed the captain had originally estimated, between eleven and twelve knots. If the weather remained calm, the wind stayed favorable (not turning east), and no accidents befell the ship or its engines, the 'Henrietta' might complete the three-thousand-mile journey from New York to Liverpool within nine days, between December 12th and 21st. However, it was acknowledged that upon arrival, the events on the 'Henrietta,' combined with the Bank of England issue, could potentially cause Mr. Fogg more problems than he foresaw or desired.",

Throughout the day, it traveled along the coast of Long Island, passing Fire Island, and quickly headed east. By midday on the following day, someone climbed onto the bridge to check the ship's location. While one might expect this to be Captain Speedy, it was actually Phileas Fogg. The real captain, Speedy, was locked in his cabin, loudly expressing his understandable but extreme displeasure. The reason for this was straightforward: Fogg wanted to travel to Liverpool, but Captain Speedy refused to take him there. So Fogg booked a ticket to Bordeaux, and over thirty hours, cleverly used his money to win over the crew, who were only temporary and not loyal to the captain, bringing them to his side. As a result, Fogg was now effectively in charge of the “Henrietta,” with Captain Speedy confined to his cabin, and the ship was now heading towards Liverpool. It was obvious from Fogg’s handling of the vessel that he had seafaring experience. The outcome of this adventure would be revealed soon. Though Aouda kept quiet, she was worried. Passepartout, on the other hand, thought Fogg’s actions were brilliant. With the ship maintaining between eleven and twelve knots as Captain Speedy had predicted, the “Henrietta” matched those speeds. Provided the sea stayed calm, the wind did not shift east, and the ship or its engines had no mishaps, it was possible for the “Henrietta” to make the three-thousand-mile journey from New York to Liverpool in the nine days between December 12th and 21st. However, once they arrived, the incident onboard, combined with the Bank of England problem, could cause Fogg more trouble than he expected."

His master’s last exploit, the consequences of which he ignored, enchanted him. Never had the crew seen so jolly and dexterous a fellow. He formed warm friendships with the sailors, and amazed them with his acrobatic feats. He thought they managed the vessel like gentlemen, and that the stokers fired up like heroes. His loquacious good-humour infected everyone. He had forgotten the past, its vexations and delays.

The conquest of the “Henrietta,” the bribery of the crew, Fogg managing the boat like a skilled seaman, amazed and confused him. He did not know what to think. For, after all, a man who began by stealing fifty-five thousand pounds might end by stealing a vessel; and Fix was not unnaturally inclined to conclude that the “Henrietta” under Fogg’s command, was not going to Liverpool at all, but to some part of the world where the robber, turned into a pirate, would quietly put himself in safety.

Passepartout was overjoyed. He was captivated by his master's latest action, the full consequences of which he didn't understand. The crew had never met anyone so cheerful and nimble. He developed strong friendships with the sailors and impressed them with his acrobatic skills. He felt they navigated the ship professionally and that the stokers worked with immense effort. His lively good mood was contagious. He had put the past behind him, forgetting its troubles and delays. He thought only of the journey's almost completed end, and sometimes boiled over with anticipation, as if heated by the \"Henrietta's\" own engines. Often, the good-natured fellow would circle around Fix, watching him with a sharp, suspicious gaze, but he avoided speaking to him, as their former closeness was gone. Fix, it must be admitted, couldn't understand anything that was happening. Fogg's takeover of the \"Henrietta,\" the bribing of the crew, and Fogg piloting the boat like a seasoned sailor astonished and perplexed him. He didn't know what conclusion to draw. After all, he reasoned, a person who started by stealing fifty-five thousand pounds might well end up stealing a ship. Fix was naturally inclined to suspect that the \"Henrietta,\" under Fogg's command, wasn't actually headed for Liverpool, but rather to some remote part of the world where the thief, now acting like a pirate, could safely find refuge. This idea seemed quite plausible, and the detective began to deeply regret having gotten involved in the matter. As for Captain Speedy, he continued to yell and grumble in his cabin, and Passepartout, whose job it was to bring him meals, took the utmost care despite his bravery.

He remained blissfully unaware of the repercussions of his master’s latest action, which thoroughly charmed him. The crew had never seen anyone quite as lively and skillful; Passepartout quickly became friends with them and impressed them with his acrobatics. He admired how the sailors operated the ship so smoothly and thought the engine men worked with heroic commitment. His cheerful and outgoing mood made everyone else cheerful as well. Forgetting any frustrations or delays from before, he focused only on the close approach of their goal, sometimes growing impatient, as if energized by the \"Henrietta’s\" own engines. He often circled Fix with a watchful, suspicious gaze, but avoided speaking to him, since their old camaraderie had faded.\n\nFix, for his part, was thoroughly bewildered by recent events. Fogg’s commandeering of the \"Henrietta,\" the bribing of the crew, and his expert handling of the ship left the detective astonished and uncertain. He struggled to make sense of it all. It seemed plausible to him that a man who started by stealing £55,000 could go so far as to steal a ship, potentially heading not to Liverpool, but to some secret corner of the world to escape justice as a pirate. This theory seemed reasonable, and Fix began to regret his involvement in the chase.\n\nMeanwhile, Captain Speedy stayed in his cabin, angrily protesting his situation. Passepartout, tasked with delivering his meals, exercised great caution when visiting him, despite his courage.

Ever since the evening before the barometer, suddenly falling, had indicated an approaching change in the atmosphere; and during the night the temperature varied, the cold became sharper, and the wind veered to the south-east.\nThis was a misfortune. Mr. Fogg, in order not to deviate from his course, furled his sails and increased the force of the steam; but the vessel’s speed slackened, owing to the state of the sea, the long waves of which broke against the stern. She pitched violently, and this retarded her progress. The breeze little by little swelled into a tempest, and it was to be feared that the “Henrietta” might not be able to maintain herself upright on the waves.\nPassepartout’s visage darkened with the skies, and for two days the poor fellow experienced constant fright. But Phileas Fogg was a bold mariner, and knew how to maintain headway against the sea; and he kept on his course, without even decreasing his steam. The “Henrietta,” when she could not rise upon the waves, crossed them, swamping her deck, but passing safely. Sometimes the screw rose out of the water, beating its protruding end, when a mountain of water raised the stern above the waves; but the craft always kept straight ahead.\nThe wind, however, did not grow as boisterous as might have been feared; it was not one of those tempests which burst, and rush on with a speed of ninety miles an hour. It continued fresh, but, unhappily, it remained obstinately in the south-east, rendering the sails useless.",

This region is notorious for frequent fogs and powerful windstorms, especially during the winter. Beginning the night before, the barometer's sudden drop signaled impending atmospheric changes; overnight, the temperature shifted, growing colder, and the wind turned towards the southeast. This presented a problem. To avoid diverting from his planned course, Mr. Fogg ordered the sails lowered and the engine power increased. Nevertheless, the ship's pace slowed due to the rough sea conditions, as long swells broke against its rear. Violent pitching further impeded its progress. The wind progressively strengthened into a full tempest, raising fears that the \"Henrietta\" might struggle to remain stable on the water. Passepartout's expression became as gloomy as the sky, and the poor man was in a state of perpetual fear for two days. However, Phileas Fogg was a skilled and fearless mariner who knew how to make headway despite the sea's opposition. He maintained his route, not even reducing the steam power. When the \"Henrietta\" couldn't rise above the waves, she instead powered through them, flooding her deck but navigating safely. Sometimes, when the stern was lifted high by a surge, the propeller emerged from the water, spinning idly; yet, the vessel consistently pushed forward. The wind, thankfully, did not reach the extreme ferocity that had been feared; it wasn't one of those sudden, powerful storms that strike with speeds of ninety miles per hour. It remained strong, but inconveniently stayed fixed from the southeast, making the use of sails impossible.",

The barometer had dropped sharply the previous evening, signaling a shift in the weather. Overnight, temperatures fluctuated, becoming colder, and the wind changed direction to come from the southeast. This posed a problem. Mr. Fogg, determined to stay on course, took down the sails and increased the steam power, but rough seas slowed the ship as waves battered the stern, causing it to pitch heavily and making progress difficult. The wind gradually intensified into a storm, raising concerns about whether the 'Henrietta' could keep upright in the rough seas. Passepartout grew as anxious as the sky turned dark, and for two days he was constantly fearful. However, Phileas Fogg, being a confident sailor, managed to keep the ship moving forward and did not reduce steam. The 'Henrietta' sometimes plowed through the waves, water flooding the deck, but continued safely onward. Occasionally, as huge waves lifted the stern, the ship's screw would come out of the water and spin in the air, yet the vessel always pressed forward. Fortunately, the wind did not become as violent as feared—while it remained strong, it never reached hurricane speeds, though it continued stubbornly from the southeast, making it impossible to use the sails."

Half of the voyage was almost accomplished, and the worst localities had been passed. In summer, success would have been well-nigh certain. In winter, they were at the mercy of the bad season. Passepartout said nothing; but he cherished hope in secret, and comforted himself with the reflection that, if the wind failed them, they might still count on the steam.\nOn this day the engineer came on deck, went up to Mr. Fogg, and began to speak earnestly with him. Without knowing why it was a presentiment, perhaps Passepartout became vaguely uneasy. He would have given one of his ears to hear with the other what the engineer was saying. He finally managed to catch a few words, and was sure he heard his master say, “You are certain of what you tell me?”\n“Certain, sir,” replied the engineer. “You must remember that, since we started, we have kept up hot fires in all our furnaces, and, though we had coal enough to go on short steam from New York to Bordeaux, we haven’t enough to go with all steam from New York to Liverpool.” “I will consider,” replied Mr. Fogg.\nPassepartout understood it all; he was seized with mortal anxiety. The coal was giving out! “Ah, if my master can get over that,” muttered he, “he’ll be a famous man!” He could not help imparting to Fix what he had overheard.\n“Then you believe that we really are going to Liverpool?”\n“Of course.”\n“Ass!” replied the detective, shrugging his shoulders and turning on his heel.\nPassepartout was on the point of vigorously resenting the epithet, the reason of which he could not for the life of him comprehend; but he reflected that the unfortunate Fix was probably very much disappointed and humiliated in his self-esteem, after having so awkwardly followed a false scent around the world, and refrained.",

The voyage was nearing its halfway point, and the riskiest sections were behind them. Achieving success would have been almost certain in summer, but winter left them vulnerable to difficult weather. Passepartout kept his thoughts to himself, but secretly maintained hope, reassuring himself that steam power remained an option if they lost the wind. On this day, the engineer came on deck and engaged Mr. Fogg in a serious discussion. Passepartout felt a growing unease, possibly a premonition, and longed to hear what was being said. He managed to catch snippets, including hearing his master ask, \"Are you absolutely sure?\" \"Positive, sir,\" the engineer replied. \"Remember, we've kept the furnaces blazing hot since we started, and while we had enough coal for a low-steam trip from New York to Bordeaux, it's not enough to reach Liverpool from New York at full steam.\" Mr. Fogg responded, \"I will give it some thought.\" Passepartout understood everything and was gripped by extreme worry. The coal supply was failing! He mumbled, \"If my master can overcome this, he'll be incredibly famous!\" He couldn't stop himself from telling Fix what he had overheard. \"So, you actually believe we're sailing to Liverpool?\" Fix asked. \"Naturally,\" Passepartout answered. \"Fool!\" Fix shot back, shrugging and spinning around abruptly. Passepartout was on the verge of strongly protesting the insult, whose meaning he couldn't possibly grasp, but he considered that the poor detective was probably very let down and hurt in his pride after awkwardly chasing a false lead globally, and so he held back.",

Success would have been almost guaranteed if it were summer, but in winter, the unfavorable weather put them at risk. Passepartout remained silent, but inwardly he held onto hope and reassured himself that if the wind died down, they could still rely on the ship’s engine.\n\nThat day, the engineer came up to Mr. Fogg on deck and began an urgent conversation. Passepartout felt a sudden, vague sense of unease, an intuition he couldn’t explain. He wished he could overhear the discussion, and eventually caught a fragment where Fogg asked, “You’re sure about this?”\n\nThe engineer replied, “Absolutely, sir. Remember, we’ve kept strong fires burning in all the furnaces since the start, and while we had enough coal for reduced steam from New York to Bordeaux, we don’t have enough to sustain full steam from New York all the way to Liverpool.” Mr. Fogg responded, “I’ll think it over.”\n\nUnderstanding the situation, Passepartout was suddenly filled with dread: they were running low on coal! \"If my master manages to solve this problem,\" he thought, \"he will be truly remarkable!\" He shared what he’d overheard with Fix.\n\n\"So you really think we’ll reach Liverpool?\" Fix asked.\n\n\"Naturally,\" Passepartout replied.\n\n\"Fool!\" the detective retorted, shrugging and walking away.\n\nPassepartout nearly confronted Fix over the insult, which he didn’t understand, but decided to let it go, reasoning that Fix was likely embarrassed and disappointed after chasing the wrong suspect around the world."

          "text_segment": "And now what course would Phileas Fogg adopt? It was difficult to imagine. Nevertheless he seemed to have decided upon one, for that evening he sent for the engineer, and said to him, “Feed all the fires until the coal is exhausted.”\nA few moments after, the funnel of the “Henrietta” vomited forth torrents of smoke. The vessel continued to proceed with all steam on; but on the 18th, the engineer, as he had predicted, announced that the coal would give out in the course of the day.\n“Do not let the fires go down,” replied Mr. Fogg. “Keep them up to the last. Let the valves be filled.”\nTowards noon Phileas Fogg, having ascertained their position, called Passepartout, and ordered him to go for Captain Speedy. It was as if the honest fellow had been commanded to unchain a tiger. He went to the poop, saying to himself, “He will be like a madman!”\nIn a few moments, with cries and oaths, a bomb appeared on the poop-deck. The bomb was Captain Speedy. It was clear that he was on the point of bursting. “Where are we?” were the first words his anger permitted him to utter. Had the poor man been an apoplectic, he could never have recovered from his paroxysm of wrath.\n“Where are we?” he repeated, with purple face.\n“Seven hundred and seven miles from Liverpool,” replied Mr. Fogg, with imperturbable calmness.\n“Pirate!” cried Captain Speedy.\n“I have sent for you, sir—”\n“Pickaroon!”\n“—sir,” continued Mr. Fogg, “to ask you to sell me your vessel.”\n“No! By all the devils, no!”\n“But I shall be obliged to burn her.”\n“Burn the ‘Henrietta’!”\n“Yes; at least the upper part of her. The coal has given out.”\n“Burn my vessel!” cried Captain Speedy, who could scarcely pronounce the words. “A vessel worth fifty thousand dollars!”\n“Here are sixty thousand,” replied Phileas Fogg, handing the captain a roll of bank-bills. This had a prodigious effect on Andrew Speedy. An American can scarcely remain unmoved at the sight of sixty thousand dollars. The captain forgot in an instant his anger, his imprisonment, and all his grudges against his passenger. The “Henrietta” was twenty years old; it was a great bargain. The bomb would not go off after all. Mr. Fogg had taken away the match.\n“And I shall still have the iron hull,” said the captain in a softer tone.\n“The iron hull and the engine. Is it agreed?”\n“Agreed.”\nAnd Andrew Speedy, seizing the banknotes, counted them and consigned them to his pocket.\nDuring this colloquy, Passepartout was as white as a sheet, and Fix seemed on the point of having an apoplectic fit. Nearly twenty thousand pounds had been expended, and Fogg left the hull and engine to the captain, that is, near the whole value of the craft! It was true, however, that fifty-five thousand pounds had been stolen from the Bank.\nWhen Andrew Speedy had pocketed the money, Mr. Fogg said to him, “Don’t let this astonish you, sir.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The question now was what course of action Phileas Fogg would choose. His plan wasn't obvious, but he seemed to have settled on one, as that evening he instructed the engineer to keep all the furnaces burning until the coal ran out. Soon after, the 'Henrietta's' smokestack belched out enormous clouds of smoke. The ship maintained its speed, but on the 18th, just as the engineer had foretold, he reported that the coal reserves would be depleted by day's end. 'Do not reduce the fires,' Mr. Fogg ordered. 'Keep them going until the absolute last moment. Make sure the valves are full.' Around midday, after confirming their location, Phileas Fogg summoned Passepartout and told him to bring Captain Speedy. Passepartout felt as if he had been ordered to set a wild animal free. He went to the stern, thinking to himself, 'He's going to be completely enraged!' In a few moments, amid shouting and curses, a figure resembling a bomb appeared on the poop-deck. This was Captain Speedy, clearly on the verge of exploding with anger. 'Where are we?' were the first words he managed to bellow through his rage. Had the poor man suffered from apoplexy, this outburst could have been fatal. 'Where are we?' he repeated, his face turning crimson. 'Seven hundred and seven miles from Liverpool,' Mr. Fogg replied with his customary composure. 'Pirate!' Captain Speedy roared. 'I requested your presence, sir—' 'Thief!' '—sir,' Mr. Fogg continued calmly, 'to inquire if you would sell me your vessel.' 'Absolutely not! Never!' 'But I will be forced to burn part of it.' 'Burn the 'Henrietta'!' 'Yes, at least the upper structure. We have run out of coal.' 'Burn my ship!' cried Captain Speedy, barely able to speak the words. 'A vessel worth fifty thousand dollars!' 'Here are sixty thousand,' Phileas Fogg countered, handing the captain a thick bundle of banknotes. This had an extraordinary impact on Andrew Speedy. An American finds it almost impossible to remain indifferent to the sight of sixty thousand dollars. The captain instantly forgot his fury, his confinement, and all his resentment towards his passenger. The 'Henrietta' was twenty years old; this was an incredible deal. The explosive situation was defused; Mr. Fogg had removed the trigger. 'And I'll still get to keep the iron hull,' the captain remarked, his tone now much softer. 'The iron hull and the engine. Is it agreed?' 'Agreed.' And Andrew Speedy, grabbing the money, counted it and put it into his pocket. Throughout this exchange, Passepartout was deathly pale, and Fix appeared as though he might have a stroke. Nearly twenty thousand pounds had been spent, and Fogg was leaving the hull and engine to the captain, which was almost the full value of the ship! Although, it was true that fifty-five thousand pounds had been stolen from the Bank. Once Andrew Speedy had pocketed the funds, Mr. Fogg said to him, 'Do not be surprised by this, sir.'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "It was unclear at first what plan Phileas Fogg would follow next, but by evening, he seemed to have reached a decision. He summoned the engineer and instructed him, “Keep the fires burning until we run out of coal.” Soon after, smoke billowed in large amounts from the smokestack of the 'Henrietta' as the ship pressed on at full steam. By the 18th, just as the engineer had foreseen, he reported that the coal would be depleted by day's end. “Don’t let the fires die down,” instructed Mr. Fogg. “Keep feeding them until the very end and fill the valves.” Around midday, having checked their progress, Fogg called Passepartout and asked him to fetch Captain Speedy—something Passepartout dreaded, comparing it to letting loose a wild animal. As expected, Captain Speedy appeared on deck in a fury, shouting in anger. His face flushed, the captain demanded to know their whereabouts. Fogg calmly replied, “Seven hundred and seven miles from Liverpool.” “Pirate!” yelled Captain Speedy. “I summoned you, sir—” Fogg began, but the captain again shouted, “Pickaroon!” Undeterred, Fogg continued, “I want to buy your vessel.” “Absolutely not! Never!” the captain replied. “Then I am afraid I’ll have to burn her,” said Fogg. “Burn the 'Henrietta'?” questioned Speedy in disbelief. “Yes, at least the upper parts; we have no more coal left.” The captain was aghast at the idea of burning a ship worth fifty thousand dollars. Fogg then handed him sixty thousand dollars in cash, which immediately transformed the captain’s mood. The allure of such a sum made him forget his anger and resentment. Given that the 'Henrietta' was old, it was a good deal for him. The prospective disaster was averted. “And I will still retain the iron hull,” the captain remarked more calmly. “The hull and engine will remain yours. Do we have an agreement?” “Agreed,” said Speedy, taking the money and putting it in his pocket. All the while, Passepartout was pale with shock, and Fix looked as if he might faint. Fogg had spent nearly twenty thousand pounds and left the boat’s main value—the hull and engine—to the captain! But as fifty-five thousand pounds had been stolen from the bank, it was all relative. After receiving the money, Fogg told Captain Speedy not to be too surprised by his actions."

Captain Speedy, who had become quite invested in Mr. Fogg's endeavor, commented, \"Sir,\" I truly sympathize with your situation. Everything seems to be against you. We are only opposite Queenstown.\" Mr. Fogg asked, \"Ah,\" is that place where we see the lights Queenstown?\" \"Yes,\" came the reply. \"Can we enter the harbor?\" Fogg enquired. \"Not for three hours. Only when the tide is high,\" Speedy stated. \"Wait,\" Mr. Fogg responded calmly, his features concealing the fact that he was about to make another attempt to conquer misfortune based on a sudden inspiration. Queenstown is the Irish port where transatlantic steamers briefly stop to unload mail. This mail is then swiftly transported to Dublin via express trains that are always kept ready to depart; from Dublin, it is sent on to Liverpool using the fastest boats available, thereby saving twelve hours compared to the time taken by the Atlantic steamers themselves. Phileas Fogg calculated that he could gain twelve hours using this same method. Instead of arriving in Liverpool the following evening aboard the \"Henrietta,\" he would reach there by noon, which would give him ample time to arrive in London before the quarter past eight deadline in the evening.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "On the 20th, most of the rails, fittings, and upper deck of the \"Henrietta\" were gone, leaving it little more than a flat shell. That same day, they spotted the Irish coastline and the Fastnet Lighthouse. By 10 p.m., they were sailing past Queenstown. Phileas Fogg had just one day left to reach London, and all the ship's steam power would barely get them to Liverpool in that time—but even that steam was nearly depleted! Captain Speedy, now invested in Fogg's endeavor, said, \"Sir, you have my sympathy. Everything seems to be against you; we're just across from Queenstown now.\" Fogg replied, \"Those lights—are they Queenstown?\" The captain confirmed, explaining they couldn't enter the harbor in under three hours, and only at high tide. Remaining composed, Fogg considered his next move. Queenstown was a port where transatlantic ships stopped to offload mail, which was then whisked to Dublin by ready express trains before heading to Liverpool by fast boats—saving twelve hours over the direct route. Fogg planned to take advantage of this, aiming to reach Liverpool by noon instead of the next evening, and thus have enough time to get to London before 8:45 that evening."

With nothing to do outside, Fogg stayed home, isolating himself in his room to sort out his affairs. Passepartout spent the day repeatedly going up and down the stairs, finding the hours painfully long. He often listened at his master’s door or peered through the keyhole, worried that something dreadful might happen. He sometimes thought of Fix, now without anger—realizing that Fix and everyone else had simply been wrong about Fogg and was only following his duty in pursuing and arresting him. Passepartout, meanwhile, was haunted by his own mistake and kept reproaching himself for his foolishness.

There are three hundred and sixty degrees on the circumference of the earth; and these three hundred and sixty degrees, multiplied by four minutes, gives precisely twenty-four hours—that is, the day unconsciously gained. In other words, while Phileas Fogg, going eastward, saw the sun pass the meridian eighty times, his friends in London only saw it pass the meridian seventy-nine times. This is why they awaited him at the Reform Club on Saturday, and not Sunday, as Mr. Fogg thought.\nAnd Passepartout’s famous family watch, which had always kept London time, would have betrayed this fact, if it had marked the days as well as the hours and the minutes!",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The question arose as to how a person as meticulous and precise as Phileas Fogg could have made such a mistake regarding the day of his arrival. Why did he believe he reached London on Saturday, December 21st, the eightieth day of his journey, when it was actually Friday, December 20th, only the seventy-ninth day? The reason for this oversight was quite straightforward. Without realizing it, Phileas Fogg had gained an entire day during his travels simply by consistently journeying towards the east. Had he travelled in the opposite direction, westward, he would have conversely lost a day. By moving eastward, he travelled in the same direction as the sun's apparent movement, causing the length of each day, relative to a fixed point like London, to decrease by four minutes for every degree of longitude he crossed. As there are 360 degrees of longitude around the earth, multiplying this by four minutes yields precisely twenty-four hours, which is the day he gained unknowingly. In essence, while Phileas Fogg, travelling east, witnessed the sun pass the meridian eighty times, those remaining in London only saw it pass seventy-nine times. This disparity explains why his friends anticipated his arrival at the Reform Club on Saturday, rather than Sunday, as Mr. Fogg had calculated. Passepartout’s well-known family watch, which always showed London time, could have revealed this discrepancy had it been capable of displaying the date as well as the hours and minutes.",

Why did he believe he had reached London on Saturday, December 21st, when in reality it was Friday, December 20th, and only the seventy-ninth day since he set out? The explanation is quite straightforward. Phileas Fogg, without realizing it, had gained a day during his travels simply because he was always moving eastward; if he had gone westward instead, he would have lost a day. By heading east, he moved in the direction of the sun, causing his days to shorten by four minutes with each degree he crossed. Since there are 360 degrees around the Earth, multiplying this by four minutes results in exactly twenty-four hours—the length of one whole day—thus, he unknowingly gained a day. To put it another way, as Fogg traveled east, he saw the sun reach its highest point eighty times, whereas those in London only witnessed the sun do so seventy-nine times. This explains why his friends expected him at the Reform Club on Saturday rather than Sunday, which is what Fogg believed. If Passepartout’s beloved family watch had displayed the days in addition to the hours and minutes, it would have revealed this to them."
