   "as he went down the wall lizard fashion i wished i had a gun or some lethal weapon that i might destroy him but i fear that no weapon wrought alone by man ’ s hand would have any effect on him i dared not wait to see him return for i feared to see those weird sisters i came back to the library and read there till i fell asleep i was awakened by the count who looked at me as grimly as a man can look as he said “ tomorrow my friend we must part you return to your beautiful england i to some work which may have such an end that we may never meet your letter home has been despatched tomorrow i shall not be here but all shall be ready for your journey in the morning come the szgany who have some labours of their own here and also come some slovaks when they have gone my carriage shall come for you and shall bear you to the borgo pass to meet the diligence from bukovina to bistritz but i am in hopes that i shall see more of you at castle dracula ” i suspected him and determined to test his sincerity sincerity it seems like a profanation of the word to write it in connection with such a monster so asked him pointblank “ why may i not go tonight ” “ because dear sir my coachman and horses are away on a mission ” “ but i would walk with pleasure i want to get away at once ” he smiled such a soft smooth diabolical smile that i knew there was some trick behind his smoothness he said “ and your baggage ” “ i do not care about it i can send for it some other time ” the count stood up and said with a sweet courtesy which made me rub my eyes it seemed so real “ you english have a saying which is close to my heart for its spirit is that which rules our boyars ‘ welcome the coming speed the parting guest ’ come with me my dear young friend not an hour shall you wait in my house against your will though sad am i at your going and that you so suddenly desire it come ” with a stately gravity he with the lamp preceded me down the stairs and along the hall suddenly he stopped “ hark ” close at hand came the howling of many wolves it was almost as if the sound sprang up at the rising of his hand just as the music of a great orchestra seems to leap under the bâton of the conductor after a pause of a moment he proceeded in his stately way to the door drew back the ponderous bolts unhooked the heavy chains and began to draw it open to my intense astonishment i saw that it was unlocked suspiciously i looked all round but could see no key of any kind as the door began to open the howling of the wolves without grew louder and angrier their red jaws with champing teeth and their bluntclawed feet as they leaped came in through the opening door i knew then that to struggle at the moment against the count was useless with such allies as these at his command i could do nothing but still the door continued slowly to open and only the count ’ s body stood in the gap suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my doom i was to be given to the wolves and at my own instigation there was a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the count and as a last chance i cried out “ shut the door i shall wait till morning"

   "beyond the green swelling hills of the mittel land rose mighty slopes of forest up to the lofty steeps of the carpathians themselves right and left of us they towered with the afternoon sun falling full upon them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks green and brown where grass and rock mingled and an endless perspective of jagged rock and pointed crags till these were themselves lost in the distance where the snowy peaks rose grandly here and there seemed mighty rifts in the mountains through which as the sun began to sink we saw now and again the white gleam of falling water one of my companions touched my arm as we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty snowcovered peak of a mountain which seemed as we wound on our serpentine way to be right before us “ look isten szek ” “ god ’ s seat ” and he crossed himself reverently as we wound on our endless way and the sun sank lower and lower behind us the shadows of the evening began to creep round us this was emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountaintop still held the sunset and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink here and there we passed cszeks and slovaks all in picturesque attire but i noticed that goitre was painfully prevalent by the roadside were many crosses and as we swept by my companions all crossed themselves here and there was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine who did not even turn round as we approached but seemed in the selfsurrender of devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world there were many things new to me for instance hayricks in the trees and here and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch their white stems shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves now and again we passed a leiterwagonthe ordinary peasant ’ s cartwith its long snakelike vertebra calculated to suit the inequalities of the road on this were sure to be seated quite a group of homecoming peasants the cszeks with their white and the slovaks with their coloured sheepskins the latter carrying lancefashion their long staves with axe at end as the evening fell it began to get very cold and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the gloom of the trees oak beech and pine though in the valleys which ran deep between the spurs of the hills as we ascended through the pass the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of latelying snow sometimes as the road was cut through the pine woods that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us great masses of greyness which here and there bestrewed the trees produced a peculiarly weird and solemn effect which carried on the thoughts and grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening when the falling sunset threw into strange relief the ghostlike clouds which amongst the carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys sometimes the hills were so steep that despite our driver ’ s haste the horses could only go slowly i wished to get down and walk up them as we do at home but the driver would not hear of it “ no no ” he said “ you must not walk here the dogs are too fierce ” and then he added with what he evidently meant for grim pleasantryfor he looked round to catch the approving smile of the rest “ and you may have enough of such matters before you go to sleep ” the only stop he would make was a moment ’ s pause to light his lamps"
