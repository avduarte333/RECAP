   "before us lay a green sloping land full of forests and woods with here and there steep hills crowned with clumps of trees or with farmhouses the blank gable end to the road there was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossomapple plum pear cherry and as we drove by i could see the green grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals in and out amongst these green hills of what they call here the “ mittel land ” ran the road losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve or was shut out by the straggling ends of pine woods which here and there ran down the hillsides like tongues of flame the road was rugged but still we seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste i could not understand then what the haste meant but the driver was evidently bent on losing no time in reaching borgo prund i was told that this road is in summertime excellent but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter snows in this respect it is different from the general run of roads in the carpathians for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept in too good order of old the hospadars would not repair them lest the turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point beyond the green swelling hills of the mittel land rose mighty slopes of forest up to the lofty steeps of the carpathians themselves right and left of us they towered with the afternoon sun falling full upon them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks green and brown where grass and rock mingled and an endless perspective of jagged rock and pointed crags till these were themselves lost in the distance where the snowy peaks rose grandly here and there seemed mighty rifts in the mountains through which as the sun began to sink we saw now and again the white gleam of falling water one of my companions touched my arm as we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty snowcovered peak of a mountain which seemed as we wound on our serpentine way to be right before us “ look isten szek ” “ god ’ s seat ” and he crossed himself reverently as we wound on our endless way and the sun sank lower and lower behind us the shadows of the evening began to creep round us this was emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountaintop still held the sunset and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink here and there we passed cszeks and slovaks all in picturesque attire but i noticed that goitre was painfully prevalent by the roadside were many crosses and as we swept by my companions all crossed themselves here and there was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine who did not even turn round as we approached but seemed in the selfsurrender of devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world there were many things new to me for instance hayricks in the trees and here and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch their white stems shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves now and again we passed a"

   "but the door would not move despair seized me i pulled and pulled at the door and shook it till massive as it was it rattled in its casement i could see the bolt shot it had been locked after i left the count then a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk and i determined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the count ’ s room he might kill me but death now seemed the happier choice of evils without a pause i rushed up to the east window and scrambled down the wall as before into the count ’ s room it was empty but that was as i expected i could not see a key anywhere but the heap of gold remained i went through the door in the corner and down the winding stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel i knew now well enough where to find the monster i sought the great box was in the same place close against the wall but the lid was laid on it not fastened down but with the nails ready in their places to be hammered home i knew i must reach the body for the key so i raised the lid and laid it back against the wall and then i saw something which filled my very soul with horror there lay the count but looking as if his youth had been half renewed for the white hair and moustache were changed to dark irongrey the cheeks were fuller and the white skin seemed rubyred underneath the mouth was redder than ever for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood which trickled from the corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck even the deep burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh for the lids and pouches underneath were bloated it seemed as if the whole awful creature were simply gorged with blood he lay like a filthy leech exhausted with his repletion i shuddered as i bent over to touch him and every sense in me revolted at the contact but i had to search or i was lost the coming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those horrid three i felt all over the body but no sign could i find of the key then i stopped and looked at the count there was a mocking smile on the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad this was the being i was helping to transfer to london where perhaps for centuries to come he might amongst its teeming millions satiate his lust for blood and create a new and everwidening circle of semidemons to batten on"
