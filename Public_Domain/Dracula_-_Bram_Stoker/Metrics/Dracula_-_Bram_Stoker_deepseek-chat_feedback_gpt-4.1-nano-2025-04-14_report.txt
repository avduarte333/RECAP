   "i must put down every detail in order i went whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south side and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs around the building on this side the stones are big and roughly cut and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them i took off my boots and ventured out on the desperate way i looked down once so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would not overcome me but after that kept my eyes away from it i knew pretty well the direction and distance of the count ’ s window and made for it as well as i could having regard to the opportunities available i did not feel dizzyi suppose i was too excitedand the time seemed ridiculously short till i found myself standing on the windowsill and trying to raise up the sash i was filled with agitation however when i bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window then i looked around for the count but with surprise and gladness made a discovery the room was empty it was barely furnished with odd things which seemed to have never been used the furniture was something the same style as that in the south rooms and was covered with dust i looked for the key but it was not in the lock and i could not find it anywhere the only thing i found was a great heap of gold in one cornergold of all kinds roman and british and austrian and hungarian and greek and turkish money covered with a film of dust as though it had lain long in the ground none of it that i noticed was less than three hundred years old there were also chains and ornaments some jewelled but all of them old and stained at one corner of the room was a heavy door i tried it for since i could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door which was the main object of my search i must make further examination or all my efforts would be in vain it was open and led through a stone passage to a circular stairway which went steeply down i descended minding carefully where i went for the stairs were dark being only lit by loopholes in the heavy masonry at the bottom there was a dark tunnellike passage through which came a deathly sickly odour the odour of old earth newly turned as i went through the passage the smell grew closer and heavier at last i pulled open a heavy door which stood ajar and found myself in an old ruined chapel which had evidently been used as a graveyard the roof was broken and in two places were steps leading to vaults but the ground had recently been dug over and the earth placed in great wooden boxes manifestly those which had been brought by the slovaks there was nobody about and i made search for any further outlet but there was none then i went over every inch of the ground so as not to lose a chance i went down even into the vaults where the dim light struggled although to do so was a dread to my very soul into two of these i went but saw nothing except fragments of old coffins and piles of dust in the third however i made a discovery there in one of the great boxes of which there were fifty in all on a pile of newly dug earth lay the count he was either dead or asleep i could not say whichfor the eyes were open and stony but without the glassiness of deathand the cheeks had the warmth of life through all their pallor the lips were as red as ever but there was no sign of movement no pulse no breath no beating of the heart i bent over him and tried to find any sign of life but in vain he could not have lain there long for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours by the side of the box was its cover pierced with holes here and there i thought he might have the keys on him but when i went to search i saw the dead eyes and in them dead though they were such a look of hate though unconscious of me or my presence that i fled from the place and leaving the count ’ s room by the window crawled again up the castle wall regaining my room i threw myself panting upon the bed and"

   "i slept till just before the dawn and when i woke threw myself on my knees for i determined that if death came he should find me ready at last i felt that subtle change in the air and knew that the morning had come then came the welcome cockcrow and i felt that i was safe with a glad heart i opened my door and ran down to the hall i had seen that the door was unlocked and now escape was before me with hands that trembled with eagerness i unhooked the chains and drew back the massive bolts but the door would not move despair seized me i pulled and pulled at the door and shook it till massive as it was it rattled in its casement i could see the bolt shot it had been locked after i left the count then a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk and i determined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the count ’ s room he might kill me but death now seemed the happier choice of evils without a pause i rushed up to the east window and scrambled down the wall as before into the count ’ s room it was empty but that was as i expected i could not see a key anywhere but the heap of gold remained i went through the door in the corner and down the winding stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel i knew now well enough where to find the monster i sought the great box was in the same place close against the wall but the lid was laid on it not fastened down but with the nails ready in their places to be hammered home i knew i must reach the body for the key so i raised the lid and laid it back against the wall and then i saw something which filled my very soul with horror there lay the count but looking as if his youth had been half renewed for the white hair and moustache were changed to dark irongrey the cheeks were fuller and the white skin seemed rubyred underneath the mouth was redder than ever for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood which trickled from the corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck even the deep burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh for the lids and pouches underneath were bloated it seemed as if the whole awful creature were simply gorged with blood he lay like a filthy leech exhausted with his repletion i shuddered as i bent over to touch him and every sense in me revolted at the contact but i had to search or i was lost the coming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those horrid three i felt all over the body but no sign could i find of the key then i stopped and looked at the count there was a mocking smile on the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad this was the being i was helping to transfer to london where perhaps for centuries to come he might amongst its teeming millions satiate his lust for blood and create a new and everwidening circle of semidemons to batten on the helpless the very thought drove me mad a terrible desire came upon me to rid the world of such a monster there was no lethal weapon at hand but i seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the cases and lifting it high struck with the edge downward at the hateful face but as i did so the head turned and the eyes fell full upon me with all their blaze of basilisk horror the sight seemed to paralyse me and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face merely making a deep gash above the forehead the shovel fell from my hand across the box and as i pulled it away the flange of the blade caught the edge of the lid which fell over again and hid the horrid thing from my sight the last glimpse i had was of the bloated face bloodstained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its own in the nethermost hell"
