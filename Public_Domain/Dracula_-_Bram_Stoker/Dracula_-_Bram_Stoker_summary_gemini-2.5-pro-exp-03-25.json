I find that the district he named is in the extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states, Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the Castle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare with our own Ordnance Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post town named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my travels with Mina.\nIn the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities: Saxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the descendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the East and North. I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended from Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered the country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. I read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of imaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting.

Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous knocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then. I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour which they said was “mamaliga,” and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a very excellent dish, which they call “impletata.” (Mem., get recipe for this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little before eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to the station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour before we began to move.

There, I searched through various books and maps for information about Transylvania. It occurred to me that gaining some prior knowledge of the region would likely be beneficial when dealing with a nobleman from that country. My research revealed that the specific area the Count mentioned is situated in the far eastern part of Transylvania, right where it borders three different territories: Transylvania, Moldavia, and Bukovina. It lies deep within the Carpathian mountains, one of Europe's most untamed and lesser-known areas. I couldn't locate any map or publication that showed the precise whereabouts of Castle Dracula, as detailed maps like our Ordnance Survey maps don't exist for this country yet. However, I did find that Bistritz, the post town named by Count Dracula, is a place that is reasonably well-known. I plan to record some of my findings here, as they might help me recall details later when I discuss my journey with Mina.The population of Transylvania is made up of four distinct groups: the Saxons in the South, alongside the Wallachs, who are believed to be descended from the Dacians; the Magyars in the West; and the Szekelys in the East and North. I am heading towards the Szekelys, who claim ancestry tracing back to Attila and the Huns. This claim could be true, as the Magyars found Huns settled there when they conquered the land in the eleventh century. I read that all known superstitions in the world are said to converge within the curve of the Carpathians, as though it acts as a focal point for imaginative beliefs. If that's the case, my time here could be very interesting indeed. (Note to self: I must remember to question the Count extensively about these.)Despite having a comfortable bed, I didn't sleep well, experiencing a variety of strange dreams. A dog howling persistently under my window throughout the night might have contributed to this, or perhaps it was the paprika I had eaten, which left me so parched I drank all the water in my carafe and was still thirsty. I finally fell asleep closer to morning and was then woken by continuous knocking at my door, which suggests I must have been in a deep sleep at that point. For breakfast, I had more paprika, a kind of corn porridge they called “mamaliga,” and a superb dish of eggplant stuffed with forcemeat, which they refer to as “impletata.” (Another note: must get the recipe for this too.) I had to rush my breakfast because the train was scheduled to depart just before eight o'clock. Or rather, that was its *scheduled* time, because after rushing to the station by 7:30, I ended up waiting in the carriage for over an hour before we actually started moving.

I’ll be meeting the Szekelys, who believe they are descendants of Attila and the Huns. This might be true, since the Huns were there when the Magyars conquered the land in the eleventh century.

At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war proper being assisted by famine and disease.\nCount Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress—white undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff fitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and said, “The Herr Englishman?” “Yes,” I said, “Jonathan Harker.” She smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves, who had followed her to the door.

In the early 1600s, it endured a three-week siege during which 13,000 people died, due to a combination of warfare casualties, lack of food, and sickness. Count Dracula had told me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel. I was pleased to find it very traditional, which was exactly what I wanted to see of the local lifestyle.

In the early 1600s, it was besieged for three weeks, resulting in the deaths of 13,000 inhabitants, due not only to fighting but also famine and disease.\n\nCount Dracula had instructed me to stay at the Golden Krone Hotel, which I was pleased to find was charmingly traditional—I was eager to experience the local customs. Clearly, they were expecting me, as I was greeted warmly by an older woman in typical peasant attire—a white underdress and a closely fitting, colorful double apron. When I introduced myself as Jonathan Harker, the Englishman, she smiled and relayed a message to an elderly man who quickly returned with a letter for me.\n\nThe letter from Count Dracula welcomed me to the Carpathians, assured me he was looking forward to my arrival, advised me to rest that night, and informed me that I had a reserved seat on the coach leaving at three the next afternoon for Bukovina. His carriage would meet me at the Borgo Pass to bring me to him. He hoped my trip from London was enjoyable and that I would find pleasure in his beautiful homeland."

This could not be true, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he answered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old lady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of way. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that was all he knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could tell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves, and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak further. It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask any one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means comforting.\nJust before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a very hysterical way:\n“Must you go? Oh! young Herr, must you go?” She was in such an excited state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all. I was just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I told her that I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business, she asked again:\n“Do you know what day it is?” I answered that it was the fourth of May. She shook her head as she said again:\n“Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know what day it is?” On my saying that I did not understand, she went on:\n“It is the eve of St. George’s Day. Do you not know that to-night, when the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have full sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?” She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but without effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked her, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I did not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a state of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the rosary round my neck, and said, “For your mother’s sake,” and went out of the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting for the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still round my neck. Whether it is the old lady’s fear, or the many ghostly traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book should ever reach Mina before I do, let it bring my good-bye. Here comes the coach!",

However, when I inquired about the specific arrangements, he became somewhat reserved and claimed he couldn't understand my German. This was surprising as he had previously understood me perfectly, responding appropriately to my questions. Both he and his wife, the elderly woman who first welcomed me, exchanged uneasy glances. He mumbled that the payment had been sent through the mail and insisted he knew nothing further. When I asked if he was acquainted with Count Dracula or could share any information about his castle, both of them made the sign of the cross, stated they knew nothing at all, and refused to elaborate. As departure time was approaching rapidly, I had no opportunity to question anyone else. The whole interaction felt very mysterious and was not reassuring at all. Just before I was about to leave, the old woman came to my room in a state of extreme agitation, crying, \"Must you leave? Oh, young sir, do you truly have to go?\" She was so distressed that she seemed to forget much of her German, mixing it with another language I didn't recognize. I managed to follow her meaning only by asking many questions. When I explained that I had urgent business and must depart immediately, she asked again, \"Do you know what day it is?\" I replied that it was the fourth of May. She shook her head and repeated, \"Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you understand what *day* it is?\" When I admitted I didn't understand her emphasis, she continued, \"It is the eve of St. George's Day. Don't you know that tonight, at the stroke of midnight, all the malevolent forces in the world will hold complete dominion? Are you aware of where you are heading and what you are journeying towards?\" Her distress was so evident that I attempted to console her, but to no avail. Eventually, she fell to her knees, pleading with me not to go, or at least to postpone my departure for a day or two. It felt quite absurd, but it definitely unsettled me. Nevertheless, I had important obligations, and nothing could be allowed to impede them. So, I tried to help her up and stated as seriously as possible that I appreciated her concern but my duty was unavoidable, and I had to depart. She then stood, dried her eyes, and took a crucifix from around her neck, offering it to me. I was unsure how to react, as being an English Churchman, I've been taught to view such items as somewhat idolatrous, yet refusing a kind elderly woman in such a state felt incredibly rude. I believe she noticed my hesitation, because she placed the rosary (she had called it a crucifix earlier, but placed a rosary) around my neck and said, \"For your mother's sake,\" before leaving the room. I am currently documenting this in my diary while awaiting the coach, which is, predictably, running late. The crucifix/rosary is still around my neck. Whether it's the old woman's fear, the numerous eerie legends of this area, or the object itself, I cannot say, but I don't feel nearly as calm as I usually do. Should this record ever reach Mina before I do, consider it my final farewell. Ah, here comes the coach now!",

She then questioned if I knew what day it was; when I said it was May 4th, she emphasized it was the eve of St. George’s Day. She warned me that at midnight, evil forces would have free rein and asked if I was aware of where I was going and what awaited me. Her distress was clear, yet my attempts to reassure her did little.

Still, my obligations were pressing, so I politely insisted I must leave. She dried her tears, removed a crucifix from her neck, and offered it to me.

There are many odd things to put down, and, lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I left Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly. I dined on what they called “robber steak”—bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red pepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple style of the London cat’s meat! The wine was Golden Mediasch, which produces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not disagreeable. I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.\nWhen I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw him talking with the landlady. They were evidently talking of me, for every now and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting on the bench outside the door—which they call by a name meaning “word-bearer”—came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them pityingly. I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for there were many nationalities in the crowd; so I quietly got my polyglot dictionary from my bag and looked them out. I must say they were not cheering to me, for amongst them were “Ordog”—Satan, “pokol”—hell, “stregoica”—witch, “vrolok” and “vlkoslak”—both of which mean the same thing, one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is either were-wolf or vampire. (Mem., I must ask the Count about these superstitions)\nWhen we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time swelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and pointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty I got a fellow-passenger to tell me what they meant; he would not answer at first, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a charm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me, just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every one seemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I could not but be touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse which I had of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing themselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the centre of the yard.

There are numerous peculiar occurrences I need to record, and to prevent anyone reading this from assuming I overindulged before leaving Bistritz, I will accurately describe my meal. I ate what they called 'robber steak'—pieces of bacon, onion, and beef seasoned with red pepper, skewered and cooked over an open fire, prepared simply like street vendor meat in London. The accompanying wine was Golden Mediasch, which leaves a peculiar but not unpleasant tingling sensation on the tongue. I drank only two glasses of this and nothing else.

It was clear they were discussing me, as they glanced at me frequently, and some people sitting on a bench outside the door—which they called by a name meaning 'word-bearer'—came closer to listen, then looked at me, mostly with pity. I could hear several words repeated often, strange words due to the diverse nationalities in the group; so I quietly retrieved my multilingual dictionary from my bag and looked them up. I must admit, their meanings were not comforting, including 'Ordog' (Satan), 'pokol' (hell), 'stregoica' (witch), and 'vrolok' and 'vlkoslak'—both meaning the same thing, one Slovak and the other Serbian for a creature that is either a werewolf or a vampire.

Before us lay a green sloping land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the road. There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom—apple, plum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by I could see the green grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these green hills of what they call here the “Mittel Land” ran the road, losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the hillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still we seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no time in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that this road is in summertime excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter snows. In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept in too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops, and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.\nBeyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves. Right and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range, deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where the snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again the white gleam of falling water. One of my companions touched my arm as we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered peak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to be right before us:—\n“Look! Isten szek!”—“God’s seat!”—and he crossed himself reverently.\nAs we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This was emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there we passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed that goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses, and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. Here and there was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were many things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now and again we passed a leiter-wagon—the ordinary peasant’s cart—with its long, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the road. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming peasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their coloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long staves, with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold, and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the Pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of late-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of greyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the hills were so steep that, despite our driver’s haste, the horses could only go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home, but the driver would not hear of it. “No, no,” he said; “you must not walk here; the dogs are too fierce”; and then he added, with what he evidently meant for grim pleasantry—for he looked round to catch the approving smile of the rest—“and you may have enough of such matters before you go to sleep.” The only stop he would make was a moment’s pause to light his lamps.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "As we rode along, the beauty of the landscape quickly helped me forget my ghostly fears, though I suspect if I had understood the languages spoken by my fellow passengers, I might not have shaken them off so easily. Ahead lay gently sloping terrain covered in forests and woods, interspersed with steep hills, some crowned with clusters of trees and others with farmhouses turned end-on to the road. Everywhere there was an astonishing abundance of fruit trees in bloom—apples, plums, pears, and cherries—and as we passed, I could see the green ground beneath the trees sparkling with fallen petals. The road wound its way through these green hills, which are called the “Mittel Land” here, disappearing as it rounded grassy bends or was obscured by the scattered fringes of pine woods that descended the hillsides like tongues of fire. The road surface was rough, yet we seemed to race over it with frantic speed. At the time, I didn't understand the reason for the hurry, but the driver was clearly determined to reach Borgo Prund without delay. I was informed that this road is excellent in the summer, but it had not yet been cleared and repaired after the winter snows. In this regard, it differs from most roads in the Carpathians, as there is an old custom of not maintaining them too well. Historically, the local rulers chose not to repair them, fearing the Turks would interpret it as preparation for bringing in foreign troops, thus accelerating the war that always seemed on the brink.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As we drove on, the beauty of the scenery soon made me forget my earlier fears, although if I had understood the different languages my fellow travelers spoke, I might not have dismissed my worries so easily. The landscape ahead featured rolling green hills dotted with forests, occasional steep rises topped with clusters of trees or farmhouses facing the road, and everywhere there was a profusion of blossoming fruit trees—apples, plums, pears, cherries. Fallen petals speckled the green grass beneath these trees. Our road wound through the hills of what locals call the “Mittel Land,” curving in and out of grassy slopes and disappearing into the tails of pine woods that stretched down the hillsides like tongues of fire. Although the road was rough, our coach sped along urgently; I did not understand why, but the driver seemed determined to reach Borgo Prund without delay. I heard that the road is usually excellent in summer, but this time it hadn’t been repaired after the winter snows—a contrast to most Carpathian roads, which historically weren’t maintained to prevent giving the Turks the impression they were preparing for invasion.\n\nBeyond the rolling hills, vast forests climbed the high slopes of the Carpathians. On either side, the mountains loomed, bathed in afternoon sunlight that revealed a spectrum of vivid colors: dark blues and purples in shaded peaks, greens and browns where grass met rock, and craggy outlines stretching into the distance, with snowy heights rising majestically. Occasionally, we could see waterfalls shining white through gaps in the peaks as the sun lowered. As we circled a hill and the snowy summit of a mountain appeared before us, a companion pointed and murmured reverently, “God’s seat,” making the sign of the cross.\n\nAs the journey continued and the sun dipped lower behind us, evening shadows deepened around our coach, while the distant mountain tops still gleamed with a soft pink hue from the last rays. We passed Cszeks and Slovaks in colorful traditional dress—though I noticed that many suffered from goitre. Roadside crosses were common, and my companions crossed themselves as we went by. Sometimes locals were seen kneeling in prayer at shrines, completely absorbed in devotion. Many sights were new to me: haystacks built in trees, beautiful weeping birches with shining white trunks among the fresh green leaves. Occasionally we encountered peasant wagons—leiter-wagons—with groups of peasants returning home, Cszeks in white, Slovaks in colored sheepskins, the latter holding long staffs with axes. As evening fell, the air grew colder and the landscape merged into a shadowy mist, with oaks, beeches, and pines blending together. In deep valleys, dark firs stood out against lingering snow, while thick fog and pale clouds created an eerie, somber atmosphere that recalled my earlier, darker imaginings. At times, the road was so steep that, in spite of the driver’s haste, the horses could hardly manage. Although I wanted to walk up the slope as I would at home, the driver refused, warning about fierce dogs in the area, and with a dark humor added that I might have enough of them before the night was over. He paused the coach only briefly—to light the lamps."

He lashed the horses unmercifully with his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on to further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the hills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a stormy sea. I had to hold on. The road grew more level, and we appeared to fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each side and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass. One by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good faith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of fear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at Bistritz—the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye. Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the darkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would give me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for some little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on the eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got into the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance which was to take me to the Count. Each moment I expected to see the glare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The only light was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle. The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock my own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best do, when the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; I thought it was “An hour less than the time.” Then turning to me, he said in German worse than my own:—\n“There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. He will now come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better the next day.” Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then, amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing of themselves, a calèche, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook us, and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash of our lamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and splendid animals. They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown beard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. I could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red in the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver:—\n“You are early to-night, my friend.” The man stammered in reply:—\n“The English Herr was in a hurry,” to which the stranger replied:—\n“That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot deceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift.” As he spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of my companions whispered to another the line from Burger’s “Lenore”:—\n“Denn die Todten reiten schnell”—\n(“For the dead travel fast.”)\nThe strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a gleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away, at the same time putting out his two fingers and crossing himself. “Give me the Herr’s luggage,” said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were handed out and put in the calèche. Then I descended from the side of the coach, as the calèche was close alongside, the driver helping me with a hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must have been prodigious. Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we swept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looked back I saw the steam from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Then the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept on their way to Bukovina. As they sank into the darkness I felt a strange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown over my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in excellent German:—\n“The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take all care of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the country) underneath the seat, if you should require it.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "As darkness fell, the passengers seemed to become agitated, speaking to the driver one after another as if urging him to accelerate. He whipped the horses fiercely and shouted encouragement, pushing them to exert themselves even more. Looking into the darkness, I then saw a lighter area ahead, like a gap in the hills. The passengers' excitement intensified; the unstable carriage jolted on its large leather springs, swaying like a small boat in a storm. I had to grip something firmly to stay steady. The road became flatter, and we seemed to race along rapidly. Then the mountains appeared closer on either side, looming over us – we were entering the Borgo Pass. Several passengers, one by one, offered me presents. They insisted I take them with an earnestness that allowed no refusal. These gifts were certainly unusual and varied, but each was given with genuine good will, a kind word, a blessing, and that peculiar combination of apprehensive gestures I had seen outside the hotel in Bistritz – making the sign of the cross and warding off the evil eye. As we sped along, the driver leaned forward, and the passengers on both sides craned their necks over the edge of the coach, peering eagerly into the gloom. It was clear that something significant was either happening or anticipated, but despite asking each passenger, none would offer any explanation. This state of heightened anticipation continued for a while; finally, we saw the Pass opening up before us on the eastern side. Dark, rolling clouds hung overhead, and the air was heavy and oppressive, feeling like thunder was imminent. It seemed as if the mountain range had divided the atmosphere into two distinct zones, and we had now entered the one charged with thunder. I began scanning the darkness myself, searching for the vehicle that was supposed to transport me to the Count. Every moment I expected to see the glow of lamps cutting through the blackness, but there was only darkness. The only light came from our own lamps, illuminated by which the steam from our hard-driven horses rose in a white mist. We could now clearly see the sandy road stretching white ahead of us, but there was no sign of any carriage. The passengers leaned back with a sigh of relief, which seemed to mock my own disappointment. I was already considering my next steps when the driver, checking his watch, said something to the others that I could barely hear, spoken so quietly and softly; I thought he said, “An hour ahead of schedule.” Then, turning to me, he spoke in German, worse than my own: “There is no carriage here. The gentleman is not expected after all. He must continue on to Bukovina and return tomorrow or the day after; preferably the day after.” While he spoke, the horses began to whinny, snort, and buck wildly, forcing the driver to rein them in tightly. Then, amidst a chorus of screams from the peasants and everyone making the sign of the cross, a calèche pulled by four horses drove up behind us, overtook us, and stopped alongside our coach. In the flash of our lamps, as their beams hit the horses, I could see they were magnificent, coal-black animals. They were driven by a tall man with a long brown beard and a large black hat that seemed to conceal his face. I could only make out the glint of remarkably bright eyes, which appeared red in the lamplight, as he turned towards us. He said to our driver, “You are early tonight, my friend.” The man stuttered in reply, “The English gentleman was in a hurry.” The stranger responded, “That is why, I presume, you wanted him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot deceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift.” As he spoke, he smiled, and the lamplight illuminated a harsh mouth with very red lips and sharp, ivory-white teeth. One of my companions whispered to another a line from Burger’s “Lenore”: “For the dead travel fast.” The strange driver clearly overheard the words, for he looked up with a glowing smile. The passenger quickly turned his face away, simultaneously extending two fingers and crossing himself. “Give me the gentleman’s luggage,” said the driver; and with surprising speed, my bags were taken out and placed in the calèche. Then I got down from the coach, as the calèche was right beside it, the driver assisting me with a hand that gripped my arm with metallic strength; his power must have been immense. Without a word, he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we sped into the dark depths of the Pass. Looking back, I saw the steam from the coach horses illuminated by the lamps, and silhouetted against it were the figures of my recent companions crossing themselves. Then the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and they hurried away on their journey to Bukovina. As they disappeared into the darkness, I felt a peculiar chill and a sense of loneliness came over me; but a cloak was placed over my shoulders and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in excellent German: “The night is cold, sir, and my master the Count instructed me to take full care of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the local plum brandy) under the seat, should you need it.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As night fell, a sense of excitement spread among the passengers, who kept urging the driver to go faster, one after another. He began whipping the horses without mercy, shouting wildly to spur them on, and the carriage sped forward with increasing speed. Ahead, through the darkness, I noticed a faint grey light, suggesting a gap in the hills. The passengers became even more agitated as the coach rattled and swayed violently, forcing me to grip tightly for stability. The road leveled out and we rushed onward, the mountains looming ever closer on both sides as we entered the Borgo Pass. Several passengers pressed unusual gifts into my hands, insisting I accept them, each accompanied by kind words, blessings, and ritual gestures—crossing themselves and making signs to ward off evil, much as I had seen outside the hotel in Bistritz.\n\nDuring our rapid travel, the driver leaned forward, while the other passengers strained to peer into the darkness. Clearly, something significant was happening or about to happen, but when I questioned them, they refused to explain. This tense atmosphere lasted a while, and eventually, we saw the Pass opening towards the east. Ominous clouds gathered overhead, and the suppressed, heavy feeling of a coming thunderstorm filled the air, as if we had passed into a different, stormier climate. I began looking out for the carriage due to pick me up for my journey to see the Count; every moment I expected to spot its lights, but there was only darkness save for our own flickering lanterns and the vapor rising from our exhausted horses. We could see the white road ahead, but there was no other vehicle in sight. The passengers withdrew with a relieved sigh that contrasted my disappointment. I was deciding what to do next when the driver quietly said something to the others, mentioning that we were an hour ahead of time. Then, turning to me, he told me in clumsy German that there was no carriage and that I should continue on to Bukovina and return the next day.\n\nAt that moment, the horses became restless and noisy. Suddenly, amid the fearful reactions and signs of protection from the peasants, a calèche drawn by four magnificent black horses pulled up beside us. Its driver was a tall man with a shaggy brown beard and a large black hat that shadowed his face, though I saw his bright, red-glowing eyes in the lamp light. He addressed our driver, commenting that he was early, to which our driver explained the English gentleman was in a hurry. The newcomer replied knowingly, implying he was aware of attempts to mislead him, and remarked on the speed of his own horses. As he spoke, his mouth appeared hard, with vivid red lips and sharp, white teeth. One passenger quoted a line from Burger’s “Lenore” about the dead traveling fast, which the new driver evidently overheard, smiling ominously. The passenger quickly turned away, making a sign of protection. The strange driver demanded my luggage, which was handed over without delay, and I climbed into the awaiting calèche. The man’s hand gripped my arm with surprising strength.\n\nWithout another word, the driver set the horses into motion and we sped into the deep darkness of the Pass. Glancing back, I saw the cloud of horse-breath extruding in the lamp light behind us, and my fellow passengers depicted as silhouettes, crossing themselves. Then their coach rolled on towards Bukovina. As they disappeared from sight, I felt a chill and pang of loneliness, but the new driver wrapped me in a cloak and rug, assuring me in perfect German that the night was cold and the Count had instructed him to take good care of me. He also pointed out a flask of local plum brandy under the seat if I wished for it."

          "text_segment": "I did not take any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I felt a little strangely, and not a little frightened. I think had there been any alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that unknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along, then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road. It seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground again; and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was so. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but I really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to delay. By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time was passing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it was within a few minutes of midnight. This gave me a sort of shock, for I suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my recent experiences. I waited with a sick feeling of suspense.\nThen a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road—a long, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken up by another dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which now sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp it through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began to strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from sudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each side of us began a louder and a sharper howling—that of wolves—which affected both the horses and myself in the same way—for I was minded to jump from the calèche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged madly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them from bolting. In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to the sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able to descend and to stand before them. He petted and soothed them, and whispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became quite manageable again, though they still trembled. The driver again took his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace. This time, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.\nSoon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the roadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning rocks guarded us boldly on either side. Though we were in shelter, we could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along. It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall, so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket. The keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew fainter as we went on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver, however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.\nSuddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The driver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and, jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not know what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took his seat, and we resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen asleep and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated endlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare. Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness around us I could watch the driver’s motions. He went rapidly to where the blue flame arose—it must have been very faint, for it did not seem to illumine the place around it at all—and gathering a few stones, formed them into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical effect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it, for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me, but as the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me straining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blue flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the wolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Although I didn't consume any, its presence was reassuring. I felt somewhat peculiar and quite apprehensive. I believe if there had been an alternative, I would have chosen it rather than proceeding with that unknown nighttime journey. The carriage maintained a rapid pace directly forward, then executed a full turn and continued along another straight route. It struck me that we were repeatedly traversing the same area; therefore, I marked a distinguishing point and confirmed this observation. I would have liked to inquire with the driver about the reason for this, but I was genuinely afraid to do so, thinking that given my situation, any objection would be useless if the intention was to cause delay. However, as I was curious about the passage of time, I lit a match and checked my watch by its light; it was just a few minutes before midnight. This caused me a type of shock, perhaps because the common belief about midnight was amplified by my recent experiences. I waited with a dreadful feeling of anticipation.\nThen, a dog in a distant farmhouse down the road started howling—a prolonged, distressed cry, seemingly out of terror. The sound was echoed by another dog, then yet another and another, until, carried by the wind now softly sighing through the Pass, a wild chorus of howling erupted, appearing to emanate from across the entire region, as far as my imagination could perceive through the night's darkness. At the initial howl, the horses began to strain and rear up, but the driver spoke calmingly to them, and they settled down, although they shivered and sweated as if recovering from suddenly bolting in fright. Following this, far off in the distance, from the mountains flanking us, a louder and sharper howling began—the sound of wolves—which affected both the horses and me similarly—I was tempted to leap from the carriage and run, while they reared up and plunged wildly again, forcing the driver to exert his full strength to prevent them from running off. Within a few minutes, however, my hearing adjusted to the noise, and the horses became sufficiently calm for the driver to dismount and stand before them. He stroked and comforted them, whispering something into their ears, much like I've heard horse-trainers do, and with remarkable effectiveness, as his gentle handling made them quite manageable again, despite their continued trembling. The driver reoccupied his seat, shook the reins, and we set off at a high speed. This time, after reaching the far side of the Pass, he abruptly turned down a narrow track that veered sharply to the right.\nSoon, we were enclosed by trees, which in places formed an arch over the road, making us pass through what felt like a tunnel; and again, imposing, dark rocks stood guard boldly on either side. Although we were sheltered, we could hear the wind picking up, as it moaned and whistled through the rocks, and the tree branches clashed together as we sped along. It grew progressively colder, and fine, powdery snow started to fall, so that soon we and everything around us were covered by a white layer. The biting wind still brought the sound of the dogs howling, although this faded as we continued our journey. The baying of the wolves sounded increasingly close, as if they were surrounding us from all directions. I became terribly frightened, and the horses shared my fear. The driver, however, was completely unperturbed; he kept turning his head left and right, but I could not discern anything in the darkness.\nSuddenly, to our left, I spotted a faint, flickering blue light. The driver noticed it simultaneously; he immediately halted the horses, and dismounting, vanished into the darkness. I was uncertain what to do, especially as the wolves' howling grew nearer; but while I was pondering, the driver suddenly reappeared, took his seat without a word, and we resumed our travel. I suspect I might have dozed off and repeatedly dreamed of this event, as looking back now, it resembles a kind of dreadful nightmare. On one occasion, the flame appeared so close to the road that, even in the surrounding darkness, I could observe the driver's actions. He moved quickly to where the blue flame emerged—it must have been very dim, as it seemed not to illuminate the area around it at all—and collecting some stones, arranged them into some pattern or shape. Once, a peculiar visual effect occurred: when he stood between me and the flame, he didn't obscure it, as I could still see its ghostly shimmer. This startled me, but as the effect was only momentary, I assumed my eyes were deceiving me from straining in the darkness. For a period after that, there were no blue flames, and we hastened forward through the gloom, with the wolves howling around us, as if they were following in a moving circle.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I didn't actually take any, but just knowing it was available brought me comfort. I felt uneasy and more than a little scared. If I’d had another option, I would have chosen it instead of continuing this mysterious night journey. The carriage was moving quickly and directly, but then we made a sharp turn and went down another straight road. It seemed as if we were just circling the same area, so I took note of a landmark and confirmed it—we were indeed repeating the route. I wanted to ask the driver what was happening, but I was afraid—given my situation, voicing my concern probably wouldn’t help if he meant to delay me. Eventually, wondering about the time, I struck a match and checked my watch—it was almost midnight. This startled me, probably because my recent experiences had heightened the usual superstitious fear of midnight. Full of anxious anticipation, I waited.\n\nSoon, I heard a dog howling down the road at a farmhouse—a long, drawn-out cry of fear. Other dogs joined in, and their cries were carried on the breeze that now whispered through the mountain pass. The whole countryside seemed alive with howls, spreading as far as the darkness allowed imagination to reach. The horses panicked at the first howl, straining and rearing, but the driver soothed them, gradually calming them down, although they trembled and sweated as if recovering from a scare. Then, louder and sharper howling started from the distant mountains—the howls of wolves—which unsettled both the horses and me. I felt like jumping out and running, just as the horses reared and thrashed so wildly that the driver had to use all his strength to keep them under control. After a while, I adapted to the noise, and the horses eventually quieted enough that the driver could get down, stand before them, and gently soothe them, whispering like a horse-tamer. His efforts calmed them considerably, though they were still shaking. He climbed back onto the carriage, shook the reins, and we set off at speed again. This time, after passing to the far end of the pass, he turned sharply down a narrow road to the right.\n\nWe were soon surrounded by trees arching overhead to form a tunnel, and flanked by imposing rocks on either side. Even protected by the trees, I could hear the wind rising as it whistled among the rocks and crashed the tree branches together. The temperature dropped further, and fine snow began to fall, quickly covering everything in white. Though the wind still carried distant dog howls, they grew fainter as we continued. The baying of wolves, however, came ever closer, as though they were gathering all around. Terror gripped me, and the horses seemed just as afraid. The driver, in contrast, remained calm, glancing left and right, but I couldn’t see anything in the darkness.\n\nThen I spotted a dim, flickering blue flame on our left, just as the driver saw it too. He stopped the horses, jumped down, and disappeared into the gloom. I was unsure what to do, especially as the wolves’ howling came nearer. Soon, the driver reappeared without a word, resumed his seat, and we continued. I think I may have dozed off and dreamt this event recurring, for it seemed to repeat again and again, feeling like a terrifying nightmare when I look back. At one point, the flame was so close I could watch the driver’s actions even in near-total darkness. He moved quickly to the flame, which was so faint it didn’t seem to light anything around it, and arranged some stones into a pattern. For a moment, when he stood between me and the flame, his figure didn’t block the light—I could still see its pale flicker through him. This caught me off guard, but the effect was brief, and I decided it must have been a trick of my eyes in the darkness. After that, we saw no more blue flames and continued our journey, with the wolves' howls encircling us as though they were closing in."

I could not see any cause for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues, with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. They were a hundred times more terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled. For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand their true import.\nAll at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had some peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared, and looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see; but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they had perforce to remain within it. I called to the coachman to come, for it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the ring and to aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of the calèche, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as to give him a chance of reaching the trap. How he came there, I know not, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. As he swept his long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves fell back and back further still. Just then a heavy cloud passed across the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.\nWhen I could see again the driver was climbing into the calèche, and the wolves had disappeared. This was all so strange and uncanny that a dreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move. The time seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon.

In its light, I saw a ring of wolves surrounding us. They had white teeth, red tongues hanging out, long, muscular limbs, and shaggy fur. Their terrifying silence was far more frightening than their howls. I felt completely frozen by fear, understanding that only by facing such horrors can one truly grasp their significance. Suddenly, the wolves began to howl, as if the moonlight had strangely affected them. The horses thrashed and reared, looking around helplessly with eyes rolling painfully to see. But the menacing circle trapped them completely, forcing them to stay within it. I called to the coachman to come, thinking our only chance was to try to break through the ring and help him reach us. I shouted and beat the side of the carriage, hoping the noise would scare the wolves away from that point, allowing him to get to the vehicle. I don't know how he arrived, but I heard his voice giving sharp, commanding orders. Looking towards the sound, I saw him standing in the road. As he swept his long arms, as if pushing away some invisible barrier, the wolves retreated further and further. Just then, a thick cloud crossed the moon, plunging us back into darkness. When I could see again, the driver was climbing back into the carriage, and the wolves had vanished.

While he was gone, the horses grew increasingly terrified, trembling, snorting, and screaming though I could not see any reason, since even the wolves had fallen silent. Then, as the moon emerged from behind dark clouds and illuminated a rugged, pine-covered rock, I saw that we were surrounded by a silent circle of wolves. Their white teeth, red tongues, powerful bodies, and thick fur made them appear far more menacing in silence than when they were howling. Fear overwhelmed me, making me feel almost paralyzed, and it was only then that I truly understood the horror of my situation. Suddenly, the wolves began to howl again, seemingly inspired by the moonlight. The horses grew frantic, rearing and glancing around in terror, but were trapped by the encircling wolves. I called out for the driver, believing our only hope was to break through the pack and help him reach us. I banged on the coach, trying to frighten the wolves away so he could approach. Somehow, the coachman returned, his authoritative voice rising as he appeared in the road. Waving his arms as if to sweep away some invisible force, the wolves retreated and faded into the night, just as a cloud veiled the moon, plunging us back into darkness. When I could finally see, the coachman was climbing in, and the wolves had vanished.

In the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark ways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than it really is. I have not yet been able to see it by daylight.\nWhen the calèche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand to assist me to alight. Again I could not but notice his prodigious strength. His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have crushed mine if he had chosen. Then he took out my traps, and placed them on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and studded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of massive stone. I could see even in the dim light that the stone was massively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and weather. As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the reins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one of the dark openings.\nI stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do. Of bell or knocker there was no sign; through these frowning walls and dark window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate. The time I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon me. What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people? What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked? Was this a customary incident in the life of a solicitor’s clerk sent out to explain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner? Solicitor’s clerk! Mina would not like that. Solicitor—for just before leaving London I got word that my examination was successful; and I am now a full-blown solicitor! I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if I were awake. It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I expected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with the dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had now and again felt in the morning after a day of overwork.

In the low light, the courtyard appeared quite large, and with several dark paths leading away under substantial round arches, it might have seemed bigger than it actually is. I haven't had the opportunity to view it in daylight yet. When the carriage stopped, the driver got down and extended his hand to help me descend. Again, I couldn't help but observe his extraordinary strength. His hand truly felt like a steel grip that could have crushed mine if he had chosen to. He then retrieved my luggage and placed it on the ground beside me as I stood near a large door, ancient and studded with big iron nails, set within a projecting entranceway of solid stone. Even in the faint light, I could discern that the stone was elaborately carved, but the carving had been significantly worn down by time and the elements. As I stood there, the driver climbed back onto his seat and shook the reins; the horses moved forward, and the carriage and everything vanished down one of the dark passages. I remained standing silently where I was, uncertain of what to do. There was no sign of a bell or knocker; through these imposing walls and dark window openings, it was unlikely my voice could be heard. The waiting time felt interminable, and doubts and fears began to press in on me. What kind of place had I arrived at, and what sort of people were here? What peculiar and potentially dangerous adventure was this that I had embarked upon?

It all felt like a terrible nightmare, and I expected to suddenly wake up and find myself at home, with the dawn filtering through the windows, as I had sometimes felt in the mornings after a day of excessive work.

Even in the poor light, I could tell the stone was strongly carved, though the details had been worn away by time and weather. While I stood there, the driver climbed back onto his seat, shook the reins, and drove off into one of the dark passageways, vanishing with the carriage. Left alone, I didn’t know what to do. There was no bell or knocker, and it seemed unlikely anyone inside would hear my voice through such intimidating walls and dark windows. The waiting felt endless, with anxiety and fear rising in me.

Step inside freely and by your own choice!” He did not move forward to meet me initially, remaining still as if frozen, his welcoming gesture holding him in place like a statue.

Next, I heard chains rattling and large bolts being pulled back. The sound of a key turning followed, grinding loudly as if it hadn't been used for a long time, and then the big door swung open. Standing in the doorway was a tall, elderly man, clean-shaven except for a long white moustache, dressed completely in black with not a hint of color on him. He carried an old-fashioned silver lamp with a bare, flickering flame, casting long, trembling shadows in the draft from the open door. The old man gestured formally with his right hand, inviting me in, and spoke in perfect English, though with a peculiar accent:—\n\"Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own will!\" He didn't move toward me, but remained still, his welcoming gesture making him seem like a statue. However, as soon as I stepped inside, he suddenly moved forward and shook my hand with surprising strength that made me flinch, and his hand was as cold as ice—more like the hand of a corpse than a living person. He repeated: \"Welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely; and leave something of the happiness you bring!\""

His eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a man of his years. For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops extremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm though thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.\nHitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees in the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but seeing them now close to me, I could not but notice that they were rather coarse—broad, with squat fingers.

We were both silent for a while; and as I looked towards the window I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn. There seemed a strange stillness over everything; but as I listened I heard as if from down below in the valley the howling of many wolves. The Count’s eyes gleamed, and he said:—\n“Listen to them—the children of the night. What music they make!” Seeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he added:—\n“Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the hunter.” Then he rose and said:—\n“But you must be tired.

He had a high, rounded forehead, and his hair was thin around his temples but thick on the rest of his head. His eyebrows were very thick and bushy, almost meeting above his nose, with profuse hair that seemed to curl on its own. Beneath his heavy moustache, his mouth looked set and rather cruel, with unusually sharp, white teeth that extended over his lips. The striking redness of his lips indicated surprising vitality for a man of his apparent age. His ears were pale and notably pointed at the top. His chin was wide and strong, and his cheeks were firm but thin. Overall, he presented a look of extraordinary paleness. Earlier, I had only seen the backs of his hands resting on his knees in the firelight, and they had appeared quite white and refined. But seeing them up close now, I couldn't help but notice they were rather rough and wide, with short, thick fingers. Oddly, there was hair growing in the center of his palms. His fingernails were long, slender, and sharpened to a point. When the Count leaned over me and his hands made contact, I involuntarily shivered. It might have been his unpleasant breath, but a terrible feeling of nausea overcame me, which I couldn't hide no matter how hard I tried. The Count, clearly seeing my reaction, pulled back.

Considering the extraordinary signs of wealth surrounding me, there are certainly peculiar absences in the house. The table service is gold and so intricately crafted it must be exceedingly valuable. The hangings on my bed, as well as the curtains and upholstery on the chairs and sofas, are made from the most expensive and beautiful materials; though centuries old, they are in excellent condition and must have been incredibly valuable when new. I saw similar items at Hampton Court, but those were worn and damaged by moths. Yet, despite all this, there isn't a single mirror in any of the rooms. There isn't even a small dressing mirror on my table, so I had to use the tiny shaving glass from my bag to shave or brush my hair. I have not yet encountered any servants anywhere, nor have I heard any sound near the castle other than the howling of wolves. Some time after I finished my meal—I'm unsure whether to call it breakfast or dinner, as it was between five and six o'clock—I looked for something to read, as I didn't want to explore the castle without Count Dracula's permission. There was absolutely nothing in the room, neither books nor newspapers nor even writing supplies. So, I opened another door and found what appeared to be a library. I tried the door opposite mine, but it was locked.",

May God protect me, if only for the sake of my loved ones! \n\n7 May. — It is once again early morning, but this time I have had a good rest and enjoyed the past twenty-four hours. I slept late and woke up naturally. After getting dressed, I entered the dining room and discovered a cold breakfast waiting for me, with hot coffee kept warm by its pot on the hearth. On the table was a card that read: \"I have to be absent for a while. Do not wait for me. — D.\" I helped myself to a satisfying meal. When I finished, I searched for a bell to notify the servants, but couldn't find one. It's strange to notice such peculiar absences in this house, given the signs of great wealth all around. The tableware is made of gold and exquisitely crafted, clearly very valuable. The curtains, chair and sofa upholstery, and the bed hangings are made of the finest and most splendid materials; they're centuries old but still remarkably well-preserved. I've seen similar pieces at Hampton Court, but there, they looked worn, frayed, and damaged by moths. Yet, despite all this luxury, there isn't a single mirror anywhere — not even a small one for my toilet table, so I had to use my shaving mirror from my bag to shave and groom myself. I still haven't seen any servants, nor heard any sounds in or near the castle except for the howling of wolves. Some time after eating — I can't really say if it was breakfast or dinner, as it was around five or six o'clock when I ate — I wanted to read something, but didn't feel comfortable exploring the castle without asking the Count. There was nothing to read in the room: no books, newspapers, or even writing materials. So I opened another door from the room and found a sort of library. I tried the door opposite mine too, but it was locked."

A table in the centre was littered with English magazines and newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date. The books were of the most varied kind—history, geography, politics, political economy, botany, geology, law—all relating to England and English life and customs and manners. There were even such books of reference as the London Directory, the “Red” and “Blue” books, Whitaker’s Almanac, the Army and Navy Lists, and—it somehow gladdened my heart to see it—the Law List.\nWhilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count entered. He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good night’s rest. Then he went on:—\n“I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is much that will interest you. These companions”—and he laid his hand on some of the books—“have been good friends to me, and for some years past, ever since I had the idea of going to London, have given me many, many hours of pleasure. Through them I have come to know your great England; and to know her is to love her. I long to go through the crowded streets of your mighty London, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of humanity, to share its life, its change, its death, and all that makes it what it is. But alas! as yet I only know your tongue through books. To you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak.”\n“But, Count,” I said, “you know and speak English thoroughly!” He bowed gravely.\n“I thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet I fear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel. True, I know the grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak them.”\n“Indeed,” I said, “you speak excellently.”\n“Not so,” he answered. “Well, I know that, did I move and speak in your London, none there are who would not know me for a stranger. That is not enough for me. Here I am noble; I am boyar; the common people know me, and I am master. But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; men know him not—and to know not is to care not for. I am content if I am like the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in his speaking if he hear my words, ‘Ha, ha! a stranger!’ I have been so long master that I would be master still—or at least that none other should be master of me. You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter Hawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in London. You shall, I trust, rest here with me awhile, so that by our talking I may learn the English intonation; and I would that you tell me when I make error, even of the smallest, in my speaking. I am sorry that I had to be away so long to-day; but you will, I know, forgive one who has so many important affairs in hand.”\nOf course I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I might come into that room when I chose. He answered: “Yes, certainly,” and added:—\n“You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are locked, where of course you will not wish to go. There is reason that all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand.” I said I was sure of this, and then he went on:—\n“We are in Transylvania; and Transylvania is not England. Our ways are not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things. Nay, from what you have told me of your experiences already, you know something of what strange things there may be.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "To my great pleasure, I discovered a large collection of English books in the library, filling entire shelves, along with bound issues of various magazines and newspapers. A central table was covered with English periodicals, though none were very recent. The books covered a wide array of subjects – history, geography, politics, economics, botany, geology, law – all focused on England, its life, customs, and ways. There were even reference materials like the London Directory, the 'Red' and 'Blue' books, Whitaker's Almanac, the Army and Navy Lists, and, to my particular satisfaction, the Law List.\nWhile I was examining the books, the Count entered through the opened door. He greeted me warmly and expressed hope that I had slept well. He then continued:\n“I'm pleased you found your way in here; I'm certain you'll find much to interest you. These companions,” he said, placing his hand on some books, “have been wonderful friends to me and have provided many hours of enjoyment over the past few years, ever since I decided to go to London. Through them, I've come to know your remarkable England, and knowing it has led me to love it. I yearn to walk through the busy streets of your powerful London, to experience the energy and activity of its people, to be a part of their lives, their changes, their mortality, and everything that defines it. But sadly, for now, I only know your language from reading. It is to you, my friend, that I look to learn how to speak it.”\n“But, Count,” I replied, “you already know and speak English perfectly!” He bowed respectfully.\n“Thank you, my friend, for your overly generous assessment, but I fear I have only just begun the journey I wish to take. It is true that I know the grammar and vocabulary, but I do not yet know how to use them in speech.”\n“Really,” I said, “you speak wonderfully.”\n“Not so,” he responded. “I am well aware that if I were to live and converse in your London, everyone would immediately recognize me as a foreigner. That is not sufficient for me. Here, I am noble; I am a boyar; the common folk recognize me, and I am in charge. But a stranger in an unfamiliar place is nobody; people don't know him, and if they don't know him, they don't care about him. I will be content only when I am like everyone else, so that no one stops if they see me or pauses in their conversation if they hear me speak, saying, 'Aha! A stranger!' I have been a master for so long that I wish to remain a master, or at least ensure that no one else becomes master over me. You have come to me not only as the representative of my friend Peter Hawkins, of Exeter, to inform me about my new property in London. I hope you will stay here with me for a while, so that through our discussions, I can learn English intonation; and I would like you to point out any errors, no matter how small, that I make when speaking. I regret having to be away for so long today, but I know you will forgive someone who has so many important matters to attend to.”\nNaturally, I assured him of my willingness to help in any way I could and asked if I was welcome to use that room whenever I wished. He replied, “Yes, certainly,” and added:\n“You may explore anywhere you please within the castle, except for the areas with locked doors; obviously, you will not wish to enter those places. There is a reason for everything being as it is, and if you could see with my eyes and understand with my knowledge, you might grasp it better.” I said I was sure that was the case, and he continued:\n“We are in Transylvania, and Transylvania is not England. Our ways are different from yours, and you will encounter many unusual things. In fact, based on the experiences you've already shared with me, you already have some idea of the strange things that might be found here.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "While exploring the library, I was thrilled to discover an extensive collection of English books filling the shelves, along with bound editions of old magazines and newspapers.

The variety of subjects was impressive—covering history, geography, politics, economics, botany, geology, and law—all focused on England and its way of life. There were even reference books like the London Directory, the 'Red' and 'Blue' books, Whitaker’s Almanac, the Army and Navy Lists, and the Law List, which particularly pleased me.\n\nAs I examined the collection, the Count entered, greeted me warmly, and asked if I’d slept well. He expressed his pleasure that I’d found the library, certain it would interest me. Placing his hand on a selection of books, he explained that these works had been valuable companions, especially since he first decided to travel to London, providing him with countless hours of enjoyment. Through them, he had learned much about England, coming to cherish it and desiring to experience London’s bustling streets and vibrant life firsthand. However, he noted that for now, he only knew English from books, looking to me as a guide to improve his spoken language.\n\nI remarked that his English was already excellent, to which he responded modestly, saying although he understood the language’s rules and vocabulary, speaking fluently was different. He believed that speaking and moving among Londoners would still mark him as a foreigner, which he found unsatisfactory. Here, he was noble and respected, but in England, a stranger is unknown and unnoticed. He wished to blend in so thoroughly that he would draw no attention, retaining his sense of mastery. He explained that my visit was not only in a professional capacity, but also so that I might help him refine his English during my stay by correcting his mistakes, even the smallest ones. He apologized for having been away for much of the day but hoped for my understanding due to his many responsibilities.\n\nNaturally, I assured him of my willingness to help and asked if I might visit the library freely. He agreed and further stated I could go wherever I wished in the castle, except where doors were locked, for reasons he implied would become clear if I saw things from his perspective. He reminded me that we were in Transylvania, not England, and that their customs would seem strange—some of which I had already witnessed."

Sometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by pretending not to understand; but generally he answered all I asked most frankly. Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I asked him of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for instance, why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue flames. He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a certain night of the year—last night, in fact, when all evil spirits are supposed to have unchecked sway—a blue flame is seen over any place where treasure has been concealed. “That treasure has been hidden,” he went on, “in the region through which you came last night, there can be but little doubt; for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the Wallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk. Why, there is hardly a foot of soil in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men, patriots or invaders. In old days there were stirring times, when the Austrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out to meet them—men and women, the aged and the children too—and waited their coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep destruction on them with their artificial avalanches. When the invader was triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had been sheltered in the friendly soil.”\n“But how,” said I, “can it have remained so long undiscovered, when there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?” The Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long, sharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; he answered:—\n“Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool! Those flames only appear on one night; and on that night no man of this land will, if he can help it, stir without his doors. And, dear sir, even if he did he would not know what to do. Why, even the peasant that you tell me of who marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight even for his own work. Even you would not, I dare be sworn, be able to find these places again?”\n“There you are right,” I said. “I know no more than the dead where even to look for them.” Then we drifted into other matters.\n“Come,” he said at last, “tell me of London and of the house which you have procured for me.” With an apology for my remissness, I went into my own room to get the papers from my bag. Whilst I was placing them in order I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as I passed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp lit, for it was by this time deep into the dark. The lamps were also lit in the study or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa, reading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaw’s Guide. When I came in he cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him I went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts. He was interested in everything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its surroundings. He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the subject of the neighbourhood, for he evidently at the end knew very much more than I did. When I remarked this, he answered:—\n“Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should? When I go there I shall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan—nay, pardon me, I fall into my country’s habit of putting your patronymic first—my friend Jonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me. He will be in Exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the law with my other friend, Peter Hawkins. So!”\nWe went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at Purfleet. When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the necessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to Mr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a place. I read to him the notes which I had made at the time, and which I inscribe here:—\n“At Purfleet, on a by-road, I came across just such a place as seemed to be required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place was for sale. It is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure, built of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large number of years. The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with rust.\n“The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old Quatre Face, as the house is four-sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of the compass. It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by the solid stone wall above mentioned. There are many trees on it, which make it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond or small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and flows away in a fair-sized stream. The house is very large and of all periods back, I should say, to mediæval times, for one part is of stone immensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with iron. It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or church. I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the door leading to it from the house, but I have taken with my kodak views of it from various points. The house has been added to, but in a very straggling way, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must be very great. There are but few houses close at hand, one being a very large house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic asylum. It is not, however, visible from the grounds.”\nWhen I had finished, he said:—\n“I am glad that it is old and big. I myself am of an old family, and to live in a new house would kill me. A house cannot be made habitable in a day; and, after all, how few days go to make up a century. I rejoice also that there is a chapel of old times. We Transylvanian nobles love not to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead. I seek not gaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and sparkling waters which please the young and gay. I am no longer young; and my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not attuned to mirth. Moreover, the walls of my castle are broken; the shadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the broken battlements and casements. I love the shade and the shadow, and would be alone with my thoughts when I may.” Somehow his words and his look did not seem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face made his smile look malignant and saturnine.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "This led to extensive conversation, and since it was clear he was eager to talk, I posed numerous questions about my recent experiences and observations. At times, he would avoid the topic or change it by feigning misunderstanding, but generally, he responded quite openly to my inquiries. As time passed and I grew more confident, I asked him about some odd occurrences from the previous night, such as why the driver had visited locations where blue flames appeared. He explained that it's widely believed that on a specific night of the year—which was last night, when all evil spirits are thought to roam freely—a blue flame indicates the location of hidden treasure. \"That treasure was buried,\" he continued, \"in the area you traveled through last night; there's little doubt about it. This land has been contested for centuries by the Wallachians, Saxons, and Turks. In fact, there's scarcely a patch of ground here that hasn't been enriched by the blood of patriots and invaders alike. Those were tumultuous times in the past, with Austrian and Hungarian forces arriving in large numbers, and local patriots—men, women, the elderly, and children—meeting them. They would wait on the cliffs above the mountain passes to unleash artificial avalanches upon them, causing devastation. When invaders were victorious, they found little wealth because everything valuable had been hidden safely within the earth.\" \"But how,\" I asked, \"could it remain hidden for so long when there's a clear sign if people would just bothered to look?\" The Count smiled, and as his lips drew back from his gums, his long, sharp canine teeth were eerily visible. He replied, \"Because your common folk are essentially cowardly and foolish! Those flames appear on only one night, and on that particular night, no man from this region will leave his home if he can help it. And, my dear sir, even if he did venture out, he wouldn't know what to do. Why, even the peasant you mentioned who marked the flame's spot wouldn't be able to locate it again in daylight, not even for his own work. I'm willing to bet even you couldn't find these places again, could you?\" \"You're absolutely right,\" I admitted. \"I have no idea where to even begin looking for them.\" We then moved on to discuss other subjects. \"Come,\" he said finally, \"tell me about London and the house you have secured for me.\" Apologizing for my delay, I went to my room to retrieve the documents from my bag. While I organized them, I heard the sound of china and silver being cleared in the adjacent room, and as I passed through, I saw the table had been cleared and the lamp lit, as it was now quite late. Lamps were also lit in the study or library, where I found the Count reclining on the sofa, reading, of all things, an English Bradshaw's Guidebook. When I entered, he cleared the table of books and papers, and we reviewed plans, deeds, and various figures related to the property. He was keenly interested in everything and asked countless questions about the place and its surroundings. It was evident he had thoroughly researched the area beforehand, as he clearly knew much more than I did by the end. When I pointed this out, he responded, \"Well, my friend, isn't it necessary? When I arrive there, I will be completely alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan—ah, forgive me, I'm falling into my country's custom of placing the family name first—my friend Jonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and assist me. He will be far away in Exeter, likely occupied with legal matters with my other friend, Peter Hawkins. So it is!\" We delved deeply into the details of purchasing the estate in Purfleet. After explaining the facts, securing his signature on the required documents, and preparing a letter to mail to Mr. Hawkins, he inquired how I had found such a suitable location. I read him the notes I had made at the time, which I record here: \"In Purfleet, on a side road, I discovered a place that seemed exactly right. There was a worn sign indicating it was for sale. It's surrounded by a tall, ancient stone wall, built with heavy stones, which hasn't been repaired in many years. The closed gates are made of heavy old oak and iron, completely covered in rust. \"The estate is called Carfax, undoubtedly a corruption of the old French 'Quatre Face' (Four Face), fitting since the house is four-sided, aligned with the cardinal compass points. It covers about twenty acres in total, entirely enclosed by the aforementioned solid stone wall. There are many trees on the grounds, making certain areas quite gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond or small lake. It appears to be fed by springs, as the water is clear and a decent-sized stream flows away from it. The house itself is very large and seems to have been built over various periods, reaching back to medieval times, I'd say. One section is made of immensely thick stone, with only a few high windows heavily barred with iron. It resembles a part of a keep and is adjacent to an old chapel or church. I couldn't enter it because I didn't have the key to the door leading from the house, but I took pictures of it from different angles with my camera. The house has been added to in a very disjointed manner, and I can only estimate the vast area it covers. There are few houses close by; one is a very large residence recently expanded and converted into a private psychiatric hospital. However, it is not visible from the estate grounds.\" When I finished, he said, \"I am pleased that it is old and large. My own family is ancient, and living in a new house would feel stifling. A house cannot become habitable overnight; and, after all, how few days are there in a century? I am also happy that there is an old chapel. We Transylvanian nobles do not care for the thought of our remains resting among the common dead. I do not seek pleasure or joy, nor the bright, excessive sunshine and sparkling waters that delight the young and cheerful. I am no longer young, and my heart, worn down by years of grief, is not inclined towards merriment. Furthermore, the walls of my castle are crumbling; shadows are abundant, and the wind blows cold through the broken battlements and windows. I love the shade and the darkness, and wish to be alone with my thoughts when possible.\" His words and his expression somehow didn't seem to match, or perhaps it was his facial structure that made his smile appear malicious and grim.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "This initiated a lengthy discussion; since it was clear he was eager for conversation, even if only to talk for its own sake, I questioned him about events I had already experienced. Occasionally, he would evade my questions or shift the topic by feigning ignorance, but for the most part, he answered frankly. As I became more comfortable, I inquired about the unusual occurrences of the previous night, such as why the coachman visited spots where blue flames appeared. He explained that it is locally believed that on a particular night—last night, specifically, when evil spirits are said to have free reign—a blue flame appears over spots where treasure is buried. He claimed there is little doubt treasure is hidden in the area we traveled through, since it has been a battleground for centuries among the Wallachians, Saxons, and Turks, with nearly every inch soaked in blood. In times past, Austrian and Hungarian armies would invade, and the locals, including women and children, would defend the mountain passes, launching avalanches on the enemy. Victorious invaders found little because the locals had already hidden their possessions underground.\n\nI asked how treasures could have remained hidden for so long, given that the blue flames point them out, if only someone would look. The Count grinned, his sharp canine teeth showing, and replied that the peasants are superstitious and cowardly; the flames appear only one night a year, and on that night, no one dares go outside. Even those who spot the flames wouldn’t be able to find the location in daylight, not even for their own handiwork. He doubted I could find them again, which I admitted was true, and the subject changed.\n\nHe soon asked me to describe London and the house I had acquired for him. Apologizing for forgetting, I went to get the necessary documents. While doing so, I noticed he had tidied the dining area and lit the lamps since it was now dark. In the study, I found him reclining and reading an English railway timetable. Upon my return, he cleared the table, and together we went through property plans and documents. He was extremely interested and asked countless questions about the estate and its surroundings. It was obvious he'd already learned a great deal about the area, perhaps more than myself. When I remarked on this, he replied it was necessary since he would be alone there—myself, Jonathan Harker, would be far away in Exeter with Mr. Hawkins.\n\nWe thoroughly discussed the purchase of the Purfleet estate. Once the necessary paperwork was completed and a letter prepared for Mr. Hawkins, he asked how I found such a suitable property. I read him my notes:\n\n'At Purfleet, off a quiet road, I found a place exactly matching the requirements, marked by a neglected 'for sale' sign. It's encircled by an ancient, high stone wall and weathered oak and iron gates. The estate, called Carfax (likely from \"Quatre Face\" due to its four-sided design matching the compass points), covers about twenty acres and is full of trees, which give it a somber atmosphere. A deep pond, likely spring-fed, lies within, with clear water running off in a decent stream. The house is vast and appears to have medieval origins, as one wing is made of thick stone with only a few high, barred windows, resembling part of a fortress keep, adjacent to an old chapel. I couldn't enter the chapel, lacking the key, but took photographs from outside. The house has been extended at various times in a rambling fashion, and its full size is hard to gauge. There are few neighboring houses, one being a large, recently upgraded property converted into a private asylum, though it can't be seen from Carfax.'\n\nAfter hearing this, the Count expressed his satisfaction that the house was both old and large, claiming that as someone from an ancient lineage, a new house would be intolerable. He said it takes time to make a house truly livable and reflected that a century is short in the scheme of things. He was also pleased about the old chapel, saying that Transylvanian nobles prefer their remains do not mix with commoners. He sought solitude and shadow, not the gaiety and light that young people enjoy, explaining that he had grown weary and mournful over the years, and his own broken castle was filled with darkness and cold. He expressed a preference for solitude and contemplation. Yet, something about his words and demeanor seemed at odds, as if his smile was somehow menacing and grim."

One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally at England, as if that map had been much used. On looking at it I found in certain places little rings marked, and on examining these I noticed that one was near London on the east side, manifestly where his new estate was situated; the other two were Exeter, and Whitby on the Yorkshire coast.\nIt was the better part of an hour when the Count returned. “Aha!” he said; “still at your books? Good! But you must not work always. Come; I am informed that your supper is ready.” He took my arm, and we went into the next room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the table. The Count again excused himself, as he had dined out on his being away from home. But he sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate. After supper I smoked, as on the last evening, and the Count stayed with me, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hour after hour. I felt that it was getting very late indeed, but I did not say anything, for I felt under obligation to meet my host’s wishes in every way. I was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified me; but I could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at the coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide. They say that people who are near death die generally at the change to the dawn or at the turn of the tide; any one who has when tired, and tied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere can well believe it. All at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air; Count Dracula, jumping to his feet, said:—\n“Why, there is the morning again! How remiss I am to let you stay up so long. You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of England less interesting, so that I may not forget how time flies by us,” and, with a courtly bow, he quickly left me.\nI went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to notice; my window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the warm grey of quickening sky. So I pulled the curtains again, and have written of this day.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "He excused himself and left me for a short while, requesting that I organize all my documents. He was gone for some time, during which I began browsing the books nearby. I came across an atlas, which happened to be open specifically to the map of England, as if that particular page had been frequently consulted. Upon looking closely, I noticed small circular markings in certain locations. Examining these, I saw one was situated near London on the eastern side, clearly indicating the location of his new property. The other two were in Exeter and Whitby on the Yorkshire coast. It was close to an hour before the Count returned. \"Ah!\" he exclaimed, \"Still occupied with your books? Excellent! But you shouldn't constantly work. Come, I understand your supper is prepared.\" He took my arm, and we moved to the adjoining room, where I found a splendid supper laid out on the table. The Count again offered an apology, explaining he had already dined while he was out. Nevertheless, he sat with me as he had the previous evening, conversing while I ate. After supper, I smoked, just as on the night before, and the Count remained with me, talking and asking questions about every imaginable topic, hour after hour. I felt it was growing exceedingly late, but I said nothing, feeling duty-bound to satisfy my host's wishes in every way. I wasn't sleepy, as the long rest the day before had refreshed me; however, I couldn't avoid feeling the cold sensation that comes upon one with the approach of dawn, which is comparable, in its own way, to the turning of the tide. It is said that people nearing death often pass away at the change to dawn or at the shift of the tide; anyone who has experienced this atmospheric change when tired and constrained to their position can readily believe this. Suddenly, we heard the crow of a cock rising with unnatural clarity and shrillness through the crisp morning air. Count Dracula, leaping to his feet, declared: \"Why, it is morning again! How negligent I am to allow you to stay up so late. You must make your conversation about my beloved new country, England, less captivating, so I don't lose track of how quickly time passes us by,\" and with a courteous bow, he swiftly left me. I returned to my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little remarkable to observe; my window overlooked the courtyard, and all I could see was the soft grey hue of the awakening sky. Consequently, I pulled the curtains shut again and have recorded the events of this day.",

Still, he stayed with me as before, chatting as I ate. Afterwards, I smoked, as I had the night before, while he continued his lively conversation, asking questions on every topic for hours. Although it was getting very late, I said nothing, feeling it polite to accommodate my host's wishes.

Count Dracula leaped up, exclaiming, “The morning again! How careless of me to let you stay up so late. You must make your talk about England less interesting, or I shall lose track of time!” With a graceful bow, he left me quickly.

If there were any one to talk to I could bear it, but there is no one. I have only the Count to speak with, and he!—I fear I am myself the only living soul within the place. Let me be prosaic so far as facts can be; it will help me to bear up, and imagination must not run riot with me. If it does I am lost. Let me say at once how I stand—or seem to.\nI only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could not sleep any more, got up. I had hung my shaving glass by the window, and was just beginning to shave. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder, and heard the Count’s voice saying to me, “Good-morning.” I started, for it amazed me that I had not seen him, since the reflection of the glass covered the whole room behind me. In starting I had cut myself slightly, but did not notice it at the moment. Having answered the Count’s salutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken. This time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and I could see him over my shoulder. But there was no reflection of him in the mirror! The whole room behind me was displayed; but there was no sign of a man in it, except myself. This was startling, and, coming on the top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague feeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near; but at the instant I saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood was trickling over my chin. I laid down the razor, turning as I did so half round to look for some sticking plaster. When the Count saw my face, his eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at my throat. I drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads which held the crucifix. It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there.\n“Take care,” he said, “take care how you cut yourself. It is more dangerous than you think in this country.” Then seizing the shaving glass, he went on: “And this is the wretched thing that has done the mischief. It is a foul bauble of man’s vanity. Away with it!” and opening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung out the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones of the courtyard far below. Then he withdrew without a word. It is very annoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case or the bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal.\nWhen I went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but I could not find the Count anywhere. So I breakfasted alone. It is strange that as yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink. He must be a very peculiar man! After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle. I went out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South. The view was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every opportunity of seeing it. The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice. A stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without touching anything! As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree tops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm. Here and there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through the forests.\nBut I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view I explored further; doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and bolted. In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there an available exit.\nThe castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner!",

I wish I were already gone, or that I had never arrived. Perhaps this unnatural nocturnal existence is affecting my mind, but I hope that's the only explanation. If only I had someone to talk to, I could endure this, but there is no one. My only contact is the Count, and encountering him... I fear I am the only living person in this entire place. I must try to stick to simple facts; it's the only way I can cope, and I absolutely cannot let my imagination get out of control, or I will be lost. Let me clearly state my current situation, or how it appears to me.\n\nI only slept for a few hours before waking up and feeling unable to rest any longer, so I got out of bed. I had hung my mirror for shaving by the window and was just beginning. Suddenly, I felt a hand on my shoulder and heard the Count's voice say, \"Good morning.\" I jumped, astonished that I hadn't seen him approach, especially since the mirror's reflection showed the entire room behind me. My surprise caused me to nick myself slightly, though I didn't notice it immediately. After responding to the Count, I looked back at the mirror, trying to figure out how I had missed him. This time, there was no room for mistake; the man was right next to me, visible over my shoulder. Yet, there was no reflection of him in the mirror! The view behind me was completely clear, showing the room empty except for myself. This was shocking, and coming after so many peculiar occurrences, it intensified the vague discomfort I always feel when the Count is near. At that moment, I noticed the small cut had bled a little, and blood was running down my chin. I put down my razor and turned slightly to find some adhesive plaster. When the Count saw my face, his eyes flared with a sort of demonic rage, and he suddenly lunged at my throat. I pulled back quickly, and his hand brushed against the string holding my crucifix beads. This caused an immediate transformation; his fury vanished so rapidly that I could barely believe it had been there at all.\n\n\"Be careful,\" he cautioned, \"be careful how you cut yourself. In this country, it's more perilous than you imagine.\" Then, snatching the shaving mirror, he continued, \"And this is the miserable object that caused the harm. It's a worthless trinket of human vanity. Get rid of it!\" With a single powerful pull of his terrible hand, he wrenched open the heavy window and threw the mirror out. It shattered into countless pieces on the stone courtyard far below. He then left without another word. This is incredibly frustrating, as I have no idea how I will shave now, unless I use my watch case or the bottom of the fortunately metal shaving pot.\n\nWhen I entered the dining room, breakfast was ready, but I couldn't find the Count anywhere. So, I ate alone. It is odd that I have never seen the Count eat or drink anything. He truly must be an unusual individual! After finishing breakfast, I spent some time exploring the castle. I went out onto the stairs and discovered a room facing south. The view was breathtaking, and from that spot, I had a perfect vantage point to appreciate it. The castle is situated right on the edge of a fearsome cliff. A stone dropped from the window would fall a thousand feet straight down without hitting anything! As far as the eye can see, there is a vast expanse of green treetops, broken occasionally by deep crevices marking chasms. Here and there, silvery lines indicate rivers winding through deep gorges within the forests.\n\nHowever, my state of mind isn't conducive to describing beauty, because after admiring the view, I continued exploring and found doors, doors, doors everywhere, and every single one was locked and bolted. There is absolutely no accessible exit from this place, except through the windows in the castle walls. The castle is nothing less than a prison, and I am trapped!",

I wish I’d never come here, or could safely leave. Perhaps this unusual nocturnal lifestyle is starting to affect me, but I wish that was the only issue! If I had anyone to talk to besides the Count, I could cope better, but he’s the only one here—and I fear I am the only living person within these walls. I need to stick to the facts, as it helps keep my imagination in check. If I let myself indulge in fanciful thoughts, things would only get worse. Here’s how things stand: I only managed to sleep for a few hours before getting up, deciding I couldn’t rest any longer. I hung my shaving mirror by the window and began shaving, when I suddenly felt a hand on my shoulder and heard the Count wish me good morning. I was shocked, as I should've seen his reflection in the mirror which covered the whole room behind me, yet I hadn't. In my surprise, I cut myself shaving but didn’t realize immediately. After returning the greeting, I looked at the mirror again, certain now the Count was behind me, but still his reflection was nowhere to be seen—only mine. This discovery alarmed me, especially on top of all the other strange events that have happened. Noticing blood trickle from my cut, I turned away to find a plaster. As soon as the Count saw my bleeding face, his eyes flashed with a wild, almost demonic fury as he lunged for my throat. I dodged, and his hand struck the crucifix beads around my neck, instantly changing his demeanor. He abruptly told me to be careful shaving, warning that cuts are more dangerous here than I realize. He then snatched up my shaving mirror, called it a vain and worthless trinket responsible for the trouble, and flung it out the window, smashing it far below. Without another word, he left. I am now frustrated, as I must try to shave using only my watch-case or the metal shaving-pot. Later, I found breakfast ready in the dining room, but the Count was nowhere to be seen. I noticed I’ve never actually seen him eat or drink—he's certainly an unusual man. Afterwards, I explored the castle. From a southern-facing room, I admired the spectacular view: the castle sits atop a sheer cliff, and a stone dropped out the window would fall for a thousand feet straight down. All around stretch endless green treetops and winding rivers in deep gorges. Nonetheless, I can’t bring myself to linger on the beauty, because when I tried exploring further, I found door after door, all locked and bolted. Apart from the windows, there's no way out from within the castle walls. Truly, this castle is a prison—and I am its prisoner!"

He knows perfectly well that I am imprisoned; and since he himself did this, likely for his own reasons, he would only mislead me if I confided everything to him. As far as I can see, my only option is to keep my knowledge and my worries to myself and remain vigilant. I realize that I am either being deceived, like a naive child, by my own fears, or I am genuinely in severe peril; and if the latter is true, I will need, and currently need, all my mental acuity to get through this.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "When I realized I was being held captive, I was overcome by a wild sense of panic. I hurried through the house, running up and down the stairs, checking every door, and looking out every window I could find. Eventually, however, the overwhelming awareness of my powerlessness suppressed every other emotion. Reflecting on it a few hours later, I believe I must have temporarily lost my senses, behaving much like a trapped rat. But once it truly sank in that I could do nothing to change my situation, I sat down as calmly as I’ve ever been and began considering my next steps. I’m still thinking about what to do and haven’t yet decided on a course of action. One thing is perfectly clear: there is no point in confiding in Count Dracula. He surely knows I am a prisoner—as he is the one who confined me—and he certainly has his reasons for doing so. If I trusted him with the truth, he would only mislead me. Therefore, the only option I see is to keep my observations and worries to myself and remain vigilant. I realize I am either overreacting, letting my fears delude me, or I am genuinely in grave danger; if it’s the latter, I will need all my intelligence and resourcefulness to survive."

This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along thought—that there were no servants in the house. When later I saw him through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the dining-room, I was assured of it; for if he does himself all these menial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them. This gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, it must have been the Count himself who was the driver of the coach that brought me here. This is a terrible thought; for if so, what does it mean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his hand in silence.

Bless that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! for it is a comfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it. It is odd that a thing which I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help. Is it that there is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium, a tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort?

This struck me as odd, but it simply reinforced my earlier suspicion that there were no staff in the house. Later, glimpsing him through the slight opening of the dining room door hinges as he set the table, I became absolutely certain. If he's performing these menial chores himself, it undeniably proves that there's no one else available to do them. This realization was frightening because if he is the only other person in the castle, he must have been the one who drove the coach that brought me here. This thought is terrifying, for if it's true, what does it signify that he could command the wolves, as he did, merely by raising his hand in silence? Why did everyone in Bistritz and on the coach show such profound fear for me? What was the meaning behind them giving me the crucifix, the garlic, the wild rose, and the mountain ash? Bless that kind, good woman who placed the crucifix around my neck! It brings me comfort and strength whenever I touch it. It's strange that something I was taught to view negatively and as a form of idol worship should offer help in a moment of loneliness and distress. Could its power reside in the object's intrinsic nature, or is it merely a vehicle, a tangible connection, for conveying memories of empathy and reassurance? Perhaps someday, if possible, I must look into this matter and decide my stance. For now, my priority is to discover everything I can about Count Dracula, as it might help me comprehend my situation.

In his speaking of things and people, and especially of battles, he spoke as if he had been present at them all. This he afterwards explained by saying that to a boyar the pride of his house and name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their fate is his fate. Whenever he spoke of his house he always said “we,” and spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking. I wish I could put down all he said exactly as he said it, for to me it was most fascinating. It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country. He grew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling his great white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as though he would crush it by main strength. One thing he said which I shall put down as nearly as I can; for it tells in its way the story of his race:—\n“We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood of many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship. Here, in the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down from Iceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them, which their Berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe, ay, and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that the were-wolves themselves had come. Here, too, when they came, they found the Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame, till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those old witches, who, expelled from Scythia had mated with the devils in the desert. Fools, fools! What devil or what witch was ever so great as Attila, whose blood is in these veins?” He held up his arms. “Is it a wonder that we were a conquering race; that we were proud; that when the Magyar, the Lombard, the Avar, the Bulgar, or the Turk poured his thousands on our frontiers, we drove them back? Is it strange that when Arpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland he found us here when he reached the frontier; that the Honfoglalas was completed there? And when the Hungarian flood swept eastward, the Szekelys were claimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to us for centuries was trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkey-land; ay, and more than that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as the Turks say, ‘water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.’ Who more gladly than we throughout the Four Nations received the ‘bloody sword,’ or at its warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the King? When was redeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the flags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent? Who was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat the Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed! Woe was it that his own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to the Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them! Was it not this Dracula, indeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and again brought his forces over the great river into Turkey-land; who, when he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph! They said that he thought only of himself. Bah! what good are peasants without a leader? Where ends the war without a brain and heart to conduct it? Again, when, after the battle of Mohács, we threw off the Hungarian yoke, we of the Dracula blood were amongst their leaders, for our spirit would not brook that we were not free. Ah, young sir, the Szekelys—and the Dracula as their heart’s blood, their brains, and their swords—can boast a record that mushroom growths like the Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach. The warlike days are over. Blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace; and the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told.”\nIt was by this time close on morning, and we went to bed. (Mem., this diary seems horribly like the beginning of the “Arabian Nights,” for everything has to break off at cockcrow—or like the ghost of Hamlet’s father.)",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Around midnight, I had a lengthy discussion with the Count. When I inquired about Transylvanian history, he became remarkably animated. Speaking of events, individuals, and particularly conflicts, he sounded as if he had witnessed them firsthand. He later clarified this, explaining that for a nobleman, his family's legacy and reputation are inextricably linked to his own pride, their triumphs his triumphs, and their destiny his destiny. He consistently used \"we\" and spoke in the plural when referring to his lineage, much like royalty. I wish I could record his words precisely as he uttered them, as I found them utterly captivating – they seemed to encompass the entire history of the region. As he spoke, he grew visibly agitated, pacing the room, tugging at his large white mustache, and gripping objects as though intent on crushing them. One specific point he made, which I will transcribe as accurately as possible, encapsulates the narrative of his ancestry:\n\n“We Szekelys have ample reason to be proud, for our ancestry includes many valiant peoples who fought for dominance with the ferocity of lions. In this melting pot of European nations, the Ugric tribe brought from Iceland the martial spirit given by Thor and Wodin, displayed with terrifying effect by their Berserkers across the coastlines of Europe, and even Asia and Africa, leading people to believe they were werewolves. Here, they encountered the Huns, whose warlike rage had swept the world like a wildfire, causing their victims to think their veins held the blood of ancient witches who had coupled with demons in the wilderness after being expelled from Scythia. How foolish! No demon or witch was ever as mighty as Attila, whose blood courses through these veins!” He raised his arms. “Is it any wonder we were conquerors, that we were proud, that we repelled the thousands of Magyars, Lombards, Avars, Bulgars, or Turks who assaulted our borders? Is it odd that when Arpad and his armies marched through Hungary, they found us already here upon reaching the frontier, that the *Honfoglalas* (Hungarian conquest) was completed there? And as the Hungarian tide moved eastward, the victorious Magyars recognized the Szekelys as kin, entrusting us for centuries with guarding the borderlands against Turkey; and more than just that, the perpetual duty of frontier watch, for as the Turks say, ‘water sleeps, but the enemy is sleepless.’ Who among the Four Nations welcomed the ‘bloody sword’ (a symbol of war) more enthusiastically or rallied quicker to the King’s standard upon its warlike call? When was the great disgrace of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the banners of Wallachia and Hungary fell to the Crescent, avenged? Who but one of my own blood, acting as Voivode, crossed the Danube and defeated the Turk on their own soil? This was truly a Dracula! What a tragedy that his own unworthy brother, after his fall, betrayed his people to the Turk, subjecting them to slavery! Was it not this Dracula, indeed, who inspired that other of his lineage who, in a later era, repeatedly led his forces across the great river into Turkish territory; who, even when driven back, returned again and again, even if alone from the bloody field where his soldiers were being slaughtered, because he knew only he could ultimately prevail! They claimed he only cared about himself. Nonsense! What good are common soldiers without a leader? How can a war succeed without a mind and heart to direct it? Furthermore, after the battle of Mohács, when we cast off the Hungarian dominion, we of the Dracula bloodline were among the leaders, for our spirit would not tolerate being anything but free. Ah, young man, the Szekelys—with the Draculas as their vital core, their intellect, and their strength—possess a history that recent upstarts like the Hapsburgs and Romanoffs can never match. The age of conflict is over. Blood is too precious now in these dishonorable times of peace; and the glories of the great races are merely stories told.”\n\nBy then, it was nearly morning, and we retired to bed. (Note to self: this diary feels awfully like the start of the \"Arabian Nights,\" where everything must stop at cockcrow—or like Hamlet’s father’s ghost.)",

He later explained that, for a nobleman, the achievements and honor of his ancestors are his own, their triumphs are his triumphs, and their misfortunes are his as well. He always referred to his family as \"we,\" speaking almost as a monarch would, using the plural form. I wish I had been able to record all his words exactly, as they were incredibly captivating, sounding like the entire history of the land. As he spoke, he became animated, pacing the room, tugging at his large white moustache, and gripping nearby objects as if he might crush them in his hands. One particular statement, which I will recount as closely as possible, seemed to summarize the pride of his lineage.\n\nHe said: \"The Szekelys have every reason to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood of many brave peoples who fought fiercely for dominance. Here, amid the turbulence of different European races, the Ugric tribe descended from Iceland, carrying the warrior spirit of Thor and Odin, shown by their Berserkers who struck fear across Europe, Asia, and Africa, until some believed they were werewolves. Later, they encountered the Huns here, whose ferocity had blazed across the world like a wildfire, so much so that dying peoples thought they carried the blood of ancient witches from Scythia who had consorted with devils in the desert. Fools! What devil or witch could match Attila, whose blood runs through these veins?\" He raised his arms for emphasis. \"Is it any wonder that we were conquerors and proud, that we repelled invasions from Magyars, Lombards, Avars, Bulgars, and Turks? Is it surprising that when Arpad and his army entered Hungary, they found us at the border and completed their conquest there? When the Hungarian forces moved east, the Magyars recognized us Szekelys as their kin and entrusted us for centuries with defending the frontier against Turkey, with the perpetual soldier's duty, for as the Turks say, 'water sleeps, but the enemy never does.' No one was quicker than us to take up arms at the King's call or to answer the call to battle. When, in the disgrace of Cassova, the Wallach and Magyar flags fell under the Ottoman crescent, who avenged that shame but a Voivode of my lineage, who crossed the Danube and defeated the Turks on their own soil? That was a true Dracula! It was his unworthy brother who, after his fall, betrayed his people to the Turks, leading them into slavery. Was it not that same Dracula who inspired a later ancestor to repeatedly invade Turkish lands, returning to the fight even when his forces were massacred, because only he could achieve victory in the end? Some claimed he was selfish. But what are peasants without a leader? Who wins a war without someone to guide it? Again, after the battle of Mohács, when we freed ourselves from Hungarian rule, the Draculas were among the leaders, for our spirit would not allow us not to be free. The Szekelys, with the Draculas as their lifeblood, brains, and swords, can boast a tradition that newer dynasties like the Hapsburgs and Romanovs cannot match. Those warlike times are over now. Blood is too valuable to shed in this dishonorable age of peace; the tales of mighty races are now just stories.\" \n\nBy then it was nearly morning and we went to bed.

          "text_segment": "12 May.—Let me begin with facts—bare, meagre facts, verified by books and figures, and of which there can be no doubt. I must not confuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own observation, or my memory of them. Last evening when the Count came from his room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the doing of certain kinds of business. I had spent the day wearily over books, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some of the matters I had been examining at Lincoln’s Inn. There was a certain method in the Count’s inquiries, so I shall try to put them down in sequence; the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me.\nFirst, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more. I told him he might have a dozen if he wished, but that it would not be wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as only one could act at a time, and that to change would be certain to militate against his interest. He seemed thoroughly to understand, and went on to ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to attend, say, to banking, and another to look after shipping, in case local help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking solicitor. I asked him to explain more fully, so that I might not by any chance mislead him, so he said:—\n“I shall illustrate. Your friend and mine, Mr. Peter Hawkins, from under the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at Exeter, which is far from London, buys for me through your good self my place at London. Good! Now here let me say frankly, lest you should think it strange that I have sought the services of one so far off from London instead of some one resident there, that my motive was that no local interest might be served save my wish only; and as one of London residence might, perhaps, have some purpose of himself or friend to serve, I went thus afield to seek my agent, whose labours should be only to my interest. Now, suppose I, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods, say, to Newcastle, or Durham, or Harwich, or Dover, might it not be that it could with more ease be done by consigning to one in these ports?” I answered that certainly it would be most easy, but that we solicitors had a system of agency one for the other, so that local work could be done locally on instruction from any solicitor, so that the client, simply placing himself in the hands of one man, could have his wishes carried out by him without further trouble.\n“But,” said he, “I could be at liberty to direct myself. Is it not so?”\n“Of course,” I replied; and “such is often done by men of business, who do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person.”\n“Good!” he said, and then went on to ask about the means of making consignments and the forms to be gone through, and of all sorts of difficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded against. I explained all these things to him to the best of my ability, and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a wonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not think of or foresee. For a man who was never in the country, and who did not evidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen were wonderful. When he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had spoken, and I had verified all as well as I could by the books available, he suddenly stood up and said:—\n“Have you written since your first letter to our friend Mr. Peter Hawkins, or to any other?” It was with some bitterness in my heart that I answered that I had not, that as yet I had not seen any opportunity of sending letters to anybody.\n“Then write now, my young friend,” he said, laying a heavy hand on my shoulder: “write to our friend and to any other; and say, if it will please you, that you shall stay with me until a month from now.”\n“Do you wish me to stay so long?” I asked, for my heart grew cold at the thought.\n“I desire it much; nay, I will take no refusal. When your master, employer, what you will, engaged that someone should come on his behalf, it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted. I have not stinted. Is it not so?”\nWhat could I do but bow acceptance? It was Mr. Hawkins’s interest, not mine, and I had to think of him, not myself; and besides, while Count Dracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing which made me remember that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it I could have no choice. The Count saw his victory in my bow, and his mastery in the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use them, but in his own smooth, resistless way:—\n“I pray you, my good young friend, that you will not discourse of things other than business in your letters. It will doubtless please your friends to know that you are well, and that you look forward to getting home to them. Is it not so?” As he spoke he handed me three sheets of note-paper and three envelopes. They were all of the thinnest foreign post, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet smile, with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip, I understood as well as if he had spoken that I should be careful what I wrote, for he would be able to read it. So I determined to write only formal notes now, but to write fully to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and also to Mina, for to her I could write in shorthand, which would puzzle the Count, if he did see it.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "On May 12th, I have resolved to record only undisputed facts, verified by reliable sources, keeping them separate from personal observations or recollections. Last night, Count Dracula emerged from his room and immediately began questioning me on English law and business procedures. Having spent the day studying, I occupied my mind by reviewing material from Lincoln's Inn. The Count's questions were clearly structured, so I plan to list them in order, hoping this information might prove useful later. He first inquired if an individual in England could employ multiple solicitors. I explained that while technically possible to have many, it's impractical and detrimental to use more than one for the same matter, as only one can handle a transaction at a time, and switching between them would harm one's interests. He seemed to grasp this completely. He then asked about the feasibility of using different solicitors for separate tasks, such as banking handled by one and shipping by another, especially if local assistance was required far from the banking solicitor's base. To ensure I didn't misinform him, I asked for clarification. He gave an example: \"Consider our mutual acquaintance, Mr. Peter Hawkins, from the area near your lovely cathedral in Exeter, which is distant from London. He is purchasing my London property through you. Allow me to explain why I chose an agent far from London instead of someone local. My sole aim was to avoid any local agendas influencing the transaction, as a London resident might have personal or friends' interests to consider. Thus, I sought an agent whose efforts would solely serve my interests. Now, imagine I, a person with many affairs, wish to ship goods to places like Newcastle, Durham, Harwich, or Dover. Wouldn't it be easier to address consignments to someone in those ports?\" I agreed that would indeed be simpler, but clarified that solicitors have an agency network allowing local work to be managed remotely by any solicitor on their client's behalf, enabling the client to rely on one main contact without extra effort. \"But,\" he countered, \"I could manage these matters myself, couldn't I?\" \"Certainly,\" I replied. \"Many businessmen choose to do so to prevent any single person from knowing all their affairs.\" \"Excellent,\" he said, and proceeded to ask about the processes for making consignments, the necessary paperwork, and potential problems that could be avoided with careful planning. I explained everything as best I could, and he struck me as someone who would make a remarkable solicitor. He anticipated every possible difficulty. His understanding and sharpness were astonishing for a man with apparently little business experience and no prior time in the country. After he seemed satisfied with the answers regarding these points, and I had confirmed details using available books, he suddenly stood up and asked, \"Have you written to our friend Mr. Peter Hawkins or anyone else since your initial letter?\" I answered with a touch of bitterness that I had not yet had an opportunity to send any letters. \"Then write now, my young friend,\" he said, placing a heavy hand on my shoulder. \"Write to our friend and anyone else, and feel free to say you will be staying with me for another month.\" My heart went cold at the prospect, and I asked, \"You wish me to stay that long?\" \"I wish it very much; in fact, I will not accept a refusal. When your principal, or whatever he is, arranged for someone to come on his behalf, it was understood that only my needs were to be considered. I have not been ungenerous. Is that not so?\" I had no choice but to nod in agreement. Mr. Hawkins's interests were at stake, not my own, and I felt I had to prioritize him. Furthermore, as Count Dracula spoke, his gaze and demeanor reminded me that I was a prisoner with no real option if he insisted. The Count recognized his success in my bow and my distress, and immediately capitalized on it in his smooth, persuasive manner: \"Please, my good young friend, confine the content of your letters to business matters. Your friends will no doubt be pleased to hear you are well and looking forward to returning home. Is that not right?\" As he spoke, he gave me three sheets of very thin foreign paper and three envelopes. Seeing the paper, looking at him, and noting his faint smile with the sharp canine teeth visible over his lower lip, I understood clearly, without him needing to say it, that I needed to be cautious about what I wrote because he would likely read it. Consequently, I resolved to write only brief, formal messages for now but planned to write fully and secretly to Mr. Hawkins and, especially, to Mina, as I could use shorthand for her letters, which would surely baffle the Count if he saw them.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "12 May.—I'll begin by stating plain, verified facts—checked through books and figures, leaving no room for doubt. I must not let these get mixed up with personal experiences, which rely on my own observation and memory. Last night, when the Count came out of his room, he started asking me about legal matters and certain business practices. I had spent the whole day tiredly studying, so to keep myself occupied, I reviewed some of what I was working on at Lincoln's Inn. The Count's questions were organized, so I shall try to recall them in order; this knowledge could be helpful to me later on.\n\nFirst, he wanted to know if someone in England could have several solicitors. I told him it was possible to have many, but it isn’t advisable to have more than one for a single transaction, since only one can act at a time, and changing solicitors could harm one’s interests. He seemed to grasp this, and then asked whether there would be any issue in having one person handle banking and another handle shipping, especially if help was needed far from the banking solicitor’s office. I asked him to clarify so as not to mislead him, and he explained:\n\nAs an example, he said that our mutual friend, Mr. Peter Hawkins, from Exeter—far from London—had arranged, through me, to buy his place in London. He explained that he had chosen to employ someone from so far away so that only his own interests would be served, rather than those of a local London agent with connections of their own. Now, if he wanted to ship goods to places like Newcastle, Durham, Harwich, or Dover, wouldn’t it be easier to appoint someone at each port? I agreed that it would be very easy, but told him that solicitors often work through networks—one can instruct another locally on behalf of the client, so the client gets things done by using just one main contact.\n\nHe asked if he was still free to give his own directions, and I told him, of course, many businessmen do so to keep their affairs private from any one person. Satisfied, he then pressed for more details about making consignments, the necessary paperwork, and possible difficulties, all of which I explained as best I could. He left me with the strong impression he would’ve made an excellent solicitor himself, having anticipated every detail. For someone not from this country, his business insight was remarkable. Once he was satisfied and I’d double-checked my answers, he stood suddenly and asked if I had sent any letters since my first to Mr. Peter Hawkins or anyone else. I answered, truthfully and a bit bitterly, that I hadn’t had the chance to send any letters to anyone yet.\n\n\"Then write now, my young friend,\" he said, firmly placing a hand on my shoulder. \"Write to our friend, and to anyone else; let them know you’ll be staying with me for another month, if you please.\"\n\nI asked if he really wanted me to stay that long, feeling apprehensive. He insisted, saying he would accept no refusal, reminding me that when my employer sent someone on his behalf, it was agreed that only the Count’s wishes mattered, and he had not held back. What could I do but agree? Mr. Hawkins’s interest, not mine, was at stake, and besides, Count Dracula’s demeanor reminded me I was effectively a prisoner, with no real choice. The Count recognized my reluctant acceptance and quickly took advantage in his smooth, overpowering way:\n\n\"Please, my good young friend, do not talk about anything besides business in your letters. It will make your friends happy to know you are well and looking forward to returning home, will it not?\" He handed me three sheets of thin foreign notepaper and matching envelopes. His smile—revealing his sharp teeth—made me realize he would likely read anything I wrote, so I resolved to keep my notes formal, but to write longer letters to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and to Mina in shorthand, knowing the Count would not understand it if he saw it."

After a little while, not hearing any sound, I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could look out towards the South. There was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse, inaccessible though it was to me, as compared with the narrow darkness of the courtyard. Looking out on this, I felt that I was indeed in prison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it were of the night. I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me. It is destroying my nerve. I start at my own shadow, and am full of all sorts of horrible imaginings. God knows that there is ground for my terrible fear in this accursed place! I looked out over the beautiful expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as day. In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness. The mere beauty seemed to cheer me; there was peace and comfort in every breath I drew. As I leaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storey below me, and somewhat to my left, where I imagined, from the order of the rooms, that the windows of the Count’s own room would look out. The window at which I stood was tall and deep, stone-mullioned, and though weatherworn, was still complete; but it was evidently many a day since the case had been there. I drew back behind the stonework, and looked carefully out.\nWhat I saw was the Count’s head coming out from the window. I did not see the face, but I knew the man by the neck and the movement of his back and arms. In any case I could not mistake the hands which I had had so many opportunities of studying. I was at first interested and somewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest and amuse a man when he is a prisoner. But my very feelings changed to repulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss, face down with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings. At first I could not believe my eyes. I thought it was some trick of the moonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but I kept looking, and it could be no delusion. I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable speed, just as a lizard moves along a wall.\nWhat manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in the semblance of man? I feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering me; I am in fear—in awful fear—and there is no escape for me; I am encompassed about with terrors that I dare not think of....",

I am confident I can sleep without fear anywhere he is not present. I've placed the crucifix above the headboard of my bed, and I believe it helps keep my rest free from dreams; it will stay there permanently. After he departed, I returned to my room. When silence fell, I left my room and ascended the stone stairs to gain a view towards the south. The vast, inaccessible expanse offered a sense of liberation compared to the confined, dark courtyard. Looking out, I truly felt like a prisoner, longing for a breath of fresh air, even the night air. This nocturnal existence is starting to wear on me, damaging my nerves. I startle easily, even at my own shadow, and am plagued by all sorts of terrifying thoughts. Given this cursed place, God knows my terrible fear is well-founded! I gazed upon the beautiful landscape, bathed in a soft yellow moonlight that made it nearly as bright as day. In this gentle light, the distant hills seemed to merge, and the shadows in the valleys and ravines were a velvety black. The sheer beauty itself seemed to lift my spirits; every breath I took brought peace and comfort. As I leaned out the window, my attention was drawn by something moving a floor below me and slightly to my left, which I deduced, based on the room layout, must be a window of the Count's private quarters. The window I was at was tall and deep, built of stone with mullions, and despite wear and tear, was still intact; however, the window frame clearly hadn't been there in a very long time. I pulled back behind the stone frame to watch carefully. What I saw was the Count's head emerging from the window. I couldn't see his face, but I recognized him by his neck and the way his back and arms moved. In any case, I couldn't mistake his hands, which I'd had ample opportunity to observe. Initially, I was curious and somewhat amused, as even the smallest thing can capture the interest and amusement of a man who is imprisoned. But my feelings instantly shifted to disgust and terror when I saw his entire body slowly emerge from the window and begin to creep down the castle wall over that terrifying drop, face down with his cloak spread around him like enormous wings. At first, I couldn't trust my eyes. I suspected it was some trick of the moonlight, a strange shadow effect; but I kept watching, and it was unmistakably real. I saw his fingers and toes gripping the corners of the stones, worn smooth over the years where mortar had eroded, using every ledge and unevenness to move downwards with considerable speed, much like a lizard on a wall. What kind of man is this, or rather, what kind of creature in human form? The dread of this horrible place is overwhelming me; I am filled with fear—terrible fear—and there is no way out for me; I am surrounded by terrors I dare not even contemplate....",

Compared to the confined, dark courtyard, the vast open space beyond—even though I couldn’t reach it—gave me a feeling of freedom. Staring out, I felt truly imprisoned, longing for a breath of fresh air, even if only from the night. This nocturnal life is taking its toll on me. My nerves are fraying; I startle at my own shadow and my mind is filled with disturbing thoughts. God knows there is good reason to be frightened in this cursed place! The beauty of the moonlit scenery before me, with hills softened by gentle light and deep, dark shadows in the valleys, brought me a brief sense of peace. The air seemed calming and reassuring.

I could clearly see his fingers and toes hooking onto the stonework and moving down swiftly, like a lizard on a wall.\n\nWhat kind of being is this, that only appears human?

          "text_segment": "15 May.—Once more have I seen the Count go out in his lizard fashion. He moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and a good deal to the left. He vanished into some hole or window. When his head had disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more, but without avail—the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight. I knew he had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to explore more than I had dared to do as yet. I went back to the room, and taking a lamp, tried all the doors. They were all locked, as I had expected, and the locks were comparatively new; but I went down the stone stairs to the hall where I had entered originally. I found I could pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains; but the door was locked, and the key was gone! That key must be in the Count’s room; I must watch should his door be unlocked, so that I may get it and escape. I went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs and passages, and to try the doors that opened from them. One or two small rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see in them except old furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten. At last, however, I found one door at the top of the stairway which, though it seemed to be locked, gave a little under pressure. I tried it harder, and found that it was not really locked, but that the resistance came from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door rested on the floor. Here was an opportunity which I might not have again, so I exerted myself, and with many efforts forced it back so that I could enter. I was now in a wing of the castle further to the right than the rooms I knew and a storey lower down. From the windows I could see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle, the windows of the end room looking out both west and south. On the latter side, as well as to the former, there was a great precipice. The castle was built on the corner of a great rock, so that on three sides it was quite impregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, or bow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort, impossible to a position which had to be guarded, were secured. To the west was a great valley, and then, rising far away, great jagged mountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with mountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and crannies of the stone. This was evidently the portion of the castle occupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had more air of comfort than any I had seen. The windows were curtainless, and the yellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to see even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth. My lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but I was glad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the place which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble. Still, it was better than living alone in the rooms which I had come to hate from the presence of the Count, and after trying a little to school my nerves, I found a soft quietude come over me. Here I am, sitting at a little oak table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much thought and many blushes, her ill-spelt love-letter, and writing in my diary in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last. It is nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, unless my senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own which mere “modernity” cannot kill.",

He moved sideways and downwards for about a hundred feet and considerably to the left, disappearing into some opening or window. After his head was out of sight, I leaned out to try and see more, but the great distance prevented a clear view. Knowing he had left the castle, I decided to take the opportunity to explore more extensively than I had dared before. Returning to my room, I took a lamp and tested all the doors, finding them all locked as expected, with relatively new locks. I then went down the stone stairs to the main hall where I had first entered. I found I could easily slide back the bolts and release the large chains on the main door, but the door itself was locked, and the key was gone! The key must be in the Count's room; I must wait for his door to be open to retrieve it and escape. I continued my exploration, thoroughly examining the various stairs and passages and attempting to open the doors leading from them. A couple of small rooms near the hall were open but contained only old, dusty, moth-eaten furniture. However, at the top of a staircase, I finally found a door that, although appearing locked, yielded slightly when pressure was applied. Pushing harder, I discovered it wasn't truly locked but stuck because its hinges had dropped, causing the heavy door to rest on the floor. Recognizing this as a potential sole opportunity, I put my effort into forcing it open, managing after several attempts to push it back enough to enter. I was now in a section of the castle situated further to the right of my familiar rooms and one level lower. From the windows, I could see that this suite of rooms extended southward along the castle, with the end room's windows facing both west and south. On both these sides, there was a sheer precipice. The castle was built on a corner of a large rock, making it unassailable from three directions. Large windows were placed here, unreachable by projectiles like slings, bows, or culverins, thus allowing for light and comfort, unlike positions that required constant guarding. To the west lay a vast valley, beyond which rose rugged mountain ranges, peak upon peak, their sheer rocky slopes dotted with mountain ash and thorn trees whose roots clung to cracks and crevices in the stone. This part of the castle was clearly the ladies' quarters in past centuries, as the furniture was more comfortable than any I had previously seen. The windows had no curtains, and the bright yellow moonlight streaming through the diamond-shaped panes allowed me to distinguish colors, while also softening the thick layer of dust covering everything and somewhat masking the decay wrought by time and moths. My lamp seemed insignificant in the brilliant moonlight, but I was glad to have it, as a terrible loneliness pervaded the place, chilling my heart and making me tremble. Nevertheless, it was preferable to staying alone in the rooms I had come to detest due to the Count's presence. After trying to calm my nerves a little, a gentle tranquility settled over me. Here I sit at a small oak table where perhaps in old times some fair lady sat painstakingly penning a bashful, poorly-spelled love letter, and I am writing in my diary in shorthand everything that has occurred since my last entry. It feels utterly contemporary and forward-thinking, yet unless I am mistaken, the ancient centuries possessed, and continue to possess, powers that mere \"modernity\" cannot extinguish.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "15 May.—Today, I saw the Count again leave the castle, moving in his strange, reptilian manner. He made his way downward, moving sideways for about a hundred feet and off to the left, eventually disappearing into some opening or window. When his head went out of sight, I leaned over to try to see more, but it was impossible due to the distance—I couldn’t get a good view. Realizing the Count was out, I decided to take the chance to explore more than I had before. Returning to my room, I grabbed a lamp and tried all the doors, but as I expected, they were locked with fairly new locks. I then went down the stone stairs to the entrance hall. I found I could easily move the bolts and release the heavy chains, but the door itself was locked and the key was missing; it must be in the Count’s room. I resolved to watch for a chance to get the key if I ever found his door open, so I might escape. I continued to investigate the different staircases and passageways and tested more doors. Some small rooms near the hall were open, but they were empty except for some ancient, dusty, moth-eaten furniture. Eventually, I discovered one door at the top of a staircase. Though it seemed locked, it actually just stuck because the hinges had sagged and the heavy door dragged on the floor. Knowing this might be my only chance, I worked hard and managed to force the door open enough to slip inside. I now found myself in a wing of the castle to the right of my previous rooms and a floor lower. Looking out the windows, I could see that this suite extended along the south side of the castle, with windows at the end facing west and south. Outside these windows, a tremendous precipice dropped away. The castle was built right at the edge of a giant rock, so it was basically unassailable on three sides, and here the windows were large because they couldn’t be attacked with slings, bows, or guns—thus providing light and comfort not possible where security was a concern. To the west was a vast valley, then rugged mountain peaks covered with mountain ash and thorn that grew wherever they could find a foothold in the rocks. This area must have been the ladies’ quarters in earlier times, as the furniture suggested more comfort than elsewhere in the castle. The windows had no curtains, so the yellow moonlight poured in through the diamond panes, letting me see colors while softening the thick layer of dust and masking a bit the ruin caused by age and moths. In such bright moonlight, my lamp was barely useful, but I was glad to have it—it was so lonely and chilly a place that my nerves were on edge. Still, it was preferable to being alone in my old rooms, which I now loathed because of the Count’s presence. After a while, I managed to calm myself and felt a gentle peace settle over me. Now I sit at a little oak table, where once maybe a young lady wrote a clumsy love letter, and I record all these events in shorthand in my diary. It all feels so modern and yet, the old centuries still seem to have powers beyond what the modern world can erase."

Whilst I live on here there is but one thing to hope for, that I may not go mad, if, indeed, I be not mad already. If I be sane, then surely it is maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this hateful place the Count is the least dreadful to me; that to him alone I can look for safety, even though this be only whilst I can serve his purpose. Great God! merciful God! Let me be calm, for out of that way lies madness indeed. I begin to get new lights on certain things which have puzzled me. Up to now I never quite knew what Shakespeare meant when he made Hamlet say:—\n“My tablets! quick, my tablets!\n’Tis meet that I put it down,” etc.,\nfor now, feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shock had come which must end in its undoing, I turn to my diary for repose. The habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me.\nThe Count’s mysterious warning frightened me at the time; it frightens me more now when I think of it, for in future he has a fearful hold upon me. I shall fear to doubt what he may say!\nWhen I had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and pen in my pocket I felt sleepy. The Count’s warning came into my mind, but I took a pleasure in disobeying it. The sense of sleep was upon me, and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider. The soft moonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom which refreshed me. I determined not to return to-night to the gloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had sat and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars. I drew a great couch out of its place near the corner, so that as I lay, I could look at the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring for the dust, composed myself for sleep. I suppose I must have fallen asleep; I hope so, but I fear, for all that followed was startlingly real—so real that now sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the morning, I cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep.\nI was not alone. The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I came into it; I could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight, my own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of dust. In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by their dress and manner. I thought at the time that I must be dreaming when I saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw no shadow on the floor. They came close to me, and looked at me for some time, and then whispered together. Two were dark, and had high aquiline noses, like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. The other was fair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes like pale sapphires. I seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it in connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the moment how or where. All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips. There was something about them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the same time some deadly fear. I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they would kiss me with those red lips. It is not good to note this down, lest some day it should meet Mina’s eyes and cause her pain; but it is the truth.",

Any feeling or certainty of safety is gone. While I remain here, my only hope is to avoid madness, if I haven't already lost my mind. If I am still sane, then surely the most insane thought is that among all the terrible things hiding in this dreadful place, the Count is the one I fear the least; that he is the only one I can look to for protection, even if it's only for as long as I serve his purposes. Dear God! Merciful God! I must stay calm, for losing control will surely lead to madness. I'm starting to understand things that previously confused me. Until now, I never fully grasped what Shakespeare meant when Hamlet said: 'My tablets! quick, my tablets! 'Tis meet that I put it down,' etc. because now, feeling as though my own mind is disturbed or on the verge of collapse from shock, I turn to my diary for solace. The act of recording things accurately helps to calm me. The Count's strange warning unsettled me at the time, but it scares me even more now as I reflect on it, realizing he has a terrifying hold over me for the future. I'll be afraid to doubt anything he says! After writing in my diary and luckily putting the book and pen back in my pocket, I started to feel sleepy. The Count's warning came to mind, but I felt a strange satisfaction in ignoring it. Sleepiness washed over me, accompanied by the stubbornness that often precedes it. The soft moonlight was calming, and the vast open view outside gave me a feeling of freedom that was refreshing. I decided not to return to the dark, eerie rooms tonight, but to sleep here, in this spot where, long ago, ladies would sit, sing, and live their sweet lives, their gentle hearts feeling sorrow for their men away fighting brutal wars. I pulled a large sofa from its place near the corner so that I could look at the lovely view to the east and south as I lay down. Ignoring the dust, I settled myself to sleep. I assume I must have fallen asleep; I hope so, but I dread it, because everything that followed felt incredibly real—so real that even sitting here now in the bright, full morning sunlight, I cannot bring myself to believe it was merely sleep. I wasn't alone. The room was the same, unchanged since I entered it; I could see my own footprints in the thick, old dust on the floor under the bright moonlight. Standing in the moonlight opposite me were three young women, clearly ladies by their attire and demeanor. I thought at the moment that I must be dreaming when I saw them because, despite the moonlight being behind them, they cast no shadows on the floor. They approached me closely, examined me for a while, and then whispered among themselves. Two of them were dark-haired with high, curved noses like the Count's, and large, intense dark eyes that appeared almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. The third was incredibly fair, with large, wavy masses of golden hair and eyes like pale sapphires. I felt somehow that I recognized her face, associating it with some unsettling fear, but I couldn't recall at that moment how or from where. All three had strikingly white teeth that gleamed like pearls against the deep red of their sensuous lips. There was something about them that made me anxious, a mix of intense longing and a profound, deadly fear. In my heart, I felt a shameful, burning desire for them to kiss me with those red lips. It feels wrong to write this down, for fear that one day Mina might see it and be hurt; but it is the truth.",

While I remain here, my only hope is that I won’t lose my mind—though it’s possible I already have. If I am still sane, then the most disturbing thing is that, among all the horrors in this dreadful place, Count Dracula is the least frightening, and he is my sole hope for safety, if only as long as I am useful to him. Lord have mercy, and keep me calm, for otherwise, madness is inevitable. I am beginning to understand things that previously confused me. Until now, I never really understood what Shakespeare meant when Hamlet said, \"My tablets! Quick, my tablets! I must write it down,\" but now, feeling on the edge of mental collapse, I turn to my diary for comfort, hoping that faithfully recording events will help calm my nerves.\n\nThe Count’s cryptic warning scared me at the time, but on reflection it terrifies me more, because I know he has a frightening power over me now. I’ll be afraid to ever doubt him again.\n\nAfter making this diary entry and pocketing my writing materials, I felt drowsy. Though I recalled the Count’s warning, I deliberately chose to ignore it, feeling stubborn with tiredness. The gentle moonlight and the open landscape gave me a sense of freedom and relaxation. I decided not to go back to my dreary rooms, but to sleep here, in the room where women used to gather, sing, and live while longing for their loved ones away at war. I moved a large couch to the corner so I could look out on the beautiful eastern and southern view. Ignoring the dust, I settled down to sleep. I think I must have dozed off—I hope so, though what happened next felt incredibly real—so real that, even in the bright daylight now, I can hardly believe it was only a dream.\n\nI wasn’t alone anymore. The room looked exactly as it had before; I could see the trail I’d made through the dusty floor in the moonlight. Across from me, standing in the moonlight, were three young women, elegantly dressed and behaving like ladies. I thought I must be dreaming, as, though the moonlight was behind them, they cast no shadows. They approached and watched me for a while, whispering to one another. Two were dark-haired, with sharp, aquiline features like the Count’s, and deep, almost red eyes in the pale yellow moonlight. The third was strikingly fair, with golden hair and pale sapphire eyes. Her face seemed familiar to me, linked somehow to a vague sense of dread, though I couldn’t recall why. All three possessed dazzlingly white teeth, shining against their bright red lips. Their presence filled me with both attraction and fear—a wicked desire for their red-lipped kiss, even though admitting this in writing troubles me, especially if Mina might ever read it. But it’s the truth."

There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips like an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp teeth. Lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of my mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat. Then she paused, and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked her teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on my neck. Then the skin of my throat began to tingle as one’s flesh does when the hand that is to tickle it approaches nearer—nearer. I could feel the soft, shivering touch of the lips on the super-sensitive skin of my throat, and the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there.

It was similar to the intensely sweet, resonant sound produced by playing musical glasses expertly. The blond woman playfully tossed her head, while the other two encouraged her. One said, 'Go ahead! You lead the way, and we'll follow; it's your privilege to begin.' The other added, 'He's youthful and robust; there's plenty for each of us.' I remained still, peering out from beneath my eyelids in a state of intensely pleasurable dread. The blond woman moved forward and leaned above me until I could feel her breathing near me. In one way it was pleasant, sweetly like honey, sending the same rush through my nerves as her voice, but beneath the sweetness lay a harshness, an unpleasantness, akin to the smell of blood. I was too afraid to lift my eyelids, but I kept looking out perfectly from under my lashes. The woman knelt and leaned over me, clearly savoring the moment. There was a calculated sensuality about her that was simultaneously exciting and off-putting, and as she arched her neck, she actually ran her tongue over her lips like an animal, so that in the moonlight I could see the wetness glistening on her bright red lips and on her crimson tongue as it passed over her white, pointed teeth. Her head descended further and further as her mouth went past my chin and seemed poised to latch onto my throat. Then she stopped, and I could hear her tongue making a swirling sound as it cleaned her teeth and lips, and I could feel her warm breath on my neck. My throat skin then started to feel that prickly sensation, like when the fingers preparing to tickle you draw nearer—and nearer. I could feel the gentle, trembling contact of her lips on the very sensitive skin of my throat, and the distinct, firm points of two sharp teeth, merely resting there for a moment. I closed my eyes in a hazy, blissful state and waited—waited with my heart pounding.",

You’re first; you have the right to begin.” The other said, “He is young and strong; there will be kisses enough for all of us.” I remained still, peeking from under my eyelashes, gripped with a mixture of fear and delicious anticipation.

Too scared to open my eyes fully, I watched through my lashes as she knelt beside me, almost reveling in pleasure. Her intentions were both exciting and alarming, and then, tilting her neck, she licked her lips animalistically. In the moonlight, I could see the shine of her saliva on her red lips and tongue, which brushed over her white, pointed teeth. She lowered her head closer and closer, her mouth dropping below my mouth and chin, seemingly aiming for my throat. There, she hesitated, and I could hear the sound of her tongue on her teeth and lips, as well as feel her hot breath at my neck. The skin of my neck tingled, the sensation growing stronger as she neared. I felt the gentle, chilling touch of her lips on my sensitive skin, and the sharp pressure of two pointed teeth barely pressing, pausing.

As my eyes opened involuntarily I saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with giant’s power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the white teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with passion. But the Count! Never did I imagine such wrath and fury, even to the demons of the pit. His eyes were positively blazing. The red light in them was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind them. His face was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires; the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar of white-hot metal. With a fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the woman from him, and then motioned to the others, as though he were beating them back; it was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to the wolves. In a voice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed to cut through the air and then ring round the room he said:—\n“How dare you touch him, any of you? How dare you cast eyes on him when I had forbidden it? Back, I tell you all! This man belongs to me! Beware how you meddle with him, or you’ll have to deal with me.” The fair girl, with a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him:—\n“You yourself never loved; you never love!” On this the other women joined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the room that it almost made me faint to hear; it seemed like the pleasure of fiends. Then the Count turned, after looking at my face attentively, and said in a soft whisper:—\n“Yes, I too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past. Is it not so? Well, now I promise you that when I am done with him you shall kiss him at your will. Now go! go! I must awaken him, for there is work to be done.”\n“Are we to have nothing to-night?” said one of them, with a low laugh, as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and which moved as though there were some living thing within it. For answer he nodded his head. One of the women jumped forward and opened it. If my ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as of a half-smothered child. The women closed round, whilst I was aghast with horror; but as I looked they disappeared, and with them the dreadful bag. There was no door near them, and they could not have passed me without my noticing. They simply seemed to fade into the rays of the moonlight and pass out through the window, for I could see outside the dim, shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away.\nThen the horror overcame me, and I sank down unconscious.",

I had never imagined such wrath and fury, not even among the demons of hell. His eyes were literally blazing. The red glow in them was horrifying, as if the flames of hell were burning behind his gaze. His face was deathly pale, and its lines were hard, like taut wires. His thick eyebrows, meeting over his nose, now looked like a surging bar of white-hot metal. With a fierce swing of his arm, he threw the woman away from him, and then gestured to the others as if pushing them back; it was the same commanding motion I had seen him use on the wolves. In a voice that, though low and almost a whisper, seemed to slice through the air and then echo around the room, he declared:\n\"How dare any of you touch him? How dare you look at him when I forbade it? Back, I tell you all! This man belongs to me! Be careful how you interfere with him, or you will answer to me.\" The fair girl, with a laugh of crude flirtatiousness, turned to reply: \"You yourself never loved; you never love!\" At this, the other women joined in, and such a joyless, harsh, inhuman laughter filled the room that hearing it nearly made me faint. It sounded like the pleasure of devils. Then the Count turned, after looking closely at my face, and said in a soft whisper: \"Yes, I too can love; you yourselves know this from the past. Is it not so? Well, now I promise you that when I am finished with him, you may kiss him as you wish. Now go! Go! I must awaken him, for there is work to be done.\" \"Are we to have nothing tonight?\" one of them asked with a low laugh, pointing to the bag he had thrown on the floor, which was moving as though something alive was inside. In response, he nodded his head. One of the women sprang forward and opened it. If my ears did not deceive me, there was a gasp and a quiet wail, like a child being smothered. The women gathered around, while I was frozen with horror; but as I watched, they disappeared, and the dreadful bag with them. There was no door nearby, and they could not have passed me without my seeing. They simply seemed to fade into the moonlight and pass out through the window, for I could see their faint, shadowy forms outside for a moment before they completely vanished. Then the horror overcame me, and I collapsed into unconsciousness.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Suddenly, another powerful feeling overwhelmed me, striking as swiftly as lightning. I was acutely aware of the Count's presence, surrounded by an intense storm of anger. As my eyes opened instinctively, I saw his strong hand seizing the delicate throat of the beautiful woman, pulling her back with incredible strength. Her blue eyes were wild with rage, white teeth grinding, and her fair cheeks flushed with anger. But Count Dracula's own fury was beyond anything I could have imagined, even in demons – his eyes blazed with a fiery red light, as if hell itself burned behind them. His skin was deathly pale, his facial features as hard as steel wires, and his thick, joining eyebrows now looked like a bar of blazing metal. With a violent movement, he threw the woman aside and signaled to the others to retreat, commanding them with the same authority he used on wolves. Speaking in a low, cutting voice that echoed sharply around the room, he declared: \"How dare any of you touch him? How dare you even look at him after I forbade it? Back! This man belongs to me! Do not interfere, or you'll answer to me.\" The fair woman replied with a mocking laugh, \"You yourself have never loved; you never love!\" The other women joined her, their soulless, cruel laughter ringing through the room, so disturbing it nearly made me faint – laughter that felt more evil than human. The Count then looked closely at me and whispered softly, \"Yes, I can love; you yourselves have witnessed it before. Isn’t it true? Well, I promise you this: once I am finished with him, you may kiss him as you like. Now, leave! I must awaken him, there is work to do.\" \"Are we to have nothing tonight?\" one woman asked with a sly laugh, pointing to the bag he had dropped on the floor; the bag shifted as if something alive was inside. He nodded in response. One woman leapt forward, opened it, and, if my ears were right, I heard a gasp and a faint, muffled cry, like that of a nearly suffocated child. The women gathered around, horrifying me, but then, as I watched in shock, they vanished along with the dreadful bag. There was no door near them, and I would have noticed if they had passed me. It was as if they simply faded into the moonlight and drifted out the window; for a brief moment, I saw their shadowy forms outside before they completely disappeared. Overcome by terror, I lost consciousness."

To be sure, there were certain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid by in a manner which was not my habit. My watch was still unwound, and I am rigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed, and many such details. But these things are no proof, for they may have been evidences that my mind was not as usual, and, from some cause or another, I had certainly been much upset. I must watch for proof. Of one thing I am glad: if it was that the Count carried me here and undressed me, he must have been hurried in his task, for my pockets are intact. I am sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would not have brooked. He would have taken or destroyed it.

Also, my watch hadn't been wound, something I always do before sleeping, among other small details. However, these don't serve as conclusive evidence, as they might merely indicate my mind wasn't functioning normally, and I had certainly been greatly disturbed for some reason. I need to find solid proof. One positive aspect is that if the Count did carry me here and undress me, he must have been in a hurry, because everything in my pockets is still there. I am sure this diary would have been a puzzle to him that he wouldn't have tolerated. He would have either taken it or destroyed it.

There were small clues—like how my clothes were neatly folded in a way I don't usually do, and my watch hadn't been wound even though I always wind it before sleep—that pointed to something being off. Still, these signs aren't definite proof, as my disturbed state of mind could have caused me to forget my usual habits. I realize I need more concrete evidence. One thing comforts me: if the Count did move and undress me, he must have been in a hurry, since all my belongings, including my diary, are untouched. This diary would have baffled him, and he surely would have taken or destroyed it if he'd looked. Now, even though this room has filled me with terror in the past, it feels like a refuge, since nothing could be more terrifying than those dreadful women who are waiting to drink my blood."

Last night the Count asked me in the suavest tones to write three letters, one saying that my work here was nearly done, and that I should start for home within a few days, another that I was starting on the next morning from the time of the letter, and the third that I had left the castle and arrived at Bistritz. I would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present state of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the Count whilst I am so absolutely in his power; and to refuse would be to excite his suspicion and to arouse his anger. He knows that I know too much, and that I must not live, lest I be dangerous to him; my only chance is to prolong my opportunities. Something may occur which will give me a chance to escape. I saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath which was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him. He explained to me that posts were few and uncertain, and that my writing now would ensure ease of mind to my friends; and he assured me with so much impressiveness that he would countermand the later letters, which would be held over at Bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my prolonging my stay, that to oppose him would have been to create new suspicion. I therefore pretended to fall in with his views, and asked him what dates I should put on the letters. He calculated a minute, and then said:—\n“The first should be June 12, the second June 19, and the third June 29.”\nI know now the span of my life. God help me!",

Last night, the Count, using his most agreeable tone, instructed me to draft three letters: one stating my work was almost complete and I would be returning home within a few days, a second claiming I was beginning my journey the very next morning from the letter's date, and a third announcing my departure from the castle and arrival in Bistritz. I yearned to resist, but I felt that under the current circumstances, where I am entirely within his control, openly challenging the Count would be sheer madness. Refusal would undoubtedly spark his suspicion and ignite his anger. He knows I possess too much compromising information and that I cannot be allowed to live, lest I become a threat to him. My only course of action is to delay, hoping that some event might arise offering an opportunity for escape. I detected in his gaze a hint of that same escalating fury I witnessed when he violently threw that woman aside. He reasoned that mail delivery was infrequent and unreliable, and that writing now would alleviate my friends' concerns. He then promised with such conviction that he would hold back the later letters, keeping them at Bistritz until the appropriate time in case my stay was prolonged, that opposing him would have only generated further mistrust. Therefore, I feigned agreement with his proposal and asked him which dates I should assign to the letters. After a moment's thought, he replied: \"The first should be June 12th, the second June 19th, and the third June 29th.\" I now understand the precise limit of my remaining time. May God help me!",

I wanted to refuse, but considering my current situation, it would be foolish to openly antagonize the Count while he holds all the power; declining his request would only make him suspicious and angry. He is aware that I know too much, and that he cannot let me live if I become a threat to him. My only hope is to buy myself more time, in the hope that something might happen to allow me to escape. I noticed the same building anger in his eyes that I saw when he pushed the woman away. He explained that the mail service here is irregular, and writing these letters now would reassure my friends; he promised, with great emphasis, that he would not send the later letters until the appropriate time if I happened to stay longer, so objecting would have only increased his suspicions. So I pretended to accept his reasoning, and asked him for the dates I should put on the letters. He thought for a moment and replied: “The first should be June 12, the second June 19, and the third June 29.” Now I realize how much longer I may survive. God help me!"

These Szgany are gipsies; I have notes of them in my book. They are peculiar to this part of the world, though allied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over. There are thousands of them in Hungary and Transylvania, who are almost outside all law. They attach themselves as a rule to some great noble or boyar, and call themselves by his name. They are fearless and without religion, save superstition, and they talk only their own varieties of the Romany tongue.\nI shall write some letters home, and shall try to get them to have them posted. I have already spoken them through my window to begin acquaintanceship. They took their hats off and made obeisance and many signs, which, however, I could not understand any more than I could their spoken language....\nI have written the letters. Mina’s is in shorthand, and I simply ask Mr. Hawkins to communicate with her. To her I have explained my situation, but without the horrors which I may only surmise. It would shock and frighten her to death were I to expose my heart to her. Should the letters not carry, then the Count shall not yet know my secret or the extent of my knowledge....\nI have given the letters; I threw them through the bars of my window with a gold piece, and made what signs I could to have them posted. The man who took them pressed them to his heart and bowed, and then put them in his cap. I could do no more. I stole back to the study, and began to read.

He sat down beside me, and said in his smoothest voice as he opened two letters:—\n“The Szgany has given me these, of which, though I know not whence they come, I shall, of course, take care. See!”—he must have looked at it—“one is from you, and to my friend Peter Hawkins; the other”—here he caught sight of the strange symbols as he opened the envelope, and the dark look came into his face, and his eyes blazed wickedly—“the other is a vile thing, an outrage upon friendship and hospitality! It is not signed. Well! so it cannot matter to us.” And he calmly held letter and envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed. Then he went on:—\n“The letter to Hawkins—that I shall, of course, send on, since it is yours. Your letters are sacred to me. Your pardon, my friend, that unknowingly I did break the seal. Will you not cover it again?” He held out the letter to me, and with a courteous bow handed me a clean envelope. I could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence. When he went out of the room I could hear the key turn softly. A minute later I went over and tried it, and the door was locked.\nWhen, an hour or two after, the Count came quietly into the room, his coming awakened me, for I had gone to sleep on the sofa. He was very courteous and very cheery in his manner, and seeing that I had been sleeping, he said:—\n“So, my friend, you are tired? Get to bed. There is the surest rest. I may not have the pleasure to talk to-night, since there are many labours to me; but you will sleep, I pray.” I passed to my room and went to bed, and, strange to say, slept without dreaming.

A group of Szgany people have arrived and set up camp in the castle courtyard. I have information about these Szgany, who are a type of Romany or gipsies unique to this region, although related to gipsies worldwide. Thousands live in Hungary and Transylvania, largely outside the law. They typically align themselves with a powerful noble or lord, often taking his name. They are known for their bravery and lack of conventional religion, being instead quite superstitious. They speak only their own dialects of the Romany language.\n\nI plan to write some letters home and attempt to persuade them to mail them for me. I've already tried speaking to them through my window to establish contact. They respectfully removed their hats and made bows and gestures, which I couldn't understand any better than their spoken words.\n\nI have finished writing the letters. The one to Mina is written in shorthand, and I've simply asked Mr. Hawkins to get in touch with her. I've described my situation to her but left out the terrifying possibilities I can only guess at. Revealing the full extent of my fears would likely shock and terrify her immensely. If these letters don't reach their destination, the Count won't yet know my secret or the extent of my awareness.\n\nI have given them the letters; I threw them out through the bars of my window along with a gold coin and used gestures to indicate they should post them. The man who took them pressed them to his chest, bowed, and then put them in his cap. There was nothing more I could do. I quietly returned to the study and started reading. Since the Count hadn't come in, I used the time to write this journal entry.\n\nThe Count has arrived. He sat next to me and, in a very smooth tone, said as he held up two letters he had opened:—\n\n“The Szgany gave me these, and although I don't know where they came from, I will certainly take care of them. Look!”—he seemed to have examined one—“one is from you, addressed to my friend Peter Hawkins; the other”—here, as he opened the envelope, he noticed the strange symbols, and a dark expression came over his face, his eyes glaring menacingly—“the other is a despicable thing, an insult to friendship and hospitality! It isn't signed. Well, then! It cannot concern us.” With that, he calmly held both the letter and its envelope in the lamp's flame until they were completely burned. He then continued:—\n\n“As for the letter to Hawkins—I will, of course, send that on, since it is yours. Your correspondence is sacred to me. Please forgive me, my friend, for unknowingly breaking the seal. Would you care to re-seal it?” He offered the letter to me and courteously handed me a fresh envelope. I could only re-address it and return it to him in silence. After he left the room, I heard the key turn softly. A minute or so later, I checked, and the door was indeed locked.\n\nWhen the Count returned quietly an hour or two later, his presence woke me as I had drifted off to sleep on the sofa. He was very polite and cheerful in his manner. Seeing that I had been sleeping, he said:—\n\n“Ah, my friend, you are tired? Go to bed. That is where you will find the best rest. I may not have time to talk tonight, as I have much work to do; but I hope you will sleep well.” I went to my room and got into bed. Oddly enough, I slept deeply without any dreams.

I spoke to them through the window to make contact. They removed their hats, bowed and gestured a lot, though I couldn't understand their words or signals.\n\nI've finished my letters. I wrote Mina's in shorthand, just asking Mr. Hawkins to contact her. I told Mina about my situation, but spared her the worst details, as the truth would terrify her.

See—one is addressed to your friend Peter Hawkins; the other\"—he saw the shorthand and looked angry—\"the other is a disgrace, an insult to our friendship and my hospitality!

Forgive me, my friend, I did not mean to break the seal. Will you seal it again?\" He handed me a fresh envelope, and I quietly redirected the letter and returned it to him. Once he left the room, I heard him lock the door. When I checked, it was indeed locked.\n\nAn hour or two later, the Count returned, waking me as I had slept on the sofa. He was very polite and cheerful, and noticing I was tired, he told me to go to bed, saying he wouldn't be able to talk tonight due to work, but wished me good rest.

With joy I hurried to the window, and saw drive into the yard two great leiter-wagons, each drawn by eight sturdy horses, and at the head of each pair a Slovak, with his wide hat, great nail-studded belt, dirty sheepskin, and high boots. They had also their long staves in hand. I ran to the door, intending to descend and try and join them through the main hall, as I thought that way might be opened for them. Again a shock: my door was fastened on the outside.\nThen I ran to the window and cried to them. They looked up at me stupidly and pointed, but just then the “hetman” of the Szgany came out, and seeing them pointing to my window, said something, at which they laughed. Henceforth no effort of mine, no piteous cry or agonised entreaty, would make them even look at me. They resolutely turned away. The leiter-wagons contained great, square boxes, with handles of thick rope; these were evidently empty by the ease with which the Slovaks handled them, and by their resonance as they were roughly moved. When they were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner of the yard, the Slovaks were given some money by the Szgany, and spitting on it for luck, lazily went each to his horse’s head.

Filled with excitement, I quickly went to the window and watched as two large wooden wagons drove into the yard, each pulled by eight powerful horses. Leading each pair was a Slovak man dressed in a wide hat, a large belt adorned with nails, a soiled sheepskin coat, and tall boots. They were also carrying their long staffs. I rushed to my door, planning to go downstairs and attempt to meet them through the main hall, thinking that route might be accessible for them. To my surprise and dismay, my door was locked from the outside. I then hurried back to the window and called out to them. They looked up at me with a blank expression and pointed, but just at that moment, the Szgany leader, the \"hetman,\" emerged. He saw them indicating my window, said something, and they all started laughing. After that, despite my repeated efforts, no desperate plea or anguished request could get them to even glance my way. They stubbornly refused to look at me. The wagons carried large, square containers with handles made of thick rope; it was clear they were empty due to how easily the Slovaks handled them and the hollow sound they made when moved roughly. Once all the boxes were unloaded and stacked in a large pile in a corner of the yard, the Szgany gave the Slovaks some money. The Slovaks, spitting on the money for good fortune, then slowly made their way to their respective horses.

As soon as I dared I ran up the winding stair, and looked out of the window, which opened south. I thought I would watch for the Count, for there is something going on. The Szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of some kind. I know it, for now and then I hear a far-away muffled sound as of mattock and spade, and, whatever it is, it must be the end of some ruthless villainy.\nI had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when I saw something coming out of the Count’s window. I drew back and watched carefully, and saw the whole man emerge. It was a new shock to me to find that he had on the suit of clothes which I had worn whilst travelling here, and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which I had seen the women take away. There could be no doubt as to his quest, and in my garb, too! This, then, is his new scheme of evil: that he will allow others to see me, as they think, so that he may both leave evidence that I have been seen in the towns or villages posting my own letters, and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the local people be attributed to me.\nIt makes me rage to think that this can go on, and whilst I am shut up here, a veritable prisoner, but without that protection of the law which is even a criminal’s right and consolation.\nI thought I would watch for the Count’s return, and for a long time sat doggedly at the window. Then I began to notice that there were some quaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight. They were like the tiniest grains of dust, and they whirled round and gathered in clusters in a nebulous sort of way. I watched them with a sense of soothing, and a sort of calm stole over me. I leaned back in the embrasure in a more comfortable position, so that I could enjoy more fully the aërial gambolling.\nSomething made me start up, a low, piteous howling of dogs somewhere far below in the valley, which was hidden from my sight. Louder it seemed to ring in my ears, and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes to the sound as they danced in the moonlight. I felt myself struggling to awake to some call of my instincts; nay, my very soul was struggling, and my half-remembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call. I was becoming hypnotised! Quicker and quicker danced the dust; the moonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom beyond. More and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom shapes. And then I started, broad awake and in full possession of my senses, and ran screaming from the place. The phantom shapes, which were becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams, were those of the three ghostly women to whom I was doomed. I fled, and felt somewhat safer in my own room, where there was no moonlight and where the lamp was burning brightly.\nWhen a couple of hours had passed I heard something stirring in the Count’s room, something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed; and then there was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me. With a beating heart, I tried the door; but I was locked in my prison, and could do nothing. I sat down and simply cried.",

As soon as it seemed safe, I hurried up the spiral stairs and looked out the window facing south. My intention was to keep watch for the Count, as I suspected something significant was happening. I could tell that the Szgany were stationed somewhere within the castle and were engaged in some kind of work. I could hear faint, muffled sounds in the distance, like digging with mattocks and spades. Whatever activity it was, it surely marked the conclusion of some cruel act.\nI had been observing from the window for less than half an hour when I noticed something emerging from the Count's window. I stepped back and watched closely as a man appeared entirely. I was shocked to see he was wearing the clothes I had traveled in and had the ominous bag, which I had seen the women carry away, slung over his shoulder. There was no mistaking his purpose, and wearing my attire! This, then, was his new evil scheme: to allow others to believe they were seeing me, so that he could both create evidence of my presence in towns or villages mailing my own letters and ensure that any wickedness he committed would be attributed to me by the local populace.\nIt fills me with fury to think this is occurring while I am held captive here, a true prisoner, yet denied the legal protection that even criminals are entitled to.\nI decided to wait for the Count to return, and I sat determinedly at the window for a long time. Then, I started noticing some odd little bright specks drifting in the moonbeams. They resembled incredibly tiny dust particles and swirled and gathered loosely in a hazy way. Watching them brought me a sense of peace and a kind of calmness settled over me. I leaned back more comfortably in the window recess to better enjoy their airy dance.\nSuddenly, something startled me – a low, sorrowful howling of dogs coming from somewhere deep in the valley below, which I couldn't see. The sound seemed to grow louder in my ears, and the floating dust motes appeared to shift shape in time with the sound as they danced in the moonlight. I felt an inner struggle, as if my instincts were trying to rouse me; my very soul seemed to fight, and my half-forgotten senses strained to respond. I was being hypnotized! The dust particles danced faster and faster; the moonbeams seemed to vibrate as they passed me and moved into the dark space beyond. They gathered more and more densely until they began to take on indistinct, ghostly forms. Then I snapped awake, fully alert and with my senses restored, and screamed as I fled the spot. The spectral shapes, which were gradually solidifying from the moonbeams, were the three ghostly women to whom I was fated. I ran and felt somewhat safer in my own room, where there was no moonlight and the lamp was burning brightly.\nAfter a couple of hours, I heard movement in the Count's room, something like a sharp, quickly stifled cry. Then there was silence, profound and terrifying, which sent a chill through me. With my heart pounding, I tried the door, but I was locked in my prison and could do nothing.

The Szgany are staying somewhere within the castle and working on some mysterious task. I know this because I occasionally hear faint, distant sounds like shovels and picks at work; whatever they're doing, it can't be good.\n\nAfter watching for less than half an hour, I saw something emerge from the Count's window. I instinctively pulled back and watched closely, witnessing the Count himself climb out. It was shocking to realize he was dressed in the same travel suit I had worn to get here, and he carried over his shoulder the dreadful bag I had seen the women take earlier. There could be no mistake about his intentions—and while wearing my clothing! So this is his latest wicked scheme: he intends for others to see someone they think is me, spreading evidence of me posting letters in towns and villages. That way, any crimes he commits will be blamed on me by the locals.\n\nI'm furious that he can get away with this while I'm stuck here—truly a prisoner—without even the legal rights that protect criminals.\n\nI tried to keep watch for the Count's return and waited stubbornly by the window. Eventually, I noticed strange little specks floating in the moonlight—like tiny dust particles swirling, clustering together in a hazy way. Watching them had a soothing effect, calming me. I leaned back to observe their dance in greater comfort.\n\nSuddenly, I was startled by a low, desperate howling of dogs from somewhere deep in the hidden valley below.

I felt as if my instincts were urging me to wake up; it was as though my very soul was trying to respond. I realized I was being hypnotized. The dust swirled faster, and the moonbeams seemed to tremble as they passed beside me into the dark beyond the window. The clusters thickened and began to form vague phantom forms.\n\nSuddenly, I snapped awake, fully alert, and ran screaming from the window. The specters—becoming more solid by the moment in the moonlight—were the three ghostly women who haunted me. I fled to my own room, feeling safer since there was no moonlight and my lamp was burning brightly.\n\nSeveral hours later, I heard a noise from the Count's room—a sharp, quickly suppressed wail—before everything went dead silent, an awful stillness that chilled me.

Last night, one of my post-dated letters, the first of those fateful messages designed to erase all evidence of my presence, was mailed. I mustn't dwell on that. I need to act! All the instances where I've been attacked, threatened, or felt endangered or afraid have occurred at night. I have never seen the Count during the day. Could it be that he rests when others are active, and is active while they are at rest? If only I could access his room! But it seems impossible. The door is always locked, making it inaccessible to me. Yet, there is a way, if one is brave enough to attempt it. If he can get through it, why couldn't someone else? I personally saw him crawl out of his window. Why shouldn't I do the same and enter through his window? The odds are terrible, but my situation is even more desperate. I will take the chance. At worst, it will only be death; and a man's death is not like an animal's, and perhaps the afterlife I dread is still open to me. May God help me with this task! Farewell, Mina, if I fail; farewell, my loyal friend and father figure; farewell, everyone, and finally, farewell Mina!",

When the sun climbed high enough today to touch the top of the great gate across from my window, its warm light made me think of the dove returning to Noah’s ark. My fears faded away, disappearing in the sun’s warmth like a mist. While I still have the courage that the day brings, I know I must act. Last night, I sent the first of my backdated letters, beginning the chain of messages that could erase all trace of me from the world. I must not dwell on this now. I must take action! It’s always at night that I’ve been troubled, threatened, or fearful. I have never seen the Count during the day—perhaps he sleeps while others are awake and is awake while others sleep. If only I could enter his room, but the door is always locked—there seems to be no way in. Yet, perhaps there is if I am bold enough: I saw him crawl out of his own window, so why couldn’t I climb in that way myself? It’s incredibly dangerous, but my desperation leaves me no choice. I’ll take the risk—at worst I could die, but I would die as a man, not as a coward, and perhaps the hereafter would still be open to me. May God help me with what I am about to do. Farewell, Mina, if I do not succeed; farewell, my loyal friend and mentor; farewell to all of you—and most of all, Mina."

          "text_segment": "Same day, later.—I have made the effort, and God, helping me, have come safely back to this room. I must put down every detail in order. I went whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south side, and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs around the building on this side. The stones are big and roughly cut, and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them. I took off my boots, and ventured out on the desperate way. I looked down once, so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would not overcome me, but after that kept my eyes away from it. I knew pretty well the direction and distance of the Count’s window, and made for it as well as I could, having regard to the opportunities available. I did not feel dizzy—I suppose I was too excited—and the time seemed ridiculously short till I found myself standing on the window-sill and trying to raise up the sash. I was filled with agitation, however, when I bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window. Then I looked around for the Count, but, with surprise and gladness, made a discovery. The room was empty! It was barely furnished with odd things, which seemed to have never been used; the furniture was something the same style as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust. I looked for the key, but it was not in the lock, and I could not find it anywhere. The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in one corner—gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian, and Hungarian, and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a film of dust, as though it had lain long in the ground. None of it that I noticed was less than three hundred years old. There were also chains and ornaments, some jewelled, but all of them old and stained.\nAt one corner of the room was a heavy door. I tried it, for, since I could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, which was the main object of my search, I must make further examination, or all my efforts would be in vain. It was open, and led through a stone passage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down. I descended, minding carefully where I went, for the stairs were dark, being only lit by loopholes in the heavy masonry. At the bottom there was a dark, tunnel-like passage, through which came a deathly, sickly odour, the odour of old earth newly turned. As I went through the passage the smell grew closer and heavier. At last I pulled open a heavy door which stood ajar, and found myself in an old, ruined chapel, which had evidently been used as a graveyard. The roof was broken, and in two places were steps leading to vaults, but the ground had recently been dug over, and the earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those which had been brought by the Slovaks. There was nobody about, and I made search for any further outlet, but there was none. Then I went over every inch of the ground, so as not to lose a chance. I went down even into the vaults, where the dim light struggled, although to do so was a dread to my very soul. Into two of these I went, but saw nothing except fragments of old coffins and piles of dust; in the third, however, I made a discovery.\nThere, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on a pile of newly dug earth, lay the Count! He was either dead or asleep, I could not say which—for the eyes were open and stony, but without the glassiness of death—and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all their pallor; the lips were as red as ever. But there was no sign of movement, no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart. I bent over him, and tried to find any sign of life, but in vain. He could not have lain there long, for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours. By the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here and there. I thought he might have the keys on him, but when I went to search I saw the dead eyes, and in them, dead though they were, such a look of hate, though unconscious of me or my presence, that I fled from the place, and leaving the Count’s room by the window, crawled again up the castle wall. Regaining my room, I threw myself panting upon the bed and tried to think....",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Later that same day, feeling God's protection, I successfully returned to my room after making a difficult attempt. I must document everything in precise order. While my courage was high, I went directly to the south-facing window and climbed out onto the narrow stone ledge encircling that side of the structure. The stones are large and roughly shaped, with mortar worn away over time. I took off my boots before cautiously starting my perilous journey. I glanced down once to ensure I wouldn't be overcome by a sudden view of the terrifying drop, but afterward, I avoided looking down. I had a good idea of the Count's window's location and distance and moved towards it as best as possible given the conditions. I didn't feel dizzy, likely due to my excitement, and the time until I reached the window sill and tried to lift the sash seemed surprisingly short. However, I became very anxious when I lowered myself and slid feet-first through the window. Once inside, I looked around for the Count, but to my surprise and relief, I found the room vacant! It was sparsely furnished with disparate items that appeared unused. The furniture was similar in style to that in the south rooms and covered in dust. I searched for the key, but it wasn't in the lock or anywhere else. The only notable discovery was a substantial pile of gold coins in one corner – a mix of Roman, British, Austrian, Hungarian, Greek, and Turkish money, coated in dust as if recently unearthed. None of it seemed less than three centuries old. There were also necklaces and ornaments, some with jewels, but all looking ancient and tarnished. A heavy door was situated in one corner of the room. I tried it because, having failed to find the key to the room or the main outer door (which was my primary goal), I needed to investigate further, or my efforts would be wasted. It was unlocked and opened into a stone passage leading to a steep, winding stairway descending downwards. I went down carefully, as the stairs were dark, illuminated only by slits in the thick stone walls. At the bottom, I found a dark, tunnel-like passage emitting a deadly, sickening smell, like old earth freshly disturbed. As I proceeded, the odor intensified and grew heavier. Eventually, I pushed open a heavy door that was ajar and found myself in an ancient, dilapidated chapel, clearly used as a burial site. The roof was damaged, and in two places, steps led down to vaults. The ground had been recently dug up, and the earth was piled into large wooden crates, unmistakably those brought by the Slovaks. No one was present, and I searched for any other exit, but there was none. Then, I meticulously examined every part of the ground, leaving no possibility unchecked. I even descended into the vaults, despite the dread it instilled, where only a faint light penetrated. I entered two of these, seeing only remnants of old coffins and layers of dust. In the third vault, however, I made a significant find. There, in one of the fifty large boxes, resting on a mound of freshly dug earth, lay the Count! I couldn't tell if he was dead or asleep; his eyes were open and fixed, lacking the glassy appearance of death, and despite his paleness, his cheeks felt warm with life; his lips remained as red as ever. Yet, there was no sign of movement, no pulse, no breath, no heartbeat. I leaned over him, attempting in vain to detect any sign of life. He couldn't have been there long, as the earthy smell would dissipate within a few hours. Beside the box lay its cover, punctured with holes. I thought he might have the keys on him, but when I reached to search, I saw his dead eyes, and in them, despite being lifeless, was such an intense look of hate, seemingly unaware of me or my presence, that I fled the place. I exited the Count's room through the window and crawled back up the castle wall. Upon reaching my room, I collapsed, gasping for breath, onto the bed and tried to comprehend everything.",

While my determination was strong, I went straight to the south-facing window and climbed onto the narrow stone ledge around that side of the building. The stones were large, crudely shaped, and the mortar had eroded away with time. I removed my boots and began the hazardous journey. I glanced down once to make sure I wouldn't be overwhelmed by the terrifying drop, then made sure to keep my eyes away from the edge. I had a good idea of where the Count’s window was, and I made my way toward it as best I could, given the circumstances. I didn’t feel dizzy—perhaps I was too exhilarated—and before I knew it, I was on the window ledge, trying to lift the sash. I became anxious as I slipped feet-first into the room. I looked for the Count, but to my relief and surprise, discovered the room was empty. It contained only a few strange, unused, dust-covered pieces of furniture, similar to those in the south rooms. Searching for a key, I found none in the lock or anywhere else. The only thing I uncovered was a large pile of gold coins in one corner—Roman, British, Austrian, Hungarian, Greek, and Turkish—all very old and dusty, none newer than three centuries. There were also chains and ornamental items, some set with jewels, all ancient and tarnished.\n\nIn the corner, I found a heavy door. Since I couldn’t find a key for either this room or the main outer door (which I needed), I decided to investigate further. The door was unlocked and led through a stone corridor to a spiraling staircase running steeply down. I descended carefully, knowing it was dark apart from scant light filtering through small openings in the thick walls. At the bottom, I came to a gloomy, tunnel-like hall, filled with a sickly, suffocating smell—the stench of freshly dug earth. The smell grew stronger as I proceeded. Eventually, I opened a heavy door standing ajar and entered a ruined old chapel, once used as a graveyard. Its roof was damaged, and stairs descended to vaults in two spots, but the ground had been freshly dug and packed into large wooden crates, like those delivered by the Slovaks. No one was around. I searched for another exit but found none. I thoroughly inspected every part of the area, even venturing into the vaults, though the thought filled me with dread. I entered two but saw nothing except pieces of old coffins and piles of dust. In the third vault, I made a discovery.\n\nInside one of roughly fifty large boxes, lying atop freshly dug earth, was the Count! He appeared either dead or asleep—I couldn’t tell.

I bent closer, searching for any sign of life, but in vain. He couldn’t have been there long, as the earthy smell would have faded in a few hours. By the box was its perforated lid. I wondered if he carried keys and leaned in to search, but the sight of his dead eyes, filled with hate, though unaware of me, made me flee in terror. I escaped through the Count’s window and climbed up the castle wall. Once back in my own room, I collapsed panting on the bed, trying to gather my thoughts..."

As he went down the wall, lizard fashion, I wished I had a gun or some lethal weapon, that I might destroy him; but I fear that no weapon wrought alone by man’s hand would have any effect on him. I dared not wait to see him return, for I feared to see those weird sisters. I came back to the library, and read there till I fell asleep.\nI was awakened by the Count, who looked at me as grimly as a man can look as he said:—\n“To-morrow, my friend, we must part. You return to your beautiful England, I to some work which may have such an end that we may never meet. Your letter home has been despatched; to-morrow I shall not be here, but all shall be ready for your journey. In the morning come the Szgany, who have some labours of their own here, and also come some Slovaks. When they have gone, my carriage shall come for you, and shall bear you to the Borgo Pass to meet the diligence from Bukovina to Bistritz. But I am in hopes that I shall see more of you at Castle Dracula.” I suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity. Sincerity! It seems like a profanation of the word to write it in connection with such a monster, so asked him point-blank:—\n“Why may I not go to-night?”\n“Because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on a mission.”\n“But I would walk with pleasure. I want to get away at once.” He smiled, such a soft, smooth, diabolical smile that I knew there was some trick behind his smoothness. He said:—\n“And your baggage?”\n“I do not care about it. I can send for it some other time.”\nThe Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy which made me rub my eyes, it seemed so real:—\n“You English have a saying which is close to my heart, for its spirit is that which rules our boyars: ‘Welcome the coming; speed the parting guest.’ Come with me, my dear young friend. Not an hour shall you wait in my house against your will, though sad am I at your going, and that you so suddenly desire it. Come!” With a stately gravity, he, with the lamp, preceded me down the stairs and along the hall. Suddenly he stopped.\n“Hark!”\nClose at hand came the howling of many wolves. It was almost as if the sound sprang up at the rising of his hand, just as the music of a great orchestra seems to leap under the bâton of the conductor. After a pause of a moment, he proceeded, in his stately way, to the door, drew back the ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains, and began to draw it open.\nTo my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked. Suspiciously, I looked all round, but could see no key of any kind.\nAs the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without grew louder and angrier; their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their blunt-clawed feet as they leaped, came in through the opening door. I knew then that to struggle at the moment against the Count was useless. With such allies as these at his command, I could do nothing. But still the door continued slowly to open, and only the Count’s body stood in the gap. Suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my doom; I was to be given to the wolves, and at my own instigation. There was a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the Count, and as a last chance I cried out:—\n“Shut the door; I shall wait till morning!” and covered my face with my hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment. With one sweep of his powerful arm, the Count threw the door shut, and the great bolts clanged and echoed through the hall as they shot back into their places.\nIn silence we returned to the library, and after a minute or two I went to my own room. The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his hand to me; with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile that Judas in hell might be proud of.\nWhen I was in my room and about to lie down, I thought I heard a whispering at my door. I went to it softly and listened. Unless my ears deceived me, I heard the voice of the Count:—\n“Back, back, to your own place! Your time is not yet come. Wait! Have patience! To-night is mine. To-morrow night is yours!” There was a low, sweet ripple of laughter, and in a rage I threw open the door, and saw without the three terrible women licking their lips. As I appeared they all joined in a horrible laugh, and ran away.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The entry for June 29th records that the Count provided further confirmation of the previous day's events, as I again saw him depart the castle through the same window, dressed in my clothes. He descended the wall like a lizard, and I longed for a gun or some deadly instrument to end his existence, but I suspected that no weapon created by human means alone could affect him. Afraid to witness his return and encounter those strange sisters, I didn't wait. Instead, I went back to the library and read until I fell asleep. I was woken by the Count, who stared at me with intense severity as he declared, 'My friend, we must part tomorrow. You will return to your beautiful England, while I attend to matters that may result in us never meeting again. Your letter home has been sent. I will not be here tomorrow, but everything for your journey will be prepared. In the morning, the Szgany, who have some tasks here, will arrive, as will some Slovaks. After they have left, my carriage will come for you and transport you to the Borgo Pass to catch the diligence traveling from Bukovina to Bistritz. However, I hope to see you again at Castle Dracula.' Feeling suspicious, I resolved to test his sincerity. Sincerity! It felt sacrilegious to use that word in reference to such a creature, so I asked him directly, 'Why can I not leave tonight?' He replied, 'Because, my dear sir, my coachman and horses are currently on a mission.' 'But I would gladly walk. I wish to leave immediately,' I insisted. He smiled a smile so soft, smooth, and wicked that I knew there was deceit behind his smooth words. He asked, 'And your luggage?' 'I am not concerned about it. I can arrange for it to be sent later,' I answered. The Count rose and, with a charming politeness that seemed so real it made me blink in disbelief, said, 'You English have a saying close to my heart, for its sentiment reflects the principle governing our boyars: 'Welcome the coming guest, speed the parting guest.' Come with me, my dear young friend. You shall not remain in my house against your will for even an hour, although I am sad at your departure and that you desire it so suddenly. Come!' With dignified seriousness, he led the way with a lamp, preceding me down the stairs and along the hall. He abruptly stopped. 'Listen!' he commanded. Close by, the howling of many wolves could be heard. It was as if the sound erupted when he raised his hand, much like the music of a great orchestra seems to surge forth under a conductor's baton. After a brief pause, he resumed his stately progress to the door, pulled back the heavy bolts, unhooked the thick chains, and began to open it. To my utter astonishment, I saw that it was unlocked. I looked around suspiciously but found no key anywhere. As the door started to open, the wolf howling outside grew louder and more savage; their red jaws with gnashing teeth and their blunt-clawed feet as they leaped became visible through the widening gap. I understood then that struggling against the Count at this moment was pointless. With such allies at his command, I was helpless. But the door continued its slow opening, with only the Count's body filling the space. Suddenly, the thought struck me that this might be the precise moment and method of my end; I was to be handed over to the wolves, brought about by my own request to leave immediately. The idea possessed a wickedness great enough for the Count, and as a final chance, I cried out, 'Close the door; I will wait until morning!' and covered my face with my hands to conceal my tears of bitter disappointment. With one powerful sweep of his arm, the Count slammed the door shut, and the heavy bolts clanged and echoed through the hall as they slid back into place. We returned to the library in silence, and after a minute or two, I went to my own room. The last I saw of Count Dracula was him blowing me a kiss, with a look of victorious malice in his eyes and a smile that would make Judas in hell feel pride. Once I was in my room and preparing to lie down, I thought I heard whispering at my door. I approached it quietly and listened. Unless my hearing was deceiving me, I heard the Count's voice saying, 'Go back, back to your assigned place! Your time has not yet arrived. Wait! Be patient! Tonight is mine. Tomorrow night is yours!' A low, sweet ripple of laughter followed, and in a fit of rage, I threw open the door and saw the three dreadful women outside, licking their lips. When I appeared, they all burst into a horrific laugh and ran away.",

Watching him crawl down the wall like a lizard, I wished I had a weapon to destroy him, but I doubt any normal weapon could harm him. I didn't stay to see him return because I was afraid of encountering the strange women. I retreated to the library and read until I fell asleep.\n\nI was then awoken by the Count, who looked very grim and said, \"Tomorrow we must part ways. You will go back to England, and I must see to business that may keep us from meeting again. Your letter has been sent; tomorrow, I will be gone, but everything you need for your journey will be ready. In the morning, the Szgany and some Slovaks will come for their own work, and after they leave, my carriage will take you to the Borgo Pass to meet the stagecoach to Bistritz. Still, I hope I will see you again at Castle Dracula.\" \n\nI was suspicious and wanted to test his honesty, though it seemed absurd to talk of sincerity in someone so monstrous. I asked directly why I could not leave tonight. He replied, \"My coachman and horses are out on an errand.\" I offered to leave on foot, eager to escape immediately. He smiled in a sly, unsettling way and asked what I would do about my luggage. I said I didn't care for it and could have it sent later.\n\nThe Count then rose and, with exaggerated politeness, said that he upheld the saying, \"Welcome the coming; speed the parting guest,\" assuring me I would not be kept against my will, though he regretted my sudden wish to depart. He invited me to follow him, leading the way with stately dignity. Suddenly, he paused and said, \"Listen!\" Nearby, the howls of many wolves filled the air, almost as if summoned by his gesture. After a moment, he proceeded to open the massive door, undoing the locks and chains.\n\nTo my surprise, the door was unlocked. I looked around but saw no key. As the door opened, the wolves’ howling grew even fiercer, their jaws snapping and claws scratching as they surged forward. I realized it was pointless to defy the Count when he had such dangerous allies. As the door slowly opened, only he stood in the way, and I suspected he meant to let the wolves attack me. Horrified, I cried out to shut the door and said I would wait until morning, covering my face in despair. With a swift motion, the Count slammed the door shut, the bolts echoing loudly.\n\nIn silence, we returned to the library. After a brief time, I went to my room. The last thing I saw was Count Dracula blowing me a kiss, his triumphant eyes glowing and his smile sinister.\n\nIn my room, as I prepared for bed, I thought I heard whispering at my door. Listening carefully, I thought I heard the Count say, \"Go back, it is not your time yet. Wait! Be patient! Tonight belongs to me. Tomorrow night is yours!\" This was followed by eerie, sweet laughter. Furious, I opened the door and saw the three dreadful women outside, licking their lips. When they saw me, they laughed horribly and ran away."

          "text_segment": "30 June, morning.—These may be the last words I ever write in this diary. I slept till just before the dawn, and when I woke threw myself on my knees, for I determined that if Death came he should find me ready.\nAt last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the morning had come. Then came the welcome cock-crow, and I felt that I was safe. With a glad heart, I opened my door and ran down to the hall. I had seen that the door was unlocked, and now escape was before me. With hands that trembled with eagerness, I unhooked the chains and drew back the massive bolts.\nBut the door would not move. Despair seized me. I pulled, and pulled, at the door, and shook it till, massive as it was, it rattled in its casement. I could see the bolt shot. It had been locked after I left the Count.\nThen a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk, and I determined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the Count’s room. He might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice of evils. Without a pause I rushed up to the east window, and scrambled down the wall, as before, into the Count’s room. It was empty, but that was as I expected. I could not see a key anywhere, but the heap of gold remained. I went through the door in the corner and down the winding stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel. I knew now well enough where to find the monster I sought.\nThe great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the lid was laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in their places to be hammered home. I knew I must reach the body for the key, so I raised the lid, and laid it back against the wall; and then I saw something which filled my very soul with horror. There lay the Count, but looking as if his youth had been half renewed, for the white hair and moustache were changed to dark iron-grey; the cheeks were fuller, and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the mouth was redder than ever, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck. Even the deep, burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches underneath were bloated. It seemed as if the whole awful creature were simply gorged with blood. He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his repletion. I shuddered as I bent over to touch him, and every sense in me revolted at the contact; but I had to search, or I was lost. The coming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those horrid three. I felt all over the body, but no sign could I find of the key. Then I stopped and looked at the Count. There was a mocking smile on the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad. This was the being I was helping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for centuries to come he might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, and create a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the helpless. The very thought drove me mad. A terrible desire came upon me to rid the world of such a monster. There was no lethal weapon at hand, but I seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the cases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the hateful face. But as I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell full upon me, with all their blaze of basilisk horror. The sight seemed to paralyse me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face, merely making a deep gash above the forehead. The shovel fell from my hand across the box, and as I pulled it away the flange of the blade caught the edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid thing from my sight. The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face, blood-stained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its own in the nethermost hell.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Morning of June 30th. I believe this could be the final entry in my journal. I slept until just before dawn and immediately knelt upon waking, resolved to face death prepared should it come. I sensed the subtle shift in the atmosphere that signalled morning's arrival. Then came the comforting sound of a cock crowing, and I felt momentarily safe. With a sense of relief, I hurried to the main hall door, having noticed earlier that it was unlocked, seeing escape as a possibility. My hands shook with urgency as I released the chains and pulled back the heavy bolts. However, the door remained stuck. A wave of despair washed over me. I yanked and yanked at the door, shaking it violently until, despite its weight, it rattled within its frame. I could see the bolt was engaged. It must have been locked after the Count left. A desperate urge to get that key, no matter the risk, seized me, and I decided then to climb back up the wall to the Count's room. He might kill me, but at that moment, death seemed a better option than staying trapped. Without hesitation, I raced back to the east window and clambered down the wall into the Count's room, just as I had before. It was empty, which I had anticipated. I couldn't find the key anywhere, though the pile of gold was still there. I went through the door in the corner, down the winding staircase, and along the dark corridor to the old chapel. By now, I knew precisely where to find the monstrous creature I was searching for. The large chest was still in its place against the wall, but the lid was merely resting on top, not secured, although the nails were positioned, ready to be hammered in. Knowing I had to get the key from the body, I lifted the lid and leaned it back against the wall. What I saw then filled my very soul with absolute horror. The Count lay there, but his appearance was dramatically altered, looking as if his youth had been half restored; his previously white hair and moustache were now dark iron-grey, his cheeks were plumper, and his pale skin seemed to glow with a deep ruby-red colour beneath the surface. His mouth was bloodier than ever, with drops of fresh blood clinging to his lips and trickling down from the corners onto his chin and neck. Even his deep, intense eyes seemed nestled within swollen flesh, as his eyelids and the bags beneath them were puffy. It was as if the entire terrifying being had simply engorged itself on blood. He lay there like a repulsive leech, utterly sated from his feeding. I recoiled as I leaned over to touch him, every part of me revolting against the contact, but I had to search, or I was doomed. The coming night could see my own body become a feast like those horrifying three. I searched all over his body, but found no sign of the key. Then I paused and looked at the Count's face. A mocking smile was fixed on his bloated features, a look that seemed to drive me insane. This was the being I was helping to relocate to London, where, potentially for centuries, amidst its dense population, he could satisfy his craving for blood and create an expanding network of lesser demons to feed on the helpless. The very thought pushed me to the brink of madness. An intense desire to rid the world of such a creature overwhelmed me. There was no suitable weapon nearby, but I grabbed a shovel the workmen had used for filling the boxes. Lifting it high, I brought its sharp edge down towards the loathsome face. However, as I did so, his head turned, and his eyes fixed on mine with the full terrifying blaze of a basilisk. The sight seemed to freeze me, and the shovel twisted in my hand, glancing off his face instead of striking cleanly, merely leaving a deep cut above his forehead. The shovel fell from my hand across the box, and as I instinctively pulled it away, the edge of the blade caught the lid, pulling it back over and hiding the dreadful sight from view. The last thing I saw was the swollen, blood-streaked face locked in a grin of pure malice that would have been at home in the deepest pits of hell.",

I slept until just before sunrise and, upon waking, fell to my knees, determined that I would be ready to meet death if it came for me. Eventually, I sensed the subtle shift in the air signaling morning's arrival, and the sound of a rooster crowing reassured me of my safety. Overjoyed, I opened my door and hurried to the hall, having noticed the door was unlocked and seeing my chance to escape. My hands trembled with excitement as I unlatched the chains and drew back the heavy bolts. But the door refused to budge. Panic engulfed me as I tugged and shook it, making it rattle in its frame. I realized that the bolt was secured—the door had been locked after the Count and I parted ways. Driven by desperation to retrieve the key at any cost, I resolved to scale the wall again and try to enter the Count’s room, even at the risk of my life, for death now seemed preferable to my predicament. Without hesitation, I hurried to the eastern window, climbed down the wall into the Count’s room as I had before. The room was empty, just as I expected, and although I saw no key, the pile of gold was still there. I slipped through the corner door, descended the winding staircase and walked down the dark passage to the old chapel—I now knew where to find the monster I sought. The large box was in its place by the wall, its lid set loosely on top, with the nails ready to be hammered in. Knowing I needed to search the body for the key, I opened the lid and set it aside. What I saw filled me with utter horror: the Count was lying there, seemingly restored to partial youth—his white hair and mustache now dark-grey, his cheeks fuller, his pale skin flushed beneath with red, and his lips vermillion with fresh blood that dripped from his mouth and stained his chin and neck. His fierce, sunken eyes were buried in swollen flesh. The whole revolting figure looked engorged on blood, lying like a sated leech. I shuddered as I forced myself to touch him, overcome by disgust, but I had to search or be lost, lest I myself become a victim like the three wretched women. I searched the body but found no key. When I stopped and looked at the Count, his swollen face wore a mocking smile that nearly drove me insane. This was the creature I was aiding in his move to London, where he could spend centuries preying on the city’s millions, creating a growing circle of fiends. The thought enraged me. Overcome with the urge to destroy this monster, I grabbed a shovel left by the workmen and struck at his face with all my might. As I swung, the Count turned his head and his blazing eyes met mine, paralyzing me with terror. The shovel glanced off, only gouging a deep wound high on his forehead. The shovel fell across the box, and as I pulled it away, it caught the lid and closed it, hiding the dreadful sight. My last view was of that bloated, blood-stained face, twisted in a demonic smile worthy of hell itself."

As I waited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming closer, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the cracking of whips; the Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count had spoken were coming. With a last look around and at the box which contained the vile body, I ran from the place and gained the Count’s room, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened. With strained ears, I listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of the key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door. There must have been some other means of entry, or some one had a key for one of the locked doors. Then there came the sound of many feet tramping and dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo. I turned to run down again towards the vault, where I might find the new entrance; but at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, and the door to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from the lintels flying. When I ran to push it open, I found that it was hopelessly fast. I was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was closing round me more closely.\nAs I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet and the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes, with their freight of earth.

Faugh! Mina is a woman, and there is nought in common. They are devils of the Pit!\nI shall not remain alone with them; I shall try to scale the castle wall farther than I have yet attempted.

During this wait, I heard the distant sound of happy voices singing a Roma song, getting closer, accompanied by the rumble of heavy wagon wheels and the sharp crack of whips. The Szgany and Slovaks the Count had mentioned were arriving. After a final glance around and at the chest holding the repulsive body, I fled the scene and hurried to the Count's room, resolved to bolt the moment the door was opened. Listening intently, I heard the key grinding in the large lock downstairs and the heavy door swinging inward. There must have been another way in, or someone possessed a key for one of the secured doors. Then came the sound of many feet shuffling, their noise fading down a corridor, creating a metallic echo. I started to rush back towards the crypt, where I might find the new entrance; but suddenly, a strong gust of wind seemed to blow the door to the spiral staircase shut with such force that it dislodged dust from the frame. When I tried to push it open, I found it was firmly stuck. I was a prisoner once more, and the snare of fate felt like it was tightening around me. As I write this, I hear the sound of numerous feet shuffling in the passage below, followed by the thud of heavy items being put down – no doubt the boxes, filled with their cargo of earth.

I am alone in the castle with those terrifying women. Disgusting! Mina is a woman, and there is absolutely no similarity. They are demons from hell! I will not remain here with them; I will attempt to climb the castle wall further than I have tried before. I will take some gold with me, in case I need it later.

I am longing to be with you, and by the sea, where we can talk together freely and build our castles in the air. I have been working very hard lately, because I want to keep up with Jonathan’s studies, and I have been practising shorthand very assiduously. When we are married I shall be able to be useful to Jonathan, and if I can stenograph well enough I can take down what he wants to say in this way and write it out for him on the typewriter, at which also I am practising very hard. He and I sometimes write letters in shorthand, and he is keeping a stenographic journal of his travels abroad. When I am with you I shall keep a diary in the same way. I don’t mean one of those two-pages-to-the-week-with-Sunday-squeezed-in-a-corner diaries, but a sort of journal which I can write in whenever I feel inclined. I do not suppose there will be much of interest to other people; but it is not intended for them. I may show it to Jonathan some day if there is in it anything worth sharing, but it is really an exercise book. I shall try to do what I see lady journalists do: interviewing and writing descriptions and trying to remember conversations. I am told that, with a little practice, one can remember all that goes on or that one hears said during a day. However, we shall see. I will tell you of my little plans when we meet. I have just had a few hurried lines from Jonathan from Transylvania. He is well, and will be returning in about a week. I am longing to hear all his news. It must be so nice to see strange countries. I wonder if we—I mean Jonathan and I—shall ever see them together. There is the ten o’clock bell ringing. Good-bye.\n“Your loving\n“Mina.\n“Tell me all the news when you write.

I've been dedicating a lot of effort to my studies recently, as I want to stay current with Jonathan's academic pursuits, and I've been diligently practicing shorthand. Once we are married, I hope to be an asset to Jonathan, and if I can master stenography, I can transcribe what he wishes to express in this manner and type it out for him. I'm also working hard on my typing skills. Sometimes, he and I exchange letters written in shorthand, and he is currently maintaining a shorthand journal of his trip abroad. I plan to keep a similar diary when I'm with you. By 'diary,' I don't mean one of those limited notebooks with just two pages per week and Sunday crammed into a corner, but rather a journal where I can write whenever the mood strikes me. I doubt much of it will interest others, but it's not meant for them. I might share it with Jonathan someday if there's anything in it worth reading, but primarily, it's for practice. I intend to try skills I see female journalists use: conducting interviews, writing descriptions, and attempting to recall conversations. I've heard that with some effort, one can learn to remember everything that happens or is said throughout a day. However, we shall see. I will share my little plans with you when we meet.

Recently, I’ve been working extra hard because I want to keep up with Jonathan's studies, and I’ve been diligently practicing shorthand. Once Jonathan and I are married, I hope these skills will allow me to help him—I’m also practicing typing so I can transcribe whatever he dictates through shorthand. Sometimes, we even correspond in shorthand, and he keeps a shorthand journal of his travels abroad. When I’m with you, I plan to keep my own diary this way—not the usual brief sort, but a journal I can write in whenever I like. It probably won’t interest anyone else, but that’s not the purpose. I might share it with Jonathan if there’s something worthwhile, but mainly, it’s for practice. I want to imitate female journalists: conducting interviews, writing vivid descriptions, and remembering conversations. I’ve heard that, with practice, it’s possible to recall everything you see and hear in a day. We’ll find out if that’s true. I’ll tell you my little plans when we meet. I just received a brief note from Jonathan in Transylvania—he’s well, and will be back in about a week. I can’t wait to hear his news. Traveling to foreign lands sounds so exciting! Maybe someday Jonathan and I will go exploring together. Oh, there’s the ten o’clock bell tolling. Goodbye for now.\n\nYour loving friend,\n\nMina\n\nPlease tell me all your news in your next letter. You haven’t written much lately. I’ve heard whispers—especially about a tall, handsome, curly-haired gentleman???"

I wrote to you twice since we parted, and your last letter was only your second. Besides, I have nothing to tell you. There is really nothing to interest you. Town is very pleasant just now, and we go a good deal to picture-galleries and for walks and rides in the park. As to the tall, curly-haired man, I suppose it was the one who was with me at the last Pop. Some one has evidently been telling tales. That was Mr. Holmwood. He often comes to see us, and he and mamma get on very well together; they have so many things to talk about in common. We met some time ago a man that would just do for you, if you were not already engaged to Jonathan. He is an excellent parti, being handsome, well off, and of good birth. He is a doctor and really clever. Just fancy! He is only nine-and-twenty, and he has an immense lunatic asylum all under his own care. Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me, and he called here to see us, and often comes now. I think he is one of the most resolute men I ever saw, and yet the most calm. He seems absolutely imperturbable. I can fancy what a wonderful power he must have over his patients. He has a curious habit of looking one straight in the face, as if trying to read one’s thoughts. He tries this on very much with me, but I flatter myself he has got a tough nut to crack. I know that from my glass. Do you ever try to read your own face? I do, and I can tell you it is not a bad study, and gives you more trouble than you can well fancy if you have never tried it. He says that I afford him a curious psychological study, and I humbly think I do. I do not, as you know, take sufficient interest in dress to be able to describe the new fashions. Dress is a bore. That is slang again, but never mind; Arthur says that every day. There, it is all out. Mina, we have told all our secrets to each other since we were children; we have slept together and eaten together, and laughed and cried together; and now, though I have spoken, I would like to speak more. Oh, Mina, couldn’t you guess? I love him. I am blushing as I write, for although I think he loves me, he has not told me so in words. But oh, Mina, I love him; I love him; I love him! There, that does me good. I wish I were with you, dear, sitting by the fire undressing, as we used to sit; and I would try to tell you what I feel. I do not know how I am writing this even to you. I am afraid to stop, or I should tear up the letter, and I don’t want to stop, for I do so want to tell you all. Let me hear from you at once, and tell me all that you think about it. Mina, I must stop. Good-night. Bless me in your prayers; and, Mina, pray for my happiness.\n\n“LUCY.\n“P.S.—I need not tell you this is a secret. Good-night again.\n\n“L.",

My dearest Mina, you're being quite unfair suggesting I'm a poor correspondent; I've written twice since we saw each other, and your last was only your second letter. Honestly, I don't have much news that would excite you. Town is delightful right now; we've been enjoying picture galleries, walks, and rides in the park. Regarding the tall, curly-haired man you mentioned, I assume you mean the one who was with me at the last Pop concert. Someone must have been talking! That was Mr. Holmwood. He visits us often, and he and Mama get along splendidly, finding much common ground to discuss. We recently met someone who would be absolutely perfect for you, were you not already promised to Jonathan. He's an excellent prospect: handsome, wealthy, from a good family, a very clever doctor, and remarkably, at just twenty-nine, he oversees a massive lunatic asylum entirely on his own. Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me, he came to visit, and now he's a regular visitor. I find him to be one of the most determined yet simultaneously calm men I've ever encountered; he seems completely unshakable. I can only imagine the profound influence he must wield over his patients. He has this peculiar habit of staring directly into your eyes, as if attempting to decipher your thoughts. He certainly directs this intense gaze my way often, but I like to think I present a bit of a challenge for him. I know this from observing my own reflection. Do you ever study your own face in a mirror? I do, and it's surprisingly insightful and more complex than you'd imagine if you've never tried it. He says I'm a fascinating psychological study for him, and I modestly agree. As you know, I don't pay enough attention to fashion to describe the latest styles; frankly, clothes bore me. That's slang again, but never mind, Arthur uses it daily. Okay, it's all out now. Mina, we've shared every secret since childhood, sleeping, eating, laughing, and crying together. And now, though I've said it, I feel the need to express it even more intensely. Oh, Mina, could you possibly have guessed? I'm in love with him. I'm blushing as I write this, because even though I believe he loves me, he hasn't articulated it yet. But oh, Mina, I love him, I love him, I love him! Writing that feels so good. I wish you were here with me, dear, by the fire, settling down, just like we used to. I could try to convey what I feel then. I'm not even sure how I'm managing to write this to you. I'm scared to stop, or I'd tear this up, but I also don't want to stop because I desperately want to tell you everything. Please write back immediately and tell me exactly what you think. Mina, I must finish now. Good-night. Please remember me in your prayers; and Mina, pray for my happiness. LUCY. P.S.—This must be kept a secret, of course. Good-night once more. L.",

London is pleasant at the moment; we’ve been spending time in art galleries, going for walks, and riding in the park.

He’s a great catch: good-looking, wealthy, well-bred, and a doctor who is very smart. Can you imagine? At just twenty-nine, he manages a huge mental hospital by himself! Mr. Holmwood introduced him, and now he visits us often. He’s among the most determined—yet most composed—men I’ve met, never seems to get flustered. I can see why he’d have such influence over his patients. He has this intense habit of looking directly into your eyes, as though he’s trying to read your thoughts. He does it often with me, but I flatter myself he finds me hard to read—I can tell from looking in the mirror! Do you ever try studying your own face?

It was so nice to be able to tell you and to have your sympathy.\n\n“My dear, it never rains but it pours. How true the old proverbs are. Here am I, who shall be twenty in September, and yet I never had a proposal till to-day, not a real proposal, and to-day I have had three. Just fancy! THREE proposals in one day! Isn’t it awful! I feel sorry, really and truly sorry, for two of the poor fellows. Oh, Mina, I am so happy that I don’t know what to do with myself. And three proposals! But, for goodness’ sake, don’t tell any of the girls, or they would be getting all sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining themselves injured and slighted if in their very first day at home they did not get six at least. Some girls are so vain! You and I, Mina dear, who are engaged and are going to settle down soon soberly into old married women, can despise vanity. Well, I must tell you about the three, but you must keep it a secret, dear, from every one, except, of course, Jonathan. You will tell him, because I would, if I were in your place, certainly tell Arthur. A woman ought to tell her husband everything—don’t you think so, dear?—and I must be fair. Men like women, certainly their wives, to be quite as fair as they are; and women, I am afraid, are not always quite as fair as they should be. Well, my dear, number One came just before lunch. I told you of him, Dr. John Seward, the lunatic-asylum man, with the strong jaw and the good forehead. He was very cool outwardly, but was nervous all the same. He had evidently been schooling himself as to all sorts of little things, and remembered them; but he almost managed to sit down on his silk hat, which men don’t generally do when they are cool, and then when he wanted to appear at ease he kept playing with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream. He spoke to me, Mina, very straightforwardly. He told me how dear I was to him, though he had known me so little, and what his life would be with me to help and cheer him. He was going to tell me how unhappy he would be if I did not care for him, but when he saw me cry he said that he was a brute and would not add to my present trouble. Then he broke off and asked if I could love him in time; and when I shook my head his hands trembled, and then with some hesitation he asked me if I cared already for any one else. He put it very nicely, saying that he did not want to wring my confidence from me, but only to know, because if a woman’s heart was free a man might have hope. And then, Mina, I felt a sort of duty to tell him that there was some one. I only told him that much, and then he stood up, and he looked very strong and very grave as he took both my hands in his and said he hoped I would be happy, and that if I ever wanted a friend I must count him one of my best. Oh, Mina dear, I can’t help crying: and you must excuse this letter being all blotted. Being proposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing, but it isn’t at all a happy thing when you have to see a poor fellow, whom you know loves you honestly, going away and looking all broken-hearted, and to know that, no matter what he may say at the moment, you are passing quite out of his life. My dear, I must stop here at present, I feel so miserable, though I am so happy.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "May 24th.\n\nMy dearest Mina,\n\nThank you so very much for your lovely letter. It meant a great deal to me to share with you and receive your understanding.\n\nOh, my dear, it's just like the saying goes, misfortunes (or, in this case, perhaps overwhelming good fortune!) never come singly. Old proverbs really hold true. Imagine, I'll be twenty this September, and until today, I had never received a single proper marriage proposal. But today, I got three! Can you believe it? THREE proposals in just one day! It's truly astonishing! I honestly feel quite sorry for two of the poor men. Oh, Mina, I am so incredibly happy I hardly know what to do with myself! Three proposals! But please, for heaven's sake, don't tell any of the other girls. They'd get all sorts of exaggerated notions and feel hurt or neglected if they didn't receive at least half a dozen proposals on their first day home. Some girls are just so conceited! You and I, dear Mina, are already engaged and are looking forward to settling down into sensible married life soon, so we can afford to look down on such vanity. Anyway, I must tell you about the three men, but you must keep this information strictly confidential from everyone, dear, except, of course, Jonathan. You should absolutely tell him because, if I were in your position, I would certainly tell Arthur (you know, a woman should share everything with her husband, don't you agree?). I need to be fair. Men, especially husbands, like their wives to be as honest as they are, and I'm afraid women aren't always as honest as they ought to be. Well, my dear, the first proposal arrived just before lunchtime. I've mentioned him to you before, Dr. John Seward, the gentleman from the lunatic asylum with the strong jaw and intelligent forehead. He tried very hard to appear composed on the outside, but he was visibly nervous beneath the surface. He had clearly practiced remembering all the little things, but he nearly sat on his silk hat – which isn't something you'd expect from someone calm – and then, trying to seem relaxed, he started fiddling with a lancet in a way that made me almost scream. He spoke to me, Mina, very directly. He told me how much I meant to him, even though he'd known me for such a short time, and how wonderful his life would be with me there to support and encourage him. He was about to tell me how unhappy he would be if I didn't feel the same, but when he saw me crying, he called himself a 'brute' and said he wouldn't add to my distress. Then he stopped and asked if there was a chance I could learn to love him later; when I shook my head, his hands started to tremble. With some hesitation, he then asked if my heart was already taken. He phrased it very gently, saying he didn't want to force my confidence, but only needed to know because if a woman's heart is free, a man can hold onto hope. And then, Mina, I felt it was my duty to tell him that there was someone. I only told him that much. He then stood up, looking very serious and strong, and taking both my hands in his, he said he sincerely hoped I would be happy and that if I ever needed a friend, I should consider him one of my very best. Oh, dear Mina, I can't help but cry as I write this, so you must forgive the smudges on the letter. Getting proposed to is lovely in theory, but it's truly not a happy experience when you have to watch a kind soul, who you know loves you genuinely, leave with a broken heart, knowing that no matter what he might say now, you are completely leaving his life behind. My dear, I have to stop writing about it now. I feel so wretched, even though I am so happy overall.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "May 24th.\n\nMy dearest Mina,\n\nThank you so much for your kind letter. It meant a great deal to me to be able to confide in you and to receive your comfort.\n\nThey say when it rains, it pours, and that certainly feels true today! Imagine—I'm almost twenty, and until now, I've never had a real marriage proposal. Today, though, I received three! Can you believe it? Three in one day! It's almost overwhelming, and to be honest, I genuinely feel sorry for two of the men. Mina, I'm so happy that I can hardly contain myself. But three proposals! Please, please don't mention this to any of the other girls—if they heard, they'd surely develop wild expectations and think themselves wronged if they didn't receive half a dozen proposals their first day home. You know how vain some girls can be. But you and I, Mina, since we're both engaged and soon to settle into the respectable lives of married women, can rise above such vanity. I must tell you all about these proposals, but, dearest, you must keep this between us—though of course, feel free to tell Jonathan. I'd do the same with Arthur if our positions were reversed. A woman should tell her husband everything, don't you agree? Men expect fairness from their wives, though I'm afraid women aren't always as fair as they should be.\n\nAnyway, my first proposer came just before lunch—Dr. John Seward, you know, the asylum doctor with the strong jaw and good forehead. Outwardly he seemed calm, though he was clearly anxious. I could tell he was trying to remember all the little things he'd prepared to say, but he was so nervous he almost sat on his silk hat! And when he tried to seem relaxed, he fiddled with his lancet until I thought I might scream. He was very direct, Mina. He explained how dear I was to him, even though we haven’t known each other long, and how much happier his life would be if I were by his side. He started to explain how sad he would be if I couldn't love him, but when he saw I was upset, he stopped and said he couldn’t add to my troubles. Then, a bit hesitantly, he asked if, with time, I could care for him; when I shook my head, his hands trembled, and then he gently asked if I already loved someone else. He was very considerate and said he didn’t want to force my confidence, only to know whether there was hope if my heart was still free. So, Mina, I felt it was right to admit there was someone. I didn't say more than that. He stood up, looking so strong and serious, took my hands, and told me he hoped I’d be happy, and that I should always consider him a friend if ever I needed one.\n\nOh, Mina, I can’t help crying as I write this, so please excuse any blotches on this letter. Being proposed to may sound lovely, but it’s terribly sad to watch someone who truly loves you walk away, heartbroken, knowing you’re leaving his life forever. I have to stop for now, dear, as I feel both happy and miserable at the same time."

I sympathise with poor Desdemona when she had such a dangerous stream poured in her ear, even by a black man. I suppose that we women are such cowards that we think a man will save us from fears, and we marry him. I know now what I would do if I were a man and wanted to make a girl love me. No, I don’t, for there was Mr. Morris telling us his stories, and Arthur never told any, and yet—— My dear, I am somewhat previous. Mr. Quincey P. Morris found me alone. It seems that a man always does find a girl alone. No, he doesn’t, for Arthur tried twice to make a chance, and I helping him all I could; I am not ashamed to say it now. I must tell you beforehand that Mr. Morris doesn’t always speak slang—that is to say, he never does so to strangers or before them, for he is really well educated and has exquisite manners—but he found out that it amused me to hear him talk American slang, and whenever I was present, and there was no one to be shocked, he said such funny things. I am afraid, my dear, he has to invent it all, for it fits exactly into whatever else he has to say. But this is a way slang has. I do not know myself if I shall ever speak slang; I do not know if Arthur likes it, as I have never heard him use any as yet. Well, Mr. Morris sat down beside me and looked as happy and jolly as he could, but I could see all the same that he was very nervous. He took my hand in his, and said ever so sweetly:—\n“‘Miss Lucy, I know I ain’t good enough to regulate the fixin’s of your little shoes, but I guess if you wait till you find a man that is you will go join them seven young women with the lamps when you quit. Won’t you just hitch up alongside of me and let us go down the long road together, driving in double harness?’\n“Well, he did look so good-humoured and so jolly that it didn’t seem half so hard to refuse him as it did poor Dr. Seward; so I said, as lightly as I could, that I did not know anything of hitching, and that I wasn’t broken to harness at all yet. Then he said that he had spoken in a light manner, and he hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing so on so grave, so momentous, an occasion for him, I would forgive him. He really did look serious when he was saying it, and I couldn’t help feeling a bit serious too—I know, Mina, you will think me a horrid flirt—though I couldn’t help feeling a sort of exultation that he was number two in one day. And then, my dear, before I could say a word he began pouring out a perfect torrent of love-making, laying his very heart and soul at my feet. He looked so earnest over it that I shall never again think that a man must be playful always, and never earnest, because he is merry at times. I suppose he saw something in my face which checked him, for he suddenly stopped, and said with a sort of manly fervour that I could have loved him for if I had been free:—\n“‘Lucy, you are an honest-hearted girl, I know. I should not be here speaking to you as I am now if I did not believe you clean grit, right through to the very depths of your soul. Tell me, like one good fellow to another, is there any one else that you care for? And if there is I’ll never trouble you a hair’s breadth again, but will be, if you will let me, a very faithful friend.’\n“My dear Mina, why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy of them? Here was I almost making fun of this great-hearted, true gentleman. I burst into tears—I am afraid, my dear, you will think this a very sloppy letter in more ways than one—and I really felt very badly. Why can’t they let a girl marry three men, or as many as want her, and save all this trouble? But this is heresy, and I must not say it. I am glad to say that, though I was crying, I was able to look into Mr. Morris’s brave eyes, and I told him out straight:—\n“‘Yes, there is some one I love, though he has not told me yet that he even loves me.’ I was right to speak to him so frankly, for quite a light came into his face, and he put out both his hands and took mine—I think I put them into his—and said in a hearty way:—\n“‘That’s my brave girl. It’s better worth being late for a chance of winning you than being in time for any other girl in the world. Don’t cry, my dear. If it’s for me, I’m a hard nut to crack; and I take it standing up. If that other fellow doesn’t know his happiness, well, he’d better look for it soon, or he’ll have to deal with me. Little girl, your honesty and pluck have made me a friend, and that’s rarer than a lover; it’s more unselfish anyhow. My dear, I’m going to have a pretty lonely walk between this and Kingdom Come. Won’t you give me one kiss? It’ll be something to keep off the darkness now and then. You can, you know, if you like, for that other good fellow—he must be a good fellow, my dear, and a fine fellow, or you could not love him—hasn’t spoken yet.’ That quite won me, Mina, for it was brave and sweet of him, and noble, too, to a rival—wasn’t it?—and he so sad; so I leant over and kissed him. He stood up with my two hands in his, and as he looked down into my face—I am afraid I was blushing very much—he said:—\n“‘Little girl, I hold your hand, and you’ve kissed me, and if these things don’t make us friends nothing ever will. Thank you for your sweet honesty to me, and good-bye.’ He wrung my hand, and taking up his hat, went straight out of the room without looking back, without a tear or a quiver or a pause; and I am crying like a baby. Oh, why must a man like that be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who would worship the very ground he trod on? I know I would if I were free—only I don’t want to be free. My dear, this quite upset me, and I feel I cannot write of happiness just at once, after telling you of it; and I don’t wish to tell of the number three until it can be all happy.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Evening has arrived. Arthur just departed, and I feel much more cheerful now than when I paused my writing earlier today. So, I can continue describing the day's events. Well, my dearest, my second caller arrived after lunch. He is such a kind soul, an American hailing from Texas. He possesses such a youthful and fresh appearance that it seems improbable he has visited so many places and experienced such remarkable adventures. I can certainly empathize with poor Desdemona when she had such a dangerous narrative poured into her ear, even by a man of colour. I suppose we women are inherently timid, believing a man will rescue us from our fears, leading us to marry them. I now understand how I would approach winning a girl's affection if I were a man. Although, perhaps I don't, because Mr. Morris was sharing his tales, and Arthur never shared any, and yet... Oh, my dear, I'm getting ahead of myself. Mr. Quincey P. Morris found me alone. It seems men always manage to find a girl by herself. Except, that's not entirely true, as Arthur attempted twice to create an opportunity, and I did everything I could to assist him; I'm not ashamed to admit that now. I should mention upfront that Mr. Morris doesn't consistently use slang – in fact, he never does so with or in front of strangers, as he is genuinely well-educated and possesses exquisite manners. However, he discovered that hearing him speak American slang amused me, and whenever I was present and there was no one to be potentially offended, he would say the most amusing things. I suspect, my dear, he has to invent it all on the spot, as it always seems to fit perfectly with whatever else he is saying. But then again, that's often the nature of slang. I'm not sure myself if I'll ever adopt slang; I don't know if Arthur even likes it, as I haven't heard him use any thus far. Anyway, Mr. Morris sat down beside me and looked as happy and jovial as possible, but I could tell, nonetheless, that he was quite nervous. He took my hand in his and said most sweetly: 'Miss Lucy, I know I ain't good enough to regulate the fixin's of your little shoes, but I guess if you wait till you find a man that is you will go join them seven young women with the lamps when you quit. Won't you just hitch up alongside of me and let us go down the long road together, driving in double harness?' Well, he did look so good-natured and cheerful that refusing him didn't feel nearly as difficult as refusing poor Dr. Seward. So, I replied as lightly as I could that I knew nothing about 'hitching' and hadn't been 'broken to harness' at all yet. Then he said he had spoken in a light-hearted manner and hoped that if he had erred in doing so on such a serious, such a momentous occasion for him, I would forgive him. He truly looked serious as he said this, and I couldn't help but feel a little serious too – I know, Mina, you'll likely think me a terrible flirt – although I couldn't help feeling a kind of triumph that he was the second proposer of the day. And then, my dear, before I could utter a word, he began pouring out a veritable flood of declarations of love, laying his very heart and soul at my feet. He looked so utterly earnest about it that I will never again believe a man must always be playful and never serious just because he is sometimes merry. I assume he saw something in my expression that stopped him, for he abruptly ceased speaking and said with a kind of manly passion that I could have loved him for if I were free: 'Lucy, you are a girl with an honest heart, I know. I wouldn't be here speaking to you as I am now if I didn't believe you were pure grit, straight through to the very core of your being. Tell me, just between two good people, is there someone else you care for? And if there is, I will never trouble you a hair's breadth again, but will remain, if you permit me, a truly faithful friend.' My dear Mina, why are men so honourable when we women are so much less deserving of them? Here I was, practically making light of this noble-hearted, true gentleman. I burst into tears – I fear, my dear, you will find this a rather messy letter in multiple ways – and I genuinely felt dreadful. Why can't they simply let a girl marry three men, or however many desire her, and avoid all this distress? But that is heretical, and I must not say it. I am relieved to say that, despite my tears, I was able to look into Mr. Morris's brave eyes and tell him plainly: 'Yes, there is someone I love, although he hasn't yet told me that he even loves me.' I was right to speak to him so openly, for a definite brightness came into his face, and he extended both hands and took mine – I believe I placed them into his – and said in a warm tone: 'That's my brave girl. It's better to be late for a chance of winning you than to be on time for any other girl in the world. Don't cry, my dear. If it's because of me, I'm a tough nut to crack; and I handle it standing up. If that other fellow isn't aware of his good fortune, well, he'd best figure it out soon, or he'll have me to contend with. Little girl, your honesty and courage have earned you a friend in me, and that's more uncommon than a lover; it's certainly more selfless. My dear, I anticipate a rather solitary journey between now and the great beyond. Won't you give me one kiss? It will be something to occasionally fend off the loneliness. You can, you know, if you wish, because that other good fellow – he must be a good fellow, my dear, and a fine one, or you couldn't love him – hasn't spoken yet.' That completely won me over, Mina, because it was brave and kind of him, and noble as well, especially towards a rival – wasn't it? – and he was so sad. So, I leaned over and kissed him. He stood up with my two hands still in his, and as he gazed down into my face – I suspect I was blushing profusely – he said: 'Little girl, I hold your hand, and you've kissed me, and if these things don't make us friends, nothing ever will. Thank you for your sweet honesty towards me, and goodbye.' He clasped my hand firmly, picked up his hat, and walked straight out of the room without looking back, without a tear, a tremor, or a pause; and I am here, crying like a baby. Oh, why must a man like that be made unhappy when there are so many girls who would worship the very ground he walks on? I know I would if I were free – only, I don't want to be free. My dear, this experience has quite unsettled me, and I feel I cannot write about happiness immediately after recounting this; and I don't wish to describe the third proposal until I can do so with complete joy.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Evening.\nArthur has just left, and I feel cheerier than when I last stopped writing, so I can continue telling you about the day. After lunch, the second suitor arrived. He’s an American from Texas, very pleasant and surprisingly youthful-looking considering his adventures. Hearing his stories, I can relate to Desdemona being swayed by an intriguing man—I guess we women seek security in men and marry them for it. If I were a man wanting a woman to love me, I’d know what to do now—although, honestly, I’m not sure, since Mr. Morris told us stories, but Arthur didn’t, yet... I’m getting ahead of myself.\n\nMr. Quincey P. Morris found me alone. It seems men always manage to find a girl alone (although Arthur had trouble, even with my help—I can admit that now). I should explain: Mr. Morris, despite being very well-educated and polite, speaks American slang for my amusement when we’re alone. I suspect he makes up some of it to fit the moment, but that’s the nature of slang. I don’t know if I’ll ever use it, or if Arthur likes it since he never does.\n\nAnyway, Mr. Morris sat down, cheerful as ever, though I sensed he was nervous. He took my hand and, very sweetly, confessed he wasn’t worthy of me, but hoped I’d consider going through life with him. He phrased it in a folksy way, and because he was so amiable, it was easier to refuse him than it had been with poor Dr. Seward. I joked that I didn’t know anything about “hitching,” and wasn’t trained for it yet. He then apologized for being lighthearted about something so serious, looking quite grave himself, which made me feel more serious, too.\n\nBefore I could say any more, he poured out a heartfelt declaration of love. He was so passionate, I realize now men can be both joyful and genuine. Then, seeing my reaction, he paused and earnestly asked if there was someone else I cared for. If so, he promised not to bother me again and to remain a devoted friend if I allowed.\n\nDear Mina, why are men so noble and we women feel so undeserving? I almost felt bad for making light of his feelings—I burst into tears. It seems unfair a girl can’t marry more than one man who loves her, but I mustn’t say that! Even through tears, I managed to look him in the eyes and confess that I did love someone, though he hadn’t declared his love for me yet. Mr. Morris lit up, took my hands, and said that being late for a chance with me was better than being early with anyone else. He comforted me, saying he was tough and would manage, but warned the man I loved to act quickly or he’d have competition. He told me my honesty made him a true friend—rarer than a lover—and he would treasure a kiss to keep as a memory. Since the man I love hasn’t spoken, he said it would be all right.\n\nThat moved me, Mina; it was brave, sweet, and noble of him toward a rival. So I kissed him. He took my hands, thanked me for my honesty, and said goodbye. He left with dignity, yet here I am, in tears. Why must a good man like him be unhappy when there are so many women who would adore him? I would, if I were free—but I don’t want to be free. All this has left me too emotional to write happily now, so I’ll wait to tell you about the third suitor until I feel better."

There are more yarns to be told, and other wounds to be healed, and another health to be drunk. Won’t you let this be at my camp-fire to-morrow night? I have no hesitation in asking you, as I know a certain lady is engaged to a certain dinner-party, and that you are free. There will only be one other, our old pal at the Korea, Jack Seward. He’s coming, too, and we both want to mingle our weeps over the wine-cup, and to drink a health with all our hearts to the happiest man in all the wide world, who has won the noblest heart that God has made and the best worth winning. We promise you a hearty welcome, and a loving greeting, and a health as true as your own right hand. We shall both swear to leave you at home if you drink too deep to a certain pair of eyes. Come!",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "May 25th: I felt little desire to eat today and couldn't settle down, so I'm writing in my diary instead. Ever since being rejected yesterday, I've felt hollow, as though nothing in the world is important enough to bother with. Knowing that working is the only remedy for this state, I visited the patients. I chose one who has been a particularly fascinating subject of study. He is so eccentric that I am determined to understand him as thoroughly as possible. Today, I believe I came closer than ever before to unraveling his mystery. I questioned him more extensively than usual, aiming to fully grasp the details of his delusion. In hindsight, I realize my approach was somewhat cruel. I seemed intent on keeping him focused on his madness, which is something I typically avoid like the plague when dealing with patients. (A note to myself: Under what circumstances would I *not* avoid utter danger? Everything has a price in Rome. Even hell has a price! A word to the wise. If there's any deeper meaning behind this impulse, it would be valuable to analyze it precisely later, so I should start now.) R. M. Renfield, age 59. He has a lively disposition and considerable physical strength but is easily agitated and experiences periods of depression that lead to certain fixed obsessions that I cannot yet identify. I suspect his inherent nature and the unsettling influence he experiences combine to create a specific mental outcome; he is potentially dangerous, likely more so if he lacks selfishness. For self-centered individuals, caution protects their adversaries just as much as it protects themselves. My thought on this is that when one's self is the central focus, the inward pull is balanced by the outward push; however, when a sense of duty or a cause is the central focus, the outward push becomes dominant and is only counterbalanced by chance or a series of chance events. \\n\\nLetter from Quincey P. Morris to the Honourable Arthur Holmwood.\\n\\n“May 25th.\\n“Dear Art,\\n“We’ve shared stories around campfires on the plains, tended each other’s injuries after attempting landings at the Marquesas Islands, and toasted together on the shores of Lake Titicaca. There are more stories yet to be told, more wounds to heal, and another toast to be made. How about you let us do this at my place tomorrow evening? I feel no hesitation in asking because I know a certain lady has a dinner engagement and you are free. There will only be one other person, our old friend from the time in Korea, Jack Seward. He's coming, too, and we both want to share our feelings over a drink and wholeheartedly raise a glass to the happiest man in the whole world, who has won the noblest and most valuable heart God ever created.

After yesterday’s rejection, I feel empty and as though nothing is worthwhile. Knowing that work is the best remedy for such feelings, I went to see the patients, choosing one who has long fascinated me. His strangeness intrigues me, and today I feel closer than ever to understanding his secret. I questioned him more thoroughly than before to get to the bottom of his delusion, but in doing so I now realize I may have been too harsh—something I usually avoid with patients as one would avoid hell itself. (Note to self: under what circumstances would I not avoid hell? Everything has a price, even hell itself, so my curiosity may be worth examining carefully.)\n\nPatient: R. M. Renfield, age 59. Shows a lively, energetic personality; is physically powerful, easily excitable, and subject to periods of depression ending in an obsession I can't yet identify. I believe his temperament and the influences on him reach a mental climax; he could be dangerous, especially if motivated by more than self-interest. For selfish men, caution protects them and others, but for those motivated by duty or a cause, only chance can balance their dangerous tendencies.\n\nLetter from Quincey P. Morris to Hon. Arthur Holmwood:\n\nMay 25.\n\nMy dear Art –\n\nWe’ve shared stories by fire on the prairie, patched each other up after adventures in the Marquesas, and toasted together by Lake Titicaca. More tales remain, more wounds need healing, and another toast is needed. Will you join me by my campfire tomorrow night? I know you’re free with a certain lady engaged elsewhere at dinner. Only one other will join us—our old friend from Korea, Jack Seward. We both wish to share a drink and offer a heartfelt toast to the happiest man in the world—the one who has won the worthiest heart. We promise you a warm welcome and a sincere salute. If you overindulge in toasts to a particular pair of eyes, we swear to take you home ourselves. Come!"

This is a lovely place. The little river, the Esk, runs through a deep valley, which broadens out as it comes near the harbour. A great viaduct runs across, with high piers, through which the view seems somehow further away than it really is. The valley is beautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on the high land on either side you look right across it, unless you are near enough to see down. The houses of the old town—the side away from us—are all red-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other anyhow, like the pictures we see of Nuremberg. Right over the town is the ruin of Whitby Abbey, which was sacked by the Danes, and which is the scene of part of “Marmion,” where the girl was built up in the wall. It is a most noble ruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic bits; there is a legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows. Between it and the town there is another church, the parish one, round which is a big graveyard, all full of tombstones. This is to my mind the nicest spot in Whitby, for it lies right over the town, and has a full view of the harbour and all up the bay to where the headland called Kettleness stretches out into the sea. It descends so steeply over the harbour that part of the bank has fallen away, and some of the graves have been destroyed. In one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches out over the sandy pathway far below. There are walks, with seats beside them, through the churchyard; and people go and sit there all day long looking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze. I shall come and sit here very often myself and work. Indeed, I am writing now, with my book on my knee, and listening to the talk of three old men who are sitting beside me. They seem to do nothing all day but sit up here and talk.\nThe harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long granite wall stretching out into the sea, with a curve outwards at the end of it, in the middle of which is a lighthouse. A heavy sea-wall runs along outside of it. On the near side, the sea-wall makes an elbow crooked inversely, and its end too has a lighthouse. Between the two piers there is a narrow opening into the harbour, which then suddenly widens.\nIt is nice at high water; but when the tide is out it shoals away to nothing, and there is merely the stream of the Esk, running between banks of sand, with rocks here and there. Outside the harbour on this side there rises for about half a mile a great reef, the sharp edge of which runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse. At the end of it is a buoy with a bell, which swings in bad weather, and sends in a mournful sound on the wind. They have a legend here that when a ship is lost bells are heard out at sea. I must ask the old man about this; he is coming this way....",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "July 24th. Whitby.—I was met at the station by Lucy, who looked more beautiful and radiant than ever. We drove to their lodging house in the Crescent. Whitby is a truly lovely spot. The small Esk river flows through a deep valley that widens as it approaches the harbour. A large viaduct with tall supports spans the valley, making the scenery beyond appear more distant than it is. The valley is vividly green and so steep that from the high ground on either side, you can see straight across it unless you are close enough to look down. The houses in the older part of town, across the valley from us, have red roofs and seem haphazardly stacked on top of each other, much like illustrations of Nuremberg. Above the town stands the remains of Whitby Abbey, ruined by the Danes and featured in a section of “Marmion” about a girl immured in a wall. It's a magnificent ruin, immense in size and filled with charming and picturesque details; local lore says a spectral white lady is sometimes seen in one of its windows. Situated between the abbey and the town is another church, the local parish church, surrounded by an extensive graveyard filled with gravestones. I consider this the most appealing location in Whitby because it overlooks the town and offers a full perspective of the harbour and the entire sweep of the bay up to the headland known as Kettleness jutting into the sea. The slope towards the harbour is so steep that part of the bank has collapsed, disturbing some graves. In one area, some stonework from the graves actually hangs over the sandy path far below. Paths with benches wind through the churchyard, where people spend the day enjoying the scenic view and the sea breeze. I plan to spend a lot of time here myself, working. In fact, I'm writing this now, with my book resting on my knee, while listening to the conversation of three elderly gentlemen seated nearby. They seem to spend their entire days sitting here chatting. Below me lies the harbour. On the far side, a long granite wall extends into the sea, curving outward at its end, with a lighthouse situated in the center of the curve. A robust sea wall runs along the outside of this. On the near side, the sea wall forms an inverted elbow bend, and its end also has a lighthouse. A narrow entrance between the two piers leads into the harbour, which then expands considerably. It's quite pleasant at high tide, but when the tide recedes, the water becomes very shallow, leaving only the Esk stream flowing between sandy banks with scattered rocks. Outside the harbour on this side, a large reef extends for about half a mile, its sharp edge running straight out from behind the southern lighthouse. A buoy with a bell marks its end, which swings in poor weather, sending a melancholy sound inland on the wind. There's a local myth that bells can be heard out at sea when a ship is lost. I must inquire about this with the old man; he's heading this way...",

A large viaduct spans the valley on tall supports, making the distant views seem even farther away. The hillsides on either side are so steep that from the high ground you gaze directly across unless you get close enough to look down. Across from us, perched along the valley, are the old town’s red-roofed houses, stacked one atop another, resembling scenes of Nuremberg. Overlooking the town, the impressive ruins of Whitby Abbey stand, famously plundered by the Danes and featured in part of “Marmion,” where a girl was encased in the wall. The Abbey is huge and splendid, with many picturesque and romantic features; there’s also a story about a white lady being seen in one of its windows.

To me, this is the loveliest spot in Whitby: it sits above the town and offers a sweeping view of the harbour and the bay all the way to the headland called Kettleness.

On our side, another sea wall curves in the opposite direction and is also capped with a lighthouse. The entrance between the two piers is narrow but widens quickly into the harbour. High tide is lovely, but when the tide recedes, little is left but the Esk’s channel cutting through sandbanks and rocky patches. Outside the harbour, a long jagged reef extends for about half a mile from the south lighthouse, ending in a bell buoy whose mournful chime is carried inland by storm winds. There’s a local legend that when ships are lost at sea, ghostly bells can be heard. I’ll ask the old man about it—he’s coming over now..."

They're fine for visitors and tourists and such, but not for a nice young lady like yourself.\" He added that the working-class people from places like York and Leeds, who are always eating smoked herring, drinking tea, and looking for cheap jet, would believe anything, wondering why anyone would bother lying to them, even the newspapers which he considers full of nonsense.

He is evidently the Sir Oracle of them, and I should think must have been in his time a most dictatorial person. He will not admit anything, and downfaces everybody. If he can’t out-argue them he bullies them, and then takes their silence for agreement with his views. Lucy was looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock; she has got a beautiful colour since she has been here. I noticed that the old men did not lose any time in coming up and sitting near her when we sat down. She is so sweet with old people; I think they all fell in love with her on the spot. Even my old man succumbed and did not contradict her, but gave me double share instead. I got him on the subject of the legends, and he went off at once into a sort of sermon. I must try to remember it and put it down:—\n“It be all fool-talk, lock, stock, and barrel; that’s what it be, an’ nowt else. These bans an’ wafts an’ boh-ghosts an’ barguests an’ bogles an’ all anent them is only fit to set bairns an’ dizzy women a-belderin’. They be nowt but air-blebs. They, an’ all grims an’ signs an’ warnin’s, be all invented by parsons an’ illsome beuk-bodies an’ railway touters to skeer an’ scunner hafflin’s, an’ to get folks to do somethin’ that they don’t other incline to. It makes me ireful to think o’ them. Why, it’s them that, not content with printin’ lies on paper an’ preachin’ them out of pulpits, does want to be cuttin’ them on the tombstones. Look here all around you in what airt ye will; all them steans, holdin’ up their heads as well as they can out of their pride, is acant—simply tumblin’ down with the weight o’ the lies wrote on them, ‘Here lies the body’ or ‘Sacred to the memory’ wrote on all of them, an’ yet in nigh half of them there bean’t no bodies at all; an’ the memories of them bean’t cared a pinch of snuff about, much less sacred. Lies all of them, nothin’ but lies of one kind or another! My gog, but it’ll be a quare scowderment at the Day of Judgment when they come tumblin’ up in their death-sarks, all jouped together an’ tryin’ to drag their tombsteans with them to prove how good they was; some of them trimmlin’ and ditherin’, with their hands that dozzened an’ slippy from lyin’ in the sea that they can’t even keep their grup o’ them.”\nI could see from the old fellow’s self-satisfied air and the way in which he looked round for the approval of his cronies that he was “showing off,” so I put in a word to keep him going:—\n“Oh, Mr. Swales, you can’t be serious. Surely these tombstones are not all wrong?”\n“Yabblins! There may be a poorish few not wrong, savin’ where they make out the people too good; for there be folk that do think a balm-bowl be like the sea, if only it be their own. The whole thing be only lies. Now look you here; you come here a stranger, an’ you see this kirk-garth.” I nodded, for I thought it better to assent, though I did not quite understand his dialect. I knew it had something to do with the church. He went on: “And you consate that all these steans be aboon folk that be happed here, snod an’ snog?” I assented again. “Then that be just where the lie comes in. Why, there be scores of these lay-beds that be toom as old Dun’s ’bacca-box on Friday night.” He nudged one of his companions, and they all laughed. “And my gog! how could they be otherwise? Look at that one, the aftest abaft the bier-bank: read it!” I went over and read:—\n“Edward Spencelagh, master mariner, murdered by pirates off the coast of Andres, April, 1854, æt. 30.” When I came back Mr. Swales went on:—\n“Who brought him home, I wonder, to hap him here? Murdered off the coast of Andres! an’ you consated his body lay under! Why, I could name ye a dozen whose bones lie in the Greenland seas above”—he pointed northwards—“or where the currents may have drifted them. There be the steans around ye. Ye can, with your young eyes, read the small-print of the lies from here. This Braithwaite Lowrey—I knew his father, lost in the Lively off Greenland in ’20; or Andrew Woodhouse, drowned in the same seas in 1777; or John Paxton, drowned off Cape Farewell a year later; or old John Rawlings, whose grandfather sailed with me, drowned in the Gulf of Finland in ’50. Do ye think that all these men will have to make a rush to Whitby when the trumpet sounds? I have me antherums aboot it! I tell ye that when they got here they’d be jommlin’ an’ jostlin’ one another that way that it ’ud be like a fight up on the ice in the old days, when we’d be at one another from daylight to dark, an’ tryin’ to tie up our cuts by the light of the aurora borealis.” This was evidently local pleasantry, for the old man cackled over it, and his cronies joined in with gusto.",

If he can't win an argument with logic, he resorts to intimidation, taking their silence as agreement with his opinions.

I observed that the old men didn't waste any time approaching and sitting near her once we were seated. She is so sweet towards older people; I think they were all instantly captivated by her.

These stories of spirits, omens, ghosts, specters, bogies, and everything related to them are only fit for making children and giddy women scream. They are nothing but puffs of hot air. They, along with all portents, signs, and warnings, were all concocted by clergymen, unpleasant scholars, and railway touts to frighten and sicken young people, and to manipulate folks into doing things they wouldn't otherwise be inclined to do. It infuriates me to think about them. Why, these are the very people who, not content with printing lies on paper and preaching them from pulpits, want to carve them onto gravestones. Look anywhere you like; all these stones, standing as tall as their pride allows, are crooked—simply falling over from the weight of the lies written on them, 'Here lies the body' or 'Sacred to the memory' inscribed on all of them, and yet in nearly half of them, there are no bodies at all; and their memories aren't cared for a bit, much less considered sacred. All lies, nothing but lies of one kind or another! Good heavens, what a peculiar commotion there will be on the Day of Judgment when they come tumbling up in their burial shirts, all jumbled together and trying to drag their tombstones with them to prove how virtuous they were; some of them trembling and shivering, their hands so numb and slick from lying in the sea that they can't even keep a grip on them.\" I could see from the old man's self-satisfied expression and the way he glanced around for approval from his companions that he was 'showing off,' so I interjected a remark to keep him talking: \"Oh, Mr. Swales, you can't be serious. Surely these tombstones aren't all incorrect?\" \"Nonsense!\" he exclaimed. \"Perhaps a very small number aren't wrong, except where they portray people as too good; for some folks think a small amount is like the sea, provided it's their own. The whole thing is just lies. Now pay attention; you are a stranger here, and you see this churchyard.\" I nodded, as I thought it best to agree, even though I didn't fully understand his regional accent. I knew it related to the church. He continued: \"And you assume that all these stones are above people who are buried here, neatly and snugly?\" I agreed again. \"Then that is precisely where the lie enters. Why, there are scores of these burial plots that are as empty as old Dun's tobacco box on Friday night.\" He nudged one of his companions, and they all chuckled. \"And good heavens! How could they be otherwise? Look at that one, the farthest one behind the coffin rest: read it!\" I went over and read: \"Edward Spencelagh, master mariner, murdered by pirates off the coast of Andres, April, 1854, æt. 30.\" When I returned, Mr. Swales went on: \"Who, I wonder, brought him home to bury him here? Murdered off the coast of Andres! And you thought his body lay beneath! Why, I could list a dozen men whose bones lie in the Greenland seas up there\"—he gestured northwards—\"or wherever the currents might have carried them. The stones are all around you. With your young eyes, you can read the tiny print of the lies from here. This Braithwaite Lowrey—I knew his father, lost in the Lively off Greenland in '20; or Andrew Woodhouse, drowned in the same seas in 1777; or John Paxton, drowned off Cape Farewell a year later; or old John Rawlings, whose grandfather sailed with me, drowned in the Gulf of Finland in '50. Do you think that all these men will have to make a mad dash to Whitby when the trumpet sounds? I have my doubts about it! I tell you that when they got here, they'd be bumping and shoving each other so much it would be like a brawl on the ice in the old days, when we'd fight each other from dawn till dusk, and trying to tie up our cuts by the light of the aurora borealis.\" This was clearly a local joke, as the old man guffawed over it, and his companions joined in with relish.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "August 1st—About an hour ago, I went up with Lucy and we had a very engaging conversation with my old friend and the two men who always join him. He clearly dominates the group and must have been quite a commanding figure in his younger days. He refuses to accept anyone else’s point and always talks over everyone. If he can't win an argument with logic, he resorts to bullying, and takes silence as agreement. Lucy looked lovely in her white dress; since arriving here her complexion has improved wonderfully. I noticed the old men quickly came over to sit by her when we settled down—she's so charming with elderly people that they all seemed to instantly adore her. Even my old friend was taken with her, for once not opposing her, but giving me twice his usual resistance instead. I brought up the local legends, which prompted him to launch into a kind of sermon, which I’ll try to summarize here: \"It’s all nonsense, every last bit. All these tales of spirits, banshees, ghosts, and the lot are nothing but stories to frighten children and gullible women. They're just air, nothing more. The myths, omens, and warnings were invented by clergy, educated folk, and railway promoters to scare and manipulate people. It makes me angry to think about them. Not content with writing lies on paper and preaching them in churches, they want to engrave them on tombstones as well. Just look around—these gravestones standing as tall as they can out of pride are barely staying up under the weight of the lies written on them, ‘Here lies the body’ or ‘Sacred to the memory’ inscribed everywhere; in nearly half, there’s no body at all, and no one cares about the memory, much less considers it sacred. Lies, all lies! I can imagine Judgment Day, when the dead supposedly rise up, all tangled together, dragging their gravestones in an attempt to prove their virtue, with some fumbling because their hands are too numb and slippery from the sea to get a good grip.' I could tell the old man was showing off, glancing around for his friends’ approval, so I engaged to encourage him: 'Oh, Mr. Swales, you can’t be serious. Are you saying all these tombstones are inaccurate?' 'Nonsense! There might be a few that aren’t wrong, except where they exaggerate the goodness of the people—some think a bowl of balm is as big as the sea if it’s their own. The whole thing is just lies. Now look here: you’re a newcomer, and you see this churchyard.' I nodded, though I didn’t entirely follow his dialect but understood he meant the church grounds. He continued: 'And you think these gravestones are above people who are peacefully buried here?' I nodded again. 'That’s exactly where the lie comes in. Many of these graves are empty—as empty as old Dun’s tobacco box on a Friday night.' He nudged one of his friends, and they all laughed. 'How could it be otherwise? Look at that stone, the one beside the path: read it!' I went over and read: 'Edward Spencelagh, master mariner, murdered by pirates off the coast of Andres, April, 1854, aged 30.' When I returned, Mr. Swales continued: 'Who brought him home to bury him here? Murdered off Andres—and you think his body is under this stone? I could name a dozen whose remains lie in the Greenland seas'—he gestured north—‘or who were swept away by the currents. There are stones all around us. You, with your young eyes, can read the small print of those lies. For example, Braithwaite Lowrey—I knew his father, lost at sea near Greenland in 1820; Andrew Woodhouse, drowned there in 1777; John Paxton, drowned off Cape Farewell a year later; or old John Rawlings, whose grandfather sailed with me, drowned in the Gulf of Finland in 1850. Do you really think all these men will rush back to Whitby when the Last Trumpet sounds? I doubt it! If they did, they’d be so jostled and crowded it’d be like the old ice-fighting days, tying up our wounds in the glow of the northern lights.' This was clearly a local joke, for the old man chuckled, and his friends laughed heartily."

The letters were upside down to me from where I sat, but Lucy was more opposite to them, so she leant over and read:—\n“Sacred to the memory of George Canon, who died, in the hope of a glorious resurrection, on July, 29, 1873, falling from the rocks at Kettleness. This tomb was erected by his sorrowing mother to her dearly beloved son. ‘He was the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.’ Really, Mr. Swales, I don’t see anything very funny in that!” She spoke her comment very gravely and somewhat severely.\n“Ye don’t see aught funny! Ha! ha! But that’s because ye don’t gawm the sorrowin’ mother was a hell-cat that hated him because he was acrewk’d—a regular lamiter he was—an’ he hated her so that he committed suicide in order that she mightn’t get an insurance she put on his life. He blew nigh the top of his head off with an old musket that they had for scarin’ the crows with. ’Twarn’t for crows then, for it brought the clegs and the dowps to him. That’s the way he fell off the rocks. And, as to hopes of a glorious resurrection, I’ve often heard him say masel’ that he hoped he’d go to hell, for his mother was so pious that she’d be sure to go to heaven, an’ he didn’t want to addle where she was. Now isn’t that stean at any rate”—he hammered it with his stick as he spoke—“a pack of lies? and won’t it make Gabriel keckle when Geordie comes pantin’ up the grees with the tombstean balanced on his hump, and asks it to be took as evidence!”\nI did not know what to say, but Lucy turned the conversation as she said, rising up:—\n“Oh, why did you tell us of this? It is my favourite seat, and I cannot leave it; and now I find I must go on sitting over the grave of a suicide.”\n“That won’t harm ye, my pretty; an’ it may make poor Geordie gladsome to have so trim a lass sittin’ on his lap. That won’t hurt ye. Why, I’ve sat here off an’ on for nigh twenty years past, an’ it hasn’t done me no harm. Don’t ye fash about them as lies under ye, or that doesn’ lie there either! It’ll be time for ye to be getting scart when ye see the tombsteans all run away with, and the place as bare as a stubble-field. There’s the clock, an’ I must gang. My service to ye, ladies!” And off he hobbled.\nLucy and I sat awhile, and it was all so beautiful before us that we took hands as we sat; and she told me all over again about Arthur and their coming marriage. That made me just a little heart-sick, for I haven’t heard from Jonathan for a whole month.\nThe same day. I came up here alone, for I am very sad. There was no letter for me. I hope there cannot be anything the matter with Jonathan. The clock has just struck nine. I see the lights scattered all over the town, sometimes in rows where the streets are, and sometimes singly; they run right up the Esk and die away in the curve of the valley. To my left the view is cut off by a black line of roof of the old house next the abbey. The sheep and lambs are bleating in the fields away behind me, and there is a clatter of a donkey’s hoofs up the paved road below. The band on the pier is playing a harsh waltz in good time, and further along the quay there is a Salvation Army meeting in a back street. Neither of the bands hears the other, but up here I hear and see them both. I wonder where Jonathan is and if he is thinking of me! I wish he were here.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I challenged him, saying, \"Surely that can't be right. You're assuming that everyone, or their spirits, will have to carry their gravestones on the Day of Judgment. Do you honestly think that would be necessary?\" \"Well, what other purpose do tombstones serve? Tell me that, miss!\" he demanded. \"To please their families, I suppose,\" I answered. \"To please their families, you suppose!\" he scoffed with intense disdain. \"How would it bring joy to their families to know that lies are written about them, and that everyone in the area is aware of the falsehoods?\" He pointed to a stone at our feet, a flat slab used as part of the seat near the cliff edge. \"Read the untruths on that headstone,\" he instructed. From my position, the letters were upside down, but Lucy was better placed, so she leaned over and read: \"Sacred to the memory of George Canon, who passed away on July 29, 1873, in hope of a glorious resurrection, after falling from the rocks at Kettleness. This memorial was put up by his grieving mother for her beloved son. 'He was the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.'

Ha! ha!\" he chuckled. \"But that's because you don't realize the 'grieving' mother was a cruel woman who detested him because he was deformed—a completely lame person he was—and he loathed her so much he ended his own life to prevent her from collecting the insurance policy she had on him. He practically blew the top of his head off with an old rifle they used for scaring birds. It wasn't just for birds then, because it brought flies and maggots to him. That's how he 'fell' off the rocks. And as for hoping for a glorious resurrection, I often heard him say himself that he hoped he'd go to hell, because his mother was so pious she was guaranteed to go to heaven, and he didn't want to be anywhere near her. So, isn't that stone at least,\" he tapped it with his stick as he spoke, \"a pack of lies? And won't it make Gabriel roar with laughter when Geordie comes puffing up the steps with the gravestone balanced on his hunched back, asking for it to be accepted as proof!\" I was speechless, but Lucy changed the topic, standing up and saying, \"Oh, why did you tell us this? This is my favourite seat, and I don't want to leave it; but now I feel compelled to keep sitting over a suicide's grave.\" \"That won't hurt you, my dear; and it might cheer up poor Geordie to have such a pretty girl sitting on him.

You should only start worrying when you see all the gravestones running away and the place left as empty as a harvested field. There's the time, and I must be going. My regards to you, ladies!\" And he limped away. Lucy and I stayed for a while, and the view before us was so lovely that we held hands. She recounted once again everything about Arthur and their upcoming wedding. That left me feeling a little heavy-hearted, as I haven't received any news from Jonathan for a whole month. The same day. I came here by myself because I am feeling very sad. There was no letter waiting for me. I hope nothing is wrong with Jonathan. The clock has just struck nine. I can see the lights scattered across the town, sometimes in rows where the streets are, and sometimes individually; they stretch up the Esk river and disappear into the bend of the valley.

The sheep and lambs are bleating in the fields behind me, and I can hear the clatter of a donkey's hooves on the paved road below.

Now, isn’t that stone—\" he tapped it, \"full of lies? Won’t it be something if the angel Gabriel laughs when George arrives on Judgment Day, lugging his tombstone on his back as proof!\"\n\nI was at a loss for words, but Lucy diverted the conversation as she stood up: \"Why did you tell us this?

He has certain qualities very largely developed; selfishness, secrecy, and purpose. I wish I could get at what is the object of the latter. He seems to have some settled scheme of his own, but what it is I do not yet know. His redeeming quality is a love of animals, though, indeed, he has such curious turns in it that I sometimes imagine he is only abnormally cruel. His pets are of odd sorts. Just now his hobby is catching flies. He has at present such a quantity that I have had myself to expostulate. To my astonishment, he did not break out into a fury, as I expected, but took the matter in simple seriousness. He thought for a moment, and then said: “May I have three days? I shall clear them away.” Of course, I said that would do. I must watch him.\n18 June.—He has turned his mind now to spiders, and has got several very big fellows in a box. He keeps feeding them with his flies, and the number of the latter is becoming sensibly diminished, although he has used half his food in attracting more flies from outside to his room.\n1 July.—His spiders are now becoming as great a nuisance as his flies, and to-day I told him that he must get rid of them. He looked very sad at this, so I said that he must clear out some of them, at all events. He cheerfully acquiesced in this, and I gave him the same time as before for reduction. He disgusted me much while with him, for when a horrid blow-fly, bloated with some carrion food, buzzed into the room, he caught it, held it exultantly for a few moments between his finger and thumb, and, before I knew what he was going to do, put it in his mouth and ate it. I scolded him for it, but he argued quietly that it was very good and very wholesome; that it was life, strong life, and gave life to him. This gave me an idea, or the rudiment of one. I must watch how he gets rid of his spiders. He has evidently some deep problem in his mind, for he keeps a little note-book in which he is always jotting down something. Whole pages of it are filled with masses of figures, generally single numbers added up in batches, and then the totals added in batches again, as though he were “focussing” some account, as the auditors put it.\n8 July.—There is a method in his madness, and the rudimentary idea in my mind is growing. It will be a whole idea soon, and then, oh, unconscious cerebration! you will have to give the wall to your conscious brother. I kept away from my friend for a few days, so that I might notice if there were any change. Things remain as they were except that he has parted with some of his pets and got a new one. He has managed to get a sparrow, and has already partially tamed it. His means of taming is simple, for already the spiders have diminished. Those that do remain, however, are well fed, for he still brings in the flies by tempting them with his food.\n19 July.—We are progressing. My friend has now a whole colony of sparrows, and his flies and spiders are almost obliterated. When I came in he ran to me and said he wanted to ask me a great favour—a very, very great favour; and as he spoke he fawned on me like a dog. I asked him what it was, and he said, with a sort of rapture in his voice and bearing:—\n“A kitten, a nice little, sleek playful kitten, that I can play with, and teach, and feed—and feed—and feed!” I was not unprepared for this request, for I had noticed how his pets went on increasing in size and vivacity, but I did not care that his pretty family of tame sparrows should be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and the spiders; so I said I would see about it, and asked him if he would not rather have a cat than a kitten. His eagerness betrayed him as he answered:—\n“Oh, yes, I would like a cat! I only asked for a kitten lest you should refuse me a cat. No one would refuse me a kitten, would they?” I shook my head, and said that at present I feared it would not be possible, but that I would see about it. His face fell, and I could see a warning of danger in it, for there was a sudden fierce, sidelong look which meant killing. The man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac. I shall test him with his present craving and see how it will work out; then I shall know more.\n10 p. m.—I have visited him again and found him sitting in a corner brooding. When I came in he threw himself on his knees before me and implored me to let him have a cat; that his salvation depended upon it. I was firm, however, and told him that he could not have it, whereupon he went without a word, and sat down, gnawing his fingers, in the corner where I had found him. I shall see him in the morning early.",

His one seemingly positive trait is an affection for animals, though his unusual approach to it sometimes makes me wonder if it's actually an extreme form of cruelty. He keeps strange pets. At the moment, he's obsessed with catching flies. He's collected so many that I felt compelled to object. Surprisingly, instead of the outburst I anticipated, he reacted with simple seriousness. After a moment's thought, he asked, \"May I have three days? I will get rid of them.\" Naturally, I agreed this was acceptable. I must continue to observe him.\n\nEntry for June 18th: He has now shifted his attention to spiders, keeping several quite large specimens in a container. He feeds them using his flies, and the fly population is noticeably decreasing, even though he has used half the remaining flies as bait to lure more from outside into his room.\n\nEntry for July 1st: His spiders are now becoming as problematic as the flies were, and today I instructed him that he must eliminate them. He looked very sad about this, so I modified the instruction, telling him he only needed to get rid of some of them. He agreed cheerfully, and I granted him the same timeframe for reduction as before. While I was there, he did something that greatly disgusted me: when a large blow-fly, bloated from feeding on something decaying, buzzed into the room, he caught it, held it triumphantly between his fingers for a few moments, and then, before I could react, put it in his mouth and ate it. I reprimanded him, but he calmly argued that it was perfectly good and healthy, explaining it was 'life, strong life,' and that it gave him life. This act sparked an idea in my mind, or at least the beginning of one. I need to watch how he disposes of his spiders. He clearly has some complex plan, as he constantly jots things down in a small notebook. Pages are filled with columns of numbers, usually single digits added in groups, with those totals added again in further groups, as if he is 'focussing' some sort of financial account, as auditors would say.\n\nEntry for July 8th: There is a logic to his apparent madness, and the initial idea forming in my mind is developing. It will soon become a complete concept, at which point, conscious thought will surpass mere unconscious processing. I stayed away from him for a few days to see if anything changed. The situation is largely the same, except he has gotten rid of some pets and acquired a new one. He has managed to get a sparrow and has already partially tamed it. His method of taming is straightforward, as the spider population has already decreased. However, the spiders that remain are well-fed because he is still attracting flies by baiting them with food.\n\nEntry for July 19th: We are making progress. My patient now has a whole group of sparrows, and his flies and spiders are nearly gone. When I entered, he rushed up to me and said he needed to ask a huge favour – a truly immense favour; as he spoke, he exhibited dog-like fawning behavior. I asked what it was, and he replied with noticeable excitement in his voice and manner:\n\n“A kitten, a lovely, smooth, playful kitten that I can play with, teach, and feed – and feed – and feed!” I wasn't entirely surprised by this request, as I had noticed the increasing size and vitality of his previous pets, but I was reluctant to see his appealing collection of tame sparrows meet the same fate as the flies and spiders. So, I replied that I would consider it and asked if he would prefer a cat instead of a kitten. His eagerness betrayed him as he responded:\n\n“Oh, yes, I would love a cat! I only asked for a kitten because I was afraid you might refuse a cat. Nobody would refuse a kitten, would they?” I shook my head and said that I feared it wasn't possible at the moment but that I would look into it. His face fell, and I detected a dangerous warning in his expression – a sudden, fierce, side-long glance suggesting a desire to kill. The man is a latent homicidal maniac. I will test him by addressing his current desire and observe the outcome; this should provide more insight.\n\nEntry for 10 p.m.: I visited him again and found him sitting in a corner, withdrawn. When I entered, he fell to his knees before me, pleading desperately for a cat, claiming his salvation depended on it. However, I remained resolute and told him he could not have one. At that, he left without a word and sat back down in the corner where I'd found him, gnawing on his fingers. I will check on him early in the morning.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "June 5—Renfield's case continues to intrigue me as I learn more about him. He possesses highly developed traits like selfishness, secrecy, and determination. I am especially curious to understand the goal driving that purpose, as it seems he has a definite plan, though I cannot yet discern what it is. Despite some peculiar behaviors, he clearly loves animals, although at times this affection seems nearly cruel. He keeps unusual pets; right now, he is fixated on catching flies and has so many that I had to intervene. Surprisingly, rather than reacting with anger as I expected, he responded calmly, asking for three days to get rid of them, which I agreed to. I intend to keep an eye on him.\n\nJune 18—He has shifted his attention to keeping large spiders, feeding them the flies he collects, which has reduced their numbers, though he continues to lure new flies into his room.\n\nJuly 1—The spiders are now becoming as troublesome as the flies once were, so I told him he needed to remove them. He seemed disappointed but agreed to at least reduce their number, and I gave him three days as before. He disturbed me by catching and eating a large blow-fly right in front of me, saying quite reasonably that it was healthy, full of life, and gave him vitality. This action has given me an idea about his behavior, so I’ll be watching to see how he disposes of his spiders. He clearly has something weighing on his mind, as he constantly writes in a notebook filled with calculations and lists, as if reconciling some account.\n\nJuly 8—I now see some order in Renfield's madness, and my earlier suspicions are crystallizing into a coherent idea. I purposely avoided him for a few days to observe any changes; it seems he has given up some pets and acquired a new one—a sparrow, which he is already training using a simple method: he feeds it by further reducing his spider collection. The remaining spiders are well-fed thanks to the flies he continues to catch.\n\nJuly 19—Renfield now has several sparrows, and barely any flies or spiders. Today he eagerly begged me for a kitten, insisting it would be a great favor. I saw this request coming, as his pets are regularly growing in both size and vitality, but I did not want the sparrows to meet the same end as the flies and spiders, so I told him I would consider it, and asked if he preferred a cat. His excitement gave him away; he admitted he wanted a cat but asked for a kitten assuming it would be easier to obtain. I replied that it was not possible for now, at which point his face darkened, revealing a potentially dangerous side. It’s clear he has homicidal tendencies tucked just beneath the surface. I plan to see how he reacts to his current craving and what unfolds.\n\n10 p.m.—I visited him again this evening and found him sulking in the corner. As soon as I entered, he desperately pleaded with me for a cat, claiming it was essential to his well-being. I remained firm and refused his request, after which he withdrew without protest and resumed gnawing his fingers in silence in the corner. I’ll check on him early in the morning."

He was spreading out his sugar, which he had saved, in the window, and was manifestly beginning his fly-catching again; and beginning it cheerfully and with a good grace. I looked around for his birds, and not seeing them, asked him where they were. He replied, without turning round, that they had all flown away. There were a few feathers about the room and on his pillow a drop of blood. I said nothing, but went and told the keeper to report to me if there were anything odd about him during the day.\n11 a. m.—The attendant has just been to me to say that Renfield has been very sick and has disgorged a whole lot of feathers. “My belief is, doctor,” he said, “that he has eaten his birds, and that he just took and ate them raw!”\n11 p. m.—I gave Renfield a strong opiate to-night, enough to make even him sleep, and took away his pocket-book to look at it. The thought that has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete, and the theory proved. My homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind. I shall have to invent a new classification for him, and call him a zoöphagous (life-eating) maniac; what he desires is to absorb as many lives as he can, and he has laid himself out to achieve it in a cumulative way. He gave many flies to one spider and many spiders to one bird, and then wanted a cat to eat the many birds. What would have been his later steps? It would almost be worth while to complete the experiment. It might be done if there were only a sufficient cause. Men sneered at vivisection, and yet look at its results to-day! Why not advance science in its most difficult and vital aspect—the knowledge of the brain? Had I even the secret of one such mind—did I hold the key to the fancy of even one lunatic—I might advance my own branch of science to a pitch compared with which Burdon-Sanderson’s physiology or Ferrier’s brain-knowledge would be as nothing. If only there were a sufficient cause! I must not think too much of this, or I may be tempted; a good cause might turn the scale with me, for may not I too be of an exceptional brain, congenitally?\nHow well the man reasoned; lunatics always do within their own scope. I wonder at how many lives he values a man, or if at only one. He has closed the account most accurately, and to-day begun a new record. How many of us begin a new record with each day of our lives?\nTo me it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my new hope, and that truly I began a new record. So it will be until the Great Recorder sums me up and closes my ledger account with a balance to profit or loss. Oh, Lucy, Lucy, I cannot be angry with you, nor can I be angry with my friend whose happiness is yours; but I must only wait on hopeless and work.

Without turning, he replied that they had all flown away. I noticed a few feathers scattered around the room and a drop of blood on his pillow. I didn't say anything, but I instructed the keeper to inform me if anything unusual occurred with him during the day.\n11 a.m.—The attendant just reported that Renfield has been very ill and vomited a large quantity of feathers. The attendant believes he ate his birds, and moreover, that he consumed them raw.\n11 p.m.—Tonight, I administered a potent opiate to Renfield, sufficient to induce sleep even in him, and I confiscated his pocket-book for examination. The idea that has been circulating in my mind lately feels complete, and my theory is confirmed. My patient, a homicidal maniac, is of a peculiar type. I will need to create a new classification for him, perhaps calling him a 'zoöphagous' (life-eating) maniac. His goal is to absorb as many lives as possible, and he has structured his efforts to achieve this cumulatively. He gave many flies to a single spider, many spiders to a single bird, and then desired a cat to consume the many birds. What would his subsequent steps have been? It would almost be worthwhile to see the experiment through. It might be justifiable if there were a compelling reason. People used to mock vivisection, yet look at the results we have today! Why not push scientific boundaries in its most challenging and crucial area – understanding the brain? If I could unlock the secret of just one such mind – if I held the key to the inner workings of even one lunatic – I could advance my field of science to a level that would dwarf even the work of Burdon-Sanderson in physiology or Ferrier in brain research. If only there were a sufficient cause! I must not dwell on this too much, or I might be tempted; a worthy cause could sway me, especially considering I might myself possess an exceptionally formed brain from birth.\nHow well the man reasoned; individuals with mental illness always reason logically within the confines of their delusion. I wonder how many lives he values a single man at, or if it's just one. He has meticulously closed his previous account and today commenced a new one. How many of us start a new ledger each day of our existence?\nTo me, it seems only yesterday that my entire life felt like it ended with the loss of my new hope, and that I truly began a new record then. This pattern will likely continue until the Great Recorder tallies my life and closes my account, showing either a profit or a loss. Oh, Lucy, Lucy, I cannot feel anger towards you, nor towards my friend whose happiness you now share; I can only endure this hopelessness and work. Work!

He fed many flies to one spider, then many spiders to one bird, and afterwards wanted a cat to eat the birds. I wonder what his next step would have been. It is almost tempting to continue the experiment, if there was enough justification. People criticize vivisection, but look at what it's achieved!

A good reason might tip me over the edge; perhaps my own mind is exceptional from birth.\n\nRenfield reasons remarkably well in his own way, as lunatics often do. I wonder how many lives he thinks a man is worth—just one, or more? He has carefully ended one phase of his experiment today and started a new one. In a way, we all start a new page each day of our lives.\n\nFor me, it feels as though my whole previous life ended when I gained new hope, and I truly began anew.

I pray it will all last.\n3 August.—Another week gone, and no news from Jonathan, not even to Mr. Hawkins, from whom I have heard. Oh, I do hope he is not ill. He surely would have written. I look at that last letter of his, but somehow it does not satisfy me. It does not read like him, and yet it is his writing. There is no mistake of that.

To-day is a grey day, and the sun as I write is hidden in thick clouds, high over Kettleness. Everything is grey—except the green grass, which seems like emerald amongst it; grey earthy rock; grey clouds, tinged with the sunburst at the far edge, hang over the grey sea, into which the sand-points stretch like grey fingers. The sea is tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar, muffled in the sea-mists drifting inland. The horizon is lost in a grey mist. All is vastness; the clouds are piled up like giant rocks, and there is a “brool” over the sea that sounds like some presage of doom. Dark figures are on the beach here and there, sometimes half shrouded in the mist, and seem “men like trees walking.” The fishing-boats are racing for home, and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep into the harbour, bending to the scuppers. Here comes old Mr. Swales. He is making straight for me, and I can see, by the way he lifts his hat, that he wants to talk....\nI have been quite touched by the change in the poor old man. When he sat down beside me, he said in a very gentle way:—\n“I want to say something to you, miss.” I could see he was not at ease, so I took his poor old wrinkled hand in mine and asked him to speak fully; so he said, leaving his hand in mine:—\n“I’m afraid, my deary, that I must have shocked you by all the wicked things I’ve been sayin’ about the dead, and such like, for weeks past; but I didn’t mean them, and I want ye to remember that when I’m gone. We aud folks that be daffled, and with one foot abaft the krok-hooal, don’t altogether like to think of it, and we don’t want to feel scart of it; an’ that’s why I’ve took to makin’ light of it, so that I’d cheer up my own heart a bit. But, Lord love ye, miss, I ain’t afraid of dyin’, not a bit; only I don’t want to die if I can help it. My time must be nigh at hand now, for I be aud, and a hundred years is too much for any man to expect; and I’m so nigh it that the Aud Man is already whettin’ his scythe. Ye see, I can’t get out o’ the habit of caffin’ about it all at once; the chafts will wag as they be used to. Some day soon the Angel of Death will sound his trumpet for me. But don’t ye dooal an’ greet, my deary!”—for he saw that I was crying—“if he should come this very night I’d not refuse to answer his call. For life be, after all, only a waitin’ for somethin’ else than what we’re doin’; and death be all that we can rightly depend on. But I’m content, for it’s comin’ to me, my deary, and comin’ quick. It may be comin’ while we be lookin’ and wonderin’. Maybe it’s in that wind out over the sea that’s bringin’ with it loss and wreck, and sore distress, and sad hearts. Look! look!” he cried suddenly. “There’s something in that wind and in the hoast beyont that sounds, and looks, and tastes, and smells like death. It’s in the air; I feel it comin’. Lord, make me answer cheerful when my call comes!” He held up his arms devoutly, and raised his hat. His mouth moved as though he were praying. After a few minutes’ silence, he got up, shook hands with me, and blessed me, and said good-bye, and hobbled off. It all touched me, and upset me very much.",

Lucy is more anxious than ever, but is otherwise well. Last night looked very threatening, and the local fishermen predict a storm is on its way. I need to try and watch the weather and learn its signs. Today is a grey day; as I write, the sun is hidden behind thick clouds high above Kettleness. Everything is grey—except for the vividly green grass, which looks like emeralds among it; grey, earthy rock; grey clouds, touched by a hint of sun at the far edge, hang over the grey sea, into which sandy points stretch out like grey fingers. The sea is crashing over the shallows and sandy areas with a roar, muffled by the sea-mists drifting inland. The horizon is lost in a grey mist. All is immense; the clouds are piled up like colossal rocks, and there is a deep rumbling sound over the sea that feels like a prediction of disaster. Dark figures are visible on the beach here and there, sometimes partly obscured by the mist, appearing like \"men walking like trees.\" The fishing boats are hurrying back to port, rising and falling with the ground swell as they enter the harbor, leaning heavily to one side. Here comes old Mr. Swales. He is coming directly towards me, and I can see, by the way he touches his hat, that he wishes to speak.... I was quite moved by the change in the poor old man. When he sat down beside me, he said in a very gentle voice:— \"I want to tell you something, miss.\" I could see he was uncomfortable, so I took his poor old wrinkled hand in mine and encouraged him to speak freely; so he said, still holding my hand:— \"I'm afraid, my dear, that I must have upset you with all the morbid things I've been saying about the dead, and that sort of thing, for weeks now; but I didn't mean them, and I want you to remember that after I'm gone. We old people who are a bit confused, and with one foot in the grave, don't really like to think about it, and we don't want to feel scared of it; and that's why I've taken to making light of it, so I could cheer up my own heart a little. But, bless your heart, miss, I'm not afraid of dying, not at all; I just don't want to die if I can help it. My time must be near now, because I am old, and a hundred years is too much for anyone to expect; and I'm so close that Death is already sharpening his blade. You see, I can't break the habit of joking about it all at once; my jaw will just keep moving as it's used to. Soon, the Angel of Death will sound his trumpet for me. But don't you grieve and cry, my dear!\"—for he saw that I was weeping—\"if he should come this very night, I wouldn't refuse to answer his call. For life is, after all, just waiting for something other than what we're doing; and death is all that we can truly depend on. But I'm content, for it's coming to me, my dear, and coming fast. It may be coming while we are looking and wondering. Maybe it's in that wind from over the sea that's bringing with it loss and shipwreck, and terrible suffering, and sad hearts. Look! look!\" he cried suddenly. \"There's something in that wind and in the mist beyond that sounds, and looks, and tastes, and smells like death. It's in the air; I feel it coming. Lord, make me answer cheerfully when my call comes!\" He lifted his arms devoutly, and raised his hat. His mouth moved as though he were praying.

Lucy is more restless than usual but otherwise healthy. Last night was ominous, and the fishermen say a storm is coming. I will try to observe and learn how to read the weather. Today is gloomy and overcast; the sun is hidden by thick clouds high above Kettleness. Everything looks gray, except for the bright green grass, which stands out like emeralds. Gray rocks, gray clouds with sunshine at their edges, and gray sea stretch to the misty horizon. Waves crash over the shallow sand with a hushed roar as sea mist rolls in, and the distant horizon disappears into the haze. The whole scene feels vast and foreboding, with towering clouds and a rumbling sound from the sea that seems like an omen. I see dark shapes on the beach, partially veiled by the mist and looking like \"men walking as trees.\" Fishing boats are hurrying home, rising and falling in the waves as they enter the harbor. Here comes old Mr. Swales. From the way he lifts his hat, it’s clear he wants to talk. \n\nI've noticed a real change in him lately.

He admitted he might have upset me with all his jokes and comments about death over the past weeks, but he didn’t mean them. He asked me to remember this after he's gone. He explained that old people, who sense their time is near, try not to be afraid by making light of it, just to cheer themselves up a bit. But he isn’t afraid of dying—just not eager for it to happen. He knows his time is likely near since he is old, and no one can expect to live forever. He joked that \"the Old Man\" (death) is already sharpening his scythe. He can’t stop joking about death out of habit, but soon the Angel of Death will call for him. He saw that I was crying and told me not to grieve; even if death comes tonight, he will answer willingly. Life, he says, is just waiting for something else, and death is the only certainty. He says he is ready and at peace with it, and it may come at any moment. He looked out at the stormy sea and insisted there was something in the wind, in the sounds and smells, that felt like death was near. He prayed aloud, and after a few minutes of silence, said goodbye, blessed me, and walked away. The whole encounter moved and unsettled me deeply."

          "text_segment": "ONE of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been experienced here, with results both strange and unique. The weather had been somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the month of August. Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the great body of holiday-makers laid out yesterday for visits to Mulgrave Woods, Robin Hood’s Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the various trips in the neighbourhood of Whitby. The steamers Emma and Scarborough made trips up and down the coast, and there was an unusual amount of “tripping” both to and from Whitby. The day was unusually fine till the afternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the East Cliff churchyard, and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of sea visible to the north and east, called attention to a sudden show of “mares’-tails” high in the sky to the north-west. The wind was then blowing from the south-west in the mild degree which in barometrical language is ranked “No. 2: light breeze.” The coastguard on duty at once made report, and one old fisherman, who for more than half a century has kept watch on weather signs from the East Cliff, foretold in an emphatic manner the coming of a sudden storm. The approach of sunset was so very beautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly-coloured clouds, that there was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old churchyard to enjoy the beauty. Before the sun dipped below the black mass of Kettleness, standing boldly athwart the western sky, its downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset-colour—flame, purple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold; with here and there masses not large, but of seemingly absolute blackness, in all sorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes. The experience was not lost on the painters, and doubtless some of the sketches of the “Prelude to the Great Storm” will grace the R. A. and R. I. walls in May next. More than one captain made up his mind then and there that his “cobble” or his “mule,” as they term the different classes of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed. The wind fell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight there was a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which, on the approach of thunder, affects persons of a sensitive nature. There were but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting steamers, which usually “hug” the shore so closely, kept well to seaward, and but few fishing-boats were in sight. The only sail noticeable was a foreign schooner with all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards. The foolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for comment whilst she remained in sight, and efforts were made to signal her to reduce sail in face of her danger. Before the night shut down she was seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating swell of the sea,\n“As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean.”\nShortly before ten o’clock the stillness of the air grew quite oppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep inland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard, and the band on the pier, with its lively French air, was like a discord in the great harmony of nature’s silence. A little after midnight came a strange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air began to carry a strange, faint, hollow booming.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Whitby was recently struck by one of the most extreme and sudden storms ever recorded, leading to peculiar and unprecedented consequences. Although the weather had been warm, it wasn't unusually so for August. Saturday evening was exceptionally clear, prompting many tourists to plan day trips to various nearby locations like Mulgrave Woods, Robin Hood’s Bay, and others around Whitby. Coastal steamers like the Emma and Scarborough also ran trips, and there was a great deal of travel activity both to and from Whitby. The day remained remarkably pleasant until the afternoon. At this point, some local observers in the East Cliff churchyard, a vantage point offering a wide view of the sea to the north and east, pointed out the sudden appearance of high-altitude cirrus clouds (\"mares'-tails\") in the northwest sky. The wind at the time was a gentle south-westerly, classified as \"light breeze\" on the Beaufort scale. The duty coastguard immediately reported this, and a long-time fisherman, who had watched weather patterns from the East Cliff for over fifty years, emphatically predicted a sudden storm was coming. The sunset that evening was extraordinarily beautiful, with magnificent, richly coloured clouds, attracting a considerable crowd to the cliff walk by the old churchyard to admire it. Before the sun disappeared behind the dark shape of Kettleness in the west, its descent was marked by countless clouds displaying every sunset hue—flame, purple, pink, green, violet, and shades of gold—interspersed with smaller, intensely dark masses of various, sharply defined shapes, resembling enormous silhouettes. This striking visual spectacle was not lost on artists, and it is expected that some of their sketches depicting the \"Prelude to the Great Storm\" will be featured in prominent art exhibitions next May. Based on the impending conditions, several boat captains decided to keep their different types of vessels, known locally as \"cobbles\" or \"mules,\" safely in the harbour until the storm had passed. The wind died down completely during the evening, resulting in a complete calm, oppressive heat, and that peculiar tension around midnight that affects sensitive individuals before a thunderstorm. Few lights were visible at sea, as even coastal steamers typically staying close to shore kept well out, and only a few fishing boats were in sight. The only noticeable vessel was a foreign schooner sailing with all sails set, seemingly heading west. Its officers' apparent recklessness or lack of knowledge was a frequent topic of discussion while it was visible, and attempts were made to signal it to reduce sail given the danger. Before nightfall, it was seen with its sails slack, gently rolling on the ocean's swell, appearing \"As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean.\" Shortly before ten o'clock, the air's stillness became quite stifling, and the silence was so profound that distant sounds like the bleating of a sheep inland or a dog barking in town were clearly audible, making the lively French music from the band on the pier sound jarring against the deep natural quiet. Just after midnight, a strange sound emanated from over the sea, and high overhead, the air began to carry an odd, faint, hollow booming noise.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "A record-breaking and extremely sudden storm has just struck this area, producing unusual and remarkable effects. Although the weather had been a bit hot, it was nothing out of the ordinary for August. Saturday evening was as pleasant as ever, and crowds of people spent the previous day enjoying outings to nearby places such as Mulgrave Woods, Robin Hood’s Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and various local excursions around Whitby. The steamships Emma and Scarborough cruised up and down the coast, and many people made round trips to and from Whitby. The day remained exceptionally beautiful until the afternoon, when some regulars at the East Cliff churchyard—who typically watch the wide views of the sea to the north and east—noticed some sudden streaks of “mares’-tails” clouds high in the northwest sky. At the time, a gentle breeze from the southwest was blowing, designated as “No. 2: light breeze” on the barometer scale. The coastguard on duty quickly reported this, and a veteran fisherman, who had kept an eye on weather patterns from East Cliff for over fifty years, strongly predicted a sudden storm was coming. The sunset was particularly striking, with vibrant, colorful clouds spreading across the sky, attracting many to walk along the cliff in the churchyard to admire the view. Before the sun disappeared behind the dark mass of Kettleness, the sky was filled with clouds of every sunset shade—red, purple, pink, green, violet, and gold—mixed with patches of deep blackness shaped like giant silhouettes. Artists were inspired by the scene, and likely, some will later display sketches titled “Prelude to the Great Storm” at the R.A. and R.I. exhibitions in May. Several captains immediately decided to keep their boats—whether cobbles or mules, as they are called—harbored until the storm passed. During the evening, the wind died down entirely. By midnight, there was total calm, oppressive heat, and a tense atmosphere often felt before a thunderstorm, particularly by sensitive people. There were hardly any lights out at sea; even the coastal steamers, which typically travel close to shore, stayed far out, and few fishing boats were seen. The only visible sail was from a foreign schooner fully rigged, apparently sailing west. Her officers were widely criticized for their recklessness or ignorance while she was visible, and several attempts were made to signal her to reduce sail due to the danger. Before night fully fell, she was drifting, her sails loose, rocking gently on the rolling sea—\"As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean.\" Just before 10 o’clock, the air became stifling, and the silence so profound that one could hear a sheep bleating far inland or a dog barking in town. Even the pier band’s lively French music seemed out of place against nature’s quiet. A little after midnight, a mysterious sound arose from over the sea, and a faint, deep booming could be heard high above."

With a rapidity which, at the time, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to realize, the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed. The waves rose in growing fury, each overtopping its fellow, till in a very few minutes the lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster. White-crested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the shelving cliffs; others broke over the piers, and with their spume swept the lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier of Whitby Harbour. The wind roared like thunder, and blew with such force that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet, or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions. It was found necessary to clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers, or else the fatalities of the night would have been increased manifold. To add to the difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea-fog came drifting inland—white, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly fashion, so dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were touching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death, and many a one shuddered as the wreaths of sea-mist swept by. At times the mist cleared, and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of the lightning, which now came thick and fast, followed by such sudden peals of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock of the footsteps of the storm.\nSome of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of absorbing interest—the sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with each wave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to snatch at and whirl away into space; here and there a fishing-boat, with a rag of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast; now and again the white wings of a storm-tossed sea-bird. On the summit of the East Cliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment, but had not yet been tried. The officers in charge of it got it into working order, and in the pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea. Once or twice its service was most effective, as when a fishing-boat, with gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidance of the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the piers. As each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of joy from the mass of people on shore, a shout which for a moment seemed to cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush.\nBefore long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner with all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed earlier in the evening. The wind had by this time backed to the east, and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they realized the terrible danger in which she now was. Between her and the port lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time to time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter, it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the harbour. It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so great that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost visible, and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such speed that, in the words of one old salt, “she must fetch up somewhere, if it was only in hell.” Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than any hitherto—a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things like a grey pall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing, for the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the booming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder than before. The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour mouth across the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited breathless. The wind suddenly shifted to the north-east, and the remnant of the sea-fog melted in the blast; and then, mirabile dictu, between the piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed, swept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and gained the safety of the harbour. The searchlight followed her, and a shudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a corpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each motion of the ship. No other form could be seen on deck at all.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Suddenly, the storm erupted without warning. Nature's appearance transformed with astonishing speed, seeming unbelievable at the time and even afterwards difficult to grasp. The waves grew increasingly violent, one towering over the next, quickly turning the previously calm sea into a raging, destructive force. Waves topped with white foam crashed furiously onto the flat sand and surged up the sloping cliffs; others broke over the piers, their spray coating the lamps of the lighthouses at the end of Whitby Harbour's piers. The wind roared like thunder and blew with such power that strong men struggled to remain upright or clung tightly to the iron supports. It became necessary to evacuate the piers of spectators to prevent a massive increase in casualties that night. Adding to the peril and difficulty, thick sea-fog began drifting inland—white, wet clouds that swept by like ghosts, so damp and cold it was easy to imagine them as the spirits of those lost at sea, their icy hands touching the living. Many people shivered as the tendrils of mist passed by. Occasionally, the mist would clear, allowing a view of the sea for some distance under the intense glare of frequent, rapid lightning. This was followed by sudden, powerful claps of thunder that seemed to make the sky itself tremble under the storm's impact.\nSome of the scenes revealed were incredibly grand and captivating—the sea, running as high as mountains, hurled vast amounts of white foam skyward with each wave, which the storm seemed to tear away and scatter. Here and there, a fishing boat with a small sail would be seen desperately racing for cover ahead of the wind; now and then, the white wings of a sea-bird battered by the storm. At the top of the East Cliff, the new searchlight was ready for its first use but hadn't been tested yet. The crew responsible for it quickly got it operational, and during lulls in the advancing mist, they swept its beam across the sea's surface. Its assistance proved very effective once or twice, like when a fishing boat, its side under water, rushed into the harbour, guided by the protective light to avoid crashing into the piers. As each boat reached the safety of the port, a cheer of relief went up from the crowd on shore, a shout that momentarily seemed to cut through the gale before being swallowed by its fury.\nBefore long, the searchlight spotted a schooner some distance away, sails fully set, appearing to be the same ship noticed earlier that evening. The wind had now shifted to the east, and the observers on the cliff shivered as they recognized the extreme danger the ship faced. Between her and the harbour lay the large, flat reef that had caused many fine ships to wreck over time. With the wind blowing from its current direction, it would be utterly impossible for her to reach the harbour entrance. High tide was approaching, but the waves were so immense that in the dips between them, the shallow areas near the shore were almost visible. The schooner, with all sails up, was rushing at such speed that, as one old sailor put it, “she's bound to end up somewhere, even if it's in hell.” Then came another surge of sea-fog, thicker than any before—a vast expanse of damp mist that seemed to envelop everything like a grey shroud, leaving only the sense of hearing useful to people. The roar of the storm, the crash of thunder, and the booming of the colossal waves penetrated the wet darkness even more loudly than before. The searchlight's beam remained fixed on the harbour mouth across the East Pier, anticipating the impact, and people waited breathlessly. Suddenly, the wind changed direction to the north-east, and the remaining sea-fog was dispersed by the blast. And then, remarkably, between the piers, leaping from wave to wave as it surged at full speed, the strange schooner swept into the harbour ahead of the wind, sails still fully set, and reached safety. The searchlight tracked her, and a shiver went through everyone who saw her, for a corpse was tied to the helm, its head drooping, swinging horrifically back and forth with each movement of the ship. No other figure was visible anywhere on deck.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Suddenly, the storm struck with astonishing speed, transforming the entire scene in ways difficult to comprehend. The sea, calm just moments before, became a wild, monstrous force as waves grew taller and more violent, crashing onto the beaches and cliffs with relentless power. Some waves swept over the piers, spraying the lighthouse lanterns at Whitby Harbour’s ends. The wind howled with such intensity that it was hard for even the strongest people to stay upright or hold onto railings, prompting authorities to evacuate the piers for safety. Thick banks of cold, wet sea fog rolled in, so eerie and chilling that people felt as though the spirits of drowned sailors brushed past them, sending shivers down many spines. Occasionally the mist parted, revealing the raging sea in flashes of lightning, with thunder shaking the sky. These moments showed scenes of dramatic grandeur: towering, foamy waves hurled into the air; fishing boats with tattered sails fleeing for refuge; and the rare glimpse of a storm-battered seabird. On the East Cliff, a new searchlight, not yet tested, was hurriedly prepared and swung across the waves between breaks in the fog. This proved invaluable when a struggling fishing boat, guided by the beam, managed to find the safety of the harbour, drawing cheers from those on shore, though their voices were soon lost in the storm.\n\nSoon, the searchlight illuminated a schooner in the distance, its sails fully set—the same ship seen earlier. With the wind now coming from the east, onlookers grew anxious, knowing she was headed toward dangerous reefs that had claimed many vessels, and it seemed impossible that she would reach the harbour safely. Though it was high tide, the massive waves exposed the sandy shoals, and the schooner hurtled forward at breakneck speed, prompting a seasoned sailor to remark grimly that she was bound to crash, even if it was in hell. An even thicker blanket of sea fog descended, muffling everything but the sounds of the tempest, thunder, and crashing waves. The searchlight was kept fixed on the harbour entrance, where the schooner might emerge, and everyone watched anxiously. When the wind suddenly shifted to the northeast, the fog was blown away—and astonishingly, the schooner appeared, leaping from wave to wave with all sails unfurled, making it safely between the piers into the harbour. The searchlight tracked her, and a chill went through the crowd: tied to the helm was a corpse, head hanging and swaying grotesquely with the ship’s movements. No other person was visible on deck."

However, all took place more quickly than it takes to write these words. The schooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many storms into the south-east corner of the pier jutting under the East Cliff, known locally as Tate Hill Pier.\nThere was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on the sand heap. Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the “top-hammer” came crashing down. But, strangest of all, the very instant the shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from below, as if shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow on the sand.

Yet, the sequence of events unfolded with incredible speed. The schooner did not linger but surged across the port, driving itself onto a substantial pile of sand and gravel, built up over time by numerous tides and storms, situated in the south-east corner of the pier extending beneath the East Cliff, a spot known locally as Tate Hill Pier. Naturally, there was a significant impact when the ship collided with the sandbank. Every mast, cable, and support was put under immense stress, causing some of the upper rigging to collapse loudly. Most astonishingly, however, the very second the ship made contact with the shore, a massive dog leaped onto the deck from below, as if launched by the impact itself, and immediately dashed to the front, jumping from the bow onto the sand. Heading directly towards the sheer cliff, where the graveyard overlooks the path to the East Pier at such a steep angle that some of the flat gravestones, called \"thruff-steans\" or \"through-stones\" in the local Whitby dialect, actually hang over where the supporting cliff has eroded, it vanished into the shadows, which seemed even deeper just beyond the beam of the searchlight.",

The ship crashed heavily as it landed on the sand, straining every mast and rope, and some of the upper parts of the ship broke off and fell. Most astonishingly, as soon as the ship touched shore, a huge dog leapt up from below deck, as though launched by the impact, ran to the bow, jumped onto the sand, and headed straight for the cliff. It raced to the spot where the graveyard almost hangs over the lane to the East Pier, at the place where gravestones stick out after some of the cliff has eroded.

          "text_segment": "It so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier, as all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were out on the heights above. Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern side of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the first to climb on board. The men working the searchlight, after scouring the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned the light on the derelict and kept it there. The coastguard ran aft, and when he came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled at once as though under some sudden emotion. This seemed to pique general curiosity, and quite a number of people began to run. It is a good way round from the West Cliff by the Drawbridge to Tate Hill Pier, but your correspondent is a fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd. When I arrived, however, I found already assembled on the pier a crowd, whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board. By the courtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your correspondent, permitted to climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman whilst actually lashed to the wheel.\nIt was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, for not often can such a sight have been seen. The man was simply fastened by his hands, tied one over the other, to a spoke of the wheel. Between the inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which it was fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast by the binding cords. The poor fellow may have been seated at one time, but the flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of the wheel and dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with which he was tied had cut the flesh to the bone. Accurate note was made of the state of things, and a doctor—Surgeon J. M. Caffyn, of 33, East Elliot Place—who came immediately after me, declared, after making examination, that the man must have been dead for quite two days. In his pocket was a bottle, carefully corked, empty save for a little roll of paper, which proved to be the addendum to the log. The coastguard said the man must have tied up his own hands, fastening the knots with his teeth. The fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some complications, later on, in the Admiralty Court; for coastguards cannot claim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a derelict. Already, however, the legal tongues are wagging, and one young law student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already completely sacrificed, his property being held in contravention of the statutes of mortmain, since the tiller, as emblemship, if not proof, of delegated possession, is held in a dead hand. It is needless to say that the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place where he held his honourable watch and ward till death—a steadfastness as noble as that of the young Casabianca—and placed in the mortuary to await inquest.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "At that specific time, Tate Hill Pier was empty as the residents of nearby houses were either sleeping or were positioned higher up on the surrounding hills. Consequently, the coastguard stationed on the eastern side of the harbour, who immediately descended to the small pier, was the initial person to board the vessel. The crew operating the searchlight had scanned the harbour entrance without success and then directed their light onto the abandoned ship, keeping it illuminated. The coastguard proceeded towards the stern and, upon reaching the ship's wheel, leaned in for a closer look but instantly drew back as if startled by a sudden realization. This action seemed to spark widespread interest, prompting a considerable number of people to start running towards the pier. It is quite a distance from the West Cliff, across the Drawbridge, to Tate Hill Pier, but as your reporter is a competent runner, I managed to arrive well before the main crowd. However, upon arrival, I discovered a gathering already present on the pier whom the coastguard and police were preventing from boarding. Through the courtesy of the chief boatman, I, as your reporter, was granted permission to go aboard the deck, becoming part of a small group who observed the deceased sailor still secured to the wheel. It was understandable that the coastguard was startled, perhaps even filled with awe, for such a sight is surely a rarity. The man was simply bound by his hands, positioned one over the other, to a single spoke of the wheel. A crucifix was placed between his inner hand and the wood, with the rosary beads securing it wrapped around both his wrists and the wheel itself, all held firmly by the binding cords. The unfortunate man might have been seated initially, but the relentless movement of the sails and the buffering action transmitted through the rudder and wheel dragged him back and forth, causing the cords used to tie him to cut deeply into his flesh, down to the bone. The situation was meticulously documented, and a doctor, Surgeon J. M. Caffyn of 33 East Elliot Place, who arrived shortly after me, declared, following his examination, that the man had likely been dead for approximately two days. A bottle, carefully sealed with a cork, was found in his pocket; it was empty except for a small rolled-up piece of paper, which was identified as an addition to the ship's log. The coastguard suggested the man must have tied his own hands, securing the knots with his teeth. The fact that a coastguard was the first to board might prevent certain complications later in the Admiralty Court, as coastguards are not entitled to salvage claims, which are the right of the first civilian to enter a derelict vessel. Nevertheless, legal discussions have already commenced, and a young law student is loudly asserting that the owner's rights are entirely forfeited, arguing that the property is held in violation of the statutes of mortmain because the tiller, serving as an emblem or even proof of delegated possession, is now held in a dead man's hand. It goes without saying that the deceased helmsman has been respectfully unbound from his post where he kept his dedicated vigil until death—a display of steadfastness as noble as that of young Casabianca—and has been transferred to the mortuary to await a formal inquest.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "At the time, nobody was present on Tate Hill Pier because local residents were either asleep or had gone up to the high ground. As a result, the coastguard stationed on the east side of the harbour was the first to reach and board the ship. The crew operating the searchlight had already swept the harbour entrance without finding anything and then focused their beam on the abandoned vessel. The coastguard hurried to the back of the ship, and upon reaching the steering wheel, leaned over to inspect it—immediately recoiling in shock, which drew the attention of others and set off a rush toward the scene. Although the path from West Cliff by the Drawbridge to Tate Hill Pier is quite lengthy, your correspondent managed to arrive ahead of the main group. Upon arrival, he saw that a crowd had already gathered on the pier, but police and the coastguard were preventing anyone from boarding. Thanks to the chief boatman, the correspondent was allowed onto the ship and became one of the few witnesses to see the dead sailor still tied to the wheel. The coastguard’s shock was understandable, as such a scene must have been rare: the man’s hands were fastened together and bound to a spoke of the wheel, with a crucifix sandwiched between his inner hand and the wood. The rosary that held the crucifix was wrapped around both the wrists and the wheel, and everything was secured tightly with cords. It appeared that the man may have originally been sitting, but the constant buffeting of the sails and movement of the rudder had dragged him around, so that the cords cut deeply into his flesh. Careful records were made, and a doctor—Surgeon J. M. Caffyn of 33, East Elliot Place—arrived soon after and declared that the sailor had been dead for at least two days. The man’s pocket contained an empty bottle sealed with a cork, inside which was a small roll of paper: an addendum to the ship’s log. The coastguard believed the sailor had tied his own hands, making the knots with his teeth. The coastguard’s being first aboard might help avoid legal disputes in Admiralty Court, since only civilians, not coastguards, can claim salvage rights for boarding a derelict first. Nevertheless, legal debates had already started, with a law student arguing that the owner’s salvage rights had been lost because, since the tiller was held by a dead hand, the statutes of mortmain applied. The dead steersman, who had remained faithfully at his post until death, was treated with respect and taken to the mortuary to await the inquest, his steadfastness likened to that of young Casabianca."

I shall send, in time for your next issue, further details of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously into harbour in the storm.\nWhitby\n9 August.—The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the storm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself. It turns out that the schooner is a Russian from Varna, and is called the Demeter. She is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, with only a small amount of cargo—a number of great wooden boxes filled with mould. This cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor, Mr. S. F. Billington, of 7, The Crescent, who this morning went aboard and formally took possession of the goods consigned to him. The Russian consul, too, acting for the charter-party, took formal possession of the ship, and paid all harbour dues, etc. Nothing is talked about here to-day except the strange coincidence; the officials of the Board of Trade have been most exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with existing regulations. As the matter is to be a “nine days’ wonder,” they are evidently determined that there shall be no cause of after complaint. A good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which landed when the ship struck, and more than a few of the members of the S. P. C. A., which is very strong in Whitby, have tried to befriend the animal. To the general disappointment, however, it was not to be found; it seems to have disappeared entirely from the town. It may be that it was frightened and made its way on to the moors, where it is still hiding in terror. There are some who look with dread on such a possibility, lest later on it should in itself become a danger, for it is evidently a fierce brute. Early this morning a large dog, a half-bred mastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to Tate Hill Pier, was found dead in the roadway opposite to its master’s yard. It had been fighting, and manifestly had had a savage opponent, for its throat was torn away, and its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw.",

I will provide additional details about the derelict ship that entered the harbour so remarkably during the storm, for your next publication.\n\nWhitby, August 9th.—The developments following the strange arrival of the abandoned ship in the storm last night are nearly more astonishing than the event itself. It turns out the schooner is a Russian vessel from Varna, named the Demeter. It carries mostly silver sand as ballast, with a small amount of cargo consisting of several large wooden boxes filled with soil. This cargo was addressed to Mr. S. F. Billington, a solicitor in Whitby located at 7, The Crescent, who boarded the ship this morning and formally took possession of the consigned goods. The Russian consul, representing the charter-party, also formally took charge of the ship and covered all harbour charges, etc. The unusual circumstances are the only subject of discussion here today; the Board of Trade officials have been exceptionally diligent in ensuring full compliance with current regulations. Since this matter is expected to cause a brief stir, they are clearly determined to prevent any subsequent issues. There was considerable interest regarding the dog that came ashore when the ship grounded, and quite a few members of the S. P. C. A., which is very active in Whitby, tried to help the animal. However, to everyone's disappointment, it could not be found; it seems to have vanished entirely from the town. It might have been scared and gone onto the moors, where it could still be hiding in terror. Some people regard this possibility with apprehension, fearing it might become dangerous later, as it is clearly a fierce animal. Early this morning, a large dog, a cross between a mastiff and another breed, owned by a coal merchant near Tate Hill Pier, was discovered dead in the road opposite its owner's yard. It had clearly been fighting and faced a savage adversary, as its throat was torn away and its stomach was slit open as if by a brutal claw.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The violent storm is already subsiding, people are heading home, and the sky is turning red above the Yorkshire hills. I plan to send more information about the mysterious derelict ship that managed to enter the harbor during the storm in time for your next issue. \n\nWhitby, 9 August—What happened after the unexpected arrival of the derelict last night is even more astonishing than the event itself. The ship is revealed to be the Russian schooner Demeter, sailing from Varna. It is carrying mostly silver sand as ballast along with several large wooden boxes filled with earth. These boxes were consigned to a local solicitor, Mr. S. F. Billington of 7, The Crescent, who boarded the ship this morning to formally receive them. The Russian consul, representing the ship's charterers, also took official possession of the vessel and paid all the required harbor fees. The entire town is abuzz over this strange incident; officials from the Board of Trade have been strict in making sure all rules have been followed. As this is likely to remain a topic of great interest for some time, the authorities are keen to avoid any later complaints.\n\nMuch attention has been given to the dog that leaped from the ship when it ran aground, and several members of the local S.P.C.A. have attempted to find and care for it. Regrettably, the dog has vanished without a trace; it is thought it may have fled in fear to the moors. Some people are worried that, if the fierce creature is still lurking about, it could pose a danger. Early this morning, a large mongrel mastiff belonging to a coal merchant near Tate Hill Pier was found dead in the road outside its owner’s yard. The dog had clearly been in a vicious fight, as its throat was torn out and its belly ripped open as though by a wild animal’s claw."

The greatest interest, however, is with regard to the paper found in the bottle, which was to-day produced at the inquest; and a more strange narrative than the two between them unfold it has not been my lot to come across. As there is no motive for concealment, I am permitted to use them, and accordingly send you a rescript, simply omitting technical details of seamanship and supercargo. It almost seems as though the captain had been seized with some kind of mania before he had got well into blue water, and that this had developed persistently throughout the voyage. Of course my statement must be taken cum grano, since I am writing from the dictation of a clerk of the Russian consul, who kindly translated for me, time being short.\nLOG OF THE “DEMETER.”\nVarna to Whitby.\nWritten 18 July, things so strange happening, that I shall keep accurate note henceforth till we land.\nOn 6 July we finished taking in cargo, silver sand and boxes of earth. At noon set sail. East wind, fresh. Crew, five hands ... two mates, cook, and myself (captain).\nOn 11 July at dawn entered Bosphorus. Boarded by Turkish Customs officers. Backsheesh. All correct. Under way at 4 p. m.\nOn 12 July through Dardanelles. More Customs officers and flagboat of guarding squadron. Backsheesh again. Work of officers thorough, but quick. Want us off soon. At dark passed into Archipelago.\nOn 13 July passed Cape Matapan. Crew dissatisfied about something. Seemed scared, but would not speak out.\nOn 14 July was somewhat anxious about crew. Men all steady fellows, who sailed with me before. Mate could not make out what was wrong; they only told him there was something, and crossed themselves. Mate lost temper with one of them that day and struck him. Expected fierce quarrel, but all was quiet.\nOn 16 July mate reported in the morning that one of crew, Petrofsky, was missing. Could not account for it. Took larboard watch eight bells last night; was relieved by Abramoff, but did not go to bunk. Men more downcast than ever. All said they expected something of the kind, but would not say more than there was something aboard. Mate getting very impatient with them; feared some trouble ahead.\nOn 17 July, yesterday, one of the men, Olgaren, came to my cabin, and in an awestruck way confided to me that he thought there was a strange man aboard the ship. He said that in his watch he had been sheltering behind the deck-house, as there was a rain-storm, when he saw a tall, thin man, who was not like any of the crew, come up the companion-way, and go along the deck forward, and disappear. He followed cautiously, but when he got to bows found no one, and the hatchways were all closed. He was in a panic of superstitious fear, and I am afraid the panic may spread. To allay it, I shall to-day search entire ship carefully from stem to stern.\nLater in the day I got together the whole crew, and told them, as they evidently thought there was some one in the ship, we would search from stem to stern. First mate angry; said it was folly, and to yield to such foolish ideas would demoralise the men; said he would engage to keep them out of trouble with a handspike. I let him take the helm, while the rest began thorough search, all keeping abreast, with lanterns: we left no corner unsearched. As there were only the big wooden boxes, there were no odd corners where a man could hide. Men much relieved when search over, and went back to work cheerfully. First mate scowled, but said nothing.\n22 July.—Rough weather last three days, and all hands busy with sails—no time to be frightened. Men seem to have forgotten their dread. Mate cheerful again, and all on good terms. Praised men for work in bad weather. Passed Gibralter and out through Straits. All well.\n24 July.—There seems some doom over this ship. Already a hand short, and entering on the Bay of Biscay with wild weather ahead, and yet last night another man lost—disappeared. Like the first, he came off his watch and was not seen again. Men all in a panic of fear; sent a round robin, asking to have double watch, as they fear to be alone. Mate angry. Fear there will be some trouble, as either he or the men will do some violence.\n28 July.—Four days in hell, knocking about in a sort of maelstrom, and the wind a tempest. No sleep for any one. Men all worn out. Hardly know how to set a watch, since no one fit to go on. Second mate volunteered to steer and watch, and let men snatch a few hours’ sleep. Wind abating; seas still terrific, but feel them less, as ship is steadier.\n29 July.—Another tragedy. Had single watch to-night, as crew too tired to double. When morning watch came on deck could find no one except steersman. Raised outcry, and all came on deck. Thorough search, but no one found. Are now without second mate, and crew in a panic. Mate and I agreed to go armed henceforth and wait for any sign of cause.\n30 July.—Last night. Rejoiced we are nearing England. Weather fine, all sails set. Retired worn out; slept soundly; awaked by mate telling me that both man of watch and steersman missing. Only self and mate and two hands left to work ship.\n1 August.—Two days of fog, and not a sail sighted. Had hoped when in the English Channel to be able to signal for help or get in somewhere. Not having power to work sails, have to run before wind. Dare not lower, as could not raise them again. We seem to be drifting to some terrible doom. Mate now more demoralised than either of men. His stronger nature seems to have worked inwardly against himself. Men are beyond fear, working stolidly and patiently, with minds made up to worst. They are Russian, he Roumanian.\n2 August, midnight.—Woke up from few minutes’ sleep by hearing a cry, seemingly outside my port. Could see nothing in fog. Rushed on deck, and ran against mate. Tells me heard cry and ran, but no sign of man on watch. One more gone. Lord, help us! Mate says we must be past Straits of Dover, as in a moment of fog lifting he saw North Foreland, just as he heard the man cry out. If so we are now off in the North Sea, and only God can guide us in the fog, which seems to move with us; and God seems to have deserted us.\n3 August.—At midnight I went to relieve the man at the wheel, and when I got to it found no one there. The wind was steady, and as we ran before it there was no yawing. I dared not leave it, so shouted for the mate. After a few seconds he rushed up on deck in his flannels. He looked wild-eyed and haggard, and I greatly fear his reason has given way. He came close to me and whispered hoarsely, with his mouth to my ear, as though fearing the very air might hear: “It is here; I know it, now. On the watch last night I saw It, like a man, tall and thin, and ghastly pale. It was in the bows, and looking out. I crept behind It, and gave It my knife; but the knife went through It, empty as the air.” And as he spoke he took his knife and drove it savagely into space. Then he went on: “But It is here, and I’ll find It. It is in the hold, perhaps in one of those boxes. I’ll unscrew them one by one and see. You work the helm.” And, with a warning look and his finger on his lip, he went below. There was springing up a choppy wind, and I could not leave the helm. I saw him come out on deck again with a tool-chest and a lantern, and go down the forward hatchway. He is mad, stark, raving mad, and it’s no use my trying to stop him. He can’t hurt those big boxes: they are invoiced as “clay,” and to pull them about is as harmless a thing as he can do. So here I stay, and mind the helm, and write these notes. I can only trust in God and wait till the fog clears. Then, if I can’t steer to any harbour with the wind that is, I shall cut down sails and lie by, and signal for help....\nIt is nearly all over now. Just as I was beginning to hope that the mate would come out calmer—for I heard him knocking away at something in the hold, and work is good for him—there came up the hatchway a sudden, startled scream, which made my blood run cold, and up on the deck he came as if shot from a gun—a raging madman, with his eyes rolling and his face convulsed with fear. “Save me! save me!” he cried, and then looked round on the blanket of fog. His horror turned to despair, and in a steady voice he said: “You had better come too, captain, before it is too late. He is there. I know the secret now. The sea will save me from Him, and it is all that is left!” Before I could say a word, or move forward to seize him, he sprang on the bulwark and deliberately threw himself into the sea. I suppose I know the secret too, now. It was this madman who had got rid of the men one by one, and now he has followed them himself. God help me! How am I to account for all these horrors when I get to port? When I get to port! Will that ever be?\n4 August.—Still fog, which the sunrise cannot pierce. I know there is sunrise because I am a sailor, why else I know not. I dared not go below, I dared not leave the helm; so here all night I stayed, and in the dimness of the night I saw It—Him! God forgive me, but the mate was right to jump overboard. It was better to die like a man; to die like a sailor in blue water no man can object. But I am captain, and I must not leave my ship. But I shall baffle this fiend or monster, for I shall tie my hands to the wheel when my strength begins to fail, and along with them I shall tie that which He—It!—dare not touch; and then, come good wind or foul, I shall save my soul, and my honour as a captain. I am growing weaker, and the night is coming on. If He can look me in the face again, I may not have time to act.... If we are wrecked, mayhap this bottle may be found, and those who find it may understand; if not, ... well, then all men shall know that I have been true to my trust. God and the Blessed Virgin and the saints help a poor ignorant soul trying to do his duty....",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Later on, thanks to the kindness of the Board of Trade's inspector, I was allowed to examine the logbook of the ship named the *Demeter*. The entries in the logbook were current up until three days before it was found, but they contained nothing particularly noteworthy, except for records concerning crew members who had gone missing. However, the document that holds the most significance is the paper discovered inside the bottle, which was presented during the inquest today. The combined narrative revealed by these two items is the strangest I have ever encountered. As there is no reason to keep this information confidential, I have been granted permission to share it. Consequently, I am providing a summary, omitting only the technical details relating to seafaring and cargo management. It almost appears as though the captain began suffering from some form of mental instability before the ship was far out at sea, and that this condition steadily worsened throughout the journey. Naturally, you should regard my account with some reservation (*cum grano*), given that I am writing based on the hurried translation provided by a clerk for the Russian consul, due to time constraints.\n\nLOG OF THE “DEMETER.”\nVoyage from Varna to Whitby.\n\nJuly 18: I am beginning to keep precise notes from this date forward until we reach land, as remarkably strange events are occurring.\n\nJuly 6: We finished loading our cargo, which included silver sand and wooden boxes filled with earth. We set sail at noon with a fresh east wind. The crew consists of five sailors, two mates, the cook, and myself, the captain.\n\nJuly 11: Entered the Bosphorus at dawn. Turkish Customs officers boarded the ship. Bribes were given. Everything was in order. We resumed sailing at 4 p.m.\n\nJuly 12: Passed through the Dardanelles. More Customs officers and the flagboat of the patrol squadron. More bribes were necessary. The officers conducted a thorough inspection, but they were quick. They seemed eager for us to depart soon. We entered the Archipelago after dark.\n\nJuly 13: Sailed past Cape Matapan. The crew appeared unhappy about something. They seemed scared but refused to speak openly about it.\n\nJuly 14: I became somewhat concerned about the crew's state. They are generally reliable men who have sailed with me before. The mate couldn't figure out what was wrong; they would only say that 'something' was amiss and kept crossing themselves. The mate lost patience with one of them today and struck him. I anticipated a fierce argument, but the reaction was subdued.\n\nJuly 16: In the morning, the mate reported that one of the crew, Petrofsky, was missing. He couldn't explain his disappearance. Petrofsky had been on the larboard watch until eight bells last night; he was relieved by Abramoff but did not go to his bunk. The men are even more despondent than before. They all claimed they expected something like this but would only repeat that 'something' was onboard. The mate is becoming very frustrated with them; I fear trouble lies ahead.\n\nJuly 17: Yesterday, one of the men, Olgaren, approached my cabin and told me in a hushed, fearful voice that he believed there was a strange man aboard the vessel. He recounted that during his watch, he was sheltering behind the deck-house from a rainstorm when he saw a tall, thin man, whom he did not recognize as any of the crew, come up the companion-way, walk forward along the deck, and disappear. He followed cautiously, but when he reached the bow, he found no one, and all the hatchways were securely closed. He was seized by a panic rooted in superstition, and I worry this fear could become widespread. To calm their fears, I will conduct a thorough search of the entire ship today, from front to back.\n\nLater in the day, I assembled the entire crew and informed them that since they seemed to think someone was on board, we would search the ship completely. The first mate was angry, saying it was absurd and that indulging such foolish notions would demoralize the men; he insisted he could handle them with a handspike to prevent trouble. I let him take charge of the steering while the rest of us conducted a meticulous search, moving together, carrying lanterns; we examined every single corner. As the only significant items were the large wooden boxes, there were no hidden places where a person could conceal themselves. The men seemed greatly relieved after the search was concluded and returned to their work with renewed cheerfulness. The first mate scowled but remained silent.\n\nJuly 22: The weather has been rough for the past three days, keeping everyone busy managing the sails – no one has had time to be frightened. The men appear to have forgotten their earlier dread. The mate is cheerful again, and everyone is getting along well. I commended the men for their effort during the bad weather. We passed Gibraltar and exited the Straits. Everything seems alright.\n\nJuly 24: A sense of doom seems to hang over this ship. We are already short one crew member, and we are entering the Bay of Biscay with the prospect of severe weather, yet last night another man was lost – he disappeared. Like the first one, he finished his watch and was never seen again. The men are completely overwhelmed by fear; they sent a petition signed by everyone (a round robin), requesting double watches as they are afraid to be alone. The mate is furious about this. I fear that conflict may arise, as either he or the men might resort to violence.\n\nJuly 28: We have endured four days in a terrible ordeal, being tossed about in a kind of chaotic storm, with the wind blowing a gale. No one has been able to sleep. The men are utterly exhausted. I barely know how to assign watches, as practically no one is fit to stand duty. The second mate volunteered to steer and keep watch to allow the men a few hours of rest. The wind is decreasing now; the seas are still enormous, but we feel them less because the ship is more stable.\n\nJuly 29: Another terrible event. We had a single watch tonight, as the crew was too exhausted for double duty. When the morning watch came on deck, they could only find the steersman. They raised an alarm, and everyone came up. We searched thoroughly, but no one was found. We are now without the second mate, and the remaining crew are in a panic. The mate and I have agreed to arm ourselves from now on and watch for any sign of what might be causing this.\n\nJuly 30: Last night. I was glad we were nearing England. The weather is fine, and all sails are set. I retired, feeling completely worn out, and slept soundly. I was awakened by the mate telling me that both the man who was on watch and the steersman were missing. Only the mate, two crew members, and I are left to work the ship.\n\nAugust 1: We have had two days of fog, and not a single other sail has been sighted. I had hoped that once we were in the English Channel, we would be able to signal for help or find a place to put in. Since we don't have enough crew to manage the sails, we are forced to drift with the wind. I don't dare lower them, as we wouldn't be able to raise them again. It feels as though we are drifting towards some terrible fate. The mate is now more distraught than either of the two remaining men. His naturally stronger disposition seems to have turned inward and is working against him. The men are past fear, working stolidly and patiently, resigned to the worst possible outcome. They are Russian, while he is Romanian.\n\nAugust 2, midnight: I was abruptly awakened from a brief period of sleep by hearing a cry, which seemed to come from outside my porthole. I couldn't see anything in the fog. I rushed onto the deck and ran into the mate. He told me he also heard the cry and ran out but saw no sign of the man who was supposed to be on watch. Another man is gone. Lord, help us! The mate believes we must have passed the Straits of Dover because, in a moment when the fog briefly lifted, he saw North Foreland, right when he heard the man cry out. If this is true, we are now off in the North Sea, and only God can guide us in this fog, which seems to move with us; and it feels as though God has abandoned us.\n\nAugust 3: At midnight, I went to take over from the man steering the ship, but when I reached the wheel, I found no one there. The wind was steady, and because we were running before it, the ship was not veering off course. I couldn't leave the helm, so I shouted for the mate. After a few seconds, he rushed up onto the deck in his nightclothes. His eyes were wild, and his face was haggard, and I greatly fear he has lost his sanity. He came close to me and whispered hoarsely, pressing his mouth against my ear as though afraid even the air might overhear: “It is here; I finally know it. While on watch last night, I saw It, like a tall, thin, terribly pale man. It was in the bow, looking out. I crept up behind It and thrust my knife into It, but the knife passed through It as if stabbing empty air.” As he spoke, he took out his knife and stabbed fiercely into the space before him. Then he continued: “But It is still here, and I will find It. It is in the hold, perhaps inside one of those boxes. I will open them one by one and see. You keep steering.” And, giving me a warning look and placing a finger on his lip, he went below. A choppy wind was beginning to rise, and I could not leave the helm. I saw him come back out on deck with a tool-chest and a lantern and descend through the forward hatchway. He is insane, completely and utterly mad, and there is no point in my trying to stop him. He cannot harm those large boxes; they are listed in the manifest as “clay,” and moving them around is the most harmless thing he could possibly be doing. So here I remain, minding the helm and writing these notes. I can only place my trust in God and wait until the fog clears. Then, if I cannot steer towards any harbor with the current wind, I will cut down the sails and lie still, and signal for help...\n\nIt is almost entirely over now. Just as I was starting to hope that the mate might emerge calmer – because I could hear him hammering away at something in the hold, and work is usually good for him – a sudden, startled scream came up from the hatchway, sending a chill through my blood. Then he shot up onto the deck as if propelled from a gun – a raving madman, his eyes rolling and his face contorted with fear. “Save me! Save me!” he cried, and then looked around at the thick blanket of fog. His horror transformed into despair, and in a steady voice, he said: “You had better come too, Captain, before it is too late. He is down there. I know the secret now. The sea will save me from Him, and it is the only option left!” Before I could utter a single word, or move forward to grab him, he leaped onto the ship's side and deliberately threw himself into the sea. I suppose I now understand the secret as well. It was this madman who had systematically eliminated the crew members, one by one, and now he has followed them. God help me! How am I ever going to explain all these horrors when I finally reach port? When I reach port! Will that ever happen?\n\nAugust 4: The fog persists, impenetrable even by the sunrise. I know it is sunrise because I am a sailor; otherwise, I would have no way of knowing. I did not dare to go below decks, nor did I dare leave the helm; so I remained here all night, and in the dimness of the night, I saw It – Him! God forgive me, but the mate was right to jump overboard. It was better to die like a man; no one can object to a sailor dying in the clear blue water. But I am the captain, and I must not abandon my ship. Nevertheless, I will thwart this fiend or monster, for I will tie my hands to the wheel when my strength begins to fail, and along with them, I will tie that which He – It! – dare not touch; and then, whether the wind is favorable or foul, I will save my soul and my honor as a captain. I am growing weaker, and night is approaching. If He can look me in the face again, I may not have enough time to act...

May God, the Blessed Virgin, and all the saints help a poor, uninformed soul trying to fulfill his duty...",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Subsequently—I was allowed by the Board of Trade inspector to examine the Demeter’s logbook, which was properly kept until three days before the end, though nothing noteworthy appeared in it except references to crew members who vanished. The most intriguing matter, however, concerns the document found in a bottle and introduced today at the inquest. Together, these sources tell a tale stranger than any I have encountered. As there is no need for secrecy, I am allowed to share these records with you, omitting only the technical nautical terms. It appears the captain developed a type of madness shortly after leaving port, which intensified during the voyage. Of course, take my statement with caution, since I am relying on a translation by a clerk from the Russian consulate, who kindly assisted me due to time constraints.\n\nLOG OF THE “DEMETER.”\nVarna to Whitby\n\nJuly 18: Strange events are occurring, so I will keep a precise record until we land. On July 6, we finished loading silver sand and boxes of earth. Set sail at noon with an east wind. The crew consists of five hands, two mates, the cook, and myself.\n\nJuly 11: At dawn, we entered the Bosphorus and were inspected by Turkish customs, who received the expected tips. Everything in order. At 4 p.m., we continued on. \n\nJuly 12: We passed through the Dardanelles, where more customs officers and a guard squadron's flagboat visited us. More tips required. Their inspection was quick and thorough. We entered the Archipelago at dusk.\n\nJuly 13: We passed Cape Matapan. The crew seemed nervous and unsettled but refused to say why.\n\nJuly 14: I grew concerned about the crew, who are usually reliable. The mate could not determine the cause of their anxiety; they just insisted something was wrong and crossed themselves. The mate lost his temper with one of them but, despite expecting a fight, all remained quiet.\n\nJuly 16: The mate reported that Petrofsky was missing. He had taken his shift at eight bells the night before, relieved by Abramoff, but did not go to his bunk. The crew, more anxious than ever, claimed they predicted something would happen but would not elaborate, only saying something was aboard. The mate is frustrated and anxious about potential trouble.\n\nJuly 17: Yesterday, sailor Olgaren came to me, frightened, stating he had seen a strange, tall and thin man, unfamiliar among the crew, emerge and walk the deck before vanishing. Though he followed, all he found were closed hatchways. Fear is spreading among the men. To calm nerves, I will conduct a thorough search of the ship today.\n\nLater, I assembled everyone to search the entire vessel. The mate dismissed this as foolishness that could demoralize the crew, but I let him steer while the rest of us searched with lanterns. There was nowhere to hide except among the large boxes. After finishing, the crew seemed relieved and resumed work, although the mate was visibly annoyed.\n\nJuly 22: For the last three days we've had rough weather and all hands busy with the sails, leaving no time for fear. The crew seems to have forgotten their anxieties, and relations have improved. We rounded Gibraltar and passed into the open sea; all is well.\n\nJuly 24: Some kind of curse haunts this ship. Already one man is gone, and as we entered the Bay of Biscay amid storms, another has disappeared in the night after ending his watch. The crew, now terrified, petitioned for double watches to avoid being alone. The mate is angry, and I fear a confrontation.\n\nJuly 28: We’ve endured four terrible days of storms with little sleep. The crew is exhausted; it's difficult to assign night watches. The second mate volunteered to steer and watch so others could rest. The wind is calming, and though the seas are still rough, the ship is steadier.\n\nJuly 29: Another tragedy. We had only a single night watch due to exhaustion. In the morning, only the steersman was found on deck, and after a search, the second mate was missing. The crew panicked. The mate and I are now carrying weapons, preparing for whatever comes next.\n\nJuly 30: Last night, we finally neared England. The weather cleared, and I slept deeply from exhaustion, only to be warned by the mate that both the watchman and steersman had vanished. Now, only myself, the mate, and two hands are left.\n\nAugust 1: We have been surrounded by fog for two days without sighting another ship. Unable to raise the sails ourselves, we must let the wind carry us, fearing to lower the sails as we could not rehoist them. We are drifting into unknown danger. The mate, once strong, now seems more broken than the men. The crew are Russian, the mate a Roumanian; they work on in grim acceptance.\n\nAugust 2, midnight: I was awakened by a cry outside my port but saw nothing in the fog. On deck, I found the mate who had also heard the cry, but the watchman was missing—another gone. The mate believed we had passed the Straits of Dover on seeing North Foreland by a break in the fog at the moment of the cry. We are now out in the North Sea, shrouded in fog that seems to move with us; it feels as if we have been abandoned.\n\nAugust 3: At midnight, when I went to relieve the wheel, no one was there, though the wind was steady. I called for the mate, who appeared looking not quite sane. He whispered hoarsely that \"It\" was on board, describing seeing a tall, ghastly pale figure in the bows, which his knife passed through without effect. The mate resolved to search the holds, believing something was hidden in the boxes, and went below with a tool chest and lantern. I remained at the helm, feeling helpless, and can only hope for deliverance once the fog lifts.\n\nIt is nearly over. Just as I hoped the mate was recovering, I heard a terrified scream from the hold. The mate burst on deck, wild with fear, begging for salvation, then said calmly that I should join him before it was too late—\"He\" is there, and the sea is the only escape. Before I could stop him, he leaped into the water. I suspect I now understand why the men disappeared one by one, and the mate has now followed them. God help me explain these horrors, if I ever reach port—if that is even possible.\n\nAugust 4: The fog still persists, impenetrable even by sunrise, which I sense only as a seasoned sailor. I did not dare go below or leave the helm. In the night, I saw It—Him! Truly, the mate was right to escape by drowning. Still, as captain, I cannot abandon ship. To resist the evil on board, I will tie myself to the wheel and affix an object I believe It cannot touch, hoping to save my soul and preserve my duty. As I grow weaker, I cling to hope. If the ship is lost, perhaps someone will find this bottle and understand; if not, let it be known I stayed true to my command. May God, the Virgin, and the saints aid a poor soul trying to do right."

          "text_segment": "10 August.—The funeral of the poor sea-captain to-day was most touching. Every boat in the harbour seemed to be there, and the coffin was carried by captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier up to the churchyard. Lucy came with me, and we went early to our old seat, whilst the cortège of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and came down again. We had a lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all the way. The poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our seat so that we stood on it when the time came and saw everything. Poor Lucy seemed much upset. She was restless and uneasy all the time, and I cannot but think that her dreaming at night is telling on her. She is quite odd in one thing: she will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness; or if there be, she does not understand it herself. There is an additional cause in that poor old Mr. Swales was found dead this morning on our seat, his neck being broken. He had evidently, as the doctor said, fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright, for there was a look of fear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder. Poor dear old man! Perhaps he had seen Death with his dying eyes! Lucy is so sweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely than other people do. Just now she was quite upset by a little thing which I did not much heed, though I am myself very fond of animals. One of the men who came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog. The dog is always with him. They are both quiet persons, and I never saw the man angry, nor heard the dog bark. During the service the dog would not come to its master, who was on the seat with us, but kept a few yards off, barking and howling. Its master spoke to it gently, and then harshly, and then angrily; but it would neither come nor cease to make a noise. It was in a sort of fury, with its eyes savage, and all its hairs bristling out like a cat’s tail when puss is on the war-path. Finally the man, too, got angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog, and then took it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on the tombstone on which the seat is fixed. The moment it touched the stone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into a tremble. It did not try to get away, but crouched down, quivering and cowering, and was in such a pitiable state of terror that I tried, though without effect, to comfort it. Lucy was full of pity, too, but she did not attempt to touch the dog, but looked at it in an agonised sort of way. I greatly fear that she is of too super-sensitive a nature to go through the world without trouble. She will be dreaming of this to-night, I am sure. The whole agglomeration of things—the ship steered into port by a dead man; his attitude, tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads; the touching funeral; the dog, now furious and now in terror—will all afford material for her dreams.\nI think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically, so I shall take her for a long walk by the cliffs to Robin Hood’s Bay and back. She ought not to have much inclination for sleep-walking then.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Today, August 10th, was the very moving funeral for the poor sea captain. It seemed like every boat in the harbor was present, and captains themselves carried the coffin the entire distance from Tate Hill Pier up to the graveyard. Lucy accompanied me, and we arrived early to secure our usual spot while the boat procession traveled up the river to the Viaduct before returning. We had an excellent view and could watch the ceremony almost completely. The poor man was buried quite close to where we sat, so we stood on our seat when the time came to witness everything. Poor Lucy appeared quite distressed. She was restless and uneasy throughout the service, and I strongly suspect that her nighttime dreaming is having a detrimental effect on her. She is peculiar in one regard: she refuses to admit to me that anything is causing her restlessness; or if something is, she doesn't understand it herself. Another contributing factor is that dear old Mr. Swales was discovered dead this morning on our very seat, with a broken neck. The doctor indicated he had clearly fallen backward in his seat due to some kind of intense fear, as the expression of dread and horror on his face was so profound the men who found him said it made them shiver. The poor, kind old man! Perhaps he saw Death with his final gaze! Lucy is so sweet and sensitive that she perceives influences far more intensely than most people. Just recently, she was quite upset by a minor incident that I didn't pay much attention to, although I am personally very fond of animals. One of the men who frequently comes up here to look for the boats was accompanied by his dog. The dog is always with him. They are both quiet individuals; I've never seen the man angry or heard the dog bark. During the service, the dog would not approach its master, who was seated with us, but stayed a few yards away, barking and howling. Its master spoke to it gently at first, then sternly, and finally angrily, but it would neither come nor stop making noise. It was in a kind of frenzy, with fierce eyes and all its fur standing on end like a cat preparing to fight. Eventually, the man also became angry, jumped down, kicked the dog, then grabbed it by the scruff of the neck and half-dragged, half-threw it onto the gravestone that serves as the base for the seat. The instant it touched the stone, the poor creature became silent and began to tremble all over. It didn't try to escape but huddled down, shivering and cowering, in such a pitiful state of terror that I attempted, without success, to comfort it. Lucy was also full of pity, but she didn't try to touch the dog; she just looked at it with a look of agony. I greatly fear that her nature is too overly sensitive for her to navigate life without suffering. I am certain she will dream about this tonight. The entire combination of events—the ship steered into port by a deceased man; his posture, tied to the wheel with religious items; the moving funeral; the dog, first furious and then terrified—will provide ample material for her dreams. I believe the best course of action will be for her to be physically exhausted when she goes to bed, so I will take her for a long walk along the cliffs to Robin Hood's Bay and back. That should lessen her inclination for sleepwalking.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "August 10.—Today, the funeral for the unfortunate sea-captain was very moving. Nearly every boat in the harbor attended, and the coffin was transported by other captains from Tate Hill Pier all the way to the churchyard. Lucy accompanied me, and we went early to our usual spot to watch as the procession of boats made its way up to the Viaduct and back again along the river. From our vantage point, we could observe almost the entire procession. The captain was buried quite close to our seat, so when the time came, we stood on it and witnessed the whole service. Lucy was noticeably unsettled, appearing anxious throughout, and I suspect her disturbed sleep at night is affecting her. She acts strangely in one respect: she neither admits to feeling restless nor seems to understand the reason if one exists. Another distressing event occurred today: poor old Mr. Swales was discovered dead this morning on our seat, apparently having died from a broken neck. According to the doctor, it looked like he fell back in fright, for his face showed a look of horror that even frightened the men who found him. Poor man! Perhaps he glimpsed Death as he passed. Lucy is so gentle and sensitive that she experiences emotions more deeply than most. She was especially unsettled by something I did not consider significant, despite being fond of animals myself. One of the men, who often comes up to look for the boats, was followed by his dog—an animal usually calm and quiet like its owner. However, during the funeral, the dog wouldn't go to its master and instead kept barking and howling from a short distance. The master tried repeatedly to call and discipline the dog, but it refused to obey and seemed beside itself with wildness, its eyes glaring and fur standing on end like a cat ready to fight. The man finally lost patience, kicked the dog, and then dragged it onto the tombstone that anchors the seat. As soon as the dog touched the stone, it became calm but started to tremble violently, staying still and clearly terrified. I tried to comfort the poor animal but failed. Lucy, too, felt sorry for it but only gazed at it with worry, not attempting to touch it. I worry that Lucy’s delicate nature may make life difficult for her; she will likely dream about this incident tonight. Everything that has happened recently—the ship arriving with a dead man at the helm, the way he was found, the emotional funeral, and the distraught dog—will all provide fodder for her nightmares. I think it’s best if Lucy wears herself out physically, so I’m planning to take her for a long walk by the cliffs to Robin Hood’s Bay and back. That way, she’ll be less likely to sleepwalk."

          "text_segment": "Same day, 11 o’clock p. m.—Oh, but I am tired! If it were not that I had made my diary a duty I should not open it to-night. We had a lovely walk. Lucy, after a while, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to some dear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse, and frightened the wits out of us. I believe we forgot everything except, of course, personal fear, and it seemed to wipe the slate clean and give us a fresh start. We had a capital “severe tea” at Robin Hood’s Bay in a sweet little old-fashioned inn, with a bow-window right over the seaweed-covered rocks of the strand. I believe we should have shocked the “New Woman” with our appetites. Men are more tolerant, bless them! Then we walked home with some, or rather many, stoppages to rest, and with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls. Lucy was really tired, and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as we could. The young curate came in, however, and Mrs. Westenra asked him to stay for supper. Lucy and I had both a fight for it with the dusty miller; I know it was a hard fight on my part, and I am quite heroic. I think that some day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a new class of curates, who don’t take supper, no matter how they may be pressed to, and who will know when girls are tired. Lucy is asleep and breathing softly. She has more colour in her cheeks than usual, and looks, oh, so sweet. If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with her seeing her only in the drawing-room, I wonder what he would say if he saw her now. Some of the “New Women” writers will some day start an idea that men and women should be allowed to see each other asleep before proposing or accepting. But I suppose the New Woman won’t condescend in future to accept; she will do the proposing herself. And a nice job she will make of it, too! There’s some consolation in that. I am so happy to-night, because dear Lucy seems better. I really believe she has turned the corner, and that we are over her troubles with dreaming. I should be quite happy if I only knew if Jonathan.... God bless and keep him.",

The only reason I'm opening my diary tonight is that I've obligated myself to keep it. We had a wonderful walk today. After a little while, Lucy became quite cheerful, which I attribute to some sweet cows in a nearby field that came sniffing towards us near the lighthouse and gave us such a fright! I think we momentarily forgot everything except, naturally, our immediate fear, and it seemed to wipe the slate clean, allowing us a fresh start. We had a substantial and excellent 'severe tea' at an charming old inn in Robin Hood's Bay, which had a lovely bow-window right over the rocks and seaweed of the beach. I imagine our appetites would have appalled the 'New Woman'. Men are more understanding, bless them! Afterward, we walked home, stopping frequently, or rather, many times, to rest, our hearts constantly anxious about potential encounters with wild bulls. Lucy was genuinely tired, and we had planned to sneak off to bed as soon as we could. However, the young curate arrived, and Mrs. Westenra invited him to stay for supper. Both Lucy and I had to fight hard against falling asleep ('the dusty miller'); I know I personally found it a difficult struggle, and I feel quite heroic for overcoming it. I really think bishops should gather someday and consider cultivating a new kind of curate who doesn't accept supper invitations, regardless of how much they are pressed, and who can recognize when girls are tired. Lucy is now asleep, breathing gently. She has more color in her cheeks than usual and looks incredibly sweet. If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with her seeing her only in the drawing-room, I wonder what his reaction would be if he saw her now. Some of the 'New Woman' writers will probably propose the idea someday that men and women should be allowed to observe each other while asleep before proposing or accepting marriage. But I suppose the 'New Woman' of the future won't deign to accept; she'll be doing the proposing herself. And she'll likely make a fine mess of that, too! There's some small comfort in that thought. I'm so happy tonight because dear Lucy seems better. I truly believe she has turned a corner and is past her difficulties with dreaming. I would be completely happy if I only knew about Jonathan... May God bless and keep him.",

After a bit, Lucy became cheerful—probably thanks to some friendly cows that wandered over near us by the lighthouse and startled us terribly. In that moment, everything slipped our minds except our own fright, which seemed to clear our heads and let us start fresh. We had a splendidly hearty tea at Robin Hood’s Bay in a charming, old inn with a bay window overlooking the seaweed-strewn rocks below. I think our large appetites would have scandalized one of those 'New Women,' though men thankfully are more forgiving! Then, on our way back, we kept stopping to rest, our minds constantly on edge about wild bulls. Lucy was genuinely worn out, and we planned to get to bed as soon as possible. But the young curate stopped by, and Mrs. Westenra invited him to join us for supper. Both Lucy and I struggled valiantly to stay awake—at least, I know I did, and I’m quite proud of myself for managing. Really, bishops ought to figure out a way to train new curates who decline supper, no matter how much they’re urged, and who can tell when girls are tired. Now Lucy is fast asleep, breathing quietly. Her cheeks are rosier than usual and she looks so sweet. If Mr. Holmwood fell for her just seeing her in the parlor, I wonder what he’d think if he could see her now. I wouldn’t be surprised if those 'New Woman' writers soon suggest that men and women should see each other sleeping before proposing marriage. But then, these modern women may not bother with accepting—they’ll be making the proposals themselves! And what an interesting situation that would be. At least there’s some amusement in that idea. I’m very content tonight, because dear Lucy seems improved. I truly think she’s recovering, and her troubling dreams are behind her. I’d be completely happy if only I knew how Jonathan was doing... May God bless and watch over him."

I fell asleep as soon as I had closed my diary.... Suddenly I became broad awake, and sat up, with a horrible sense of fear upon me, and of some feeling of emptiness around me. The room was dark, so I could not see Lucy’s bed; I stole across and felt for her. The bed was empty. I lit a match and found that she was not in the room. The door was shut, but not locked, as I had left it. I feared to wake her mother, who has been more than usually ill lately, so threw on some clothes and got ready to look for her. As I was leaving the room it struck me that the clothes she wore might give me some clue to her dreaming intention. Dressing-gown would mean house; dress, outside. Dressing-gown and dress were both in their places. “Thank God,” I said to myself, “she cannot be far, as she is only in her nightdress.” I ran downstairs and looked in the sitting-room. Not there! Then I looked in all the other open rooms of the house, with an ever-growing fear chilling my heart. Finally I came to the hall door and found it open. It was not wide open, but the catch of the lock had not caught. The people of the house are careful to lock the door every night, so I feared that Lucy must have gone out as she was. There was no time to think of what might happen; a vague, overmastering fear obscured all details. I took a big, heavy shawl and ran out. The clock was striking one as I was in the Crescent, and there was not a soul in sight. I ran along the North Terrace, but could see no sign of the white figure which I expected. At the edge of the West Cliff above the pier I looked across the harbour to the East Cliff, in the hope or fear—I don’t know which—of seeing Lucy in our favourite seat. There was a bright full moon, with heavy black, driving clouds, which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of light and shade as they sailed across. For a moment or two I could see nothing, as the shadow of a cloud obscured St. Mary’s Church and all around it. Then as the cloud passed I could see the ruins of the abbey coming into view; and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as a sword-cut moved along, the church and the churchyard became gradually visible.

We've just been through such a dangerous and distressing experience. I had fallen asleep right after finishing my previous entry... Then, I suddenly woke up completely and sat up, feeling a terrible sense of dread and an awareness of emptiness nearby. The room was dark, making it impossible to see Lucy's bed. I quietly crept over and felt for her. Her bed was empty. I lit a match and confirmed she wasn't anywhere in the room. The door was closed, but it wasn't locked, which is how I intended to leave it. Fearing to wake her mother, who has been uncommonly ill lately, I quickly dressed and prepared to search for her. As I was about to leave the room, it occurred to me that her clothes might offer a clue about her sleepwalking destination. A dressing-gown would mean she stayed inside; a dress would indicate she went outside. Both her dressing-gown and a dress were in their usual spots. 'Thank God,' I whispered to myself, 'she can't be far if she's only in her nightgown.' I hurried downstairs and checked the sitting-room. She wasn't there! Then, growing increasingly afraid, I checked all the other open rooms in the house. Finally, I reached the front door and found it open. It wasn't wide open, but the latch hadn't properly caught. Since the residents are always careful to lock the door at night, I feared Lucy must have gone out just as she was. There was no time to consider the potential consequences; an overwhelming, formless fear obscured all other thoughts. I grabbed a large, heavy shawl and ran outside. The clock was striking one as I reached the Crescent, and there was absolutely no one else around. I ran along the North Terrace, but saw no sign of the white figure I expected to find. At the edge of the West Cliff overlooking the pier, I looked across the harbour towards the East Cliff, hoping or fearing - I wasn't sure which - to see Lucy in our favourite spot. There was a bright full moon, with heavy, dark clouds scudding rapidly across the sky, creating fleeting scenes of light and shadow. For a moment or two, I couldn't see anything, as a cloud's shadow covered St. Mary's Church and the surrounding area. Then, as the cloud passed, I saw the abbey ruins come into view; and as a narrow, sharp line of light like a sword cut moved along, the church and churchyard gradually became visible. My expectation, whatever it was, was confirmed, for there, in our favourite seat, the silver moonlight illuminated a figure, dressed in striking white, reclining slightly. The cloud moved too quickly for me to see much clearly, as shadow immediately extinguished the light; but it seemed to me that something dark was standing behind the seat where the white figure shone, leaning over her.",

I had dozed off right after finishing my last diary entry, but then I woke up suddenly, wide awake and consumed by fear and an odd sense of emptiness. The room was dark, so I couldn't tell if Lucy was in bed. I went to check and found her bed empty. I lit a match—she wasn't in the room. The door was shut but not locked, just as I'd left it. Not wanting to wake Lucy's mother, who has been sicker than usual lately, I quickly put on some clothes to look for her. Before leaving, I thought maybe her clothes would hint at where she might've gone—if she took her dressing-gown she'd be in the house, her dress meant outside. But both were there, so I felt relieved that she must be close, as she was only in her nightdress. I hurried downstairs, checked the sitting-room—she wasn't there. I searched all the open rooms, my fear growing with each one. Finally, I found the hall door open, not fully, but the latch hadn't caught. Since the household always locks up at night, I dreaded that Lucy had gone outside as she was. There was no time to dwell on what could happen; a powerful, vague fear clouded my thoughts. Grabbing a large shawl, I rushed out. As I reached the Crescent, the clock struck one, and the street was empty.

For a moment, a cloud shadow hid St. Mary's Church and the area around it; then, as the cloud moved, the ruins of the abbey gradually appeared, illuminated by a narrow shaft of moonlight. My expectations were met: on our favorite bench, the moonlight shone on a white, reclining figure. The clouds moved too quickly for me to see much more, but I thought I glimpsed something dark behind the bench, leaning over the white figure."

The town seemed as dead, for not a soul did I see; I rejoiced that it was so, for I wanted no witness of poor Lucy’s condition. The time and distance seemed endless, and my knees trembled and my breath came laboured as I toiled up the endless steps to the abbey. I must have gone fast, and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted with lead, and as though every joint in my body were rusty. When I got almost to the top I could see the seat and the white figure, for I was now close enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow. There was undoubtedly something, long and black, bending over the half-reclining white figure. I called in fright, “Lucy! Lucy!” and something raised a head, and from where I was I could see a white face and red, gleaming eyes. Lucy did not answer, and I ran on to the entrance of the churchyard. As I entered, the church was between me and the seat, and for a minute or so I lost sight of her. When I came in view again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight struck so brilliantly that I could see Lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back of the seat. She was quite alone, and there was not a sign of any living thing about.\nWhen I bent over her I could see that she was still asleep. Her lips were parted, and she was breathing—not softly as usual with her, but in long, heavy gasps, as though striving to get her lungs full at every breath. As I came close, she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the collar of her nightdress close around her throat. Whilst she did so there came a little shudder through her, as though she felt the cold. I flung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight round her neck, for I dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air, unclad as she was. I feared to wake her all at once, so, in order to have my hands free that I might help her, I fastened the shawl at her throat with a big safety-pin; but I must have been clumsy in my anxiety and pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by, when her breathing became quieter, she put her hand to her throat again and moaned. When I had her carefully wrapped up I put my shoes on her feet and then began very gently to wake her. At first she did not respond; but gradually she became more and more uneasy in her sleep, moaning and sighing occasionally. At last, as time was passing fast, and, for many other reasons, I wished to get her home at once, I shook her more forcibly, till finally she opened her eyes and awoke. She did not seem surprised to see me, as, of course, she did not realise all at once where she was. Lucy always wakes prettily, and even at such a time, when her body must have been chilled with cold, and her mind somewhat appalled at waking unclad in a churchyard at night, she did not lose her grace. She trembled a little, and clung to me; when I told her to come at once with me home she rose without a word, with the obedience of a child. As we passed along, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed me wince. She stopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes; but I would not. However, when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard, where there was a puddle of water, remaining from the storm, I daubed my feet with mud, using each foot in turn on the other, so that as we went home, no one, in case we should meet any one, should notice my bare feet.\nFortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting a soul. Once we saw a man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along a street in front of us; but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such as there are here, steep little closes, or “wynds,” as they call them in Scotland. My heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes I thought I should faint. I was filled with anxiety about Lucy, not only for her health, lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for her reputation in case the story should get wind. When we got in, and had washed our feet, and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, I tucked her into bed. Before falling asleep she asked—even implored—me not to say a word to any one, even her mother, about her sleep-walking adventure. I hesitated at first to promise; but on thinking of the state of her mother’s health, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her, and thinking, too, of how such a story might become distorted—nay, infallibly would—in case it should leak out, I thought it wiser to do so. I hope I did right. I have locked the door, and the key is tied to my wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed. Lucy is sleeping soundly; the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea....",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I couldn't discern what the figure was, whether human or animal. I didn't wait for a second look but rushed down the steep stairs to the dock and along the fish market to the bridge, the sole route to the East Cliff. The town appeared deserted; I saw no one, which I was glad of, as I didn't want anyone to see Lucy in her state. The journey felt interminable, and my legs shook while my breath came in ragged gasps as I struggled up the endless steps to the abbey. Although I must have moved quickly, it felt as though my feet were weighted down and my body stiff. Nearing the top, I spotted the bench and the white shape, close enough now to make it out even through patches of darkness. There was definitely something tall and dark leaning over the white figure who was lying back. I shouted in fear, \"Lucy! Lucy!\" and a head lifted. From my position, I could see a pale face and bright red eyes. Lucy didn't reply, and I ran towards the entrance of the churchyard. As I went in, the church building blocked my view of the bench, and I lost sight of her for a minute or so. When I could see her again, the cloud had moved, and the moonlight shone so brightly that I could see Lucy reclined with her head resting on the back of the seat. She was entirely alone, with no sign of any other living thing nearby. When I leaned over her, I saw she was still sleeping. Her lips were slightly open, and she was breathing, not gently as usual, but in long, heavy gasps, as if struggling to fill her lungs with each breath. As I got closer, she lifted her hand in her sleep and pulled the collar of her nightdress tighter around her throat. As she did this, a slight shiver went through her, as if she felt the cold. I wrapped my warm shawl over her, pulling the edges snugly around her neck, terrified she might catch a fatal chill from the night air, given she was so exposed. I was afraid to wake her suddenly, so to free my hands to help her, I fastened the shawl at her throat with a large safety pin. But I must have been clumsy in my haste, pinching or pricking her with it, because soon after, as her breathing became quieter, she put her hand back to her throat and moaned. Once I had wrapped her securely, I put my shoes on her feet and then began to gently wake her. At first, she didn't react, but gradually she grew more restless in her sleep, occasionally moaning and sighing. Finally, as time was passing quickly, and for several other reasons, I was anxious to get her home immediately, I shook her more firmly until she eventually opened her eyes and woke up. She didn't seem surprised to see me, as she didn't instantly comprehend where she was. Lucy always wakes up gracefully, and even then, when her body must have been freezing and her mind somewhat shocked at waking up undressed in a churchyard at night, she kept her composure. She trembled slightly and held onto me. When I told her we had to go home right away, she got up without a word, like an obedient child. As we walked, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy saw me flinch. She stopped and insisted I take my shoes, but I refused. However, when we reached the pathway outside the churchyard where there was a puddle left from the storm, I smeared my feet with mud, using one foot to cover the other, so that if we met anyone on the way home, they wouldn't notice I was barefoot. We were fortunate and reached home without encountering anyone. At one point, we saw a man who seemed a bit drunk walking down a street ahead of us, but we hid in a doorway until he disappeared up one of the steep, narrow alleys common here, called 'closes' or 'wynds' in Scotland. My heart was pounding so loudly the whole time I sometimes felt I might faint. I was deeply worried about Lucy, not just about her health from being exposed, but also about her reputation if the story were to become known. Once we were inside, and had washed our feet and said a prayer of thanks together, I tucked her into bed. Before she fell asleep, she asked, indeed pleaded, with me not to mention her sleepwalking to anyone, not even her mother. Initially, I hesitated to promise, but considering her mother's fragile health and how knowing this would distress her, and also thinking about how such a story could easily be twisted—which it certainly would be—if it got out, I decided it was wiser to agree. I hope I made the right choice. I've locked the door and tied the key to my wrist, so perhaps I won't be disturbed again. Lucy is sleeping peacefully; the first hint of dawn is high and distant over the sea.",

Near the top, I could make out a bench and a pale figure; close enough now, I saw something long and dark bent over the reclining form. Panicked, I shouted, “Lucy! Lucy!” Something lifted its head, revealing a pale face with glowing red eyes. Lucy didn’t answer, so I hurried to the churchyard entrance. As I passed through, the church blocked my view briefly; once in sight again, the moon illuminated Lucy alone on the bench, her head resting back. No one else was there.\n\nWhen I leaned over her, I saw she was still asleep. Her mouth was open and her breathing was labored, as if she were gasping for air. As I approached, she instinctively drew her nightdress collar around her throat and shivered, feeling the cold. I wrapped her in a warm shawl, securing it tightly around her neck, fearing she’d catch a chill in the cold night air. Not wanting to wake her suddenly, I pinned the shawl at her throat with a large safety pin; in my haste, I must have scratched or pinched her, because when her breathing calmed, she touched her throat and whimpered. Once she was bundled up, I put my shoes on her feet and gently tried to wake her. She was unresponsive at first but gradually grew more restless, sighing and moaning, until, pressed for time, I woke her more firmly. She finally opened her eyes, not surprised to see me, likely not realizing at once where she was. Lucy always wakes gracefully, and even chilled and frightened to find herself undressed in a churchyard at night, she didn’t lose her composure. She trembled and clung to me; when I told her we must go home, she obeyed without question, like a child.\n\nOn the way, the gravel hurt my bare feet and Lucy noticed; she wanted me to take my shoes, but I refused. When we reached the path outside the churchyard, I muddied my feet in a puddle to disguise that I had no shoes, so no one would notice if we met anyone. Luck was with us and we got home without encountering anyone. We saw one man, apparently drunk, but hid in a doorway until he had gone. My heart pounded so loudly that I thought I might faint, worried for Lucy’s health after her exposure, and for her reputation if the incident became known. Once home and our feet washed, we said a prayer of thanks and I tucked Lucy into bed. Before falling asleep, she begged me not to tell anyone, not even her mother, about her sleepwalking. I hesitated, but knowing her mother’s poor health and how rumors might harm Lucy, I agreed. I think I did the right thing. I’ve locked the door and tied the key to my wrist, so I should not be disturbed again. Lucy is sleeping peacefully now, and the dawn is brightening the sky over the sea."

The adventure of the night does not seem to have harmed her; on the contrary, it has benefited her, for she looks better this morning than she has done for weeks. I was sorry to notice that my clumsiness with the safety-pin hurt her. Indeed, it might have been serious, for the skin of her throat was pierced. I must have pinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for there are two little red points like pin-pricks, and on the band of her nightdress was a drop of blood. When I apologised and was concerned about it, she laughed and petted me, and said she did not even feel it. Fortunately it cannot leave a scar, as it is so tiny.\nSame day, night.—We passed a happy day. The air was clear, and the sun bright, and there was a cool breeze. We took our lunch to Mulgrave Woods, Mrs. Westenra driving by the road and Lucy and I walking by the cliff-path and joining her at the gate. I felt a little sad myself, for I could not but feel how absolutely happy it would have been had Jonathan been with me. But there! I must only be patient. In the evening we strolled in the Casino Terrace, and heard some good music by Spohr and Mackenzie, and went to bed early. Lucy seems more restful than she has been for some time, and fell asleep at once. I shall lock the door and secure the key the same as before, though I do not expect any trouble to-night.\n12 August.—My expectations were wrong, for twice during the night I was wakened by Lucy trying to get out. She seemed, even in her sleep, to be a little impatient at finding the door shut, and went back to bed under a sort of protest. I woke with the dawn, and heard the birds chirping outside of the window. Lucy woke, too, and, I was glad to see, was even better than on the previous morning. All her old gaiety of manner seemed to have come back, and she came and snuggled in beside me and told me all about Arthur. I told her how anxious I was about Jonathan, and then she tried to comfort me. Well, she succeeded somewhat, for, though sympathy can’t alter facts, it can help to make them more bearable.\n13 August.—Another quiet day, and to bed with the key on my wrist as before. Again I awoke in the night, and found Lucy sitting up in bed, still asleep, pointing to the window. I got up quietly, and pulling aside the blind, looked out. It was brilliant moonlight, and the soft effect of the light over the sea and sky—merged together in one great, silent mystery—was beautiful beyond words. Between me and the moonlight flitted a great bat, coming and going in great whirling circles. Once or twice it came quite close, but was, I suppose, frightened at seeing me, and flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey. When I came back from the window Lucy had lain down again, and was sleeping peacefully. She did not stir again all night.\n14 August.—On the East Cliff, reading and writing all day. Lucy seems to have become as much in love with the spot as I am, and it is hard to get her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or dinner. This afternoon she made a funny remark. We were coming home for dinner, and had come to the top of the steps up from the West Pier and stopped to look at the view, as we generally do. The setting sun, low down in the sky, was just dropping behind Kettleness; the red light was thrown over on the East Cliff and the old abbey, and seemed to bathe everything in a beautiful rosy glow. We were silent for a while, and suddenly Lucy murmured as if to herself:—\n“His red eyes again! They are just the same.” It was such an odd expression, coming apropos of nothing, that it quite startled me. I slewed round a little, so as to see Lucy well without seeming to stare at her, and saw that she was in a half-dreamy state, with an odd look on her face that I could not quite make out; so I said nothing, but followed her eyes. She appeared to be looking over at our own seat, whereon was a dark figure seated alone. I was a little startled myself, for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like burning flames; but a second look dispelled the illusion. The red sunlight was shining on the windows of St. Mary’s Church behind our seat, and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the refraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved. I called Lucy’s attention to the peculiar effect, and she became herself with a start, but she looked sad all the same; it may have been that she was thinking of that terrible night up there. We never refer to it; so I said nothing, and we went home to dinner. Lucy had a headache and went early to bed. I saw her asleep, and went out for a little stroll myself; I walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of sweet sadness, for I was thinking of Jonathan. When coming home—it was then bright moonlight, so bright that, though the front of our part of the Crescent was in shadow, everything could be well seen—I threw a glance up at our window, and saw Lucy’s head leaning out. I thought that perhaps she was looking out for me, so I opened my handkerchief and waved it. She did not notice or make any movement whatever. Just then, the moonlight crept round an angle of the building, and the light fell on the window. There distinctly was Lucy with her head lying up against the side of the window-sill and her eyes shut. She was fast asleep, and by her, seated on the window-sill, was something that looked like a good-sized bird. I was afraid she might get a chill, so I ran upstairs, but as I came into the room she was moving back to her bed, fast asleep, and breathing heavily; she was holding her hand to her throat, as though to protect it from cold.\nI did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly; I have taken care that the door is locked and the window securely fastened.\nShe looks so sweet as she sleeps; but she is paler than is her wont, and there is a drawn, haggard look under her eyes which I do not like. I fear she is fretting about something. I wish I could find out what it is.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The same day around noon, things seemed to be progressing well. Lucy had slept until I gently woke her and appeared not to have shifted position at all. The previous night's unsettling experience seemed to have had no ill effect on her; if anything, she looked healthier this morning than she had in weeks. I felt bad when I saw that my awkward handling of the safety pin had caused her a slight injury. It could have been serious, as it had punctured the skin on her throat. I must have pinched a fold of loose skin and pinned through it, as there were two small red marks resembling pin-pricks, and a tiny drop of blood on the edge of her nightdress. When I apologised and expressed concern, she laughed and was affectionate, saying she hadn't even felt it. Fortunately, the mark is so small it won't leave a scar. Later that same day, in the evening, we had a pleasant day. The weather was clear, sunny, and there was a refreshing breeze. We picnicked in Mulgrave Woods, with Mrs. Westenra arriving by car and Lucy and I walking along the cliff-path before meeting her at the entrance. I felt a touch of sadness personally, wishing Jonathan could have been with me to share the perfect happiness. But I know I must be patient. In the evening, we strolled on the Casino Terrace, listened to some good music by Spohr and Mackenzie, and retired early. Lucy seems more settled than she has been recently and fell asleep immediately. I plan to lock the door and keep the key as before, although I don't anticipate any problems tonight. My expectations were incorrect, as on the 12th of August, I was woken up twice during the night by Lucy trying to get out of the room. Even in her sleep, she seemed slightly annoyed that the door was closed, and she returned to bed with a sense of mild protest. I woke with the sunrise and heard the birds singing outside the window. Lucy also awoke, and I was pleased to see she looked even better than the morning before. Her usual cheerful disposition seemed to have fully returned, and she came over and snuggled beside me, telling me all about Arthur. I confessed my anxiety about Jonathan, and she attempted to comfort me. She did succeed to some extent, because although sympathy can't change reality, it can help make difficulties more bearable. August 13th was another peaceful day, and I went to bed with the key on my wrist again, just as before. Once more, I woke during the night to find Lucy sitting up in bed, still asleep, gesturing towards the window. I quietly got up, pulled back the curtain, and looked outside. The moonlight was incredibly bright, casting a soft and indescribably beautiful light over the sea and sky, which seemed to blend into a single, vast, silent mystery. Between me and the moonlit scene, a large bat flitted back and forth in wide, swirling circles. It came quite close once or twice but I suppose was scared when it saw me and flew off across the harbour towards the abbey. When I turned back from the window, Lucy had lain down again and was sleeping peacefully. She didn't stir again for the rest of the night. On August 14th, I spent the whole day on the East Cliff, reading and writing. Lucy seems to love the spot as much as I do, and it's difficult to convince her to leave when it's time to go home for meals. This afternoon, she said something strange. We were heading back for dinner and had reached the top of the steps leading up from the West Pier, stopping, as we usually do, to admire the view. The setting sun, low on the horizon, was just about to dip behind Kettleness; its red light was cast over the East Cliff and the old abbey, seemingly bathing everything in a lovely rosy glow. We were quiet for a moment, and then Lucy suddenly whispered as if to herself, \"His red eyes again! They are just the same.\" It was such an odd comment, coming out of nowhere, that it quite startled me. I subtly turned slightly to get a good look at Lucy without seeming to stare and noticed she was in a semi-dreamy state, with an unusual expression on her face that I couldn't quite understand. So I didn't say anything but followed where her eyes were directed. She seemed to be looking towards our usual seat, where a dark figure was sitting alone. I felt a slight shock myself, as for an instant it looked as though the stranger had large eyes like burning flames. But a second look dispelled the illusion. The red sunlight was reflecting off the windows of St. Mary's Church behind our seat, and as the sun lowered, the slight change in the angle of reflection and refraction made it appear as if the light was moving. I drew Lucy's attention to this peculiar effect, and she came back to herself with a start, but she still looked sad; perhaps she was thinking of that frightening night we had up there. We never talk about it, so I didn't mention it again, and we went home for dinner. Lucy had a headache and went to bed early. I saw that she was asleep and decided to go for a short walk myself. I walked along the cliffs to the west, feeling a sweet melancholy as I thought of Jonathan. On my way back home—the moonlight was very bright then, so bright that although the front of our part of the Crescent was in shadow, everything was clearly visible—I glanced up at our window and saw Lucy's head leaning out. Thinking she might be looking out for me, I took out my handkerchief and waved. She didn't notice or make any kind of movement. Just then, the moonlight rounded a corner of the building and illuminated the window. There, distinctly, was Lucy with her head resting against the side of the window-sill, her eyes closed. She was fast asleep, and beside her, perched on the window-sill, was something that looked like a rather large bird. I was worried she might get a chill, so I hurried upstairs, but as I entered the room, she was already moving back towards her bed, still fast asleep and breathing heavily; she was holding her hand to her throat, as if trying to protect it from the cold. I didn't wake her, but tucked her in warmly. I made sure the door was locked and the window securely fastened. She looks so lovely as she sleeps; but she is paler than usual, and there is a tired, drawn look under her eyes that concerns me. I am afraid she is worrying about something. I wish I could discover what it is.",

They instructed that these goods were to be delivered immediately upon arrival at King's Cross station to Carfax, near Purfleet. The house there was empty, and they included the labelled keys. The consignment consisted of fifty boxes which were to be placed in the partially ruined building on the property, marked 'A' on an accompanying diagram, which was the old chapel. The goods were scheduled to depart that night at 9:30 PM and arrive at King's Cross at 4:30 PM the following afternoon. Because their client desired prompt delivery, they requested that Carter, Paterson & Co. have transport teams ready at King's Cross upon the train's arrival to move the goods without delay. To prevent any administrative hold-ups regarding payment, they enclosed a cheque for £10, asking for acknowledgement of receipt. They requested any overcharge be returned and promised to cover any additional cost promptly. After delivery, the keys were to be left in the main hall of the house for the owner, who had their own duplicate key. Billington & Son strongly urged the utmost speed in handling the delivery. Later, on August 21st, Messrs. Carter, Paterson & Co. replied to Billington & Son. They confirmed receiving the £10 and returned the excess amount of £1 17s. 9d with a receipted account.

Last night she slept well all night, and did not disturb me once. The roses seem coming back already to her cheeks, though she is still sadly pale and wan-looking. If she were in any way anæmic I could understand it, but she is not. She is in gay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness. All the morbid reticence seems to have passed from her, and she has just reminded me, as if I needed any reminding, of that night, and that it was here, on this very seat, I found her asleep. As she told me she tapped playfully with the heel of her boot on the stone slab and said:—\n“My poor little feet didn’t make much noise then! I daresay poor old Mr. Swales would have told me that it was because I didn’t want to wake up Geordie.” As she was in such a communicative humour, I asked her if she had dreamed at all that night. Before she answered, that sweet, puckered look came into her forehead, which Arthur—I call him Arthur from her habit—says he loves; and, indeed, I don’t wonder that he does. Then she went on in a half-dreaming kind of way, as if trying to recall it to herself:—\n“I didn’t quite dream; but it all seemed to be real. I only wanted to be here in this spot—I don’t know why, for I was afraid of something—I don’t know what. I remember, though I suppose I was asleep, passing through the streets and over the bridge. A fish leaped as I went by, and I leaned over to look at it, and I heard a lot of dogs howling—the whole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at once—as I went up the steps. Then I had a vague memory of something long and dark with red eyes, just as we saw in the sunset, and something very sweet and very bitter all around me at once; and then I seemed sinking into deep green water, and there was a singing in my ears, as I have heard there is to drowning men; and then everything seemed passing away from me; my soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the air. I seem to remember that once the West Lighthouse was right under me, and then there was a sort of agonising feeling, as if I were in an earthquake, and I came back and found you shaking my body. I saw you do it before I felt you.”\nThen she began to laugh. It seemed a little uncanny to me, and I listened to her breathlessly. I did not quite like it, and thought it better not to keep her mind on the subject, so we drifted on to other subjects, and Lucy was like her old self again. When we got home the fresh breeze had braced her up, and her pale cheeks were really more rosy. Her mother rejoiced when she saw her, and we all spent a very happy evening together.\n19 August.—Joy, joy, joy! although not all joy. At last, news of Jonathan. The dear fellow has been ill; that is why he did not write. I am not afraid to think it or say it, now that I know. Mr. Hawkins sent me on the letter, and wrote himself, oh, so kindly. I am to leave in the morning and go over to Jonathan, and to help to nurse him if necessary, and to bring him home. Mr. Hawkins says it would not be a bad thing if we were to be married out there. I have cried over the good Sister’s letter till I can feel it wet against my bosom, where it lies. It is of Jonathan, and must be next my heart, for he is in my heart. My journey is all mapped out, and my luggage ready. I am only taking one change of dress; Lucy will bring my trunk to London and keep it till I send for it, for it may be that ... I must write no more; I must keep it to say to Jonathan, my husband. The letter that he has seen and touched must comfort me till we meet.",

If she were anaemic, I would understand this, but she isn't. She is in high spirits, full of life and cheerfulness. All her previous gloomy quietness has vanished, and she just reminded me (as if I could forget) about that specific night and how I found her asleep right here on this very bench. As she told me, she tapped the stone slab playfully with her boot heel and commented, \"My poor little feet were so quiet then! I bet old Mr. Swales would have said it was because I didn't want to disturb Geordie.\" Since she was so willing to talk, I asked if she had dreamed that night. Before answering, that sweet, wrinkled look appeared on her forehead, which Arthur (I call him that because she does) says he adores; and frankly, I see why he does. Then she spoke in a somewhat dreamy manner, as if trying to bring the memory back: \"I didn't exactly dream; it all felt real. I just felt compelled to be in this precise spot—I don't know why, because I was afraid of something—I don't know what. I recall, though I suppose I was asleep, walking through the streets and crossing the bridge.

I seem to remember that at one point the West Lighthouse was directly beneath me, and then there was a sort of painful feeling, like being in an earthquake, and I returned and found you shaking my body. I saw you doing it before I felt you.\" Then she started laughing. It struck me as a little strange, and I listened intently.

She remembered wandering through the town, crossing the bridge, seeing a fish jump, leaning to look at it, hearing many dogs howling as she approached the steps, and then having a hazy image of a long, dark figure with red eyes, and being surrounded by something both sweet and bitter. She felt as though she was sinking underwater, hearing a singing like those drowning hear, and as if her soul left her body. At one point, she saw the lighthouse below her, sensed an earthquake-like terror, then awoke to me shaking her, seeing it before actually feeling it. She laughed afterwards, which struck me as odd.

He has endeared himself to everyone here by his kindness and gentle nature. He is improving well and, I believe, will be back to his normal self soon. However, please continue to be cautious with him for his safety. I pray, with the help of God, St. Joseph, and St. Mary, that you both have many happy years together."

          "text_segment": "19 August.—Strange and sudden change in Renfield last night. About eight o’clock he began to get excited and sniff about as a dog does when setting. The attendant was struck by his manner, and knowing my interest in him, encouraged him to talk. He is usually respectful to the attendant and at times servile; but to-night, the man tells me, he was quite haughty. Would not condescend to talk with him at all. All he would say was:—\n“I don’t want to talk to you: you don’t count now; the Master is at hand.”\nThe attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which has seized him. If so, we must look out for squalls, for a strong man with homicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous. The combination is a dreadful one. At nine o’clock I visited him myself. His attitude to me was the same as that to the attendant; in his sublime self-feeling the difference between myself and attendant seemed to him as nothing. It looks like religious mania, and he will soon think that he himself is God. These infinitesimal distinctions between man and man are too paltry for an Omnipotent Being. How these madmen give themselves away! The real God taketh heed lest a sparrow fall; but the God created from human vanity sees no difference between an eagle and a sparrow. Oh, if men only knew!\nFor half an hour or more Renfield kept getting excited in greater and greater degree. I did not pretend to be watching him, but I kept strict observation all the same. All at once that shifty look came into his eyes which we always see when a madman has seized an idea, and with it the shifty movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come to know so well. He became quite quiet, and went and sat on the edge of his bed resignedly, and looked into space with lack-lustre eyes. I thought I would find out if his apathy were real or only assumed, and tried to lead him to talk of his pets, a theme which had never failed to excite his attention. At first he made no reply, but at length said testily:—\n“Bother them all! I don’t care a pin about them.”\n“What?” I said. “You don’t mean to tell me you don’t care about spiders?” (Spiders at present are his hobby and the note-book is filling up with columns of small figures.) To this he answered enigmatically:—\n“The bride-maidens rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the bride; but when the bride draweth nigh, then the maidens shine not to the eyes that are filled.”\nHe would not explain himself, but remained obstinately seated on his bed all the time I remained with him.\nI am weary to-night and low in spirits. I cannot but think of Lucy, and how different things might have been. If I don’t sleep at once, chloral, the modern Morpheus—C2HCl3O. H2O! I must be careful not to let it grow into a habit. No, I shall take none to-night! I have thought of Lucy, and I shall not dishonour her by mixing the two. If need be, to-night shall be sleepless....\nLater.—Glad I made the resolution; gladder that I kept to it. I had lain tossing about, and had heard the clock strike only twice, when the night-watchman came to me, sent up from the ward, to say that Renfield had escaped. I threw on my clothes and ran down at once; my patient is too dangerous a person to be roaming about. Those ideas of his might work out dangerously with strangers. The attendant was waiting for me. He said he had seen him not ten minutes before, seemingly asleep in his bed, when he had looked through the observation-trap in the door. His attention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out. He ran back and saw his feet disappear through the window, and had at once sent up for me. He was only in his night-gear, and cannot be far off. The attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should go than to follow him, as he might lose sight of him whilst getting out of the building by the door. He is a bulky man, and couldn’t get through the window. I am thin, so, with his aid, I got out, but feet foremost, and, as we were only a few feet above ground, landed unhurt. The attendant told me the patient had gone to the left, and had taken a straight line, so I ran as quickly as I could.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "August 19th. Renfield's behavior underwent a strange and sudden alteration last night. Around 8 PM, he became agitated, sniffing about like a hunting dog. His attendant, noting his manner and knowing my interest, encouraged him to converse. Renfield is usually respectful, even occasionally subservient, towards the attendant; however, the attendant reported that he was quite arrogant this evening, refusing to engage in any conversation. His only comment was: \"I won't talk to you; you're insignificant now; the Master is near.\" The attendant suspects he's been afflicted by a sudden form of religious madness. If this is true, we should brace for trouble, as a strong individual experiencing both homicidal and religious mania concurrently could be perilous. It's a terrifying combination. I visited him myself at 9 PM. His attitude towards me was identical to the one he showed the attendant; in his elevated sense of self, the difference between the attendant and me seemed irrelevant to him. It certainly appears to be religious mania, and he'll likely soon believe he is God. For an Omnipotent Being, such minor distinctions between people are too trivial. It's fascinating how these madmen reveal their delusions! The genuine God watches over even a fallen sparrow, yet the 'God' born of human pride sees no difference between an eagle and a sparrow. Oh, if only people understood! For thirty minutes or more, Renfield grew increasingly agitated. I didn't appear to be watching, but I maintained careful observation. Suddenly, that evasive look appeared in his eyes, common when a madman fixates on an idea, accompanied by the characteristic restless head and back movements familiar to asylum staff. He then grew very still, sat calmly on the edge of his bed, and stared blankly into space with dull eyes. I wanted to see if his apathy was real or feigned, so I tried to steer the conversation towards his pets, a topic that had always captured his attention. Initially, he offered no reply, but eventually said irritably: \"Forget about them all! I don't care about them at all.\" \"What?\" I exclaimed. \"Are you saying you don't care about spiders?\" (Spiders are currently his obsession, and his notebook is being filled with columns of small figures.) To this, he responded mysteriously: \"The bridesmaids delight the eyes that await the arrival of the bride; but when the bride approaches, the bridesmaids no longer attract the gaze of eyes that are full.\" He refused to clarify, remaining stubbornly seated on his bed throughout my visit. I feel weary and disheartened tonight. I can't stop thinking about Lucy and how things might have been different. If I don't fall asleep immediately, there's chloral, the modern Morpheus—C2HCl3O. H2O! I must be careful not to develop a dependency. No, I won't take any tonight! Thinking of Lucy, I won't dishonor her memory by combining the two. If necessary, I will go sleepless tonight.... Later. I'm glad I made that resolve, and even happier I kept it. I had been restlessly turning in bed and had only heard the clock strike twice when the night-watchman arrived, sent from the ward, to report that Renfield had escaped. I quickly got dressed and rushed downstairs; my patient is too dangerous to be wandering freely. His delusions could prove perilous if he encounters strangers. The attendant was waiting for me. He stated he had seen him less than ten minutes earlier, seemingly asleep in his bed, when he checked through the observation window in the door. The sound of the window being forced open drew his attention. He hurried back and saw his feet disappearing through the window, and immediately came to get me. He was only in his nightclothes, so he can't be far away. The attendant thought it more sensible to watch where he went rather than follow him, as he might lose sight of him while exiting the building through the door. Being a bulky man, he couldn't fit through the window. I am thin, so, with his assistance, I climbed out, going feet first, and since it was only a short drop, I landed unharmed. The attendant told me the patient had gone to the left and moved in a straight line, so I ran as fast as I could.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "August 19th.—Last night, Renfield underwent a sudden and dramatic shift in behavior. Around eight in the evening he seemed unusually animated, pacing and sniffing about much like a hunting dog. The attendant, aware of my interest in Renfield, encouraged him to speak. Normally, Renfield is either polite or even obsequious with the staff, but this time, according to the attendant, he was disdainful and refused to converse, saying only, “I don’t want to talk to you: you don’t count now; the Master is at hand.” The attendant suspects Renfield has developed a sudden religious mania, which could be dangerous, as he is strong and the mixture of homicidal and religious delusions is a frightening one. At nine o’clock I visited Renfield myself and found he treated me the same way he had treated the attendant. He now seemed to see no distinction between us, lost in his inflated self-importance. It appears to be religious mania that may lead him to imagine himself a deity—failing to recognize small differences between people, as if only an all-powerful being could do so. It is always revealing to see such delusions in madmen! The true God notices every small creature, while a god made from human pride ignores even obvious contrasts. If only people understood this! For over half an hour, Renfield’s excitement grew. Though I acted casual, I observed him closely. Suddenly, that familiar furtive look appeared in his eyes—the look seen when a lunatic latches onto an idea—along with shifty movements. Then he grew calm, sat at the edge of his bed, staring blankly into space. To test if his apathy was real or faked, I began speaking about his pets, a topic that usually interested him. At first he was silent, but eventually replied irritably, “Bother them all! I don’t care a pin about them.” I was surprised and pressed, asking if he truly didn’t care about spiders, which he’s been obsessed with lately. He answered cryptically, “The bride-maidens rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the bride; but when the bride draweth nigh, then the maidens shine not to the eyes that are filled.” He would not elaborate and sat stubbornly on his bed the whole time I was there. \nTonight I feel weary and melancholy, unable to stop thinking of Lucy and how things might have been different. If I cannot sleep, perhaps I should use chloral, the modern version of Morpheus, but I worry about dependency. No, I will not take any tonight! My thoughts of Lucy forbid it; I’ll remain sleepless if necessary... \nLater.—I am glad I made—and kept—that decision. I had only heard the clock strike twice when the night-watchman reported to me, sent from the ward, that Renfield had escaped. I quickly dressed and hurried downstairs, as Renfield is too dangerous to be loose. His delusions might put strangers at risk. The attendant said he’d checked on him not ten minutes before and saw Renfield, seemingly asleep, through the door’s observation panel. He heard the sound of a window being forced open, hurried back, and just saw Renfield’s feet disappear out the window. He was only in his nightclothes and couldn’t be far. The attendant suggested it was better to watch where Renfield went rather than try to follow, not wanting to lose sight of him while exiting by the door. The attendant is too large to fit through the window, but I am slim, so with his help I went out feet first and, being only a few feet up, landed unharmed. The attendant reported that Renfield had gone left in a straight line, so I quickly went after him."

I got a ladder myself, and crossing the wall, dropped down on the other side. I could see Renfield’s figure just disappearing behind the angle of the house, so I ran after him. On the far side of the house I found him pressed close against the old ironbound oak door of the chapel. He was talking, apparently to some one, but I was afraid to go near enough to hear what he was saying, lest I might frighten him, and he should run off. Chasing an errant swarm of bees is nothing to following a naked lunatic, when the fit of escaping is upon him! After a few minutes, however, I could see that he did not take note of anything around him, and so ventured to draw nearer to him—the more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him in. I heard him say:—\n“I am here to do Your bidding, Master. I am Your slave, and You will reward me, for I shall be faithful. I have worshipped You long and afar off. Now that You are near, I await Your commands, and You will not pass me by, will You, dear Master, in Your distribution of good things?”\nHe is a selfish old beggar anyhow. He thinks of the loaves and fishes even when he believes he is in a Real Presence. His manias make a startling combination. When we closed in on him he fought like a tiger. He is immensely strong, for he was more like a wild beast than a man. I never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before; and I hope I shall not again. It is a mercy that we have found out his strength and his danger in good time. With strength and determination like his, he might have done wild work before he was caged. He is safe now at any rate. Jack Sheppard himself couldn’t get free from the strait-waistcoat that keeps him restrained, and he’s chained to the wall in the padded room. His cries are at times awful, but the silences that follow are more deadly still, for he means murder in every turn and movement.\nJust now he spoke coherent words for the first time:—\n“I shall be patient, Master. It is coming—coming—coming!”\nSo I took the hint, and came too. I was too excited to sleep, but this diary has quieted me, and I feel I shall get some sleep to-night.",

I immediately returned and instructed the watchman to quickly gather three or four men and accompany me onto the grounds of Carfax, anticipating that our acquaintance might pose a threat. I obtained a ladder myself, used it to cross the wall, and descended on the opposite side. I spotted Renfield just vanishing around the corner of the house, so I pursued him. On the far side, I found him pressed against the ancient, iron-banded oak door of the chapel. He appeared to be speaking to someone, but I was hesitant to get too close to hear what he was saying, fearing I might startle him and cause him to flee. Chasing a runaway lunatic in a fit of escape is far more challenging than pursuing a stray swarm of bees! However, after a few moments, I could see he was oblivious to his surroundings, so I decided to approach him, especially since my men had now crossed the wall and were surrounding him. I heard him declare: 'I am here to follow Your orders, Master. I am Your servant, and You will compensate me, as I will be loyal. I have adored You from afar for a long time. Now that You are close, I await Your commands, and You won't overlook me, will You, beloved Master, when you distribute Your favors?' He is fundamentally a self-serving individual, thinking of personal gain even when he believes he is in a genuine spiritual presence. His delusions form a striking combination. When we closed in on him, he fought with immense ferocity. He possesses extraordinary strength; he behaved more like a wild animal than a human. I have never before witnessed a lunatic in such an intense fit of rage, and I hope I never do again. It is fortunate that we discovered his strength and the potential danger he represents in good time. With such strength and resolve, he could have caused serious harm before being confined. At any rate, he is secure now. Not even Jack Sheppard could escape the straitjacket that restrains him, and he is chained to the wall in the padded room. His screams are sometimes terrifying, but the subsequent silences are even more ominous, as every move and turn suggests a murderous intent. Just moments ago, he spoke intelligibly for the first time, saying: 'I will be patient, Master. It is arriving—arriving—arriving!' Taking that as a cue, I left as well. I was too agitated to sleep, but writing in this diary has calmed me, and I believe I will be able to sleep tonight.",

I grabbed a ladder, climbed the wall myself, and dropped down on the other side. I could just make out Renfield moving out of sight behind the corner of the house, so I chased after him.

Now that You are near, I await Your orders—surely you won’t forget me when you share your rewards, dear Master?\" He really is a selfish old beggar; even when he believes he's in the presence of the divine, his thoughts are on material gain. His madness is remarkable. When we tried to capture him, he fought fiercely, like a wild animal—I've never seen a lunatic in such a violent state before, and I hope I never do again. Thankfully, we've discovered just how strong and potentially dangerous he is before anything worse happened. With such power and will, he could have done serious harm if not caught. Now, at least, he is secure: not even the infamous Jack Sheppard could escape the restraining straitjacket he's now in, locked and chained to the wall in a padded room. Sometimes his screams are terrifying, but the silences that follow are even more chilling, as his every gesture seems filled with murderous intent. Just now, he spoke clearly for the first time and said, \"I shall be patient, Master. It is coming—coming—coming!\" Taking my cue, I left as well. I was too shaken to sleep at first, but writing in this diary has calmed me, and I think I'll sleep tonight."

Well, my dear, I got to Hull all right, and caught the boat to Hamburg, and then the train on here. I feel that I can hardly recall anything of the journey, except that I knew I was coming to Jonathan, and, that as I should have to do some nursing, I had better get all the sleep I could.... I found my dear one, oh, so thin and pale and weak-looking. All the resolution has gone out of his dear eyes, and that quiet dignity which I told you was in his face has vanished. He is only a wreck of himself, and he does not remember anything that has happened to him for a long time past. At least, he wants me to believe so, and I shall never ask. He has had some terrible shock, and I fear it might tax his poor brain if he were to try to recall it. Sister Agatha, who is a good creature and a born nurse, tells me that he raved of dreadful things whilst he was off his head. I wanted her to tell me what they were; but she would only cross herself, and say she would never tell; that the ravings of the sick were the secrets of God, and that if a nurse through her vocation should hear them, she should respect her trust. She is a sweet, good soul, and the next day, when she saw I was troubled, she opened up the subject again, and after saying that she could never mention what my poor dear raved about, added: ‘I can tell you this much, my dear: that it was not about anything which he has done wrong himself; and you, as his wife to be, have no cause to be concerned. He has not forgotten you or what he owes to you. His fear was of great and terrible things, which no mortal can treat of.’ I do believe the dear soul thought I might be jealous lest my poor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl. The idea of my being jealous about Jonathan! And yet, my dear, let me whisper, I felt a thrill of joy through me when I knew that no other woman was a cause of trouble. I am now sitting by his bedside, where I can see his face while he sleeps. He is waking!...\n“When he woke he asked me for his coat, as he wanted to get something from the pocket; I asked Sister Agatha, and she brought all his things. I saw that amongst them was his note-book, and was going to ask him to let me look at it—for I knew then that I might find some clue to his trouble—but I suppose he must have seen my wish in my eyes, for he sent me over to the window, saying he wanted to be quite alone for a moment. Then he called me back, and when I came he had his hand over the note-book, and he said to me very solemnly:—\n“‘Wilhelmina’—I knew then that he was in deadly earnest, for he has never called me by that name since he asked me to marry him—‘you know, dear, my ideas of the trust between husband and wife: there should be no secret, no concealment. I have had a great shock, and when I try to think of what it is I feel my head spin round, and I do not know if it was all real or the dreaming of a madman. You know I have had brain fever, and that is to be mad. The secret is here, and I do not want to know it. I want to take up my life here, with our marriage.’ For, my dear, we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities are complete. ‘Are you willing, Wilhelmina, to share my ignorance? Here is the book. Take it and keep it, read it if you will, but never let me know; unless, indeed, some solemn duty should come upon me to go back to the bitter hours, asleep or awake, sane or mad, recorded here.’ He fell back exhausted, and I put the book under his pillow, and kissed him. I have asked Sister Agatha to beg the Superior to let our wedding be this afternoon, and am waiting her reply....\n“She has come and told me that the chaplain of the English mission church has been sent for. We are to be married in an hour, or as soon after as Jonathan awakes....\n“Lucy, the time has come and gone. I feel very solemn, but very, very happy. Jonathan woke a little after the hour, and all was ready, and he sat up in bed, propped up with pillows. He answered his ‘I will’ firmly and strongly. I could hardly speak; my heart was so full that even those words seemed to choke me. The dear sisters were so kind. Please God, I shall never, never forget them, nor the grave and sweet responsibilities I have taken upon me. I must tell you of my wedding present. When the chaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my husband—oh, Lucy, it is the first time I have written the words ‘my husband’—left me alone with my husband, I took the book from under his pillow, and wrapped it up in white paper, and tied it with a little bit of pale blue ribbon which was round my neck, and sealed it over the knot with sealing-wax, and for my seal I used my wedding ring. Then I kissed it and showed it to my husband, and told him that I would keep it so, and then it would be an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each other; that I would never open it unless it were for his own dear sake or for the sake of some stern duty. Then he took my hand in his, and oh, Lucy, it was the first time he took his wife’s hand, and said that it was the dearest thing in all the wide world, and that he would go through all the past again to win it, if need be. The poor dear meant to have said a part of the past, but he cannot think of time yet, and I shall not wonder if at first he mixes up not only the month, but the year.\n“Well, my dear, what could I say? I could only tell him that I was the happiest woman in all the wide world, and that I had nothing to give him except myself, my life, and my trust, and that with these went my love and duty for all the days of my life. And, my dear, when he kissed me, and drew me to him with his poor weak hands, it was like a very solemn pledge between us....\n“Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this? It is not only because it is all sweet to me, but because you have been, and are, very dear to me. It was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came from the schoolroom to prepare for the world of life. I want you to see now, and with the eyes of a very happy wife, whither duty has led me; so that in your own married life you too may be all happy as I am. My dear, please Almighty God, your life may be all it promises: a long day of sunshine, with no harsh wind, no forgetting duty, no distrust. I must not wish you no pain, for that can never be; but I do hope you will be always as happy as I am now. Good-bye, my dear. I shall post this at once, and, perhaps, write you very soon again. I must stop, for Jonathan is waking—I must attend to my husband!\n“Your ever-loving\n“Mina Harker.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Buda-Pesth, August 24th. My dearest Lucy, I know you're eager to hear what's happened since we said goodbye at the Whitby train station. Well, I reached Hull without incident, took the boat to Hamburg, and then the train here. The journey itself is a blur; all I remember is the thought of seeing Jonathan and knowing I needed to rest as much as possible because I'd be nursing him. I found my poor dear so incredibly thin, pale, and weak. The determined look in his eyes is gone, and the quiet dignity I mentioned before has vanished. He's just a shadow of his former self, and he can't seem to recall anything that happened to him recently. Or at least, he wants me to believe that, and I won't push him. He's clearly suffered a terrible shock, and I worry that trying to remember could harm his fragile mind. Sister Agatha, who is a wonderful person and a natural nurse, told me he talked about dreadful things while he was delirious. I asked her what they were, but she just made the sign of the cross and refused, saying the ravings of the sick are sacred secrets between them and God, and a nurse is bound to respect that trust. She's a truly kind soul, and the next day, seeing how upset I was, she brought it up again. While she still wouldn't say what he raved about, she did add, 'I can tell you this much, dear: it wasn't about anything he did wrong, and you, as his future wife, have no reason to worry. He hasn't forgotten you or his obligations to you. His fears were of grand and terrifying things that no human can comprehend.' I think the sweet woman actually believed I might be jealous, imagining my poor Jonathan had fallen for someone else! The thought of me being jealous over Jonathan is ridiculous! And yet, Lucy, I must confess, a wave of relief washed over me when I knew another woman wasn't the cause of his distress. I'm sitting by his bed now, watching him sleep. He's waking up! He asked for his coat when he woke, wanting something from a pocket. I asked Sister Agatha, and she brought all his belongings. I saw his notebook among them and was about to ask if I could look at it, hoping for a clue to his troubles. But he must have seen the desire in my eyes because he sent me to the window, saying he needed a moment alone. When he called me back, he had his hand on the notebook and spoke to me very seriously: 'Wilhelmina' - I knew then he was utterly serious, as he hasn't used that name since he proposed - 'dear, you know my views on trust between a husband and wife: there should be no secrets, no hiding anything. I've had a terrible shock, and when I try to think about it, my head spins, and I can't tell if it was real or the delusion of a madman. You know I had brain fever, and that's akin to madness. The secret is in this book, and I don't want to know it. I want to start my life here with our marriage.' We had decided to get married as soon as the paperwork was done. 'Are you willing, Wilhelmina,' he continued, 'to share my not knowing? Here is the book. Take it and keep it; read it if you want, but never let me know what's in it, unless, of course, some crucial duty requires me to revisit those dreadful hours, whether they were real or imagined, sane or insane, as recorded here.' He fell back, exhausted, and I placed the book under his pillow and kissed him. I've asked Sister Agatha to petition the Superior to allow our wedding this afternoon, and I'm waiting for her response. She just came back and told me the chaplain from the English mission church has been summoned. We are to be married in about an hour, or as soon as Jonathan is awake. Lucy, the time has come and gone. I feel very serious, but incredibly, wonderfully happy. Jonathan woke up a little after the hour, everything was prepared, and he sat up in bed, supported by pillows. He answered his 'I will' with a firm, strong voice. I could barely speak; my heart was so full that even those words felt like they were choking me. The dear sisters were so kind. God willing, I will never, ever forget them, or the solemn and sweet responsibilities I've now accepted. I must tell you about my wedding present. After the chaplain and sisters left me alone with my husband - oh, Lucy, it's the first time I've written 'my husband' - I took the book from under his pillow, wrapped it in white paper, tied it with a small piece of pale blue ribbon from around my neck, and sealed the knot with sealing wax, using my wedding ring as the seal. Then I kissed it and showed it to my husband, telling him I would keep it that way, and it would be a visible sign throughout our lives of the trust we share; that I would only ever open it for his own dear sake or because of some serious obligation. Then he took my hand in his, and oh, Lucy, it was the first time he held his wife's hand, and he said it was the most precious thing in the world, and he would relive everything he's been through just to win it, if necessary. The poor dear meant a *part* of the past, but he can't think clearly about time yet, and I won't be surprised if he confuses not just months but years at first. Well, my dear, what could I say? I could only tell him I was the happiest woman in the world and that I had nothing to give him but myself, my life, and my trust, and that my love and duty for all my days came with those. And, dear, when he kissed me and pulled me close with his poor weak hands, it felt like a very sacred promise between us. Lucy dear, do you know why I'm telling you all this? It's not just because these moments are precious to me, but because you have been, and remain, so dear to me. It was my privilege to be your friend and mentor when you left school and prepared for the world. I want you to see now, through the eyes of a very happy wife, where my sense of duty has led me, so that in your own married life, you too can be as happy as I am. My dear, please God, your life will fulfill all its promise: a long period of sunshine, without harshness, without neglecting duty, without distrust. I can't wish you no pain, as that's impossible, but I do hope you will *always* be as happy as I am *now*. Goodbye, my dear. I'll mail this immediately and maybe write again very soon. I must stop now; Jonathan is waking - I must attend to my husband! Your ever-loving, Mina Harker.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Buda-Pesth, August 24.\n\nMy dearest Lucy,\n\nI know you must be eager to hear about everything that has transpired since we parted at the Whitby train station. My journey went smoothly: I arrived safely in Hull, caught the boat to Hamburg, and then traveled by train to my destination. I can’t remember much of the trip except that I was eager to reach Jonathan, knowing I might need to care for him and thus should rest as much as I could. When I found him, he looked so thin, pale, and weak—he hardly seemed like himself. The determination I once saw in him was gone, and his dignified demeanor had disappeared. He seemed a mere shadow of his former self and claims he can’t recall anything that’s happened recently. Whether that’s true or not, I won’t press him about it; he’s clearly suffered a terrible shock and trying to remember could stress his fragile mind too much. Sister Agatha, a wonderful nurse, told me that while Jonathan was delirious, he spoke of awful things. I asked her what he said, but she would only make the sign of the cross and insist those confessions are sacred—nurses must keep such secrets. She’s very kind, though, and the next day, seeing I was upset, she assured me Jonathan hadn’t done anything wrong and I had no reason to worry as his fiancée. She seemed to think I might be jealous another woman was involved, but I was relieved to know otherwise! I’m now typing this while Jonathan sleeps beside me—he is waking up…\n\nWhen he awoke, he asked for his coat to retrieve something. Sister Agatha brought his belongings. I noticed his notebook and considered asking to read it, hoping for insight into his troubles, but he must have sensed my thoughts and asked for privacy. When he called me back, he covered the notebook and addressed me very seriously—calling me Wilhelmina, which he hasn’t done since proposing. He explained he believed there should be absolute honesty between husband and wife. He admitted the shock he experienced left his memory uncertain—he isn’t sure if it was real or a madman’s dream. The secret, he said, is in the notebook, but he doesn’t want to know its contents now; he’d rather move forward together with our wedding approaching. He asked if I would agree to share his ignorance about whatever tortured him. He gave me the book, telling me to read it only if I must for his sake or some serious duty. I placed the notebook under his pillow and kissed him. I’ve since asked Sister Agatha to obtain permission for us to marry this afternoon, and I’m waiting for a reply…\n\nShe’s returned to say that the English mission church chaplain is coming; we’ll be married in about an hour as soon as Jonathan wakes up…\n\nIt’s done! Though I feel solemn, I am incredibly happy. Jonathan woke shortly after and everything was prepared—sitting up in bed, he firmly declared his vows. I was so overwhelmed with emotion I could hardly speak. The sisters were so kind. I pray I will never forget them or the significant vows I have made. I must tell you about my wedding present: after the chaplain and sisters left, I took Jonathan’s notebook, wrapped it in white paper, tied it with the blue ribbon I wore, and sealed it with my wedding ring. I told Jonathan I’d keep it safe as a symbol of our trust, never opening it unless it was truly necessary. He took my hand—his wife’s hand for the first time—and told me he’d gladly endure the past again to win me. Though he meant only parts of his past, he’s still confused about time, and I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s mixing up months or even years.\n\nWhat could I say? All I could tell him was that I am the happiest woman in the world, and have nothing to give him but myself, my life, and my trust, along with my love and devotion forever. When he kissed me and embraced me with his frail hands, it felt like a profound promise between us…\n\nLucy dear, do you know why I’m sharing all of this with you? It’s not just because it makes me happy, but also because you have always meant so much to me. I had the privilege of guiding you as you left school and started your adult life. Now, I want you to see—through the eyes of a happy wife—just where duty has led me, so that in your own marriage, you might find the same happiness. I pray your life will be as lovely as it promises to be: filled with sunshine, faithful to duty, and untouched by distrust. I can’t wish you a life without pain, but I do hope you are always as happy as I am now. Goodbye, my dear. I will mail this letter at once and perhaps write soon again. I must stop now, since Jonathan is awakening and I must look after my husband!\n\nYour ever-loving,\n\nMina Harker."

For the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent. Then one night, just as the moon rose, he grew quiet, and kept murmuring to himself: “Now I can wait; now I can wait.” The attendant came to tell me, so I ran down at once to have a look at him. He was still in the strait-waistcoat and in the padded room, but the suffused look had gone from his face, and his eyes had something of their old pleading—I might almost say, “cringing”—softness. I was satisfied with his present condition, and directed him to be relieved. The attendants hesitated, but finally carried out my wishes without protest. It was a strange thing that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust, for, coming close to me, he said in a whisper, all the while looking furtively at them:—\n“They think I could hurt you! Fancy me hurting you! The fools!”\nIt was soothing, somehow, to the feelings to find myself dissociated even in the mind of this poor madman from the others; but all the same I do not follow his thought. Am I to take it that I have anything in common with him, so that we are, as it were, to stand together; or has he to gain from me some good so stupendous that my well-being is needful to him? I must find out later on. To-night he will not speak. Even the offer of a kitten or even a full-grown cat will not tempt him. He will only say: “I don’t take any stock in cats.

He was still in the strait-waistcoat inside the padded cell, but the flushed, swollen look had vanished from his face, and his eyes showed some of their earlier pleading—almost 'cringing'—gentleness. I was content with his condition at that moment and ordered that he be released from his restraints. The attendants hesitated but eventually complied with my wishes without arguing. It was odd that the patient had enough wit to perceive their mistrust, because, coming close to me, he whispered while casting stealthy glances at them, \"They think I could hurt you! Imagine me harming you! The idiots!\" Finding myself differentiated from the others, even in the mind of this unfortunate madman, was somehow reassuring, but I still don't grasp his logic. Am I supposed to understand that I have something in common with him, meaning we are, so to speak, united; or does he require some incredibly valuable benefit from me such that my welfare is necessary for him? I must determine this later. He will not speak tonight. Not even offering him a kitten or a full-grown cat will persuade him. He will only repeat, \"I don't care about cats.

Fools!” Somehow, it was comforting that even this poor madman separated me, in his mind, from the staff; yet I don’t understand his reasoning. Does he see us as allies, or is there something he needs from me that’s so important my safety matters to him? I need to investigate further. Tonight, he won’t speak, not even the offer of a kitten or a grown cat can tempt him. All he says is: “I don’t care about cats. I have bigger concerns now, and I can wait; I can wait.”"

Three nights has the same thing happened—violent all day then quiet from moonrise to sunrise. I wish I could get some clue to the cause. It would almost seem as if there was some influence which came and went. Happy thought! We shall to-night play sane wits against mad ones. He escaped before without our help; to-night he shall escape with it. We shall give him a chance, and have the men ready to follow in case they are required....\n23 August.—“The unexpected always happens.” How well Disraeli knew life. Our bird when he found the cage open would not fly, so all our subtle arrangements were for nought. At any rate, we have proved one thing; that the spells of quietness last a reasonable time. We shall in future be able to ease his bonds for a few hours each day. I have given orders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the padded room, when once he is quiet, until an hour before sunrise. The poor soul’s body will enjoy the relief even if his mind cannot appreciate it. Hark! The unexpected again! I am called; the patient has once more escaped.\nLater.—Another night adventure. Renfield artfully waited until the attendant was entering the room to inspect. Then he dashed out past him and flew down the passage. I sent word for the attendants to follow. Again he went into the grounds of the deserted house, and we found him in the same place, pressed against the old chapel door. When he saw me he became furious, and had not the attendants seized him in time, he would have tried to kill me. As we were holding him a strange thing happened. He suddenly redoubled his efforts, and then as suddenly grew calm. I looked round instinctively, but could see nothing. Then I caught the patient’s eye and followed it, but could trace nothing as it looked into the moonlit sky except a big bat, which was flapping its silent and ghostly way to the west. Bats usually wheel and flit about, but this one seemed to go straight on, as if it knew where it was bound for or had some intention of its own. The patient grew calmer every instant, and presently said:—\n“You needn’t tie me; I shall go quietly!” Without trouble we came back to the house.

When our patient found his door open, he didn't leave, rendering our clever plan useless. However, we did confirm that his periods of calmness last a reasonable duration. From now on, we can loosen his restraints for a few hours daily. I have instructed the night attendant simply to confine him to the padded room when he is quiet until one hour before sunrise.

Renfield cunningly waited for the attendant to enter the room for inspection. He then darted past him and sped down the corridor. I sent orders for the attendants to chase him. He again went to the grounds of the abandoned house, and we found him at the same spot, pressed against the old chapel door. Upon seeing me, he became enraged, and the attendants barely restrained him before he could attack me. While we held him, something odd occurred.

Then I followed the patient's gaze but could only see a large bat in the moonlit sky, making its silent, ghost-like way straight west. Bats usually flutter erratically, but this one flew directly, as if it knew its destination or had a purpose.

The same pattern has occurred for three nights now: violent behavior throughout the day, and calm from moonrise to sunrise. I wish I knew the reason behind this. It seems as if there’s some mysterious influence that comes and goes. I’ve had an idea—we’ll pit rational minds against madness tonight. Previously, he managed to escape on his own; this time, we’ll allow him the opportunity to escape, with the staff ready to follow him if needed.\n\nAugust 23—“The unexpected always happens.” Disraeli understood life well. When our patient saw his door open, he chose not to flee, making all our clever planning pointless. At least now we know that his calm periods last for a predictable duration, so we can loosen his restraints for a few hours daily. I’ve instructed the night attendant to simply lock him in the padded room once he settles down, until an hour before dawn. Even if his mind doesn’t notice the difference, his body will benefit from the respite. Wait, something unforeseen has happened again—I’m being summoned because the patient has escaped once more.\n\nLater—Another nighttime incident. Renfield cunningly waited until the attendant entered his room, then burst past him into the corridor. I alerted the staff to pursue him. Again, he ran into the grounds of the empty house, and we found him at the chapel door. When he saw me, he flew into a rage and, had the attendants not caught him in time, might have tried to attack me. While restraining him, something unexpected occurred—he suddenly fought harder, then just as quickly became calm. Instinctively, I glanced around but saw nothing. Following his gaze into the moonlight, I noticed only a large bat flying silently westward. Unlike the usual erratic bats, this one flew in a straight line, as if with a purpose. Renfield became calmer by the second and soon said, “You needn’t tie me; I shall go quietly!” We returned to the house without incident. His unusual calm feels unsettling to me, and I won’t soon forget this night…\n\nLucy Westenra’s Diary"

At the same time, I am not by any means satisfied with her appearance; she is woefully different from what she was when I saw her last. Of course you must bear in mind that I did not have full opportunity of examination such as I should wish; our very friendship makes a little difficulty which not even medical science or custom can bridge over. I had better tell you exactly what happened, leaving you to draw, in a measure, your own conclusions. I shall then say what I have done and propose doing.\n“I found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits. Her mother was present, and in a few seconds I made up my mind that she was trying all she knew to mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious. I have no doubt she guesses, if she does not know, what need of caution there is. We lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful, we got, as some kind of reward for our labours, some real cheerfulness amongst us. Then Mrs. Westenra went to lie down, and Lucy was left with me. We went into her boudoir, and till we got there her gaiety remained, for the servants were coming and going. As soon as the door was closed, however, the mask fell from her face, and she sank down into a chair with a great sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand. When I saw that her high spirits had failed, I at once took advantage of her reaction to make a diagnosis. She said to me very sweetly:—\n“‘I cannot tell you how I loathe talking about myself.’ I reminded her that a doctor’s confidence was sacred, but that you were grievously anxious about her. She caught on to my meaning at once, and settled that matter in a word. ‘Tell Arthur everything you choose. I do not care for myself, but all for him!’ So I am quite free.\n“I could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless, but I could not see the usual anæmic signs, and by a chance I was actually able to test the quality of her blood, for in opening a window which was stiff a cord gave way, and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass. It was a slight matter in itself, but it gave me an evident chance, and I secured a few drops of the blood and have analysed them. The qualitative analysis gives a quite normal condition, and shows, I should infer, in itself a vigorous state of health. In other physical matters I was quite satisfied that there is no need for anxiety; but as there must be a cause somewhere, I have come to the conclusion that it must be something mental. She complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily at times, and of heavy, lethargic sleep, with dreams that frighten her, but regarding which she can remember nothing. She says that as a child she used to walk in her sleep, and that when in Whitby the habit came back, and that once she walked out in the night and went to East Cliff, where Miss Murray found her; but she assures me that of late the habit has not returned. I am in doubt, and so have done the best thing I know of; I have written to my old friend and master, Professor Van Helsing, of Amsterdam, who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the world. I have asked him to come over, and as you told me that all things were to be at your charge, I have mentioned to him who you are and your relations to Miss Westenra. This, my dear fellow, is in obedience to your wishes, for I am only too proud and happy to do anything I can for her. Van Helsing would, I know, do anything for me for a personal reason, so, no matter on what ground he comes, we must accept his wishes. He is a seemingly arbitrary man, but this is because he knows what he is talking about better than any one else. He is a philosopher and a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of his day; and he has, I believe, an absolutely open mind. This, with an iron nerve, a temper of the ice-brook, an indomitable resolution, self-command, and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings, and the kindliest and truest heart that beats—these form his equipment for the noble work that he is doing for mankind—work both in theory and practice, for his views are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy. I tell you these facts that you may know why I have such confidence in him. I have asked him to come at once. I shall see Miss Westenra to-morrow again. She is to meet me at the Stores, so that I may not alarm her mother by too early a repetition of my call.\n“Yours always,\n“John Seward.”\nLetter, Abraham Van Helsing, M. D., D. Ph., D. Lit., etc., etc., to Dr. Seward.\n“2 September.\n“My good Friend,—\n“When I have received your letter I am already coming to you. By good fortune I can leave just at once, without wrong to any of those who have trusted me. Were fortune other, then it were bad for those who have trusted, for I come to my friend when he call me to aid those he holds dear. Tell your friend that when that time you suck from my wound so swiftly the poison of the gangrene from that knife that our other friend, too nervous, let slip, you did more for him when he wants my aids and you call for them than all his great fortune could do. But it is pleasure added to do for him, your friend; it is to you that I come. Have then rooms for me at the Great Eastern Hotel, so that I may be near to hand, and please it so arrange that we may see the young lady not too late on to-morrow, for it is likely that I may have to return here that night. But if need be I shall come again in three days, and stay longer if it must. Till then good-bye, my friend John.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "On September 2nd, Dr. John Seward wrote to a dear friend expressing concern about Miss Westenra's health. Despite finding no evidence of physical illness or malfunction, he was worried by her drastically changed appearance. He noted that his friendship with the family made a complete medical examination difficult. Seward described how Miss Westenra initially appeared cheerful, evidently trying to conceal her true condition from her mother to prevent anxiety. They managed some genuine cheerfulness during a shared meal. Once alone after her mother rested, Miss Westenra's forced gaiety vanished, and she appeared deeply distressed, admitting her dislike of discussing her health but agreeing to share anything for her friend 'Arthur'. Seward observed she seemed pale but lacked typical signs of anaemia. A minor cut on her hand from broken glass while opening a window unexpectedly allowed him to test her blood, which analysis showed was normal and seemed indicative of good health. With no other physical issues found, Seward concluded the problem was likely mental. Miss Westenra reported occasional breathing difficulties, heavy, frightening dreams she couldn't remember, and admitted to a history of sleepwalking that had returned in Whitby, leading to her being found by Miss Murray on East Cliff, although she claimed it had stopped recently. Unsure how to proceed, Seward decided to contact his former teacher, Professor Van Helsing of Amsterdam, a renowned expert in complex diseases. He asked Van Helsing to come immediately, explained his friend's relationship to Miss Westenra, and mentioned costs were covered. Seward highly praised Van Helsing's intellect, character (including an open mind, strong will, composure, resilience, self-control, tolerance, and kindness), explaining his confidence in him. He planned to meet Miss Westenra the next day at the Stores to avoid alarming her mother with another visit to the house so soon. On the same date, September 2nd, Professor Van Helsing replied to Dr. Seward, stating he was already travelling upon receiving the letter, fortunate to be able to leave immediately without neglecting his patients. He emphasized that he was coming primarily for Seward, recalling a past event where Seward's quick action saved a friend. He was also happy to help Seward's friend, but his loyalty was to Seward. He asked Seward to book him a room at the Great Eastern Hotel for easy access and requested arrangements to see the young lady early the next day, as he might need to return home that night, though he would return in three days and stay longer if necessary.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "September 2nd.\n\nMy Dear Friend,\n\nRegarding Miss Westenra’s health, I am writing to tell you promptly that, in my opinion, there is no obvious disease or medical issue that I can diagnose. However, I still am not satisfied with her appearance; she looks much changed from when I last saw her. Keep in mind, I didn't have as thorough an examination as I would have liked, as our friendship made things a bit delicate—something even medical custom can’t overcome. I’ll describe exactly what happened and leave you to form your own judgment, then explain what I’ve done and plan to do next.\n\nMiss Westenra seemed cheerful when I arrived. Her mother was with us, and very quickly I realized Lucy was trying hard to hide her condition from her mother and stop her from worrying. I suspect Lucy knows, or at least senses, that caution is necessary. We had lunch together, and, making an effort to be pleasant, we eventually found ourselves actually enjoying ourselves for a time. After lunch, Mrs. Westenra rested, leaving Lucy alone with me. We went to Lucy’s private room, and as soon as we were alone her cheerful facade disappeared—she slumped in a chair sighing deeply, covering her face with her hand. Seeing her spirits drop, I took the opportunity to try to discuss her health. She said gently that she hated talking about herself. I reminded her that a doctor keeps confidences and that you were very concerned for her. She understood immediately and told me I could tell you everything, that her only concern was for you, not herself. So I have a free hand.\n\nI could tell she was somewhat pale, but I couldn’t find the typical signs of anemia. By chance, while opening a stiff window, the cord broke and she slightly cut her hand. This minor accident let me collect and test a sample of her blood. The test showed her blood was perfectly normal—suggesting good overall health. Otherwise, her physical health is fine, so I suspect the real problem may be psychological. She spoke of occasionally struggling to breathe easily and feeling weighed down by heavy sleep and strange, frightening dreams, though she can’t describe them. She mentioned that she used to sleepwalk as a child, and that the habit returned in Whitby—one night she even wandered out and was found by Miss Murray—but she assures me she hasn’t been sleepwalking recently. I’m unsure what to think, so I’ve done the best thing I know: I’ve written to Professor Van Helsing of Amsterdam, who is the world’s leading authority on rare illnesses, asking him to come and help. Since you assured me you would cover any expense, I’ve told him about your relationship with Miss Westenra. I’m happy to help in any way I can. Van Helsing is a unique man—he can seem abrupt, but he’s extremely knowledgeable, open-minded, brave, calm, decisive, self-controlled, and compassionate. He is also a great philosopher and leading scientist. I want you to know why I have such faith in him. I have asked him to come immediately. I am seeing Miss Westenra again tomorrow (we’ll meet at the Stores to avoid alarming her mother with too many visits).\n\nYours always,\nJohn Seward.\n\n---\n\nLetter from Abraham Van Helsing, to Dr. Seward\nSeptember 2.\n\nMy Good Friend,\n\nAs soon as I got your letter I was already preparing to come to you. Fortunately, I can leave immediately without neglecting anyone who relies on me. If that weren’t the case, it would be unfortunate for those who depend on me, because when my friend calls for my help with someone dear to him, I must come. Remind your friend that when you swiftly removed the gangrene poison from my wound caused by another friend’s carelessness, you did more than even the greatest wealth could do for a man in need. It is my pleasure, as well as my duty, to help. Arrange a room for me at the Great Eastern Hotel so I can stay near, and please try to ensure we can see the young lady not too late tomorrow, as I may need to return right away. But if it’s necessary I’ll come back in three days and stay longer if needed. Until then, goodbye, my friend John."

          "text_segment": "“3 September.\n“My dear Art,—\n“Van Helsing has come and gone. He came on with me to Hillingham, and found that, by Lucy’s discretion, her mother was lunching out, so that we were alone with her. Van Helsing made a very careful examination of the patient. He is to report to me, and I shall advise you, for of course I was not present all the time. He is, I fear, much concerned, but says he must think. When I told him of our friendship and how you trust to me in the matter, he said: ‘You must tell him all you think. Tell him what I think, if you can guess it, if you will. Nay, I am not jesting. This is no jest, but life and death, perhaps more.’ I asked what he meant by that, for he was very serious. This was when we had come back to town, and he was having a cup of tea before starting on his return to Amsterdam. He would not give me any further clue. You must not be angry with me, Art, because his very reticence means that all his brains are working for her good. He will speak plainly enough when the time comes, be sure. So I told him I would simply write an account of our visit, just as if I were doing a descriptive special article for The Daily Telegraph. He seemed not to notice, but remarked that the smuts in London were not quite so bad as they used to be when he was a student here. I am to get his report to-morrow if he can possibly make it. In any case I am to have a letter.\n“Well, as to the visit. Lucy was more cheerful than on the day I first saw her, and certainly looked better. She had lost something of the ghastly look that so upset you, and her breathing was normal. She was very sweet to the professor (as she always is), and tried to make him feel at ease; though I could see that the poor girl was making a hard struggle for it. I believe Van Helsing saw it, too, for I saw the quick look under his bushy brows that I knew of old. Then he began to chat of all things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinite geniality that I could see poor Lucy’s pretense of animation merge into reality. Then, without any seeming change, he brought the conversation gently round to his visit, and suavely said:—\n“‘My dear young miss, I have the so great pleasure because you are so much beloved. That is much, my dear, ever were there that which I do not see. They told me you were down in the spirit, and that you were of a ghastly pale. To them I say: “Pouf!”’ And he snapped his fingers at me and went on: ‘But you and I shall show them how wrong they are. How can he’—and he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that with which once he pointed me out to his class, on, or rather after, a particular occasion which he never fails to remind me of—‘know anything of a young ladies? He has his madmans to play with, and to bring them back to happiness, and to those that love them. It is much to do, and, oh, but there are rewards, in that we can bestow such happiness. But the young ladies! He has no wife nor daughter, and the young do not tell themselves to the young, but to the old, like me, who have known so many sorrows and the causes of them. So, my dear, we will send him away to smoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and I have little talk all to ourselves.’ I took the hint, and strolled about, and presently the professor came to the window and called me in. He looked grave, but said: ‘I have made careful examination, but there is no functional cause. With you I agree that there has been much blood lost; it has been, but is not. But the conditions of her are in no way anæmic. I have asked her to send me her maid, that I may ask just one or two question, that so I may not chance to miss nothing. I know well what she will say. And yet there is cause; there is always cause for everything. I must go back home and think. You must send to me the telegram every day; and if there be cause I shall come again. The disease—for not to be all well is a disease—interest me, and the sweet young dear, she interest me too. She charm me, and for her, if not for you or disease, I come.’\n“As I tell you, he would not say a word more, even when we were alone. And so now, Art, you know all I know. I shall keep stern watch. I trust your poor father is rallying. It must be a terrible thing to you, my dear old fellow, to be placed in such a position between two people who are both so dear to you. I know your idea of duty to your father, and you are right to stick to it; but, if need be, I shall send you word to come at once to Lucy; so do not be over-anxious unless you hear from me.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "September 3rd.\n\n\"My dear Art,\n\nVan Helsing has completed his visit and departed. He traveled with me to Hillingham. Due to Lucy's foresight, her mother was out for lunch, which allowed us to see Lucy alone. Van Helsing performed a very detailed examination of the patient. He will be providing me with a report, and I will keep you informed, as I was not present throughout the entire examination. I fear he is significantly concerned, but he stated he needs time to deliberate. When I mentioned our close friendship and how much you rely on me in this matter, he said: 'You must relay everything you believe. Convey what I believe, if you can sense it, if you are willing. No, I am not joking. This is not a joke, but a matter of life and death, perhaps even more.' I inquired about the meaning of 'perhaps more,' as he was extremely serious. This was when we were back in London, and he was having tea before starting his journey back to Amsterdam. He would not offer any further explanation. Please do not be upset with me, Art, because his very silence means that his entire intellect is focused on her welfare. Rest assured, he will speak plainly when the appropriate time arrives. So, I told him I would simply write a detailed account of our visit, just as if I were composing a descriptive feature article for *The Daily Telegraph*. He seemed not to notice but commented that the amount of soot in London was not quite as bad as it was when he studied here years ago. I am scheduled to receive his report tomorrow if at all possible. In any case, I am guaranteed to receive a letter.\n\n\"Well, concerning the visit, Lucy was more cheerful than on the day I first saw her, and she certainly appeared healthier. She had lost some of that terrifyingly pale look that disturbed you so much, and her breathing was normal. She was very kind to the professor, as she always is, and attempted to make him feel comfortable, although I could see that the poor girl was putting in a great effort. I believe Van Helsing perceived it too, as I saw the quick glance from under his bushy eyebrows that I recognized from before. Then, he began to converse about all sorts of topics except for ourselves and illnesses, doing so with such immense warmth that I could see poor Lucy's feigned animation transform into genuine liveliness. Then, without any noticeable change, he gently guided the conversation towards his visit and said smoothly:\n\n\"'My dear young lady, I have the great pleasure of meeting you because you are so beloved. That is significant, my dear, even if there were something I did not see. They informed me that you were feeling low and were ghastly pale. To them, I say: \"Pouf!\"' And he snapped his fingers at me and continued: 'But you and I will show them how wrong they are. How can he' - and he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as when he once pointed me out to his class after a specific incident he never fails to mention - 'understand anything about young ladies? He has his mentally disturbed patients to work with, to help them find happiness again and return to those who love them. It is a great deal of work, and indeed, there are rewards in being able to bring such happiness. But young women! He has no wife or daughter, and young people do not share their confidences with other young people, but with the old, like me, who have experienced many sorrows and understand their origins. So, my dear, we will send him away to smoke a cigarette in the garden while you and I have a little private conversation.' I took the hint, and walked around outside. Presently, the professor came to the window and signaled me to come back in. He looked grave but said: 'I have conducted a careful examination, but there is no physical explanation. I agree with you that there has been considerable blood loss; it occurred, but it is not ongoing. However, her condition is by no means anemic. I have asked her to send me her maid so that I may ask just one or two questions, ensuring that I do not miss anything. I know well what she will say. And yet there is a cause; there is always a reason for everything. I must return home and reflect. You must send me a telegram every day; and if there is cause for concern, I shall come again. The ailment - for not being entirely well is an ailment - interests me, and the sweet young dear, she interests me too. She captivates me, and I will come for her sake, if not for yours or the disease's.'\n\n\"As I told you, he would not say another word, even when we were alone. And so now, Art, you know everything that I know. I will maintain a strict vigil. I trust your poor father is improving. My dear old friend, it must be a terrible predicament for you, being caught between two people who are both so important to you. I understand your sense of duty to your father, and you are right to adhere to it; but, if necessary, I will send you a message to come to Lucy immediately; so do not be overly anxious unless you receive word from me.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "September 3rd.\n\nDear Art,\n\nVan Helsing visited Hillingham with me today. Thanks to Lucy’s good sense, her mother was out for lunch, so we were alone with her. Van Helsing performed a thorough examination of Lucy and will report his findings to me, which I’ll pass on to you, since I wasn’t present the entire time. He seems quite worried but says he needs time to think. I told him that you trust me with Lucy’s care, and he insisted I should share everything with you, even his own thoughts if I can infer them, saying this is a matter of life or death—or perhaps something even greater. I asked what he meant, but he wouldn’t say more. Later, when he was having tea before leaving for Amsterdam, he still wouldn’t elaborate further. Please don’t be upset with me for not knowing more; his reluctance is because he’s using all his expertise for Lucy’s sake. He’ll speak clearly when he’s ready. I told him I’d write up a report of our visit, as if for The Daily Telegraph, but he only commented on the London smog. He promised to send me his report tomorrow if possible, or at least a letter.\n\nNow about the visit: Lucy seemed more cheerful and looked healthier than when I last saw her. The dreadful pallor that disturbed you was improved, and her breathing was normal. She tried very hard to make Van Helsing feel welcome, and I suspect he noticed her effort just as I did. To put her at ease, Van Helsing led the conversation away from Lucy’s illness, and eventually her forced liveliness became real. Then, subtly, he brought the subject back to his visit and kindly told Lucy she was much loved and that her condition wasn’t as serious as others thought. He joked a bit about me, saying I wasn’t knowledgeable about young ladies, and suggested he and Lucy should talk alone while I waited in the garden. After a while, Van Helsing called me back inside. He looked serious, explaining that although Lucy had lost blood, he couldn’t find any underlying cause and she wasn’t actually anemic. He asked to speak to her maid to clarify a few points, though he felt he already knew the answers. He said there is always a cause for every symptom, so he needs to think further at home. He wants me to send him daily telegrams and will return if there’s any need. He also expressed genuine fondness for Lucy and interest in her illness.\n\nAs I said, Van Helsing wouldn’t reveal anything more, even in private. That’s all I know, Art. I’ll keep a close watch over Lucy. I hope your father recovers soon. I understand how hard it must be to be torn between two people you care about. You’re right to care for your father, but, if necessary, I’ll let you know if you should return for Lucy—so only worry if you hear from me."

          "text_segment": "4 September.—Zoöphagous patient still keeps up our interest in him. He had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time. Just before the stroke of noon he began to grow restless. The attendant knew the symptoms, and at once summoned aid. Fortunately the men came at a run, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon he became so violent that it took all their strength to hold him. In about five minutes, however, he began to get more and more quiet, and finally sank into a sort of melancholy, in which state he has remained up to now. The attendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were really appalling; I found my hands full when I got in, attending to some of the other patients who were frightened by him. Indeed, I can quite understand the effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though I was some distance away. It is now after the dinner-hour of the asylum, and as yet my patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen, woe-begone look in his face, which seems rather to indicate than to show something directly. I cannot quite understand it.\nLater.—Another change in my patient. At five o’clock I looked in on him, and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be. He was catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his capture by making nail-marks on the edge of the door between the ridges of padding. When he saw me, he came over and apologised for his bad conduct, and asked me in a very humble, cringing way to be led back to his own room and to have his note-book again. I thought it well to humour him: so he is back in his room with the window open. He has the sugar of his tea spread out on the window-sill, and is reaping quite a harvest of flies. He is not now eating them, but putting them into a box, as of old, and is already examining the corners of his room to find a spider. I tried to get him to talk about the past few days, for any clue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me; but he would not rise. For a moment or two he looked very sad, and said in a sort of far-away voice, as though saying it rather to himself than to me:—\n“All over! all over! He has deserted me. No hope for me now unless I do it for myself!” Then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way, he said: “Doctor, won’t you be very good to me and let me have a little more sugar? I think it would be good for me.”\n“And the flies?” I said.\n“Yes! The flies like it, too, and I like the flies; therefore I like it.” And there are people who know so little as to think that madmen do not argue. I procured him a double supply, and left him as happy a man as, I suppose, any in the world. I wish I could fathom his mind.\nMidnight.—Another change in him. I had been to see Miss Westenra, whom I found much better, and had just returned, and was standing at our own gate looking at the sunset, when once more I heard him yelling. As his room is on this side of the house, I could hear it better than in the morning. It was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky beauty of a sunset over London, with its lurid lights and inky shadows and all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul water, and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stone building, with its wealth of breathing misery, and my own desolate heart to endure it all. I reached him just as the sun was going down, and from his window saw the red disc sink. As it sank he became less and less frenzied; and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him, an inert mass, on the floor. It is wonderful, however, what intellectual recuperative power lunatics have, for within a few minutes he stood up quite calmly and looked around him. I signalled to the attendants not to hold him, for I was anxious to see what he would do. He went straight over to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar; then he took his fly-box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the box; then he shut the window, and crossing over, sat down on his bed. All this surprised me, so I asked him: “Are you not going to keep flies any more?”\n“No,” said he; “I am sick of all that rubbish!” He certainly is a wonderfully interesting study. I wish I could get some glimpse of his mind or of the cause of his sudden passion. Stop; there may be a clue after all, if we can find why to-day his paroxysms came on at high noon and at sunset. Can it be that there is a malign influence of the sun at periods which affects certain natures—as at times the moon does others? We shall see.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "September 4th – My carnivorous patient continues to be a source of great interest. He had a single aggressive episode, which occurred unexpectedly yesterday. Just before noon, he became agitated. Recognizing the signs, the attendant quickly called for help. Fortunately, the staff arrived promptly, just as he became extremely violent at noon, requiring all their strength to restrain him. However, after about five minutes, he gradually calmed down and settled into a state of melancholy, which has persisted since then. The attendant reported that his screams during the fit were terrifying. When I arrived, I was busy attending to other patients who were frightened by his behaviour. I can certainly understand their reaction, as the noise even disturbed me from a distance. It is now past the asylum's dinner hour, and my patient is still sitting in a corner, looking withdrawn and dejected, with a dull, gloomy expression that hints at something rather than directly revealing it. I find this puzzling.\n\nLater – My patient's condition has changed again. At 5 o'clock, I checked on him and found him appearing as happy and content as he used to be. He was catching and eating flies, marking each capture with a fingernail scratch on the door edge between the padding. Upon seeing me, he came over, apologized for his earlier behaviour, and humbly requested to be taken back to his own room and given his notebook. I decided to indulge him, so he is back in his room with the window open. He has spread the sugar from his tea on the windowsill and is gathering a significant number of flies. He isn't eating them now but is putting them into a box, as was his habit previously, and is already searching the room corners for a spider. I attempted to get him to discuss the past few days, as any insight into his thoughts would be immensely helpful, but he was unresponsive. For a moment, he looked very sad and spoke in a distant tone, as if speaking to himself rather than me:\n\"It's all over! All gone! He has abandoned me. There's no hope for me now unless I act myself!\" Then, suddenly turning to me with determination, he asked: \"Doctor, would you please be very kind and give me a little more sugar? I believe it would benefit me.\"\n\"And the flies?\" I inquired.\n\"Yes! The flies enjoy it too, and I like the flies; therefore, I like the sugar.\" It's astonishing how little some people understand that even those deemed insane engage in reasoning. I gave him a double portion and left him seeming as joyful as anyone, I imagine. I wish I could understand his mind.\n\nMidnight – He has changed again. I had visited Miss Westenra, finding her significantly improved, and had just returned, standing at our gate watching the sunset. Suddenly, I heard him yelling once more. Since his room is on this side of the building, I could hear it more clearly than in the morning. It was jarring to turn away from the stunning, hazy beauty of a London sunset, with its intense lights, deep shadows, and the marvellous colours that appear on polluted clouds just as on dirty water, and then face the stark, grim reality of my cold stone building, filled with suffering, and my own lonely heart having to bear it all. I reached him just as the sun was setting, and from his window, I watched the red disk descend. As it sank, his frenzy diminished, and just as it dipped below the horizon, he slipped from the attendants' grasp, collapsing motionlessly onto the floor. It is remarkable, however, what mental resilience people with mental illness possess, for within minutes, he calmly stood up and looked around. I gestured to the attendants not to hold him, curious to see his next action. He went straight to the window and brushed out the sugar crumbs; then he took his fly box, emptied its contents outside, and threw the box away; finally, he closed the window and sat down on his bed. All this surprised me, so I asked: \"Are you not planning to keep flies anymore?\"\n\"No,\" he replied, \"I've had enough of all that nonsense!\" He is unquestionably a fascinating case study. I wish I could gain some insight into his thoughts or the reason for his sudden fits of passion. Wait; perhaps there is a clue after all, if we can determine why his paroxysms today occurred precisely at high noon and at sunset. Could it be that the sun has a harmful influence during certain periods that affects specific temperaments, just as the moon affects others sometimes? We will see.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "September 4th—Our zoöphagous patient continues to fascinate us. He only had a single outburst, occurring at an odd time yesterday. Just before noon he became agitated, and the attendant, recognizing the signs, quickly called for help. The response was swift, and they managed to restrain him just as the clock struck twelve, when he became extremely violent and it took all their strength to subdue him. Within five minutes, he had calmed and fell into a deep depression, a state in which he remains. The attendant reported that his screams during the fit were horrible. I was busy calming other patients distressed by the noise, and even I was affected by it though I was some way off. Now, after the asylum's dinner hour, the patient sits alone brooding, looking gloomy and sorrowful, suggesting but not revealing his feelings, which I can't fully comprehend.\n\nLater—I found another shift in his mood at 5pm. He appeared content, catching flies to eat and tracking them with scratches on the padded door. He greeted me apologetically, humbly asking to return to his own room and for his notebook. I thought it best to oblige, so now he’s back in his room with the window open. He’s spreading tea sugar on the windowsill to attract flies, collecting them in a box rather than eating them, and looking for spiders as before. I tried to get him to talk about past days for clues to his thoughts, but he stayed quiet. He seemed sad for a moment and murmured to himself, “All over! He has deserted me. No hope for me now unless I do it for myself!” Then he asked me earnestly for more sugar, explaining that both he and the flies liked it. Clearly, madmen can reason after all. I gave him double the usual amount and left him as content as anyone could be. I still wish I could understand his mind.\n\nMidnight—He changed again. After visiting Miss Westenra, I returned and was standing at our gate watching the sunset when I heard him screaming again. His room is on this side, so I heard it more clearly than in the morning. The contrast between the beautiful, dramatic sunset over London and the grim reality of the asylum struck me harshly as I hurried in. I reached him just as the sun set. As the red disc disappeared, his frenzy faded; as it vanished completely, he collapsed and lay still on the floor. Remarkably, lunatics recover their senses quickly; within minutes he stood up calmly. I indicated the attendants should release him to observe his behavior. He went to the window, swept away the sugar, emptied his fly-box outside, discarded the box, closed the window, and sat on his bed. Surprised, I asked if he was done keeping flies. He replied, “No, I’m sick of that nonsense!” He remains an intriguing case. I wish I knew the source of his sudden passions. Perhaps there is a clue—both his fits today happened at noon and sunset. Might certain sun phases affect some people as the moon does others? We shall see."

          "text_segment": "6 September.\n“My dear Art,—\n“My news to-day is not so good. Lucy this morning had gone back a bit. There is, however, one good thing which has arisen from it; Mrs. Westenra was naturally anxious concerning Lucy, and has consulted me professionally about her. I took advantage of the opportunity, and told her that my old master, Van Helsing, the great specialist, was coming to stay with me, and that I would put her in his charge conjointly with myself; so now we can come and go without alarming her unduly, for a shock to her would mean sudden death, and this, in Lucy’s weak condition, might be disastrous to her. We are hedged in with difficulties, all of us, my poor old fellow; but, please God, we shall come through them all right. If any need I shall write, so that, if you do not hear from me, take it for granted that I am simply waiting for news. In haste\n\nYours ever,\n“John Seward.”\nDr. Seward’s Diary.\n7 September.—The first thing Van Helsing said to me when we met at Liverpool Street was:—\n“Have you said anything to our young friend the lover of her?”\n“No,” I said. “I waited till I had seen you, as I said in my telegram. I wrote him a letter simply telling him that you were coming, as Miss Westenra was not so well, and that I should let him know if need be.”\n“Right, my friend,” he said, “quite right! Better he not know as yet; perhaps he shall never know. I pray so; but if it be needed, then he shall know all. And, my good friend John, let me caution you. You deal with the madmen. All men are mad in some way or the other; and inasmuch as you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with God’s madmen, too—the rest of the world. You tell not your madmen what you do nor why you do it; you tell them not what you think. So you shall keep knowledge in its place, where it may rest—where it may gather its kind around it and breed. You and I shall keep as yet what we know here, and here.” He touched me on the heart and on the forehead, and then touched himself the same way. “I have for myself thoughts at the present. Later I shall unfold to you.”\n“Why not now?” I asked. “It may do some good; we may arrive at some decision.” He stopped and looked at me, and said:—\n“My friend John, when the corn is grown, even before it has ripened—while the milk of its mother-earth is in him, and the sunshine has not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the husbandman he pull the ear and rub him between his rough hands, and blow away the green chaff, and say to you: ‘Look! he’s good corn; he will make good crop when the time comes.’” I did not see the application, and told him so. For reply he reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, as he used long ago to do at lectures, and said: “The good husbandman tell you so then because he knows, but not till then. But you do not find the good husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow; that is for the children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as of the work of their life. See you now, friend John? I have sown my corn, and Nature has her work to do in making it sprout; if he sprout at all, there’s some promise; and I wait till the ear begins to swell.” He broke off, for he evidently saw that I understood. Then he went on, and very gravely:—\n“You were always a careful student, and your case-book was ever more full than the rest. You were only student then; now you are master, and I trust that good habit have not fail. Remember, my friend, that knowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker. Even if you have not kept the good practise, let me tell you that this case of our dear miss is one that may be—mind, I say may be—of such interest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick the beam, as your peoples say. Take then good note of it. Nothing is too small. I counsel you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises. Hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess. We learn from failure, not from success!”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "September 6th: Dr. Seward writes to Arthur Holmwood, reporting that Lucy's health has worsened. He mentions one positive outcome: Mrs. Westenra, concerned about Lucy, sought his professional advice. Seward used this chance to inform her that his esteemed mentor, the renowned specialist Van Helsing, would be staying with him. This allows them to jointly care for Lucy without alarming Mrs. Westenra, as a shock could be fatal to her and disastrous for Lucy in her current state. Seward acknowledges their shared difficulties but expresses hope they will overcome them. He will only write if necessary, so Arthur should assume no news means he is simply awaiting updates. The letter concludes with Seward's signature.\n\nSeptember 7th: Dr. Seward's Diary Entry: Upon meeting Van Helsing at Liverpool Street station, the first thing Van Helsing asked was if Seward had told Arthur, Lucy's fiancé, anything. Seward replied that he had waited to speak with Van Helsing first, as mentioned in his telegram. He had only sent Arthur a letter stating Van Helsing's arrival due to Miss Westenra's declining health and promising further updates if needed. Van Helsing approved, agreeing it was best for Arthur not to know yet, perhaps never, but affirming he would be told everything if required. Van Helsing then cautioned Seward, drawing a parallel between managing patients and dealing with the world at large. He advised Seward, a specialist in treating the mentally ill, to handle others ('God's madmen') with the same discretion as his patients – not revealing his actions, motives, or thoughts. This way, knowledge remains private and can develop. They would keep their current understanding confidential, represented by touching the heart and forehead. Van Helsing mentioned he had thoughts he would share later. Seward asked why not now, hoping it might help them make a decision. Van Helsing responded with an analogy about a farmer and corn, explaining that a farmer doesn't prematurely assess a crop by digging up the seeds but waits until the ear begins to swell, knowing its potential then. He implied that he was waiting for developments before revealing his ideas, just as a farmer waits for the corn to show clear growth. He noted Seward understood. Van Helsing then continued, emphasizing the importance of meticulous record-keeping, recalling Seward's diligent habits as a student. He urged him to continue this practice, asserting that written knowledge is more reliable than memory, especially in this potentially crucial case. He advised noting everything, including doubts and assumptions, as learning comes from mistakes, not successes.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "6 September.\n\nMy dear Art,\n\nToday my news isn't as positive. Lucy's condition has regressed somewhat this morning. On the bright side, her mother, Mrs. Westenra, was naturally worried and sought my professional opinion. I used this chance to tell her that my former mentor, Van Helsing, a renowned expert, will be staying with me and that together, we'd look after Lucy. Now we can attend to Lucy freely without alarming her mother, since any shock to her could be fatal, which would be catastrophic for Lucy in her current frail state. We're all in a tough situation, my friend, but with hope, we'll make it through. If necessary, I'll write again; so if you don't hear from me, just assume I'm awaiting further updates. Hastily yours,\nJohn Seward.\n\nDr. Seward’s Diary.\n\n7 September.\n\nWhen I met Van Helsing at Liverpool Street, the first thing he asked was:\n\n\"Have you told our young friend, her fiancé, anything?\"\n\nI answered, \"No, I waited to see you as mentioned in my telegram. I only wrote to him to say you were coming because Miss Westenra's health had declined, and I'd inform him if needed.\"\n\n\"Good,\" he replied, \"that is for the best! It's better he doesn't know anything for now; maybe he won't ever need to know—I hope so. But if it's necessary, we'll tell him everything. Furthermore, John, be cautious. You manage insane people, but truly, everyone is a little mad. Just as you deal with your patients discreetly, treat everyone else the same. Don't always explain your intentions or thoughts. Keep knowledge where it belongs, let it grow quietly. We'll keep what we know to ourselves for now,\" and he touched his forehead and heart, then mine. \"I'm thinking things over at present. I'll share more later.\"\n\nI asked, \"Why not now? Maybe it could help us decide.\"\n\nHe paused and said, \"John, consider the farmer who inspects his growing corn. Before it's ripe—while it's still full of the earth's milk and uncolored by the sun—he might pick an ear, rub it, blow away the green chaff, and say, 'This is good corn; it'll yield well in time.'\" I said I didn't understand. He tugged my ear playfully, as he used to do when teaching, and said, \"The wise farmer says that only when he knows for sure—but he doesn't dig up his planted corn just to check. That's for children; serious farmers let nature take its course. Do you understand, John? I've planted my seed, and nature must do her work. If something grows, that's promising; I'll wait until there's real progress.\"\n\nHe could tell I'd grasped the point and continued, more seriously:\n\"You were always a diligent student and kept better notes than anyone. Now you're an expert yourself, and I trust you still do. Remember, knowledge is stronger than memory, so don't rely on the weaker. Even if your habits have slipped, let me say that Miss Westenra's case might be so significant that nothing else will outweigh it. Record everything, even uncertainties and guesses. Later you'll find it useful to see how accurate your intuition was. We learn more from our failures than our successes!\""

He took with him a bag in which were many instruments and drugs, “the ghastly paraphernalia of our beneficial trade,” as he once called, in one of his lectures, the equipment of a professor of the healing craft. When we were shown in, Mrs. Westenra met us. She was alarmed, but not nearly so much as I expected to find her. Nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordained that even death has some antidote to its own terrors. Here, in a case where any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some cause or other, the things not personal—even the terrible change in her daughter to whom she is so attached—do not seem to reach her. It is something like the way Dame Nature gathers round a foreign body an envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that which it would otherwise harm by contact. If this be an ordered selfishness, then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice of egoism, for there may be deeper root for its causes than we have knowledge of.\nI used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid down a rule that she should not be present with Lucy or think of her illness more than was absolutely required. She assented readily, so readily that I saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and I were shown up to Lucy’s room. If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday, I was horrified when I saw her to-day. She was ghastly, chalkily pale; the red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of her face stood out prominently; her breathing was painful to see or hear. Van Helsing’s face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows converged till they almost touched over his nose. Lucy lay motionless, and did not seem to have strength to speak, so for a while we were all silent. Then Van Helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently out of the room. The instant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to the next door, which was open. Then he pulled me quickly in with him and closed the door. “My God!” he said; “this is dreadful. There is no time to be lost. She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart’s action as it should be. There must be transfusion of blood at once. Is it you or me?”\n“I am younger and stronger, Professor. It must be me.”\n“Then get ready at once. I will bring up my bag. I am prepared.”\nI went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was a knock at the hall-door. When we reached the hall the maid had just opened the door, and Arthur was stepping quickly in. He rushed up to me, saying in an eager whisper:—\n“Jack, I was so anxious. I read between the lines of your letter, and have been in an agony. The dad was better, so I ran down here to see for myself. Is not that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing? I am so thankful to you, sir, for coming.” When first the Professor’s eye had lit upon him he had been angry at his interruption at such a time; but now, as he took in his stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood which seemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "When I described Lucy's symptoms, which were the same as before but significantly worse, he became very serious and said nothing. He had brought a bag containing many medical instruments and drugs, the 'ghastly equipment of our beneficial trade,' as he once called the tools of a healing professor in a lecture. Upon being shown in, Mrs. Westenra met us. She was worried, but much less so than I had expected. It seems nature, in its kinder moments, ensures that even death loses some of its terror. In this situation, where any shock could be fatal, things are arranged so that, for some reason, the impersonal aspects—even the terrifying change in her beloved daughter—don't seem to fully register with her. It's akin to how nature forms a protective envelope of insensitive tissue around a foreign object, shielding what contact would otherwise harm. If this is a form of programmed self-concern, then perhaps we should hesitate before condemning egoism, as its roots might be deeper than we understand. Using my knowledge of this state of mind, I insisted she should not be with Lucy or think about her illness more than absolutely required. She agreed immediately, so readily that I again saw nature's fight for life at work. Van Helsing and I were taken up to Lucy's room. If I was shocked seeing her yesterday, I was appalled today. She looked dreadful, deathly pale; the color seemed to have vanished even from her lips and gums, and the bones of her face were prominent; her breathing was visibly and audibly painful. Van Helsing's face became as rigid as marble, and his eyebrows drew together until they nearly touched above his nose. Lucy lay still, seemingly too weak to speak, so we remained silent for a moment. Then Van Helsing motioned to me, and we quietly left the room. The instant the door was closed, he quickly moved down the passage to the next door, which was open. He swiftly pulled me inside with him and shut the door. 'My God!' he exclaimed, 'this is terrible. There is no time to lose. She will die purely from lack of blood needed for her heart's function. There must be a blood transfusion at once. Is it you or me?' I replied, 'I am younger and stronger, Professor. It must be me.' He instructed, 'Then get ready immediately. I will bring up my bag. I am prepared.' I went downstairs with him, and as we descended, there was a knock at the front door. When we reached the hall, the maid had just opened the door, and Arthur was quickly stepping in. He hurried over to me, whispering eagerly, 'Jack, I was so anxious. I read between the lines of your letter and have been in agony. My father is better, so I rushed here to see for myself.

Initially, the Professor had seemed annoyed by his interruption at such a moment, but now, as he observed Arthur's sturdy build and the robust youthful vitality he seemed to radiate, his eyes brightened.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "When I explained Lucy's symptoms—which were the same as before but far more pronounced—he became very serious but said nothing in response. He brought along his medical bag filled with numerous tools and medicines, once referring to such equipment in a lecture as the \"ghastly paraphernalia of our beneficial trade.\" On our arrival, Mrs. Westenra greeted us. She was worried, but surprisingly less so than I had anticipated. Nature, in her kindness, sometimes offers a way for people to be shielded from the full horror of death. In this situation, though any shock might be fatal for her, circumstances have somehow ensured that external events—even the drastic changes in her beloved daughter—do not fully register with her. It's like how Nature encases a foreign body in insensitive tissue to prevent harm. If this is a form of self-preservation, perhaps we should hesitate before condemning selfishness, as it might have deeper causes than we understand. Drawing on my knowledge of how the mind sometimes protects itself from trauma, I decided Mrs. Westenra should not be present with Lucy or dwell on her illness more than necessary. She agreed without protest, which I took as another indication of Nature's instinct to protect life. Van Helsing and I then went up to Lucy's room. If I had been disturbed by her condition the previous day, I was now truly horrified. She looked deathly pale, with no color in her lips or gums, and her facial bones were apparent; her labored breathing was distressing to witness. Van Helsing's expression hardened, and his brows knit tightly together. Lucy lay still, seemingly too weak to speak, so we all remained quiet for a while. Then Van Helsing signaled for me to follow him, and we quietly left the room. As soon as the door closed, he quickly led me into the next room and shut the door behind us. \"My God! This is terrible. We can't waste any time. She will die simply because she doesn't have enough blood to keep her heart working. She needs a blood transfusion right away. Should it be you or me?\" I replied, \"I'm younger and stronger, Professor. It should be me.\" He instructed me to prepare at once while he fetched his bag. As we went downstairs, there was a knock at the front door. When we reached the hall, the maid had just opened it for Arthur, who hurried in and approached me, whispering urgently that he was deeply worried after reading my letter and had come as soon as he could, now that his father was better. He recognized Van Helsing and expressed his gratitude for the Professor's presence. At first, Van Helsing had been irritated by the interruption, but upon seeing Arthur's strong and healthy appearance, his mood lifted and his expression brightened."

          "text_segment": "Without a pause he said to him gravely as he held out his hand:—\n“Sir, you have come in time. You are the lover of our dear miss. She is bad, very, very bad. Nay, my child, do not go like that.” For he suddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting. “You are to help her. You can do more than any that live, and your courage is your best help.”\n“What can I do?” asked Arthur hoarsely. “Tell me, and I shall do it. My life is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body for her.” The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could from old knowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer:—\n“My young sir, I do not ask so much as that—not the last!”\n“What shall I do?” There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostril quivered with intent. Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder. “Come!” he said. “You are a man, and it is a man we want. You are better than me, better than my friend John.” Arthur looked bewildered, and the Professor went on by explaining in a kindly way:—\n“Young miss is bad, very bad. She wants blood, and blood she must have or die. My friend John and I have consulted; and we are about to perform what we call transfusion of blood—to transfer from full veins of one to the empty veins which pine for him. John was to give his blood, as he is the more young and strong than me”—here Arthur took my hand and wrung it hard in silence—“but, now you are here, you are more good than us, old or young, who toil much in the world of thought. Our nerves are not so calm and our blood not so bright than yours!” Arthur turned to him and said:—\n“If you only knew how gladly I would die for her you would understand——”\nHe stopped, with a sort of choke in his voice.\n“Good boy!” said Van Helsing. “In the not-so-far-off you will be happy that you have done all for her you love. Come now and be silent. You shall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must go; and you must leave at my sign. Say no word to Madame; you know how it is with her! There must be no shock; any knowledge of this would be one. Come!”\nWe all went up to Lucy’s room. Arthur by direction remained outside. Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. She was not asleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort. Her eyes spoke to us; that was all. Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laid them on a little table out of sight. Then he mixed a narcotic, and coming over to the bed, said cheerily:—\n“Now, little miss, here is your medicine. Drink it off, like a good child. See, I lift you so that to swallow is easy. Yes.” She had made the effort with success.\nIt astonished me how long the drug took to act. This, in fact, marked the extent of her weakness. The time seemed endless until sleep began to flicker in her eyelids. At last, however, the narcotic began to manifest its potency; and she fell into a deep sleep. When the Professor was satisfied he called Arthur into the room, and bade him strip off his coat. Then he added: “You may take that one little kiss whiles I bring over the table. Friend John, help to me!” So neither of us looked whilst he bent over her.\nVan Helsing turning to me, said:\n“He is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not defibrinate it.”\nThen with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed the operation. As the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come back to poor Lucy’s cheeks, and through Arthur’s growing pallor the joy of his face seemed absolutely to shine. After a bit I began to grow anxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur, strong man as he was. It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy’s system must have undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her. But the Professor’s face was set, and he stood watch in hand and with his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur. I could hear my own heart beat. Presently he said in a soft voice: “Do not stir an instant. It is enough. You attend him; I will look to her.” When all was over I could see how much Arthur was weakened. I dressed the wound and took his arm to bring him away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning round—the man seems to have eyes in the back of his head:—\n“The brave lover, I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall have presently.” And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted the pillow to the patient’s head. As he did so the narrow black velvet band which she seems always to wear round her throat, buckled with an old diamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged a little up, and showed a red mark on her throat. Arthur did not notice it, but I could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing’s ways of betraying emotion. He said nothing at the moment, but turned to me, saying: “Now take down our brave young lover, give him of the port wine, and let him lie down a while. He must then go home and rest, sleep much and eat much, that he may be recruited of what he has so given to his love. He must not stay here. Hold! a moment. I may take it, sir, that you are anxious of result. Then bring it with you that in all ways the operation is successful. You have saved her life this time, and you can go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is. I shall tell her all when she is well; she shall love you none the less for what you have done. Good-bye.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Holding out his hand, he said solemnly without hesitation, \"Sir, you have arrived at a critical moment. You are the beloved of our dear young lady. She is in a very, very grave condition. No, my dear boy, don't react like that.\" He suddenly turned pale and sank into a chair, almost fainting. \"You must help her. You are capable of more than anyone else, and your courage will be your greatest asset.\" \"What can I do?\" Arthur asked hoarsely. \"Tell me, and I will do it. My life belongs to her, and I would sacrifice the final drop of blood in my body for her.\" The Professor has a strong sense of humor, and drawing on my past experiences, I could detect a hint of it in his reply: \"My young friend, I don't require quite that much – not the very last drop!\" \"What should I do?\" His eyes blazed with intensity, and his open nostrils trembled with determination. Van Helsing clapped him on the shoulder. \"Come!\" he urged. \"You are a man, and a man is precisely what we need. You are more capable than I am, better even than my friend John.\" Arthur appeared bewildered, and the Professor continued with a gentle explanation: \"Our young lady is severely ill. She requires blood, and without it, she will die. My friend John and I have conferred, and we are about to perform what we call a transfusion of blood – to transfer blood from healthy veins into the depleted veins that desperately need it. John was supposed to provide his blood, as he is younger and stronger than I am\" – at this, Arthur gripped my hand tightly in silence – \"but now that you are here, you are more suitable than us, whether old or young, who spend our lives in intellectual pursuits. Our nerves are not as steady, and our blood not as vital as yours!\" Arthur turned to him and said, \"If only you understood how willingly I would die for her, you would comprehend—\" He stopped, a catch in his voice. \"Excellent boy!\" Van Helsing exclaimed. \"Before long, you will be thankful that you did everything you could for the one you love. Come now and remain silent. You may kiss her once before we begin, but then you must leave; and you must depart when I signal. Do not speak a word to Madame; you are aware of her fragile state! There must be no shock; any knowledge of this would be one. Come!\" We all proceeded to Lucy's room. As instructed, Arthur waited outside. Lucy turned her head and looked at us but remained silent. She wasn't asleep, but she was simply too weak to make any effort. Only her eyes communicated with us. Van Helsing took some items from his bag and placed them on a small table out of sight. Then he prepared a narcotic, and approaching the bed, said cheerfully: \"Now, my little one, here is your medicine. Drink it down, like a good girl. See, I will lift you slightly to make swallowing easier. There.\" She successfully managed the effort. I was surprised by how long it took for the drug to take effect. This fact highlighted the extent of her weakness. Time seemed to drag on until sleep finally began to flicker in her eyelids. At last, however, the narcotic's power began to assert itself, and she sank into a deep slumber. When the Professor was satisfied, he called Arthur into the room and instructed him to remove his coat. Then he added: \"You may have that single little kiss while I position the table. Friend John, assist me!\" So neither of us watched while he leaned over her. Van Helsing, turning to me, said: \"He is so youthful and robust, and his blood is so pure that we do not need to defibrinate it.\" Then, with speed but perfect technique, Van Helsing performed the procedure. As the transfusion progressed, something resembling life seemed to return to poor Lucy's cheeks, and through Arthur's increasing paleness, the joy on his face seemed truly radiant. After a time, I started to feel anxious, as the blood loss was clearly affecting Arthur, despite his strength. It gave me an insight into the terrible ordeal Lucy's system must have endured, considering that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her. But the Professor's expression was resolute, and he stood with his watch in hand, his gaze shifting between the patient and Arthur. I could hear the beating of my own heart. Presently, he said in a quiet voice: \"Do not move for an instant. That is sufficient. You attend to him; I will see to her.\" When everything was completed, I could see how greatly Arthur was weakened. I dressed the wound and took his arm to lead him away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning – the man seemed to have eyes in the back of his head: \"The courageous lover, I believe, deserves another kiss, which he shall have shortly.\" And having finished the operation, he adjusted the pillow under the patient's head. As he did so, the narrow black velvet ribbon she always wore around her throat, fastened with an old diamond buckle her lover had given her, was slightly pulled up, revealing a red mark on her throat. Arthur did not notice it, but I heard the deep, sharp intake of breath, one of Van Helsing's tell-tale signs of emotion. He said nothing at that moment but turned to me, saying: \"Now take our brave young lover downstairs, give him some port wine, and let him lie down for a while. He must then return home and rest, sleep and eat plenty, so that he can recover from what he has given to his love. He must not remain here. Wait! Just a moment. I understand, sir, that you are concerned about the outcome. Then take this assurance with you: the operation was successful in every way. You have saved her life this time, and you can go home and rest easy, knowing that all that can be done has been. I shall tell her everything when she is well; she will love you no less for what you have done. Good-bye.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Without hesitation, Van Helsing gravely extended his hand to Arthur and said, \"Sir, you've arrived just in time. As Miss Lucy's beloved, you are needed—she is faring very, very poorly.\" He tried to reassure Arthur, who turned pale and nearly collapsed in a chair. \"You must help her,\" Van Helsing continued. \"You can do more for her than anyone else, and your strength lies in your courage.\" Arthur replied hoarsely, \"What can I do? Just tell me. My life is hers—I'd gladly give every drop of blood for her.\" With a hint of humor, Van Helsing answered, \"I'm not asking for quite that much—not all your blood!\" Determined, Arthur insisted, asking what he must do. Van Helsing commended his resolve: \"That's what we need—a true man with courage. You're better suited than Dr. Seward or myself.\" Arthur was confused, so Van Helsing explained kindly: \"Miss Lucy is very weak—she needs blood or she will die. John and I have decided to attempt a transfusion. John was to donate, as he is younger and stronger than I am,\"—at this point, Arthur gripped Seward's hand—\"but now that you're here, you're the best candidate. Your nerves and blood are fresher than ours.\" Arthur protested that he would do anything for Lucy, even die for her, but could hardly speak. Van Helsing reassured him, saying, \"You'll later be glad you did this for the person you love. Come now and remain quiet. You'll be allowed a kiss before we begin, but then must leave when I signal. Tell nothing of this to Madame Mina; she must not be shocked or alarmed.\"\n\nThey all proceeded to Lucy's room, except Arthur who waited outside. Lucy, awake but extremely weak, could only communicate with her eyes. Van Helsing set up his instruments and prepared a sedative for Lucy, helping her to drink it. The drug took some time to act, highlighting Lucy's severe weakness, but eventually she fell into a deep sleep. When Van Helsing was satisfied, he called Arthur inside, had him remove his coat, and allowed him a kiss before the procedure. Then, with Seward’s help, Van Helsing performed the blood transfusion methodically. As Arthur gave blood, some color returned to Lucy's cheeks and Arthur, though pale, was joyful. As the transfusion progressed, Seward noticed Arthur growing weak and realized how depleted Lucy must have been for the procedure to only partially revive her. Van Helsing, ever watchful, monitored both Lucy and Arthur, and eventually called an end to the process.\n\nAfterward, Seward tended to Arthur, who was exhausted, while Van Helsing commended Arthur and promised he could have another kiss. Adjusting Lucy's pillows, Van Helsing inadvertently revealed a red mark on her throat, causing him a moment of silent concern, though Arthur didn’t see it. Van Helsing then told Seward to take Arthur downstairs, give him wine, and make sure he got proper rest to recover his strength. He assured Arthur he could go home knowing he’d done everything possible to save Lucy, and promised that she’d be told of his sacrifice once well enough, with the assurance that greater love would result from his actions. Van Helsing gave his farewells, urging rest and reassurance for Arthur."

          "text_segment": "When Arthur had gone I went back to the room. Lucy was sleeping gently, but her breathing was stronger; I could see the counterpane move as her breast heaved. By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently. The velvet band again covered the red mark. I asked the Professor in a whisper:—\n“What do you make of that mark on her throat?”\n“What do you make of it?”\n“I have not examined it yet,” I answered, and then and there proceeded to loose the band. Just over the external jugular vein there were two punctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking. There was no sign of disease, but the edges were white and worn-looking, as if by some trituration. It at once occurred to me that this wound, or whatever it was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood; but I abandoned the idea as soon as formed, for such a thing could not be. The whole bed would have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must have lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion.\n“Well?” said Van Helsing.\n“Well,” said I, “I can make nothing of it.” The Professor stood up. “I must go back to Amsterdam to-night,” he said. “There are books and things there which I want. You must remain here all the night, and you must not let your sight pass from her.”\n“Shall I have a nurse?” I asked.\n“We are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watch all night; see that she is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her. You must not sleep all the night. Later on we can sleep, you and I. I shall be back as soon as possible. And then we may begin.”\n“May begin?” I said. “What on earth do you mean?”\n“We shall see!” he answered, as he hurried out. He came back a moment later and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger held up:—\n“Remember, she is your charge. If you leave her, and harm befall, you shall not sleep easy hereafter!”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "After Arthur departed, I returned to the room. Lucy was resting peacefully, her breathing more robust; I observed the bedspread rise and fall with her chest. Van Helsing sat by the bed, watching her intently. The velvet band once more concealed the red mark. I quietly inquired of the Professor, \"What is your assessment of that mark on her neck?\" He responded, \"What is your assessment?\" I admitted, \"I haven't examined it yet,\" and immediately began to remove the band. Directly above the outer jugular vein were two small but unhealthy-looking punctures. There were no signs of illness, but the edges appeared pale and worn, as if rubbed. It crossed my mind that this injury, whatever it was, could explain the obvious blood loss; however, I quickly dismissed this notion because it seemed impossible. The entire bed would have been soaked scarlet with the amount of blood she must have lost to cause the extreme paleness she exhibited before the transfusion. Van Helsing then asked, \"Well?\" \"Well,\" I replied, \"I can't make sense of it.\" The Professor stood up. \"I must return to Amsterdam tonight,\" he stated. \"I need books and supplies there. You must remain here all night, and you must not take your eyes off her.\" I asked, \"Should I get a nurse?\" He answered, \"We are the best nurses, you and I. You must stay awake all night, ensure she is well-nourished, and that nothing disturbs her. You absolutely cannot sleep. Later, we can both rest. I will be back as soon as possible. And then we may begin.\" \"May begin?\" I repeated. \"What in the world do you mean?\" \"You'll see!\" he replied, rushing out. He paused a moment later, poked his head back through the door, and raised a warning finger, saying, \"Remember, she is under your care.

He turned the question back to me. Admitting I hadn’t examined it yet, I loosened the ribbon and saw two small, unhealthy-looking puncture wounds just above the major vein in her neck. There were no signs of illness, but the edges looked pale and worn, as if irritated. It immediately crossed my mind that this could explain her obvious blood loss, but I dismissed the thought, reasoning that such bleeding would have left the bed soaked in blood, which it wasn’t. When Van Helsing asked what I thought, I replied I couldn’t make any sense of it. Rising, the Professor announced he needed to return to Amsterdam that night to retrieve some important books and tools, and insisted I stay and watch Lucy all night, not letting her out of my sight. He told me we were better nurses than anyone else and that I should ensure Lucy was cared for and not disturbed, emphasizing that I must not sleep the whole night. He assured me we could rest later, and that he would return as soon as possible so we could begin whatever was needed. When I asked what he meant, he vaguely replied that we would see, then left, but poked his head back in to sternly remind me that Lucy was my responsibility and that if any harm came to her while I was away, I would never rest easy again."

          "text_segment": "8 September.—I sat up all night with Lucy. The opiate worked itself off towards dusk, and she waked naturally; she looked a different being from what she had been before the operation. Her spirits even were good, and she was full of a happy vivacity, but I could see evidences of the absolute prostration which she had undergone. When I told Mrs. Westenra that Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up with her she almost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her daughter’s renewed strength and excellent spirits. I was firm, however, and made preparations for my long vigil. When her maid had prepared her for the night I came in, having in the meantime had supper, and took a seat by the bedside. She did not in any way make objection, but looked at me gratefully whenever I caught her eye. After a long spell she seemed sinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself together and shook it off. This was repeated several times, with greater effort and with shorter pauses as the time moved on. It was apparent that she did not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once:—\n“You do not want to go to sleep?”\n“No; I am afraid.”\n“Afraid to go to sleep! Why so? It is the boon we all crave for.”\n“Ah, not if you were like me—if sleep was to you a presage of horror!”\n“A presage of horror! What on earth do you mean?”\n“I don’t know; oh, I don’t know. And that is what is so terrible. All this weakness comes to me in sleep; until I dread the very thought.”\n“But, my dear girl, you may sleep to-night. I am here watching you, and I can promise that nothing will happen.”\n“Ah, I can trust you!” I seized the opportunity, and said: “I promise you that if I see any evidence of bad dreams I will wake you at once.”\n“You will? Oh, will you really? How good you are to me. Then I will sleep!” And almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief, and sank back, asleep.\nAll night long I watched by her. She never stirred, but slept on and on in a deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep. Her lips were slightly parted, and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a pendulum. There was a smile on her face, and it was evident that no bad dreams had come to disturb her peace of mind.\nIn the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and took myself back home, for I was anxious about many things. I sent a short wire to Van Helsing and to Arthur, telling them of the excellent result of the operation. My own work, with its manifold arrears, took me all day to clear off; it was dark when I was able to inquire about my zoöphagous patient. The report was good; he had been quite quiet for the past day and night. A telegram came from Van Helsing at Amsterdam whilst I was at dinner, suggesting that I should be at Hillingham to-night, as it might be well to be at hand, and stating that he was leaving by the night mail and would join me early in the morning.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "September 8th.—I remained awake throughout the night watching over Lucy. The sedative's effects wore off as dusk approached, and she awoke naturally, appearing completely transformed from her state before the medical procedure. She was even in good spirits, displaying lively happiness, although I could still perceive signs of the profound exhaustion she had endured. When I informed Mrs. Westenra that Dr. Van Helsing had instructed me to keep vigil over her daughter, she largely dismissed the idea, pointing to Lucy's seemingly restored strength and excellent mood. However, I stood firm and made the necessary arrangements for my long watch. After her maid helped her prepare for bed, I entered, having eaten dinner, and took a seat beside her. She offered no objection whatsoever, instead looking at me with gratitude whenever our eyes met. After a considerable time, she seemed to be drifting off to sleep, but with evident effort, she appeared to pull herself together and resist it. This resistance repeated several times, with increasing difficulty and shorter pauses as time went on. It was clear she was trying to avoid sleep, so I addressed the issue directly: \"You don't want to fall asleep?\" \"No, I'm afraid.\" \"Afraid to sleep! Why is that? It's the comfort we all wish for.\" \"Ah, not if you were like me—if sleep felt like a warning of terror to you!\" \"A warning of terror! What on earth do you mean?\" \"I don't know; oh, I don't know. And that's the truly frightening part. All this weakness overcomes me when I sleep; I've come to dread the very notion of it.\" \"But, my dear girl, you can sleep tonight. I am here, watching over you, and I promise that nothing will happen.\" \"Ah, I can trust you!\" I seized the moment and said, \"I promise you that if I see any indication of bad dreams, I will wake you immediately.\" \"You will? Oh, will you really? You are so kind to me. Then I will sleep!\" And almost as she finished speaking, she let out a deep sigh of relief and settled back, asleep. I kept watch by her side all night long. She didn't stir at all, but slept continuously in a deep, calm, life-giving, and restorative slumber. Her lips were slightly separated, and her chest rose and fell with rhythmic regularity. There was a smile on her face, confirming that no disturbing nightmares had troubled her peace of mind. In the early morning, her maid arrived, and I left Lucy in her care, returning home myself, as I had many concerns on my mind. I quickly sent a short telegram to both Van Helsing and Arthur, informing them of the positive outcome of the operation. My own work, with its numerous overdue tasks, occupied me all day; it was dark by the time I could inquire about my patient who eats live creatures. The report was favorable; he had been very calm for the past day and night. A telegram from Van Helsing in Amsterdam reached me while I was having dinner, suggesting that I should go to Hillingham tonight, as it might be beneficial to be nearby, and stating that he was traveling by the night train and would meet me early the following morning.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "8 September.—I stayed up all night with Lucy. As the effects of the sedative wore off by evening, she woke up on her own and seemed like a completely different person compared to before the procedure. Her mood had improved, she was lively and cheerful, but I could still see the signs of her previous exhaustion. When I informed Mrs. Westenra that Dr. Van Helsing had instructed me to stay awake with Lucy, she was dismissive, pointing out how well and energetic her daughter appeared. Nevertheless, I stood my ground and got ready for the overnight watch. After her maid helped her prepare for bed, and after I had eaten, I sat by her bedside. Lucy showed no objection to my company and looked at me with gratitude whenever our eyes met. After some time, she seemed about to fall asleep, but she caught herself and forced herself to stay awake, doing this repeatedly with increasing difficulty. It was obvious she was afraid to sleep, so I addressed it directly:\n“You don’t want to sleep?”\n“No; I’m afraid.”\n“Afraid of sleep? Why? Sleep is something everyone desires.”\n“Not if you were me—if sleep meant a warning of horror.”\n“A warning of horror! What do you mean?”\n“I don’t know; that’s what’s frightening. All this weakness comes when I sleep; I’m terrified just thinking about it.”\n“But you can sleep tonight. I’m here watching over you, and I promise nothing will happen.”\n“Oh, I trust you!” Taking advantage of this, I said, “If I notice any sign of nightmares, I’ll wake you immediately.”\n“You will? Really? You are so good to me. Then I will sleep!” With a relieved sigh, she soon drifted off into sleep.\nI watched her all night. She slept soundly and peacefully, her breathing steady and her expression serene, with no sign of troubling dreams.\nIn the morning, her maid arrived, so I left Lucy in her care and went home, preoccupied with several matters. I sent brief telegrams to Van Helsing and Arthur to inform them of the operation’s success. I spent my day catching up on my own delayed work, and only after dark could I check on my zoöphagous patient, who had been calm over the past day and night. During dinner, I received a telegram from Van Helsing in Amsterdam, suggesting I be at Hillingham that night as it would be prudent to be nearby. He also said he would take the night train to join me in the morning."

For two nights I had hardly had a wink of sleep, and my brain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral exhaustion. Lucy was up and in cheerful spirits. When she shook hands with me she looked sharply in my face and said:—\n“No sitting up to-night for you. You are worn out. I am quite well again; indeed, I am; and if there is to be any sitting up, it is I who will sit up with you.” I would not argue the point, but went and had my supper. Lucy came with me, and, enlivened by her charming presence, I made an excellent meal, and had a couple of glasses of the more than excellent port. Then Lucy took me upstairs, and showed me a room next her own, where a cozy fire was burning. “Now,” she said, “you must stay here. I shall leave this door open and my door too. You can lie on the sofa for I know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go to bed whilst there is a patient above the horizon. If I want anything I shall call out, and you can come to me at once.” I could not but acquiesce, for I was “dog-tired,” and could not have sat up had I tried. So, on her renewing her promise to call me if she should want anything, I lay on the sofa, and forgot all about everything.\nLucy Westenra’s Diary.\n9 September.—I feel so happy to-night. I have been so miserably weak, that to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine after a long spell of east wind out of a steel sky. Somehow Arthur feels very, very close to me. I seem to feel his presence warm about me. I suppose it is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our inner eyes and sympathy on ourselves, whilst health and strength give Love rein, and in thought and feeling he can wander where he wills. I know where my thoughts are. If Arthur only knew! My dear, my dear, your ears must tingle as you sleep, as mine do waking. Oh, the blissful rest of last night! How I slept, with that dear, good Dr. Seward watching me. And to-night I shall not fear to sleep, since he is close at hand and within call. Thank everybody for being so good to me! Thank God! Good-night, Arthur.",

Lucy, however, was awake and cheerful. She immediately noticed his weariness and insisted that she was well enough to stay up, telling him he must rest. Too tired to object, Seward went to supper, joined by Lucy. Her pleasant presence and the good food and wine helped him enjoy the meal. Afterward, Lucy took him upstairs to a cozy room next to hers, directing him to stay there. She suggested he rest on the sofa, knowing doctors often stay near patients, and promised to call out if she needed anything, leaving their doors open. Seward, utterly exhausted, readily agreed, lay down, and quickly fell asleep. Lucy's diary entry for the same day expresses her overwhelming happiness and feeling of recovery, likening it to sunshine after a cold spell. She feels a deep connection to Arthur, sensing his presence and believing that health allows love to focus outward, unlike the self-absorption of illness. Her thoughts are entirely on Arthur, wishing he knew her feelings. She gratefully recalls the restful sleep she had the previous night knowing Dr. Seward was watching and feels safe sleeping again with him nearby.

She reassured me that she was feeling much better and volunteered to stay up with me if needed. Not wanting to argue, I went to eat supper. Lucy accompanied me, and her cheerful company helped me enjoy the meal and some excellent port wine. Afterwards, she led me to a room next to hers, where a cozy fire awaited. She told me to rest there with the doors open between our rooms so that she could call for me if necessary, knowing doctors rarely rest when a patient is around. Being utterly weary, I gladly agreed, lay down on the sofa, and quickly drifted off.\n\nLucy Westenra’s Diary. September 9th—Tonight, I feel so joyful. After feeling so weak and miserable, it’s wonderful to feel alive again—like sunshine breaking after a long stretch of bleak weather. Arthur seems particularly close to me in spirit. I suppose illness makes us focus inwardly, while feeling healthy frees our hearts and minds. My thoughts are all with Arthur, and I wish he knew! I hope he can sense how much I care, even as he sleeps. Last night's deep, restful sleep, knowing Dr. Seward was watching over me, was blissful. Tonight, since he’s nearby, I am not afraid to sleep. I am grateful to everyone, and I thank God for their kindness. Good night, Arthur."

          "text_segment": "10 September.—I was conscious of the Professor’s hand on my head, and started awake all in a second. That is one of the things that we learn in an asylum, at any rate.\n“And how is our patient?”\n“Well, when I left her, or rather when she left me,” I answered.\n“Come, let us see,” he said. And together we went into the room.\nThe blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently, whilst Van Helsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread, over to the bed.\nAs I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, I heard the Professor’s low hiss of inspiration, and knowing its rarity, a deadly fear shot through my heart. As I passed over he moved back, and his exclamation of horror, “Gott in Himmel!” needed no enforcement from his agonised face. He raised his hand and pointed to the bed, and his iron face was drawn and ashen white. I felt my knees begin to tremble.\nThere on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy, more horribly white and wan-looking than ever. Even the lips were white, and the gums seemed to have shrunken back from the teeth, as we sometimes see in a corpse after a prolonged illness. Van Helsing raised his foot to stamp in anger, but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habit stood to him, and he put it down again softly. “Quick!” he said. “Bring the brandy.” I flew to the dining-room, and returned with the decanter. He wetted the poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed palm and wrist and heart. He felt her heart, and after a few moments of agonising suspense said:—\n“It is not too late. It beats, though but feebly. All our work is undone; we must begin again. There is no young Arthur here now; I have to call on you yourself this time, friend John.” As he spoke, he was dipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion; I had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt-sleeve. There was no possibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one; and so, without a moment’s delay, we began the operation. After a time—it did not seem a short time either, for the draining away of one’s blood, no matter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling—Van Helsing held up a warning finger. “Do not stir,” he said, “but I fear that with growing strength she may wake; and that would make danger, oh, so much danger. But I shall precaution take. I shall give hypodermic injection of morphia.” He proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out his intent. The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to merge subtly into the narcotic sleep. It was with a feeling of personal pride that I could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid cheeks and lips. No man knows, till he experiences it, what it is to feel his own life-blood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves.\nThe Professor watched me critically. “That will do,” he said. “Already?” I remonstrated. “You took a great deal more from Art.” To which he smiled a sad sort of smile as he replied:—\n“He is her lover, her fiancé. You have work, much work, to do for her and for others; and the present will suffice.”\nWhen we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy, whilst I applied digital pressure to my own incision. I laid down, whilst I waited his leisure to attend to me, for I felt faint and a little sick. By-and-by he bound up my wound, and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for myself. As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and half whispered:—\n“Mind, nothing must be said of this. If our young lover should turn up unexpected, as before, no word to him. It would at once frighten him and enjealous him, too. There must be none. So!”\nWhen I came back he looked at me carefully, and then said:—\n“You are not much the worse. Go into the room, and lie on your sofa, and rest awhile; then have much breakfast, and come here to me.”\nI followed out his orders, for I knew how right and wise they were. I had done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my strength. I felt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at what had occurred. I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over and over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement, and how she could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to show for it. I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for, sleeping and waking, my thoughts always came back to the little punctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their edges—tiny though they were.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "September 10th - I was startled awake in an instant, feeling the Professor's hand on my head. That's one skill you definitely pick up in an asylum. He asked how our patient was doing. \"Well, she was fine when I left her, or rather, when she finished with me,\" I replied. \"Come, let's go see,\" he said, and we went into the room together. The blind was down, and I gently raised it while Van Helsing quietly padded over to the bed like a cat. As I pulled up the blind and the morning sun filled the room, I heard the Professor make a low gasp, a sound so rare from him that a terrible fear shot through my heart. He moved back as I approached, and his horrified cry, \"Gott in Himmel!\" (God in Heaven!), was amplified by his expression of anguish. He raised his hand and pointed at the bed; his usually firm face was now gaunt and deathly pale. I felt my knees start to tremble. There on the bed lay poor Lucy, looking worse than ever, incredibly pale and emaciated, seemingly unconscious. Even her lips were white, and her gums appeared to have pulled back from her teeth, similar to how a corpse might look after a long illness. Van Helsing briefly raised his foot as if to stamp in anger, but his deep-seated instincts and years of habit took over, and he lowered it softly. \"Quick!\" he commanded. \"Get the brandy.\" I rushed to the dining room and returned with the decanter. He used it to wet her poor white lips, and together we rubbed her palms, wrists, and chest. He checked her heart and, after a few agonizing moments of uncertainty, declared: \"It's not too late. Her heart is beating, albeit faintly. All our work has been undone; we must start again. Young Arthur isn't here this time; I'll have to rely on you, friend John.\" While speaking, he took transfusion instruments from his bag. I had already removed my coat and rolled up my shirt-sleeve. Giving an opiate wasn't possible or necessary at the moment, so we began the procedure immediately. After some time – which felt long, as having your blood drained is a distressing sensation, no matter how willingly you offer it – Van Helsing raised a warning finger. \"Don't move,\" he said, \"but I'm afraid that as she regains strength, she might wake, which would be very dangerous, immensely dangerous. But I will take a precaution. I shall give her a hypodermic injection of morphia.\" He then swiftly and skillfully administered the injection. The effect on Lucy was positive; her faintness seemed to blend smoothly into a drug-induced sleep. I felt a sense of personal satisfaction seeing a faint touch of color return to her pale cheeks and lips. No one truly understands, until they experience it, what it means to feel their own life-blood flowing into the veins of the woman they love. The Professor watched me critically. \"That's sufficient,\" he stated. \"Already?\" I protested. \"You took much more from Art.\" With a touch of sadness in his smile, he replied: \"He is her beloved, her fiancé. You have important responsibilities ahead for her and for others; this amount will suffice for now.\" When we finished the transfusion, he cared for Lucy while I pressed on my own incision. I lay down, waiting for him to attend to me, feeling weak and a bit unwell. Eventually, he bandaged my wound and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for myself. As I was leaving the room, he followed me and whispered: \"Remember, this must remain a secret. If her young lover should arrive unexpectedly, as before, say nothing to him. It would both alarm and make him jealous. There must be absolutely no mention of it. Understood?\" When I returned, he examined me closely and then said: \"You seem largely recovered. Go into the room, lie down on your sofa, and rest for a while; then have a large breakfast and come back here to me.\" I followed his instructions, knowing they were correct and wise. I had done my part, and now my next duty was to conserve my strength. I felt very weak, and in my weakness, some of the shock at what had happened subsided. I did fall asleep on the sofa, though, repeatedly wondering how Lucy had deteriorated so much and how she could have lost such a large amount of blood without any visible sign. I suspect I continued to ponder this in my dreams, as whether awake or asleep, my thoughts kept returning to the small puncture marks on her throat and the tiny, yet ragged and depleted appearance of their edges.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "September 10.—I suddenly woke up after feeling the Professor’s hand on my head, a reflex I’ve picked up during my time in the asylum. He asked me about Lucy, and I replied that she was well when we last parted. We decided to check on her together. I quietly raised the window blind to let in the morning light as Van Helsing moved to the bedside with his usual quiet step. As soon as the sunlight filled the room, I heard the Professor give a strange, drawn breath—a rare sound that instantly filled me with fear. As I approached, he recoiled with a horrified expression and exclaimed “Gott in Himmel!” His usually stern face was now pale, and I felt my legs weaken. On the bed, Lucy looked even more lifeless and pale than before, her lips and gums white as if she were a corpse. Van Helsing, visibly upset, almost stomped his foot, but his self-control held and he put it down gently. He urgently told me to bring some brandy, which I quickly fetched. He moistened her lips with it, and together we rubbed her hands, wrists, and chest. Feeling for her heartbeat in tense silence, Van Helsing eventually confirmed she was still alive—just barely. We realized all our previous efforts were undone and would have to start anew. With Lucy’s fiancé, Arthur, not present, Van Helsing asked me to assist. We immediately began preparing for another blood transfusion, with me rolling up my sleeve to donate. There was no need for sedatives, so we proceeded without delay. The process felt long and draining, both physically and emotionally. Van Helsing soon warned me not to move, worrying that Lucy’s revival could be dangerous, and gave her a morphine injection to keep her sedated. Gradually, I was proud to see some color return to Lucy’s face. It’s a strange feeling, giving your own lifeblood to someone you care deeply about. Van Helsing told me to stop, reminding me that Arthur had given more blood, but explained that as Lucy’s fiancé, Art’s donation was different and that I would have other responsibilities. Once it was over, Van Helsing cared for Lucy while I attended to my own wound, feeling faint and sick. Later, he bandaged me and sent me downstairs for wine. He urged me not to mention what had happened to Arthur, as it might upset or make him jealous. When I returned, Van Helsing checked on me and advised that I rest and eat well before helping further. I obeyed, understanding the wisdom in his orders, though still weak and bewildered by Lucy’s sudden decline and the mysterious loss of her blood. As I drifted to sleep, the strange wounds on Lucy’s neck and their ragged edges filled my thoughts, both waking and dreaming."

When Van Helsing had seen her, he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge, with strict injunctions that I was not to leave her for a moment. I could hear his voice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office.\nLucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anything had happened. I tried to keep her amused and interested. When her mother came up to see her, she did not seem to notice any change whatever, but said to me gratefully:—\n“We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you have done, but you really must now take care not to overwork yourself. You are looking pale yourself. You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit; that you do!” As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily, for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonted drain to the head. The reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned imploring eyes on me. I smiled and nodded, and laid my finger on my lips; with a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows.\nVan Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me: “Now you go home, and eat much and drink enough. Make yourself strong. I stay here to-night, and I shall sit up with little miss myself. You and I must watch the case, and we must have none other to know. I have grave reasons. No, do not ask them; think what you will. Do not fear to think even the most not-probable. Good-night.”\nIn the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either of them might not sit up with Miss Lucy. They implored me to let them; and when I said it was Dr. Van Helsing’s wish that either he or I should sit up, they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the “foreign gentleman.” I was much touched by their kindness. Perhaps it is because I am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucy’s account, that their devotion was manifested; for over and over again have I seen similar instances of woman’s kindness. I got back here in time for a late dinner; went my rounds—all well; and set this down whilst waiting for sleep. It is coming.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Lucy slept late into the day and woke up feeling somewhat better and stronger, although not as much as the day before. After Van Helsing checked on her, he went for a walk, giving me strict instructions not to leave her side for even a moment. I overheard him in the hall asking for directions to the nearest place to send a telegram. Lucy talked with me freely, appearing completely unaware that anything unusual had taken place. I attempted to keep her entertained and engaged. When her mother came up to see her, she didn't seem to notice any difference in Lucy, but she told me gratefully that they were very much in my debt for everything I had done, adding that I really needed to be careful not to overwork myself. She remarked that I looked pale and certainly needed a wife to nurse and look after me. As she said this, Lucy's face turned deeply red, but it was only for a moment, as her poor, weak veins couldn't handle such an unaccustomed rush of blood to her head for long. The effect was extreme paleness as she turned pleading eyes toward me. I smiled, nodded, and put a finger to my lips; with a sigh, she lay back among her pillows. Van Helsing returned after about two hours and soon told me to go home, eat heartily and drink sufficiently to make myself strong. He said he would stay there tonight and watch over Lucy himself. He emphasized that he and I must monitor the situation, and no one else must be aware. He had serious reasons, but I should not ask what they were; I should think whatever I wished, not fearing to consider even the most improbable things. He then bid me good night. In the hallway, two maids approached me and asked if one of them could stay up with Miss Lucy. They begged me to let them, and when I explained that Dr. Van Helsing wanted either him or me to remain awake with her, they tearfully asked me to plead with the 'foreign gentleman' on their behalf. Their kindness touched me deeply. Perhaps their devotion was shown because I feel weak at the moment, and perhaps because it concerned Lucy; I have seen similar instances of women's kindness many times. I got back home just in time for a late dinner, completed my rounds in the hospital where all was well, and wrote this down while waiting to fall asleep. Sleep is coming.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Lucy slept late into the day, and when she awoke she felt somewhat better and stronger, but not as much so as she had been the previous day. After Van Helsing had checked on her, he went out for a walk, instructing me sternly not to leave her side even for a moment. I could hear him in the hallway asking someone for directions to the nearest telegraph office. Lucy spoke with me openly and didn’t seem aware that anything had happened to her. I did my best to keep her cheerful and engaged. When her mother visited, she didn’t notice any difference in Lucy’s condition, but thanked me warmly for everything I had done, reminding me that I needed to look after my own health and joking that I needed a wife to care for me. At this, Lucy blushed deeply for a moment, but her weak condition quickly made her go pale again as she looked at me with pleading eyes. I smiled in reassurance, gesturing for her to stay quiet, and she lay back on her pillows with a sigh.\n\nVan Helsing came back after a couple of hours and told me to go home to eat and rest, as he would stay with Lucy through the night. He insisted that only the two of us should watch over her, for reasons he did not wish to explain, telling me not to be afraid to imagine even unlikely possibilities. He bade me goodnight. In the hallway, two of the maids approached me, asking if they could stay up with Lucy. They pleaded with me, and when I told them it was Van Helsing’s wish that only he or I should, they begged me to speak to him on their behalf. I was moved by their concern, perhaps because I was feeling weak or because it was for Lucy’s sake, but I have often seen such kindness from women before. I made it home in time for a late dinner, checked on my patients—all were fine—and wrote all this while waiting for sleep to come. Now, I feel it arriving."

          "text_segment": "11 September.—This afternoon I went over to Hillingham. Found Van Helsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much better. Shortly after I had arrived, a big parcel from abroad came for the Professor. He opened it with much impressment—assumed, of course—and showed a great bundle of white flowers.\n“These are for you, Miss Lucy,” he said.\n“For me? Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!”\n“Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with. These are medicines.” Here Lucy made a wry face. “Nay, but they are not to take in a decoction or in nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming nose, or I shall point out to my friend Arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeing so much beauty that he so loves so much distort. Aha, my pretty miss, that bring the so nice nose all straight again. This is medicinal, but you do not know how. I put him in your window, I make pretty wreath, and hang him round your neck, so that you sleep well. Oh yes! they, like the lotus flower, make your trouble forgotten. It smell so like the waters of Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the Conquistadores sought for in the Floridas, and find him all too late.”\nWhilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling them. Now she threw them down, saying, with half-laughter, and half-disgust:—\n“Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me. Why, these flowers are only common garlic.”\nTo my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, his iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting:—\n“No trifling with me! I never jest! There is grim purpose in all I do; and I warn you that you do not thwart me. Take care, for the sake of others if not for your own.” Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might well be, he went on more gently: “Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear me. I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those so common flowers. See, I place them myself in your room. I make myself the wreath that you are to wear. But hush! no telling to others that make so inquisitive questions. We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience; and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait for you. Now sit still awhile. Come with me, friend John, and you shall help me deck the room with my garlic, which is all the way from Haarlem, where my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glass-houses all the year. I had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here.”\nWe went into the room, taking the flowers with us. The Professor’s actions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopœia that I ever heard of. First he fastened up the windows and latched them securely; next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all over the sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get in would be laden with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp he rubbed all over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and round the fireplace in the same way. It all seemed grotesque to me, and presently I said:—\n“Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do, but this certainly puzzles me. It is well we have no sceptic here, or he would say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit.”\n“Perhaps I am!” he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which Lucy was to wear round her neck.\nWe then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she was in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her neck. The last words he said to her were:—\n“Take care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close, do not to-night open the window or the door.”\n“I promise,” said Lucy, “and thank you both a thousand times for all your kindness to me! Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such friends?”\nAs we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said:—\n“To-night I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want—two nights of travel, much reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow, and a night to sit up, without to wink. To-morrow in the morning early you call for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so much more strong for my ‘spell’ which I have work. Ho! ho!”\nHe seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nights before and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror. It must have been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend, but I felt it all the more, like unshed tears.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "On September 11th, I visited Hillingham in the afternoon. I found Van Helsing in good spirits and Lucy showing much improvement. Soon after my arrival, a large package addressed to the Professor arrived from overseas. He opened it with exaggerated importance – which I assumed was put on – revealing a substantial bunch of white flowers. 'These are for you, Miss Lucy,' he announced. 'For me? Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!' she exclaimed. 'Yes, my dear, but they are not for playing with. They are medicine.' At this, Lucy made a face. 'No, but you don't have to drink them or take them in any unpleasant way, so you don't need to turn up that lovely nose of yours, or I'll point out to my friend Arthur the sorrow he might face seeing such beauty he cherishes so much become twisted. Aha, my pretty girl, that brings the nice nose straight again. This is medicinal, but you wouldn't know how. I will place them in your window, I will make a lovely wreath, and hang it around your neck, so you will sleep well. Oh yes! Like the lotus flower, they will make you forget your troubles. They smell like the waters of Lethe and the fountain of youth the Conquistadores searched for in Florida, finding it much too late.' While he spoke, Lucy was inspecting and smelling the flowers. She then tossed them aside, half-laughing, half-disgusted, saying, 'Oh, Professor, I think you're just playing a trick on me. Why, these are just common garlic.' To my surprise, Van Helsing stood up and said with utter seriousness, his jaw set firmly and his bushy eyebrows drawn together, 'Do not joke with me! I never jest! There is a serious purpose behind everything I do; and I warn you not to obstruct me. Be careful, for the sake of others if not yourself.' Then, seeing poor Lucy looked frightened, as was understandable, he continued more gently, 'Oh, little miss, my dear, do not be afraid of me. I am only doing this for your benefit; but there is much power for you in these very common flowers. See, I will place them in your room myself. I will personally make the wreath for you to wear. But quiet! Do not tell anyone who might ask inquisitive questions. We must follow instructions, and silence is part of obedience; and obedience will restore you to health and strength, ready for the loving arms that await you. Now stay still for a moment. Come with me, friend John, and you will help me arrange my garlic in the room, which came all the way from Haarlem, where my friend Vanderpool cultivates herbs in his greenhouses year-round. I had to send a telegram yesterday, or they would not have arrived here.' We went into the room, carrying the flowers. The Professor's actions were certainly peculiar and not described in any medical book I'd ever encountered. First, he secured the windows and fastened them shut; next, taking a handful of flowers, he rubbed them all over the window sashes, as if to ensure that any breath of air that might enter would be heavy with the smell of garlic. Then, using the same wisp of flowers, he rubbed the door frame entirely – top, bottom, and sides – and circled the fireplace in the same manner. It all struck me as bizarre, and after a moment, I said, 'Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason for your actions, but this truly baffles me. It's fortunate we don't have a sceptic here, or they might say you were performing some kind of spell to ward off an evil spirit.' 'Perhaps I am!' he responded calmly as he began creating the wreath Lucy was to wear around her neck. We then waited while Lucy got ready for the night, and when she was in bed, he came and personally secured the garlic wreath around her neck. His final words to her were, 'Be careful not to disturb it; and even if the room feels stuffy, do not open the window or the door tonight.' 'I promise,' Lucy said, 'and thank you both immensely for all your kindness to me! Oh, what have I done to be so fortunate to have such friends?' As we departed the house in my carriage, which was waiting, Van Helsing remarked, 'Tonight I can finally sleep in peace, and I need sleep – two nights of travel, much reading during the day in between, and much worry about the day to follow, plus a night spent awake without blinking. Tomorrow morning early, you will call for me, and we will come together to see our lovely girl, so much stronger thanks to my 'spell' which I have enacted. Ho! ho!' He sounded so self-assured that I, recalling my own confidence from two nights earlier and the terrible outcome, felt a sense of dread and undefined fear. It must have been my weakness that made me hesitate to share this with my friend, but I felt it all the more intensely, like tears held back.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "September 11—This afternoon, I visited Hillingham and found Van Helsing in a great mood and Lucy feeling much improved. Not long after I arrived, a large package from overseas was delivered to the Professor. He opened it with exaggerated seriousness and revealed a big bunch of white flowers. \n\n\"These are for you, Miss Lucy,\" he said. \n\n\"For me? Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!\" \n\n\"Yes, but they're not for you to play with. These are medicines.\" Lucy made a face at this. \"Don’t worry, you won’t have to drink them or take them in any nasty way, so don't turn up that pretty little nose, or I’ll have to tell Arthur what he’s in for if he gets to see such a lovely face so distorted. Ah, there, that made your nose straight again! These flowers are medicinal, but in a way you don't know. I’ll put them in your window, make a nice garland to hang around your neck, and that should help you sleep. They’ll help you forget your troubles, like the mythical lotus flowers or the water from Lethe, or even the fountain of youth that explorers searched for in Florida.”\n\nWhile he was talking, Lucy inspected and smelled the flowers, then tossed them away, half-laughing, half-disgusted: \"Oh, Professor, you must be joking! These are just common garlic!\" \n\nTo my surprise, Van Helsing stood up, looking very stern, his jaw set and brows furrowed: \"Don’t joke with me! I never jest. There’s a serious reason for everything I do, and I warn you not to interfere. Do it for others if not for yourself.\" Then, seeing how frightened Lucy was, he softened his tone: \"Don't be afraid, my dear. I only want what’s best for you; there’s real power in those humble flowers. I’ll arrange them myself in your room and make your garland. But don’t tell anyone else—you must obey and keeping quiet is part of that. Obedience will help you recover and return to those who love you. Sit quietly for now. John, come help me prepare the room with the garlic, which I had shipped from Haarlem, where my friend Vanderpool grows it. I had to send a telegram yesterday or it wouldn't have arrived.\"\n\nWe carried the flowers into Lucy’s room. The Professor’s actions were certainly odd—nothing like any medical practice I knew. First he locked the windows securely, then rubbed garlic all along the window frames, so every bit of air coming in would carry its scent. He did the same to the door frame and the fireplace. To me, it all seemed bizarre, so I said, \"Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason, but this is a mystery. A skeptic would say you’re casting a spell to ward off evil spirits.\"\n\n\"Maybe I am!\" he replied calmly as he made the garland of garlic for Lucy.\n\nWe waited while Lucy got ready for bed, and once she was tucked in, Van Helsing himself placed the garland around her neck and told her, \"Don’t disturb it, and even if the room gets stuffy, don’t open the window or door tonight.\"\n\n\"I promise,\" Lucy replied, \"and thank you both so much for your kindness. How did I get so lucky to have such friends?\"\n\nAs we left the house, Van Helsing said, \"Tonight I can finally sleep, which I badly need after two nights of travel, a full day of reading, more anxieties, and a sleepless night. Tomorrow morning, come pick me up and we’ll check on our dear patient—she’ll be healthier thanks to my ‘spell’.\" He was so sure of himself that I felt a mixture of awe and fear, remembering how confident I had been two nights earlier with disastrous results. I hesitated to share these feelings with my friend, but I felt them deeply, as if on the verge of tears."

He positively frightened me, he was so fierce. And yet he must have been right, for I feel comfort from them already. Somehow, I do not dread being alone to-night, and I can go to sleep without fear. I shall not mind any flapping outside the window. Oh, the terrible struggle that I have had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness, or the pain of the fear of sleep, with such unknown horrors as it has for me! How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no dreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings nothing but sweet dreams. Well, here I am to-night, hoping for sleep, and lying like Ophelia in the play, with “virgin crants and maiden strewments.” I never liked garlic before, but to-night it is delightful! There is peace in its smell; I feel sleep coming already. Good-night, everybody.\nDr. Seward’s Diary.\n13 September.—Called at the Berkeley and found Van Helsing, as usual, up to time. The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting. The Professor took his bag, which he always brings with him now.\nLet all be put down exactly. Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham at eight o’clock. It was a lovely morning; the bright sunshine and all the fresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature’s annual work. The leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours, but had not yet begun to drop from the trees. When we entered we met Mrs. Westenra coming out of the morning room. She is always an early riser. She greeted us warmly and said:—\n“You will be glad to know that Lucy is better. The dear child is still asleep. I looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in, lest I should disturb her.” The Professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant. He rubbed his hands together, and said:—\n“Aha! I thought I had diagnosed the case. My treatment is working,” to which she answered:—\n“You must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor. Lucy’s state this morning is due in part to me.”\n“How you do mean, ma’am?” asked the Professor.\n“Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went into her room. She was sleeping soundly—so soundly that even my coming did not wake her. But the room was awfully stuffy. There were a lot of those horrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actually a bunch of them round her neck. I feared that the heavy odour would be too much for the dear child in her weak state, so I took them all away and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air. You will be pleased with her, I am sure.”\nShe moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early. As she had spoken, I watched the Professor’s face, and saw it turn ashen grey. He had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor lady was present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be; he actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into her room. But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me, suddenly and forcibly, into the dining-room and closed the door.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "September 12th. Everyone is so kind to me. I have grown quite fond of dear Dr. Van Helsing. I was puzzled why he was so concerned about these flowers; his intensity even startled me. However, he must have been right, as I already feel relief from them. Tonight, I am not afraid to be alone, and I can sleep peacefully without fearing any sounds outside the window. Oh, the terrible struggle I've had against sleep recently; the agony of sleeplessness, or the agony of fearing sleep itself and the unknown horrors it brings! How fortunate are some people whose lives are free from fears and anxieties, for whom sleep is a nightly gift that brings only pleasant dreams. Well, here I am tonight, hoping for sleep, lying here like Ophelia in the play, with 'virgin crants and maiden strewments.' I used to dislike garlic, but tonight it is wonderful! Its smell is calming; I feel sleep approaching already. Goodnight, everyone.\n\nDr. Seward's Diary.\n\nSeptember 13th. Met Van Helsing at the Berkeley as usual, perfectly on time. The carriage from the hotel was ready. The Professor picked up his bag, which he now carries with him everywhere.\n\nLet me record everything accurately. Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham at eight o'clock. It was a beautiful morning; the bright sunshine and the crisp feeling of early autumn felt like nature's year was culminating. The leaves were changing into all sorts of lovely colours but hadn't started falling yet. When we went inside, we met Mrs. Westenra coming out of the morning room. She is always up early. She greeted us warmly and said:\n\n\"You'll be happy to know that Lucy is better. The poor girl is still asleep. I peeked into her room and saw her but didn't go in so I wouldn't disturb her.\" The Professor smiled, looking quite delighted. He rubbed his hands together and said:\n\n\"Aha! I believed I had diagnosed the case correctly. My treatment is working,\" to which she replied:\n\n\"You shouldn't take all the credit, doctor. Lucy's condition this morning is partly because of me.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, madam?\" the Professor asked.\n\n\"Well, I was worried about the dear child during the night and went into her room. She was sleeping soundly – so soundly my entering didn't wake her. But the room was dreadfully stuffy. There were many of those awful, strong-smelling flowers all around, and she actually had a bunch of them around her neck. I worried the strong scent would be too much for her in her weak state, so I removed them all and opened the window slightly to let in a little fresh air. I'm sure you will be pleased with her progress.\"\n\nShe then moved off into her boudoir, where she usually ate her early breakfast. As she spoke, I watched the Professor's face and saw it lose all colour, turning ashen grey. He had managed to maintain his composure while the poor lady was there, knowing her state and how dangerous a shock would be; he even smiled at her as he held the door open for her to go into her room. But the moment she disappeared, he pulled me, abruptly and forcefully, into the dining room and closed the door.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "September 12—Everyone has been so kind to me. I feel a real fondness for Dr. Van Helsing, though I can't quite understand why he was so concerned about these flowers; his insistence was almost scary. Nevertheless, he must have known what he was doing as I already feel comforted by them. Tonight, I do not fear being alone and expect I'll be able to sleep peacefully, undisturbed by any noises at my window. Recently, I've struggled so much to avoid sleep, dreading either the pain of insomnia or the fear of what nightmares it might hold. Some people are so lucky to have restful sleep free from fear. Tonight, I'm hopeful I can rest, feeling almost like Ophelia with her garlands, despite never liking garlic before—tonight its scent is soothing, and I'm already drifting off. Good-night, all.\n\nDr. Seward’s Diary.\nSeptember 13—When I arrived at the Berkeley, Van Helsing was ready as usual, and the carriage awaited us. Van Helsing carried his ever-present bag. To keep a precise record: we arrived together at Hillingham at eight in the morning. The day was beautiful, bright, and filled with the freshness of early autumn, with the leaves showing vibrant colors but not yet falling. As we entered, we met Mrs. Westenra, an early riser, leaving the morning room. She warmly shared good news: Lucy was better, still asleep, and undisturbed when she checked in. Van Helsing, visibly pleased and confident in his diagnosis and treatment, expressed his satisfaction. Mrs. Westenra replied that it wasn't all his doing. She recounted her concern for Lucy during the night—finding her daughter sleeping deeply in a room filled with pungent flowers, even a bunch around her neck. Worried that it might be overwhelming for Lucy, she removed the flowers and opened the window for fresh air, believing it would be helpful. She then left for her breakfast. I noticed Van Helsing’s face grow pale, but he kept calm for Mrs. Westenra’s sake. As soon as she was gone, he urgently pulled me into the dining-room and closed the door."

He raised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beat his palms together in a helpless way; finally he sat down on a chair, and putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. Then he raised his arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe. “God! God! God!” he said. “What have we done, what has this poor thing done, that we are so sore beset? Is there fate amongst us still, sent down from the pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way? This poor mother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think, does such thing as lose her daughter body and soul; and we must not tell her, we must not even warn her, or she die, and then both die. Oh, how we are beset! How are all the powers of the devils against us!” Suddenly he jumped to his feet. “Come,” he said, “come, we must see and act. Devils or no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not; we fight him all the same.” He went to the hall-door for his bag; and together we went up to Lucy’s room.\nOnce again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went towards the bed. This time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the same awful, waxen pallor as before. He wore a look of stern sadness and infinite pity.\n“As I expected,” he murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his which meant so much. Without a word he went and locked the door, and then began to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another operation of transfusion of blood. I had long ago recognised the necessity, and begun to take off my coat, but he stopped me with a warning hand. “No!” he said. “To-day you must operate. I shall provide. You are weakened already.” As he spoke he took off his coat and rolled up his shirt-sleeve.\nAgain the operation; again the narcotic; again some return of colour to the ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep. This time I watched whilst Van Helsing recruited himself and rested.\nPresently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs. Westenra that she must not remove anything from Lucy’s room without consulting him; that the flowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of their odour was a part of the system of cure. Then he took over the care of the case himself, saying that he would watch this night and the next and would send me word when to come.\nAfter another hour Lucy waked from her sleep, fresh and bright and seemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal.\nWhat does it all mean?

He raised his hands in silent despair, then beat them together helplessly before sitting down, covering his face, and sobbing with deep, wrenching sounds. Lifting his arms again as if addressing the universe, he cried out, \"God! God! God!\" lamenting their plight. He questioned if ancient pagan fate still existed to cause such suffering. He highlighted the tragic irony that the poor mother, unknowingly and with good intentions, had put her daughter's soul and body in peril, yet they dared not inform or warn her, fearing it would lead to both their deaths. He exclaimed how overwhelmed they were, with all the forces of evil arrayed against them. Suddenly, he leaped up, his demeanor changing. \"Come,\" he urged, \"we must observe and act. Devils or not, even all devils combined, it makes no difference; we will fight him regardless.\" Retrieving his bag from the hall, we went up to Lucy's room together. Inside, I again pulled up the blind while Van Helsing approached the bed. This time, he didn't flinch upon seeing her face, which still bore the same dreadful, waxy paleness. His expression was one of grim sorrow and profound compassion. \"Just as I anticipated,\" he murmured with his characteristic intake of breath that conveyed much meaning. Without a word, he locked the door and began laying out the equipment for yet another blood transfusion on the small table. Recognizing the necessity, I had already started removing my coat, but he stopped me with a cautionary hand. \"No!\" he stated. \"You must perform the operation today. I will donate the blood. You are already too weak.\" As he spoke, he removed his own coat and rolled up his shirt-sleeve. The procedure was repeated: the narcotic, the return of color to her pale cheeks, and the steady breathing of healthy sleep. This time, I observed while Van Helsing rested and recovered. After a while, he found an opportunity to instruct Mrs. Westenra that she must not remove anything from Lucy's room without consulting him, explaining that the flowers had medicinal properties and inhaling their scent was part of the treatment. He then took full responsibility for Lucy's care, stating he would keep watch that night and the next and would notify me when needed. An hour later, Lucy awoke from her sleep, appearing refreshed, alert, and seemingly unharmed by her terrible ordeal. I am left bewildered by these events.

He then threw his arms up again, as if pleading with the universe, and cried out, “God! God! God! What have we done, what has this poor woman done to deserve such affliction? Is there some ancient fate upon us, from the days of old, that these things must happen, and in this way? This poor, well-intentioned mother, unaware of the consequences, has doomed her daughter in body and soul; and we cannot warn her, cannot even tell her, or she will die—and then both will be lost. We are beset on all sides, as if all the powers of evil are upon us!” Suddenly, Van Helsing stood up and said, “Come, we must act. Whether devils are against us or not, we’ll fight them just the same.” He fetched his bag, and together we went into Lucy’s room.\n\nI drew the blind as usual while Van Helsing approached the bed. This time, when he saw Lucy’s pale, waxen face, he didn’t startle but instead wore an expression of deep sadness and mercy.\n\n“As I thought,” he murmured, with that particular breathy tone that signified something important. Without saying more, he locked the door and set out his tools again for another blood transfusion. Having realized the necessity long ago, I began preparing myself, but Van Helsing stopped me, saying, “No! Today, you must perform the procedure; I will donate blood—you’re already too weak.” With that, he rolled up his sleeve to begin.\n\nOnce more, the process unfolded: the operation, the sedative, and a return of color and healthy sleep to Lucy’s cheeks. While Van Helsing recovered his strength, I kept watch.\n\nSoon after, Van Helsing told Mrs. Westenra she mustn’t remove anything from Lucy’s room without his approval, explaining that the flowers were medicinal and their scent part of her treatment. He took charge and said he would personally watch over Lucy for the next two nights and would let me know when my help was needed again.\n\nAn hour later, Lucy woke up looking refreshed and lively, hardly affected by her ordeal.\n\nI’m left wondering—what does all this mean?

It is as if I had passed through some long nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and feel the fresh air of the morning around me. I have a dim half-remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing; darkness in which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress more poignant: and then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back to life as a diver coming up through a great press of water. Since, however, Dr. Van Helsing has been with me, all this bad dreaming seems to have passed away; the noises that used to frighten me out of my wits—the flapping against the windows, the distant voices which seemed so close to me, the harsh sounds that came from I know not where and commanded me to do I know not what—have all ceased. I go to bed now without any fear of sleep. I do not even try to keep awake. I have grown quite fond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for me every day from Haarlem. To-night Dr. Van Helsing is going away, as he has to be for a day in Amsterdam. But I need not be watched; I am well enough to be left alone. Thank God for mother’s sake, and dear Arthur’s, and for all our friends who have been so kind! I shall not even feel the change, for last night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time.

Dr. Van Helsing is leaving tonight for a day trip to Amsterdam. However, I don't require supervision; I'm well enough to manage on my own. I am deeply grateful for this, for my mother's sake, for dear Arthur, and for all our kind friends. I won't even notice his absence much, as Dr. Van Helsing slept for significant portions of last night in his chair.

Thomas Bilder lives in one of the cottages in the enclosure behind the elephant-house, and was just sitting down to his tea when I found him. Thomas and his wife are hospitable folk, elderly, and without children, and if the specimen I enjoyed of their hospitality be of the average kind, their lives must be pretty comfortable. The keeper would not enter on what he called “business” until the supper was over, and we were all satisfied. Then when the table was cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said:—\n“Now, sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want. You’ll excoose me refoosin’ to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals. I gives the wolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea afore I begins to arsk them questions.”\n“How do you mean, ask them questions?” I queried, wishful to get him into a talkative humour.\n“’Ittin’ of them over the ’ead with a pole is one way; scratchin’ of their hears is another, when gents as is flush wants a bit of a show-orf to their gals. I don’t so much mind the fust—the ’ittin’ with a pole afore I chucks in their dinner; but I waits till they’ve ’ad their sherry and kawffee, so to speak, afore I tries on with the ear-scratchin’. Mind you,” he added philosophically, “there’s a deal of the same nature in us as in them theer animiles. Here’s you a-comin’ and arskin’ of me questions about my business, and I that grumpy-like that only for your bloomin’ ’arf-quid I’d ’a’ seen you blowed fust ’fore I’d answer. Not even when you arsked me sarcastic-like if I’d like you to arsk the Superintendent if you might arsk me questions. Without offence did I tell yer to go to ’ell?”\n“You did.”\n“An’ when you said you’d report me for usin’ of obscene language that was ’ittin’ me over the ’ead; but the ’arf-quid made that all right. I weren’t a-goin’ to fight, so I waited for the food, and did with my ’owl as the wolves, and lions, and tigers does. But, Lor’ love yer ’art, now that the old ’ooman has stuck a chunk of her tea-cake in me, an’ rinsed me out with her bloomin’ old teapot, and I’ve lit hup, you may scratch my ears for all you’re worth, and won’t git even a growl out of me. Drive along with your questions. I know what yer a-comin’ at, that ’ere escaped wolf.”\n“Exactly. I want you to give me your view of it. Just tell me how it happened; and when I know the facts I’ll get you to say what you consider was the cause of it, and how you think the whole affair will end.”\n“All right, guv’nor. This ’ere is about the ’ole story. That ’ere wolf what we called Bersicker was one of three grey ones that came from Norway to Jamrach’s, which we bought off him four years ago. He was a nice well-behaved wolf, that never gave no trouble to talk of. I’m more surprised at ’im for wantin’ to get out nor any other animile in the place. But, there, you can’t trust wolves no more nor women.”\n“Don’t you mind him, sir!” broke in Mrs. Tom, with a cheery laugh. “’E’s got mindin’ the animiles so long that blest if he ain’t like a old wolf ’isself! But there ain’t no ’arm in ’im.”\n“Well, sir, it was about two hours after feedin’ yesterday when I first hear my disturbance. I was makin’ up a litter in the monkey-house for a young puma which is ill; but when I heard the yelpin’ and ’owlin’ I kem away straight. There was Bersicker a-tearin’ like a mad thing at the bars as if he wanted to get out. There wasn’t much people about that day, and close at hand was only one man, a tall, thin chap, with a ’ook nose and a pointed beard, with a few white hairs runnin’ through it. He had a ’ard, cold look and red eyes, and I took a sort of mislike to him, for it seemed as if it was ’im as they was hirritated at. He ’ad white kid gloves on ’is ’ands, and he pointed out the animiles to me and says: ‘Keeper, these wolves seem upset at something.’\n“‘Maybe it’s you,’ says I, for I did not like the airs as he give ’isself. He didn’t git angry, as I ’oped he would, but he smiled a kind of insolent smile, with a mouth full of white, sharp teeth. ‘Oh no, they wouldn’t like me,’ ’e says.\n“‘Ow yes, they would,’ says I, a-imitatin’ of him. ‘They always likes a bone or two to clean their teeth on about tea-time, which you ’as a bagful.’\n“Well, it was a odd thing, but when the animiles see us a-talkin’ they lay down, and when I went over to Bersicker he let me stroke his ears same as ever. That there man kem over, and blessed but if he didn’t put in his hand and stroke the old wolf’s ears too!\n“‘Tyke care,’ says I. ‘Bersicker is quick.’\n“‘Never mind,’ he says. ‘I’m used to ’em!’\n“‘Are you in the business yourself?’ I says, tyking off my ’at, for a man what trades in wolves, anceterer, is a good friend to keepers.\n“‘No,’ says he, ‘not exactly in the business, but I ’ave made pets of several.’ And with that he lifts his ’at as perlite as a lord, and walks away. Old Bersicker kep’ a-lookin’ arter ’im till ’e was out of sight, and then went and lay down in a corner and wouldn’t come hout the ’ole hevening.",

After much effort and several initial refusals, and frequently invoking the name of the “Pall Mall Gazette” as a sort of magic key, I finally located the keeper responsible for the wolf enclosure at the Zoo. Thomas Bilder lives with his wife in a cottage behind the elephant house. When I arrived, they were just sitting down for tea. The Bilders are kindly, older, and childless hosts, and if their hospitality is consistent, they must lead a pleasant life. Mr. Bilder would not discuss what he considered 'business' until after supper, insisting we all eat first. Once the food was cleared away and he had lit his pipe, he said:\n\n\"Now, sir, ask me what you wish. Sorry for not discussing work topics before eating. I feed the animals—wolves, jackals, and hyenas—before I start questioning them myself.\"\n\n\"How do you question them?\" I asked, hoping to get him talking.\n\n\"Sometimes by hitting them on the head with a stick; sometimes by scratching their ears when a gentleman wants to impress a lady. I don’t mind the former—tapping them before feeding; but I wait until after their treat before I try ear-scratching. Truth be told,\" he continued, \"people and animals are not so different. You come here with questions about my business, and I was grumpy. If it weren't for your half-sovereign, I wouldn't have answered. Even when you joked about asking the Superintendent for permission, I told you off, didn’t I?\"\n\n\"You did.\"\n\n\"And when you said you’d report me for bad language, that was like hitting me over the head. But the tip made it alright. I won’t fight if there’s food. Like the wolves and lions, I waited for supper. Now, after my wife's tea-cake and some tea, and my pipe, you can ask what you like—I won’t bite. Go ahead with your questions! I know you want to hear about the escaped wolf.\"\n\n\"Exactly. I’d like your account of what happened—just the facts, and your thoughts on the cause and how it'll end.\"\n\n\"Well, here’s the story. That wolf, Bersicker, was one of three gray wolves we bought from Jamrach’s four years ago, originally from Norway. He behaved well and never caused trouble. I’m more surprised at him wanting to escape than any other animal. But you can’t trust wolves—no more than you can women.\"\n\n\"Ignore him, sir!\" Mrs. Bilder interjected cheerily. \"After so many years minding the animals he’s become a bit wolfish himself! But he’s harmless.\"\n\n\"Anyway, it was a couple of hours after feeding yesterday when I first heard trouble. I was making a bed for a sick young puma in the monkey house, but when I heard the howling, I came at once. Bersicker was trying madly to get out of his cage. There weren’t many people about; nearby was only a tall, thin man with a hooked nose, a pointed beard streaked with white, cold eyes, and white gloves. I took a dislike to him—it seemed the wolves did, too. He pointed at the wolves and said, ‘Keeper, these wolves seem troubled.’\n\n'Perhaps it’s you,' I replied, not liking his manner. He only smiled arrogantly, showing sharp white teeth, and answered, 'Oh no, they wouldn’t like me.'\n\n'Oh yes, they would,' I mimicked him. 'They like a bone or two to gnaw after tea, and you’ve got plenty.'\n\nStrangely, when we spoke, the animals calmed down. When I went to Bersicker, he let me scratch his ears as usual. The man came over and, surprisingly, also stroked the wolf’s ears!\n\n'Careful,' I warned, 'Bersicker is quick.'\n\n'Never mind,' he said, 'I’m used to them.'\n\n'You work with animals yourself?' I asked, respectfully tipping my hat—as animal traders are always good to know.\n\n'Not exactly, but I’ve kept several as pets,' he replied, politely tipping his own hat before walking away. Bersicker watched him until he was gone, then lay down in the corner and stayed there the rest of the evening."

My own belief was that the ’armony ’ad got into his ’ead.”\n“Now, Mr. Bilder, can you account in any way for the escape of the wolf?”\n“Well, sir,” he said, with a suspicious sort of modesty, “I think I can; but I don’t know as ’ow you’d be satisfied with the theory.”\n“Certainly I shall. If a man like you, who knows the animals from experience, can’t hazard a good guess at any rate, who is even to try?”\n“Well then, sir, I accounts for it this way; it seems to me that ’ere wolf escaped—simply because he wanted to get out.”\nFrom the hearty way that both Thomas and his wife laughed at the joke I could see that it had done service before, and that the whole explanation was simply an elaborate sell. I couldn’t cope in badinage with the worthy Thomas, but I thought I knew a surer way to his heart, so I said:—\n“Now, Mr. Bilder, we’ll consider that first half-sovereign worked off, and this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when you’ve told me what you think will happen.”\n“Right y’are, sir,” he said briskly. “Ye’ll excoose me, I know, for a-chaffin’ of ye, but the old woman here winked at me, which was as much as telling me to go on.”\n“Well, I never!” said the old lady.\n“My opinion is this: that ’ere wolf is a-’idin’ of, somewheres. The gard’ner wot didn’t remember said he was a-gallopin’ northward faster than a horse could go; but I don’t believe him, for, yer see, sir, wolves don’t gallop no more nor dogs does, they not bein’ built that way. Wolves is fine things in a storybook, and I dessay when they gets in packs and does be chivyin’ somethin’ that’s more afeared than they is they can make a devil of a noise and chop it up, whatever it is. But, Lor’ bless you, in real life a wolf is only a low creature, not half so clever or bold as a good dog; and not half a quarter so much fight in ’im. This one ain’t been used to fightin’ or even to providin’ for hisself, and more like he’s somewhere round the Park a-’idin’ an’ a-shiverin’ of, and, if he thinks at all, wonderin’ where he is to get his breakfast from; or maybe he’s got down some area and is in a coal-cellar. My eye, won’t some cook get a rum start when she sees his green eyes a-shining at her out of the dark! If he can’t get food he’s bound to look for it, and mayhap he may chance to light on a butcher’s shop in time. If he doesn’t, and some nursemaid goes a-walkin’ orf with a soldier, leavin’ of the hinfant in the perambulator—well, then I shouldn’t be surprised if the census is one babby the less. That’s all.”\nI was handing him the half-sovereign, when something came bobbing up against the window, and Mr. Bilder’s face doubled its natural length with surprise.\n“God bless me!” he said. “If there ain’t old Bersicker come back by ’isself!”\nHe went to the door and opened it; a most unnecessary proceeding it seemed to me. I have always thought that a wild animal never looks so well as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us; a personal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea.\nAfter all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither Bilder nor his wife thought any more of the wolf than I should of a dog. The animal itself was as peaceful and well-behaved as that father of all picture-wolves—Red Riding Hood’s quondam friend, whilst moving her confidence in masquerade.\nThe whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos. The wicked wolf that for half a day had paralysed London and set all the children in the town shivering in their shoes, was there in a sort of penitent mood, and was received and petted like a sort of vulpine prodigal son. Old Bilder examined him all over with most tender solicitude, and when he had finished with his penitent said:—\n“There, I knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble; didn’t I say it all along? Here’s his head all cut and full of broken glass. ’E’s been a-gettin’ over some bloomin’ wall or other. It’s a shyme that people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles. This ’ere’s what comes of it. Come along, Bersicker.”\nHe took the wolf and locked him up in a cage, with a piece of meat that satisfied, in quantity at any rate, the elementary conditions of the fatted calf, and went off to report.\nI came off, too, to report the only exclusive information that is given to-day regarding the strange escapade at the Zoo.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "According to Bilder, last night, as soon as the moon rose, the local wolves began to howl, though there was nothing apparent for them to howl at. No one was nearby, except for someone who seemed to be calling a dog behind the gardens off Park road. He checked outside once or twice to ensure everything was fine, which it was, and the howling stopped. Just before midnight, he took another look around before turning in, and was astonished to find that old Bersicker's cage rails were broken and twisted, and the cage was empty. That, he stated, was all he knew for certain. When asked if anyone else had seen anything, he mentioned that one of their gardeners, returning home from a social event around that time, claimed to have seen a large grey dog emerging through the garden hedges. He admitted he didn't fully believe this account, as the gardener hadn't mentioned it to his wife upon getting home, and only recalled seeing anything after the wolf's escape was known and they had spent the entire night searching the Park for Bersicker. Bilder suspected the gardener's senses were impaired by the social gathering. Asked if he could explain the wolf's escape, Mr. Bilder replied with a hint of feigned modesty that he thought he could, though he doubted the theory would satisfy. Assured that his expertise would make any guess valuable, he explained his perspective: the wolf escaped simply because it wanted to get out. From the hearty laughter of both Thomas and his wife, it was clear this was a well-worn joke and his explanation was merely an elaborate jest. Recognizing I couldn't match Thomas's wit, I decided on a more direct approach, saying, \"Now, Mr. Bilder, let's consider that first half-sovereign payment settled. Here is its companion, ready to be claimed once you've shared your thoughts on what you believe will happen.\" He responded readily, \"Certainly, sir. I hope you'll excuse my joking; the old woman here gave me a wink, which I took as encouragement to continue.\" His wife exclaimed, \"Well, I never!\" He then offered his opinion: \"My belief is that wolf is currently hiding somewhere. The gardener who later recalled seeing it claimed it was galloping north faster than a horse, but I don't believe him, because, you see, sir, wolves don't gallop like dogs or horses; their build is different. Wolves are impressive in stories, and I suppose when they are in packs chasing something more fearful than they are, they can create a tremendous noise and tear it apart. But honestly, in real life, a wolf is just an ordinary creature, not half as smart or courageous as a good dog, and with very little fight in it. This one isn't accustomed to fighting or providing for itself, so it's more likely hiding and shivering somewhere around the Park, perhaps wondering how it will get its breakfast, or maybe it's gone down an area entrance and is in a coal cellar. Imagine the surprise of a cook when she sees its green eyes shining at her from the dark! If it can't find food, it's sure to search, and maybe it will happen upon a butcher's shop in time. If it doesn't, and some nursemaid goes off for a walk with a soldier, leaving the infant in the pram—well, then I wouldn't be surprised if the census records one less baby. That's my view.\" As I was handing him the half-sovereign, something bumped against the window, and Mr. Bilder's face registered extreme surprise. \"Good heavens!\" he exclaimed. \"Look! Old Bersicker has come back by himself!\" He went and opened the door, which struck me as quite unnecessary. I have always felt that a wild animal is best observed when a substantial barrier is between us, and personal experience has only strengthened that conviction. However, routine dictates behaviour, for neither Bilder nor his wife seemed any more concerned about the wolf than I would about a domestic dog. The animal itself was as calm and well-behaved as the quintessential storybook wolf—Red Riding Hood's former companion before its deception was revealed. The whole scene was an indescribable blend of comedy and sorrow. The supposedly wicked wolf that had caused half of London to freeze with fear all day was there in a state of seeming repentance, welcomed and petted like a wayward son who had returned. Old Bilder examined him thoroughly with great tenderness, and having finished with the apparently contrite animal, he remarked, \"There, I knew the poor old chap would run into some kind of trouble; didn't I say it all along? His head is all cut and full of broken glass. He must have climbed over some damnable wall or other. It's a shame people are allowed to put broken bottles on top of their walls. This is what happens. Come along, Bersicker.\" He took the wolf and secured it in a cage, giving it a piece of meat that at least in size fulfilled the basic requirement of a returned prodigal's feast, and went off to file his report. I also left to report the only exclusive information available today regarding the strange incident at the Zoo.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Last night, as soon as the moon rose, the wolves here began to howl for no apparent reason. There was no one around except for someone calling a dog out in the park. I checked outside a couple times, and each time everything seemed normal, and the howling would stop. Just before midnight, I did a final check before bed and was shocked to find old Bersicker’s cage with the bars bent and the wolf missing. That’s all I know for sure.\n\nSomeone asked if anyone else saw anything. One of our gardeners said he saw a big grey dog coming out of the hedges on his way home from a music party, but he didn’t tell his wife about it and only remembered once everyone learned the wolf had escaped. Personally, I think he just imagined it after his night out.\n\nI was asked if I had any explanation for the wolf’s escape. I answered that in my view, the wolf got out simply because he wanted to. Thomas and his wife found this amusing, obviously not for the first time.\n\nI was then encouraged with a reward to give my opinion on what would happen next. I said I believed the wolf was hiding somewhere nearby, likely scared and cold, possibly in a basement or cellar, certainly not running as fast as the gardener claimed—wolves just aren’t built that way. He’s not used to fending for himself and might be searching for food. If he doesn’t find any, maybe he’ll end up scaring a cook or, in the worst case, do something desperate. That’s my opinion.\n\nAt that moment, something bumped against the window and, to everyone’s shock, Bersicker the wolf returned by himself. Mr. Bilder opened the door, seeming unfazed, and treated the wolf with familiarity, as though he were a pet dog. Bersicker was calm and even a little subdued, reminding us of the wolf from “Little Red Riding Hood” when he fooled the girl. The scene was oddly touching and funny at the same time: the supposedly fearsome wolf of London was back, injured but penitent, and was fussed over like a returning prodigal. Mr. Bilder checked his wounds—Cuts on his head from broken glass, likely from climbing a wall—and locked him in his cage, giving him food as a reward. He went off to report the return, and I left to share this exclusive update on the curious incident at the Zoo."

He had a dinner-knife in his hand, and, as I saw he was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us. He was too quick and too strong for me, however; for before I could get my balance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely. Before he could strike again, however, I got in my right and he was sprawling on his back on the floor. My wrist bled freely, and quite a little pool trickled on to the carpet.

I was astonished, as it's almost unheard of for a patient to enter the Superintendent's study uninvited. He immediately charged straight at me. He had a dinner-knife in his grasp, and sensing the danger, I attempted to use the table as a barrier. However, he was too fast and strong for me; before I could stabilize myself, he attacked and inflicted a rather severe cut on my left wrist. Before he could strike again, I managed to hit him with my right hand, sending him falling onto his back on the floor. My wrist was bleeding profusely, with a small pool trickling onto the carpet. Noticing that my friend seemed to have no further intention of attacking, I attended to bandaging my wrist, maintaining a watchful eye on the figure lying on the ground. When the attendants rushed in, and we focused on him, his actions were positively nauseating. He was prone on the floor, licking up the blood that had dripped from my wounded wrist, just like a dog would. He was secured without difficulty and, surprisingly, went with the attendants quite submissively, merely reiterating over and over: \"The blood is the life!

Realizing the threat, I tried to keep the table between us, but he was too fast and strong, managing to slash my left wrist before I could react.

This is an exact record of what took place to-night. I feel I am dying of weakness, and have barely strength to write, but it must be done if I die in the doing.\nI went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowers were placed as Dr. Van Helsing directed, and soon fell asleep.\nI was waked by the flapping at the window, which had begun after that sleep-walking on the cliff at Whitby when Mina saved me, and which now I know so well. I was not afraid, but I did wish that Dr. Seward was in the next room—as Dr. Van Helsing said he would be—so that I might have called him. I tried to go to sleep, but could not. Then there came to me the old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep awake. Perversely sleep would try to come then when I did not want it; so, as I feared to be alone, I opened my door and called out: “Is there anybody there?” There was no answer. I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door again. Then outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl like a dog’s, but more fierce and deeper. I went to the window and looked out, but could see nothing, except a big bat, which had evidently been buffeting its wings against the window. So I went back to bed again, but determined not to go to sleep. Presently the door opened, and mother looked in; seeing by my moving that I was not asleep, came in, and sat by me. She said to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont:—\n“I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you were all right.”\nI feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her to come in and sleep with me, so she came into bed, and lay down beside me; she did not take off her dressing gown, for she said she would only stay a while and then go back to her own bed. As she lay there in my arms, and I in hers, the flapping and buffeting came to the window again. She was startled and a little frightened, and cried out: “What is that?” I tried to pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she lay quiet; but I could hear her poor dear heart still beating terribly. After a while there was the low howl again out in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was a crash at the window, and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor. The window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and in the aperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great, gaunt grey wolf. Mother cried out in a fright, and struggled up into a sitting posture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her. Amongst other things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that Dr. Van Helsing insisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me. For a second or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strange and horrible gurgling in her throat; then she fell over—as if struck with lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for a moment or two. The room and all round seemed to spin round. I kept my eyes fixed on the window, but the wolf drew his head back, and a whole myriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken window, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that travellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert. I tried to stir, but there was some spell upon me, and dear mother’s poor body, which seemed to grow cold already—for her dear heart had ceased to beat—weighed me down; and I remembered no more for a while.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "September 17th, Night. I am writing this and leaving it accessible so that no one might accidentally face trouble because of me. This is a precise record of the events of this evening. I feel incredibly weak, as if I am dying, and can barely manage to write, but it is a necessary task even if I perish while completing it. I retired for the night as usual, making certain the flowers were arranged according to Dr. Van Helsing's instructions, and quickly fell asleep. I was awakened by the sound of flapping at the window, a noise that began after my sleepwalking episode on the cliff at Whitby when Mina rescued me, and which I now recognize clearly. I wasn't frightened, but I did wish Dr. Seward was in the adjacent room, as Dr. Van Helsing had promised he would be, so I could call out to him. I attempted to return to sleep without success. Then, the old dread of sleep returned, prompting me to resolve to stay awake. Annoyingly, sleep seemed to try to overtake me precisely when I wanted to avoid it. Since I was afraid to be alone, I opened my door and called out, 'Is anyone there?' There was no response. Fearful of waking my mother, I closed my door again. Outside, in the garden shrubbery, I then heard a sound like a dog's howl, but more savage and deeper in pitch. I went to the window to look out but could see nothing except a large bat, which had clearly been hitting against the glass. So, I returned to bed, determined not to fall asleep. Presently, the door opened, and my mother peered in. Seeing by my movement that I wasn't asleep, she entered and sat beside me. She spoke to me, her voice even softer and sweeter than usual, saying, 'I was worried about you, my darling, and came to make sure you were alright.' Fearing she might get cold sitting there, I asked her to come into bed and sleep with me. So, she joined me in bed and lay down beside me. She didn't remove her dressing gown, explaining she would only stay a short while before returning to her own bed. As she lay there in my embrace and I in hers, the flapping and hitting sound returned to the window. She was startled and somewhat scared, crying out, 'What is that?' I managed to soothe her and she eventually became quiet, though I could still hear her poor heart beating rapidly. After a moment, the low howl sounded again from the shrubbery. Shortly after, there was a sudden crash at the window, and fragments of broken glass were scattered across the floor. The wind rushing in blew the window blind back, and framed in the opening of the shattered panes was the head of a large, thin grey wolf. Mother screamed in terror and scrambled up into a sitting position, clutching wildly at anything she could grasp for support. Among other things, she seized the wreath of flowers that Dr. Van Helsing had insisted I wear around my neck and tore it away from me. For a couple of seconds, she remained sitting up, pointing at the wolf, and a strange, terrible gurgling sound came from her throat. Then she collapsed suddenly, as though struck by lightning. Her head hit my forehead, making me dizzy for a brief moment. The room and everything around me seemed to spin. I kept my gaze fixed on the window, but the wolf pulled its head back, and what looked like countless tiny specks seemed to blow in through the broken window, swirling and circling like the pillars of dust travellers describe during a desert simoon. I tried to move, but some force held me captive. My dear mother's body, which already felt cold because her beloved heart had stopped beating, lay heavily upon me, and I remember nothing more for a period.",

These notes are a faithful account of what happened tonight. I feel extremely weak, almost at the point of death, and it takes all my remaining strength to write, but I must do it even if it kills me.\n\nI went to bed as I usually do, making sure to arrange the flowers the way Dr. Van Helsing told me, then I fell asleep quickly. I was awakened by a flapping sound at the window—the same noise that started after my sleepwalking incident on the Whitby cliffs, when Mina rescued me, and which I have come to recognize well. I wasn’t afraid, but I wished Dr. Seward were nearby as Dr. Van Helsing had promised, so I could call for help. I tried to fall asleep again but couldn’t, and the old fear of sleep returned, prompting me to stay awake. Ironically, sleep began to overtake me once I tried to resist it. Feeling uneasy being alone, I opened my door and called out to see if anyone was there, but got no answer. Not wanting to wake my mother, I shut the door again. Then I heard a fierce, deep howl outside in the bushes—like a dog’s, but stronger. I looked out the window and saw nothing but a large bat beating against the glass. I returned to bed, determined not to sleep.\n\nSoon, my mother opened the door. Noticing I was awake, she came in and sat with me, soothing me with her gentle words, saying she had been worried and wanted to check on me. Afraid she’d catch cold, I suggested she sleep next to me, so she lay down beside me in her dressing gown, intending only to stay a short while. As we held each other, the flapping at the window returned, frightening her. She asked what it was; I tried to calm her, and eventually, she settled down, though I could still hear her heart racing. After a little while, I heard the low howl again, and then suddenly there was a crash as the window broke and shattered glass fell to the floor. The wind blew the blind back, revealing the head of a large, thin gray wolf through the broken window. My mother cried out in terror, sat up, and grabbed at anything for support, accidentally tearing from my neck the garland of flowers Dr. Van Helsing had made me wear. She sat for a moment, pointing at the wolf, making a horrible gurgling sound, then collapsed, hitting her head against mine and leaving me dizzy. The room seemed to spin, but I kept looking at the window as the wolf drew back its head and countless little specks came blowing in, whirling around like a sandstorm in the desert. I tried to move, but I was paralyzed, trapped under my mother’s now-cold body—for her heart had stopped—and I remembered nothing further for some time."

Somewhere near, a passing bell was tolling; the dogs all round the neighbourhood were howling; and in our shrubbery, seemingly just outside, a nightingale was singing. I was dazed and stupid with pain and terror and weakness, but the sound of the nightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort me. The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for I could hear their bare feet pattering outside my door. I called to them, and they came in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it was that lay over me on the bed, they screamed out. The wind rushed in through the broken window, and the door slammed to. They lifted off the body of my dear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the bed after I had got up. They were all so frightened and nervous that I directed them to go to the dining-room and have each a glass of wine. The door flew open for an instant and closed again. The maids shrieked, and then went in a body to the dining-room; and I laid what flowers I had on my dear mother’s breast.

They all four lay helpless on the floor, breathing heavily. The decanter of sherry was on the table half full, but there was a queer, acrid smell about. I was suspicious, and examined the decanter. It smelt of laudanum, and looking on the sideboard, I found that the bottle which mother’s doctor uses for her—oh! did use—was empty. What am I to do? what am I to do? I am back in the room with mother. I cannot leave her, and I am alone, save for the sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged. Alone with the dead! I dare not go out, for I can hear the low howl of the wolf through the broken window.\nThe air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the draught from the window, and the lights burn blue and dim.

The sounds appeared to have woken the maids as well, for I heard their footsteps outside my door. I called them, and they entered. When they saw what had happened and my mother lying on top of me, they screamed. The wind blew through the broken window, slamming the door shut. They carefully lifted my dear mother's body off me. After I got up, they covered her with a sheet and placed her on the bed. Seeing how scared and nervous they were, I instructed them to go to the dining room and have a glass of wine each. The door briefly flew open and then closed again. The maids shrieked before heading together to the dining room. I placed what flowers I had on my dear mother's chest. After they left, I remembered Dr. Van Helsing's instructions, but I hesitated to remove the flowers. Besides, I planned to have some servants stay with me. I was surprised the maids didn't come back. I called them, but there was no answer, so I went to the dining room to find them. My spirits sank when I saw the situation.

          "text_segment": "18 September.—I drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early. Keeping my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone. I knocked gently and rang as quietly as possible, for I feared to disturb Lucy or her mother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door. After a while, finding no response, I knocked and rang again; still no answer. I cursed the laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an hour—for it was now ten o’clock—and so rang and knocked again, but more impatiently, but still without response. Hitherto I had blamed only the servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me. Was this desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing tight around us? Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too late? I knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of danger to Lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses; and I went round the house to try if I could find by chance an entry anywhere.\nI could find no means of ingress. Every window and door was fastened and locked, and I returned baffled to the porch. As I did so, I heard the rapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven horse’s feet. They stopped at the gate, and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the avenue. When he saw me, he gasped out:—\n“Then it was you, and just arrived. How is she? Are we too late? Did you not get my telegram?”\nI answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got his telegram early in the morning, and had not lost a minute in coming here, and that I could not make any one in the house hear me. He paused and raised his hat as he said solemnly:—\n“Then I fear we are too late. God’s will be done!” With his usual recuperative energy, he went on: “Come. If there be no way open to get in, we must make one. Time is all in all to us now.”\nWe went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen window. The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, and handing it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window. I attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them. Then with a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and opened the window. I helped the Professor in, and followed him. There was no one in the kitchen or in the servants’ rooms, which were close at hand. We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining-room, dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four servant-women lying on the floor. There was no need to think them dead, for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the room left no doubt as to their condition. Van Helsing and I looked at each other, and as we moved away he said: “We can attend to them later.” Then we ascended to Lucy’s room. For an instant or two we paused at the door to listen, but there was no sound that we could hear. With white faces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered the room.\nHow shall I describe what we saw? On the bed lay two women, Lucy and her mother. The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a white sheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the broken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look of terror fixed upon it. By her side lay Lucy, with face white and still more drawn. The flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her mother’s bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little wounds which we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled. Without a word the Professor bent over the bed, his head almost touching poor Lucy’s breast; then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one who listens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me:—\n“It is not yet too late! Quick! quick! Bring the brandy!”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "On September 18th, I drove directly to Hillingham, arriving early. Leaving my carriage at the gate, I walked up the main drive by myself. I knocked softly and rang the bell as quietly as I could, not wanting to wake Lucy or her mother, and hoping only to summon a servant to the door. After some time passed without an answer, I knocked and rang again; still, there was no reply. I cursed the servants' laziness for presumably still being in bed at such an hour—it was already ten o'clock—and so I rang and knocked once more, this time less patiently, but again, I received no response. Up to this point, I had only blamed the staff, but now a terrible apprehension began to overcome me. Was this emptiness just another step in the seemingly inescapable chain of misfortune tightening around us? Had I indeed arrived too late at a house of death? I knew that even a slight delay, mere seconds or minutes, could mean hours of danger for Lucy if she had suffered another of those dreadful relapses; so, I walked around the house to see if I could perhaps find an entry point anywhere. I could not find any way to get inside. Every window and door was secured and locked, and I returned to the porch feeling defeated. As I did so, I heard the rapid clip-clop of a horse being ridden swiftly. It stopped at the gate, and moments later, I met Van Helsing running up the drive. When he saw me, he exclaimed breathlessly:—\"Then it was you, and you've just arrived. How is she? Are we too late? Did you not get my telegram?\" I replied as quickly and clearly as possible that I had only received his telegram that morning, had wasted no time coming here, and could not get anyone inside the house to respond to me. He paused, lifting his hat, and said solemnly:—\"Then I fear we are indeed too late. May God's will be done!\" With his characteristic ability to recover quickly, he continued: \"Come. If there's no way in, we must create one. Time is absolutely critical for us now.\" We went to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen window. The Professor took a small surgical saw from his bag and, handing it to me, pointed to the iron bars protecting the window. I began working on them immediately and very soon had cut through three. Then, using a long, thin knife, we pushed back the latch on the window sashes and opened the window. I helped the Professor climb in and followed him. There was no one in the kitchen or in the nearby servants' quarters. We checked all the rooms as we moved through the house, and in the dining room, dimly lit by shafts of light filtering through the shutters, we found four female servants lying on the floor. Their loud, raspy breathing and the strong smell of laudanum in the room left no doubt as to their state, so there was no need to think they were dead. Van Helsing and I exchanged glances, and as we left the room, he said: \"We can attend to them later.\" Then we went up to Lucy's room. For a moment or two, we stopped at the door to listen, but we could hear nothing. With pale faces and shaking hands, we gently opened the door and stepped inside the room. How can I possibly describe what we saw? On the bed lay two women, Lucy and her mother. The mother was positioned furthest back, covered by a white sheet, the edge of which had been lifted by the draft from the broken window, revealing her drawn, white face fixed in an expression of terror. Beside her lay Lucy, her face white and even more gaunt. We found the flowers that had been around her neck upon her mother's chest, and Lucy's throat was bare, showing the two small wounds we had observed before, but now looking dreadfully pale and damaged. Without speaking, the Professor leaned over the bed, his head almost touching poor Lucy's chest; then he quickly turned his head, as if listening intently, and jumping to his feet, he shouted to me:—\"It is not too late yet! Quick! Quick! Bring the brandy!\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "On September 18th, I immediately traveled to Hillingham and got there early in the day. I left my cab waiting at the gate and walked up the driveway alone. I gently knocked and quietly rang the bell, not wanting to disturb Lucy or her mother, hoping only a servant would answer. When no one responded, I tried knocking and ringing again, still with no result. I became annoyed, thinking the servants must be lazy to still be in bed at ten o’clock, so I knocked and rang more insistently, but still no one came. At first I only blamed the servants, but soon a dreadful fear crept over me: was this emptiness another sign of the tragic events closing in on us? Had I arrived too late at a home destined for death? I realized that even a short delay could put Lucy in danger if she had suffered another terrible relapse, so I walked around the house looking for any way in.\n\nEvery door and window was locked fast, so I returned frustrated to the porch. As I did so, I heard the sound of a fast-approaching horse, which stopped at the gate. Moments later, Van Helsing hurried up the avenue toward me. On seeing me, he breathlessly asked if I had just arrived, how Lucy was, whether we were too late, and if I had received his telegram. I quickly explained that I had gotten his message early and had come without delay, but could not get anyone to answer at the house. He paused, solemnly removed his hat, and said, \"Then I fear we are too late. God’s will be done!\" Quickly regaining his determination, he said, \"Come. If we can’t get in, we’ll have to make our own way. Time is critical.\"\n\nWe went to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen window. Van Helsing handed me a small surgical saw and pointed to the iron bars across the window. I quickly sawed through three of them, and using a long thin knife, we unlatched the window and opened it. I helped Van Helsing inside, then followed. The kitchen and servants’ rooms were empty. As we searched the rooms, we found four female servants lying on the dining-room floor. Their noisy breathing and the strong smell of laudanum made it clear they were drugged, not dead. Van Helsing said we could help them later, and we continued upstairs to Lucy’s room. We stopped at the door to listen, but heard nothing. With pale faces and shaking hands, we quietly entered.\n\nInside, we saw Lucy and her mother on the bed. Her mother lay further in, wrapped in a white sheet blown aside by a draft, her face pale and contorted in terror. Lucy was beside her, her face even more deathly white. The flowers that had been placed around Lucy’s neck were now on her mother’s chest, leaving Lucy’s throat exposed, showing the two puncture wounds we had noticed previously, looking even more swollen and ghastly. Without speaking, Van Helsing leaned close to Lucy’s chest, listened intently, and suddenly declared, \"It is not too late! Quickly! Bring the brandy!\""

The maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and I fancied that the narcotic was wearing off. I did not stay to make sure, but returned to Van Helsing. He rubbed the brandy, as on another occasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her hands. He said to me:—\n“I can do this, all that can be at the present. You go wake those maids. Flick them in the face with a wet towel, and flick them hard. Make them get heat and fire and a warm bath. This poor soul is nearly as cold as that beside her. She will need be heated before we can do anything more.”\nI went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the women. The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidently affected her more strongly, so I lifted her on the sofa and let her sleep. The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to them they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner. I was stern with them, however, and would not let them talk. I told them that one life was bad enough to lose, and that if they delayed they would sacrifice Miss Lucy. So, sobbing and crying, they went about their way, half clad as they were, and prepared fire and water. Fortunately, the kitchen and boiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water. We got a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it. Whilst we were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door. One of the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. Then she returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come with a message from Mr. Holmwood. I bade her simply tell him that he must wait, for we could see no one now. She went away with the message, and, engrossed with our work, I clean forgot all about him.\nI never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such deadly earnest. I knew—as he knew—that it was a stand-up fight with death, and in a pause told him so. He answered me in a way that I did not understand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear:—\n“If that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let her fade away into peace, for I see no light in life over her horizon.” He went on with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour.\nPresently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to be of some effect. Lucy’s heart beat a trifle more audibly to the stethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement. Van Helsing’s face almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in a hot sheet to dry her he said to me:—\n“The first gain is ours! Check to the King!”\nWe took Lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laid her in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat. I noticed that Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat. She was still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had ever seen her.\nVan Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with her and not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then beckoned me out of the room.\n“We must consult as to what is to be done,” he said as we descended the stairs. In the hall he opened the dining-room door, and we passed in, he closing the door carefully behind him. The shutters had been opened, but the blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette of death which the British woman of the lower classes always rigidly observes. The room was, therefore, dimly dark. It was, however, light enough for our purposes. Van Helsing’s sternness was somewhat relieved by a look of perplexity. He was evidently torturing his mind about something, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke:—\n“What are we to do now? Where are we to turn for help? We must have another transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl’s life won’t be worth an hour’s purchase. You are exhausted already; I am exhausted too. I fear to trust those women, even if they would have courage to submit. What are we to do for some one who will open his veins for her?”\n“What’s the matter with me, anyhow?”\nThe voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought relief and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris. Van Helsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and a glad look came into his eyes as I cried out: “Quincey Morris!” and rushed towards him with outstretched hands.\n“What brought you here?” I cried as our hands met.\n“I guess Art is the cause.”\nHe handed me a telegram:—\n“Have not heard from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious. Cannot leave. Father still in same condition. Send me word how Lucy is. Do not delay.—Holmwood.”\n“I think I came just in the nick of time. You know you have only to tell me what to do.”\nVan Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight in the eyes as he said:—\n“A brave man’s blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is in trouble. You’re a man and no mistake. Well, the devil may work against us for all he’s worth, but God sends us men when we want them.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I rushed downstairs and brought it back, making sure to smell and taste it to ensure it wasn't drugged like the sherry decanter I'd found on the table. The maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, suggesting the sedative was wearing off. I didn't wait but returned to Van Helsing. He rubbed the brandy on her lips, gums, wrists, and palms, just as before. He instructed me:\n“I'll do this, everything possible right now. You go wake those maids. Slap their faces hard with a wet towel. Get them to start fires and heat water for a warm bath. This poor girl is almost as cold as the one next to her. She needs to be warmed before we can proceed.”\nI went at once and had little trouble waking three of the women. The fourth was just a young girl, and the drug had clearly affected her more severely, so I lifted her onto the sofa and let her sleep. The others were confused initially, but as their memories returned, they became hysterical, crying and sobbing. I was strict with them, however, and wouldn't let them talk. I told them losing one life was tragic enough and any delay would jeopardize Miss Lucy's life. So, weeping, they went about their tasks, only partly dressed, preparing the fire and water. Fortunately, the kitchen and boiler fires were still lit, and hot water was readily available. We prepared a bath, carried Lucy as she was, and placed her in it. While we were diligently rubbing her limbs to warm her, someone knocked at the front door. One of the maids ran off, quickly put on more clothes, and opened it. She returned to whisper that a gentleman had arrived with a message from Mr. Holmwood. I instructed her to simply tell him he must wait as we couldn't see anyone currently. She left with the message, and absorbed in our work, I completely forgot about him.\nIn all my life, I had never seen the Professor work with such intense seriousness. I knew, as he did, that this was a direct confrontation with death, and I told him so during a brief pause. He responded in a way I didn't fully understand, but with the most severe look his face could show:\n“If that were the only problem, I would stop here and let her gently fade into peace, as I see no hope for her future life.” He continued his efforts with, if possible, renewed and more frantic energy.\nSoon, we both began to notice that the heat was starting to have an effect. Lucy's heart beat a bit more distinctly audible with the stethoscope, and her lungs showed a perceptible movement. Van Helsing's face almost glowed. As we lifted her from the bath and wrapped her in a hot sheet to dry her, he said to me:\n“We've gained the first advantage! Checkmate to the King!”\nWe carried Lucy into another room, which had by then been made ready, placed her in bed, and managed to force a few drops of brandy down her throat. I observed that Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief around her neck. She was still unconscious and seemed as bad as, if not worse than, we had ever seen her.\nVan Helsing called in one of the women and instructed her to stay with Lucy constantly until we returned, then gestured for me to follow him out of the room.\n“We must consult on the next steps,” he said as we descended the stairs. In the hall, he opened the dining room door, and we went inside, him carefully closing the door behind us. The shutters were open, but the blinds were drawn, following the custom of lower-class British women as a mark of respect in times of death. The room was thus dimly lit, though sufficient for our needs. Van Helsing's sternness was softened by a look of confusion. He was clearly agonizing over something, so I waited a moment, and then he spoke:\n“What are we to do now? Where can we find help? We need another blood transfusion, and quickly, or that poor girl's life won't last another hour. You are already worn out; I am exhausted too. I hesitate to rely on those women, even if they had the courage to agree. Who can we find willing to offer their blood for her?”\n“What's going on with me, anyway?”\nThe voice came from the sofa across the room, and its sound brought relief and joy to my heart, for it was Quincey Morris. Van Helsing reacted angrily at first, but his face softened, and a look of happiness came into his eyes as I exclaimed, “Quincey Morris!” and rushed towards him with outstretched hands.\n“What brought you here?” I asked as our hands met.\n“I reckon Art [Holmwood] is the reason.”\nHe handed me a telegram:\n“Haven't heard from Seward for three days, extremely worried. Cannot leave. Father still same condition. Send update how Lucy is. Do not delay.—Holmwood.”\n“I believe I arrived just in the nick of time. You only need to tell me what's required.”\nVan Helsing stepped forward, took his hand, and looked him directly in the eyes as he said:\n“A brave man's blood is the most valuable thing on this earth when a woman is in peril. You are unquestionably a man. Let the devil work against us with all his power, but God sends us men when we need them.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I hurried downstairs and brought back the brandy, making sure to check its smell and taste to ensure it hadn’t been drugged like the sherry decanter I found on the table. The maids were still alive but breathing more restlessly, so I thought the effects of the drug might be wearing off. Not pausing to confirm, I returned to Van Helsing. He applied the brandy, as before, to Lucy’s lips, gums, wrists, and palms. Then he told me, “This is all I can do for now. Go wake the maids—splash water on their faces, and do it thoroughly. Start fires and draw a warm bath. Lucy is nearly as cold as the corpse next to her. She must be warmed up before we can help her further.”\n\nI immediately set about rousing the women and managed to wake three without much trouble. The fourth, a young girl, seemed more deeply affected, so I rested her on the sofa to sleep. The other maids were dazed at first, but as they regained their memories, they became hysterical, crying uncontrollably. I remained strict with them, refusing to let them speak, telling them that wasting time could cost Lucy her life. Tearful and in partial dress, they went about preparing fire and water. Luckily, the kitchen and boiler fires were still burning, so there was plenty of hot water. We made a bath, carried Lucy to it as she was, and placed her inside. While we rubbed her limbs to restore warmth, a knock sounded at the door. One maid quickly dressed and answered it, returning to inform us a gentleman had brought a message from Mr. Holmwood. I instructed her to tell him to wait, as we couldn’t receive visitors. Absorbed in our work, I soon forgot about him entirely.\n\nNever before had I seen Professor Van Helsing work with such intense determination. Both of us realized we were in a life-or-death situation, and I mentioned as much to him during a pause. He replied, sternly and with a look I had not seen before, “If that’s all it were, I would let her slip away peacefully, for I see no reason for hope in her future.” He then resumed his efforts with even more vigor.\n\nGradually, we noticed the warmth was taking effect. Lucy’s heartbeat became stronger, and her breathing improved. Van Helsing’s face filled with hope, and as we lifted Lucy from the bath and wrapped her in a warm sheet, he said, “We’ve had our first success! Check to the King!”\n\nWe moved Lucy to a room prepared for her, put her in bed, and gave her a little brandy. I saw Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief around her neck. Lucy remained unconscious and was in the worst state we’d ever seen. Van Helsing instructed one of the women to stay with her and watch her closely until we returned, then motioned for me to follow him out. \n\n“We need to discuss our next steps,” he said as we went downstairs. In the dimly lit dining room, Van Helsing’s sternness was tinged with confusion. He was obviously struggling with our situation. Finally, he said, “What should we do now? Who can we turn to? Lucy needs another blood transfusion soon or she’ll die. You’re already worn out and so am I. I wouldn’t trust these women, even if they were willing. How can we find someone who’ll donate blood to her?”\n\nJust then, a voice from the sofa interrupted: “What about me?” To my joy and relief, it was Quincey Morris. Van Helsing began with an angry start but, recognizing the voice, brightened as I greeted Quincey and shook his hand. “What brings you here?” I asked. He indicated a telegram from Arthur Holmwood expressing anxiety for Lucy and asking for news. “I guess I arrived just in time. Just tell me how to help,” Quincey said.\n\nVan Helsing warmly shook Quincey’s hand, declaring, “A brave man’s blood is the best thing for a woman in need. The devil may try his worst, but God always sends the men we require.”"

          },
          "text_segment": "Once again we went through that ghastly operation. I have not the heart to go through with the details. Lucy had got a terrible shock and it told on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went into her veins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other occasions. Her struggle back into life was something frightful to see and hear. However, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and Van Helsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and with good effect. Her faint became a profound slumber. The Professor watched whilst I went downstairs with Quincey Morris, and sent one of the maids to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. I left Quincey lying down after having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a good breakfast. Then a thought struck me, and I went back to the room where Lucy now was. When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet or two of note-paper in his hand. He had evidently read it, and was thinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow. There was a look of grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved. He handed me the paper saying only: “It dropped from Lucy’s breast when we carried her to the bath.”\nWhen I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pause asked him: “In God’s name, what does it all mean? Was she, or is she, mad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?” I was so bewildered that I did not know what to say more. Van Helsing put out his hand and took the paper, saying:—\n“Do not trouble about it now. Forget it for the present. You shall know and understand it all in good time; but it will be later. And now what is it that you came to me to say?” This brought me back to fact, and I was all myself again.\n“I came to speak about the certificate of death. If we do not act properly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would have to be produced. I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for if we had it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did. I know, and you know, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that Mrs. Westenra had disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it. Let us fill up the certificate at once, and I shall take it myself to the registrar and go on to the undertaker.”\n“Good, oh my friend John! Well thought of! Truly Miss Lucy, if she be sad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends that love her. One, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides one old man. Ah yes, I know, friend John; I am not blind! I love you all the more for it! Now go.”\nIn the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling him that Mrs. Westenra was dead; that Lucy also had been ill, but was now going on better; and that Van Helsing and I were with her. I told him where I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I was going said:—\n“When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all to ourselves?” I nodded in reply and went out. I found no difficulty about the registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements.\nWhen I got back Quincey was waiting for me. I told him I would see him as soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up to her room. She was still sleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her side. From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that he expected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature. So I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfast-room, where the blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more cheerful, or rather less cheerless, than the other rooms. When we were alone, he said to me:—\n“Jack Seward, I don’t want to shove myself in anywhere where I’ve no right to be; but this is no ordinary case. You know I loved that girl and wanted to marry her; but, although that’s all past and gone, I can’t help feeling anxious about her all the same. What is it that’s wrong with her? The Dutchman—and a fine old fellow he is; I can see that—said, that time you two came into the room, that you must have another transfusion of blood, and that both you and he were exhausted. Now I know well that you medical men speak in camera, and that a man must not expect to know what they consult about in private. But this is no common matter, and, whatever it is, I have done my part. Is not that so?”\n“That’s so,” I said, and he went on:—\n“I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I did to-day. Is not that so?”\n“That’s so.”\n“And I guess Art was in it too. When I saw him four days ago down at his own place he looked queer. I have not seen anything pulled down so quick since I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to grass all in a night. One of those big bats that they call vampires had got at her in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open, there wasn’t enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had to put a bullet through her as she lay. Jack, if you may tell me without betraying confidence, Arthur was the first, is not that so?” As he spoke the poor fellow looked terribly anxious. He was in a torture of suspense regarding the woman he loved, and his utter ignorance of the terrible mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain. His very heart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him—and there was a royal lot of it, too—to keep him from breaking down. I paused before answering, for I felt that I must not betray anything which the Professor wished kept secret; but already he knew so much, and guessed so much, that there could be no reason for not answering, so I answered in the same phrase: “That’s so.”\n“And how long has this been going on?”\n“About ten days.”\n“Ten days! Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poor pretty creature that we all love has had put into her veins within that time the blood of four strong men. Man alive, her whole body wouldn’t hold it.” Then, coming close to me, he spoke in a fierce half-whisper: “What took it out?”\nI shook my head. “That,” I said, “is the crux. Van Helsing is simply frantic about it, and I am at my wits’ end. I can’t even hazard a guess. There has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown out all our calculations as to Lucy being properly watched. But these shall not occur again. Here we stay until all be well—or ill.” Quincey held out his hand. “Count me in,” he said. “You and the Dutchman will tell me what to do, and I’ll do it.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "We performed that dreadful procedure again. I lack the emotional strength to recount the specifics. Lucy had suffered a severe shock, and it affected her more profoundly this time; although she received a considerable amount of blood, her body didn't respond to the treatment as effectively as before. Her struggle back to consciousness was terrifying to witness and hear. Nevertheless, her heart and lungs showed improvement, and Van Helsing administered a subcutaneous injection of morphia, just like before, which had a positive effect. Her faintness transformed into a deep sleep. The Professor kept watch while I went downstairs with Quincey Morris to instruct a maid to pay off one of the waiting cab drivers. After giving Quincey a glass of wine, I left him resting and told the cook to prepare a hearty breakfast. Then, an idea struck me, and I returned quietly to Lucy's room. Upon entering, I found Van Helsing holding a couple of sheets of notepaper. He had clearly read it and was deep in thought, hand on his brow. His face showed a look of grim satisfaction, as if a question had been answered. He handed me the paper, saying simply, “It fell from Lucy’s chest when we moved her to the bath.” After reading it, I looked at the Professor and, after a moment's silence, asked him, “For heaven’s sake, what does this signify? Is she or was she mad, or what kind of awful peril is this?” I was so disoriented I couldn't think of anything else to say. Van Helsing extended his hand, took the paper, and said, “Don’t worry about this now. Put it out of your mind for the moment. You will know and understand everything eventually, but it will be later. Now, what was it you came back to tell me?” This question brought me back to reality, and I felt composed again. “I came to discuss the death certificate,” I said. “If we don't handle this correctly and judiciously, there could be an inquest, and that paper would have to be presented. I hope we can avoid an inquest because, if we had one, it would surely be the end of poor Lucy, even if nothing else was. I, you, and the other doctor who attended her know that Mrs. Westenra had a heart condition, and we can certify that she died from it. Let’s complete the certificate immediately, and I will personally take it to the registrar and then proceed to the undertaker.” “Excellent, my dear friend John! A very sensible suggestion! Indeed, Miss Lucy, though she faces formidable adversaries, is fortunate in the friends who care for her. One, two, three men, besides one old man, have offered their blood for her. Ah yes, I see, friend John; I am not oblivious! I admire you all the more for it! Now, go.” In the hall, I encountered Quincey Morris, who had a telegram for Arthur informing him of Mrs. Westenra’s death, mentioning that Lucy had also been ill but was now improving, and that Van Helsing and I were with her. I told him where I was going, and he urged me to hurry, but as I was leaving, he said, “When you return, Jack, can I have a brief private conversation with you?” I nodded my agreement and went out. I had no trouble with the registration process and made arrangements with the local undertaker to come that evening to measure for the coffin and finalize the details. When I returned, Quincey was waiting for me. I told him I would speak with him as soon as I had checked on Lucy and went up to her room. She was still asleep, and the Professor appeared not to have moved from his chair beside her. His gesture of putting a finger to his lips suggested he expected her to wake soon and wanted to avoid disturbing her natural recovery. So, I went back downstairs to Quincey and led him into the breakfast room, where the blinds were open, making it a little less grim, or rather, more cheerful, than the other rooms. Once we were alone, he said to me, “Jack Seward, I don’t wish to intrude where I don’t belong; but this is not a typical situation. You know I loved that girl and hoped to marry her; but, although that aspiration is long past, I can’t help but remain anxious about her. What is afflicting her? The Dutchman—and he seems a remarkable old fellow, I can see that—said, when you two entered the room that time, that you needed another blood transfusion and that both you and he were exhausted. Now, I am aware that medical professionals speak in private, and a person shouldn’t expect to know the details of their confidential consultations. However, this is no ordinary matter, and whatever it is, I have contributed my part. Isn't that true?” “That’s right,” I replied, and he continued, “I assume both you and Van Helsing had already done what I did today. Isn't that so?” “That’s right.” “And I suspect Art was involved too. When I saw him four days ago at his place, he looked unwell. I haven't seen someone deteriorate so rapidly since I was on the Pampas and had a mare I was fond of just collapse overnight. One of those large bats they call vampires had attacked her during the night, and between feeding and leaving the vein open, she didn’t have enough blood left to stand up, and I had to shoot her where she lay. Jack, if you can tell me without breaking confidence, Arthur was the first, wasn’t he?” As he spoke, the poor man looked incredibly distressed. He was in agony from the uncertainty regarding the woman he loved, and his complete lack of understanding about the terrible mystery surrounding her amplified his suffering. His very heart seemed to ache, and it took every bit of his considerable manliness—and he possessed a great deal of it—to keep him from breaking down. I paused before answering, feeling I shouldn't reveal anything the Professor wanted kept secret; but he already knew and suspected so much that there seemed no reason not to answer, so I responded with the same phrase: “That’s right.” “And how long has this been occurring?” “About ten days.” “Ten days! Then I reckon, Jack Seward, that poor, lovely girl we all care for has received the blood of four strong men into her veins within that period. Good heavens, her entire body couldn’t possibly contain that much.” Then, leaning closer, he spoke in a fierce half-whisper, “What took it out?” I shook my head. “That,” I said, “is the core puzzle. Van Helsing is absolutely beside himself with frustration, and I am completely at a loss. I cannot even venture a guess. A series of minor events have disrupted all our plans for keeping a close watch on Lucy. But these will not happen again. We will stay here until everything is resolved—for better or for worse.” Quincey extended his hand. “Include me,” he said. “You and the Dutchman just tell me what needs to be done, and I will do it.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Once again, we were forced to perform that dreadful procedure. I can't bear to revisit the specifics. Lucy had suffered a severe shock, and it affected her more this time; although she received plenty of blood, her body didn’t respond as well as it had before. Her struggle to regain consciousness was terrifying to witness and hear. Still, her heart and lungs gradually improved, and Van Helsing administered morphine under her skin, just as before, which helped greatly. Her faint changed into a deep sleep. The Professor stayed to watch her while I went downstairs with Quincey Morris, sent a maid to pay one of the waiting cabmen, and left Quincey to rest with a glass of wine. I told the cook to prepare a good breakfast. Then I remembered something and returned quietly to Lucy’s room. There, I found Van Helsing holding some sheets of note-paper; he had read them and was deep in thought, looking as though he was satisfied by something being resolved. He gave me the paper, saying only, “It dropped from Lucy’s breast when we carried her to the bath.”\n\nAfter I read it, I stood staring at the Professor. After a pause, I asked, “For God’s sake, what does this mean? Was she, or is she, mad? Or what horror threatens her?” I was so confused that I didn’t know what else to say. Van Helsing took the paper back and said, “Don’t worry about it now. Forget it for the moment. You’ll understand everything in time, but later. Now, what did you want to say to me?” Brought back to reality, I replied, “I wanted to discuss the death certificate. If we don’t handle everything properly, there might be an inquest, and then that paper would have to be produced. I hope we can avoid an inquest, because it would certainly kill poor Lucy if nothing else did. We know, and the other doctor knows, that Mrs. Westenra had heart disease and we can certify that as the cause. Let’s fill out the certificate now; I’ll take it to the registrar myself and then to the undertaker.”\n\n“Excellent, John! Well thought-out! Though Miss Lucy is troubled by her enemies, she’s at least fortunate in the friends who care for her. One, two, three of you, and even an old man, all risked your blood for her. I see it, my friend, and value you all the more. Now, go.”\n\nIn the hall, I met Quincey Morris, who had a telegram for Arthur letting him know Mrs. Westenra had died, that Lucy was ill but improving, and that Van Helsing and I were with her. I told Quincey where I was headed and he hurried me on. As I left, he asked, “When you get back, Jack, can I have a word with you alone?” I nodded and left. I completed the registration without trouble and made arrangements with the local undertaker.\n\nWhen I returned, Quincey was waiting for me. I told him I’d see him after checking on Lucy, then went to her room. She was still sleeping; the Professor hadn't moved, and signaled that he expected Lucy to awaken soon. So I went down to Quincey and took him to the breakfast room, which was a bit more cheerful. Alone, he said, “Jack Seward, I don’t want to interfere, but this is no ordinary situation. You know I loved Lucy and wanted to marry her, and though that’s in the past, I’m still worried. What is wrong with her? The Dutchman (a fine man) said you both needed another blood transfusion and that you were both exhausted. I know doctors keep sensitive things private, but I’ve played my part. Isn’t that so?”\n\n“That’s so,” I said. He continued, “Both you and Van Helsing had already done what I did today. Isn’t that so?” “That’s so.” “And Art was involved too. When I last saw him, he looked terrible. I haven’t seen anyone fade so fast since a vampire bat attacked one of my horses in the Pampas, draining it of blood and leaving it unable to stand. Jack, if you can tell me, Arthur was the first, wasn’t he?” He was clearly distressed, desperate for answers about the woman he loved, and deeply tormented by the mystery. I hesitated but finally answered, “That’s so.”\n\n“How long has this been going on?”\n\n“About ten days.”\n\n“Ten days! So in that time, four strong men have given Lucy their blood. Her whole body couldn’t even contain that much.” Then he leaned closer and whispered fiercely, “So what took it out?”\n\nI shook my head. “That’s the point. Van Helsing is beside himself, and I have no idea. Several small incidents have thrown off our efforts to watch over Lucy, but that won’t happen again. We’ll stay until all is well—or not.” Quincey reached for my hand. “Count me in. Tell me what to do, and I’ll do it.”"

We told her that either or both of us would now remain with her all the time, and that seemed to comfort her. Towards dusk she fell into a doze. Here a very odd thing occurred. Whilst still asleep she took the paper from her breast and tore it in two. Van Helsing stepped over and took the pieces from her.

The careful Professor had placed it back where he found it, presumably to avoid alarming her upon waking. Her gaze then fell upon Van Helsing and myself, and a look of relief or happiness crossed her face. She then glanced around the room, and seeing her location, she shivered; she let out a loud cry and covered her pale face with her frail, thin hands. We both immediately understood the meaning behind this—that the full realization of her mother's death had struck her; so we did our best to provide comfort. Our sympathy likely eased her somewhat, but she remained very low in spirits and thought, weeping quietly and weakly for a considerable duration. We informed her that at least one of us, or both, would stay with her constantly from now on, which seemed to offer her some solace. As dusk neared, she fell into a light sleep. At this juncture, a peculiar event occurred. While still asleep, she took the paper from her chest and tore it in two. Van Helsing stepped forward and took the torn fragments from her grasp. Nevertheless, she continued the action of tearing, as if the material were still in her hands; finally, she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering imaginary fragments.

The thoughtful professor must have put it back while she slept so she wouldn't be startled upon waking. As soon as she saw Van Helsing and me, her face brightened, but then, after looking around and realizing where she was, she shuddered, cried out loudly, and covered her pale face with her thin hands. We both knew this meant she suddenly understood that her mother was dead, so we did our best to comfort her. Our sympathy seemed to help a little, but she remained very downcast and quietly cried for a long while. We reassured her that either or both of us would stay with her constantly, which seemed to make her feel better. As evening approached, she drifted into light sleep. Something odd then happened: while still asleep, she took the note from her chest and tore it in half. Van Helsing crossed over and took the pieces away, but Lucy continued the tearing motion as if she still held the paper, and at last opened her hands as if she was scattering its remains.

She was hardly able to turn her head, and the little nourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good. At times she slept, and both Van Helsing and I noticed the difference in her, between sleeping and waking. Whilst asleep she looked stronger, although more haggard, and her breathing was softer; her open mouth showed the pale gums drawn back from the teeth, which thus looked positively longer and sharper than usual; when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently changed the expression, for she looked her own self, although a dying one. In the afternoon she asked for Arthur, and we telegraphed for him.

When he saw her, Arthur was simply choking with emotion, and none of us could speak. In the hours that had passed, the fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed for it, had grown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was possible were shortened. Arthur’s presence, however, seemed to act as a stimulant; she rallied a little, and spoke to him more brightly than she had done since we arrived.

The Professor and I (Harker) took turns watching over her, never leaving her alone. Quincey Morris didn't state his intention, but I knew he spent the entire night patrolling around the house. By daybreak, the morning light clearly showed how much poor Lucy's strength had diminished. She could barely move her head, and the little nourishment she was able to take seemed to do her no good. At times she would sleep, and both Van Helsing and I noticed the stark difference in her state between sleeping and waking. While asleep, she appeared stronger, though also more drawn, and her breathing was quieter; her slightly open mouth revealed her pale gums pulled back from her teeth, which consequently looked distinctly longer and sharper than usual. When she woke, the gentle look in her eyes changed her expression, making her look like her usual self, albeit a dying one. In the afternoon, she asked to see Arthur. We sent a telegram for him, and Quincey went to the station to meet him. He arrived close to six o'clock, just as the sun was setting warmly, its red light streaming through the window and adding some color to her pale cheeks. Seeing her, Arthur was overcome with emotion and struggled to speak, and none of the rest of us could either. Over the preceding hours, her periods of sleep, or the comatose state that resembled it, had become more frequent, shortening the brief moments when conversation was possible. However, Arthur's presence seemed to act as a boost; she rallied slightly and spoke to him more brightly than she had since we arrived. He, too, managed to compose himself and spoke as cheerfully as he could, making the best of the difficult situation. It is now almost one o'clock in the morning. Arthur and Van Helsing are currently with her. I am scheduled to relieve them in fifteen minutes and am recording this entry on Lucy's phonograph. They are supposed to rest until six o'clock.

The Professor and I took shifts to keep vigil, making sure she was never alone for even a moment. While Quincey Morris didn’t say what he planned, I realized he spent the night continuously patrolling the grounds. When daylight arrived, its brightness revealed just how much Lucy’s health had deteriorated—she was so weak she could barely move her head, and the little food she managed to consume offered no benefit. Sometimes she would doze off, and Van Helsing and I observed notable contrasts between her sleeping and waking state. While sleeping, she appeared physically stronger, though her features were more gaunt, her breathing gentler. With her lips pulled back, her teeth looked unusually prominent and pointed. Upon waking, the change in her eyes softened her face, restoring her usual expression, albeit as someone facing death. That afternoon, she asked for Arthur, so we sent a telegram. Quincey went to collect him from the station. Arthur arrived close to six in the evening, with the setting sun casting a warm, red glow on Lucy’s pale face, giving it a bit more color. Overcome by emotion when he saw her, Arthur could hardly speak, and none of us managed a word. As time passed, Lucy’s periods of sleep or near-unconsciousness became more frequent, leaving less and less time for conversation. Still, Arthur seemed to revive her, and she was more animated with him than she had been since we arrived. He, too, tried to be optimistic and engaging, making the best of things. Now it’s almost one in the morning, and he and Van Helsing are by her side. I’ll relieve them in fifteen minutes, and I’m recording this entry on Lucy’s phonograph. Until six a.m., they’ll try to get some rest. I fear our vigil will end tomorrow, as the ordeal appears too much for Lucy to recover from. May God help us all."

You will pardon me, I know, for all my faults when you have read all my budget of news. Well, I got my husband back all right; when we arrived at Exeter there was a carriage waiting for us, and in it, though he had an attack of gout, Mr. Hawkins. He took us to his house, where there were rooms for us all nice and comfortable, and we dined together. After dinner Mr. Hawkins said:—\n“‘My dears, I want to drink your health and prosperity; and may every blessing attend you both. I know you both from children, and have, with love and pride, seen you grow up. Now I want you to make your home here with me. I have left to me neither chick nor child; all are gone, and in my will I have left you everything.’ I cried, Lucy dear, as Jonathan and the old man clasped hands. Our evening was a very, very happy one.\n“So here we are, installed in this beautiful old house, and from both my bedroom and the drawing-room I can see the great elms of the cathedral close, with their great black stems standing out against the old yellow stone of the cathedral and I can hear the rooks overhead cawing and cawing and chattering and gossiping all day, after the manner of rooks—and humans. I am busy, I need not tell you, arranging things and housekeeping. Jonathan and Mr. Hawkins are busy all day; for, now that Jonathan is a partner, Mr. Hawkins wants to tell him all about the clients.\n“How is your dear mother getting on? I wish I could run up to town for a day or two to see you, dear, but I dare not go yet, with so much on my shoulders; and Jonathan wants looking after still. He is beginning to put some flesh on his bones again, but he was terribly weakened by the long illness; even now he sometimes starts out of his sleep in a sudden way and awakes all trembling until I can coax him back to his usual placidity. However, thank God, these occasions grow less frequent as the days go on, and they will in time pass away altogether, I trust. And now I have told you my news, let me ask yours. When are you to be married, and where, and who is to perform the ceremony, and what are you to wear, and is it to be a public or a private wedding? Tell me all about it, dear; tell me all about everything, for there is nothing which interests you which will not be dear to me. Jonathan asks me to send his ‘respectful duty,’ but I do not think that is good enough from the junior partner of the important firm Hawkins & Harker; and so, as you love me, and he loves me, and I love you with all the moods and tenses of the verb, I send you simply his ‘love’ instead.

Mina begins by saying it feels like a long time since they communicated and asks for forgiveness for her silence, promising her 'news budget' will explain. She joyfully reports that Jonathan is safely home. Upon their arrival in Exeter, Mr. Hawkins, despite a gout attack, met them in a carriage and took them to his comfortable home, where they had dinner. After the meal, Mr. Hawkins toasted their health and future, wishing them well. He spoke of watching them grow up with affection and pride. He then made a significant announcement: since he has no surviving family, he wants them to live with him and has made them his sole heirs in his will. Mina writes that she cried upon hearing this, especially when Jonathan and Mr. Hawkins shook hands. Their evening was exceptionally happy. Now, they are living at Mr. Hawkins's lovely old house. From both her bedroom and the drawing-room, Mina can see the large elms by the cathedral, their dark trunks stark against the yellow stone of the building, and can hear the constant cawing and chattering of the rooks, which she compares to human gossip. She mentions she is occupied with getting settled and managing the household. Jonathan and Mr. Hawkins are also occupied all day, as Mr. Hawkins is introducing Jonathan to the business and clients now that he is a partner. Mina asks about Lucy's mother's health and expresses a desire to visit London for a couple of days but feels unable to leave yet due to her responsibilities and Jonathan's continued need for care. She notes Jonathan is starting to regain weight but was greatly weakened by his long illness. He still occasionally wakes up abruptly from sleep, trembling, until she can calm him. However, she is thankful these episodes are decreasing in frequency and trusts they will eventually disappear. After sharing her news, Mina eagerly asks for all the details about Lucy's upcoming marriage: the date, location, officiant, her dress, and whether it will be public or private. She urges Lucy to tell her everything, as anything that interests Lucy is important to her. Jonathan asked her to send his 'respectful duty,' but Mina felt that was too formal for the junior partner of the now important firm Hawkins & Harker.

He wakes up frightened sometimes, but that is happening less often as time goes on. Mina then requests to hear all about Lucy's upcoming wedding—the date, venue, who will officiate, what she will wear, and whether it will be public or private—because everything about Lucy's life is important to her.

Dated September 17th, Mina begins by saying it feels like ages since they last communicated and asks for forgiveness for her silence, promising to share all her news. She reports that Jonathan returned safely, and when they reached Exeter, Mr. Hawkins, despite suffering from gout, was waiting for them with a carriage. He brought them to his home, which he had prepared comfortably for their arrival, and they had dinner together. After the meal, Mr. Hawkins proposed a toast to their health and happiness, expressing his lifelong affection and pride in them. He announced his desire for them to live with him, as he has no surviving family, and revealed he has designated them as his sole inheritors in his will. Mina shares that she cried when Jonathan and the elderly Mr. Hawkins shook hands, and they spent a very joyful evening. Mina describes their new residence in the lovely old house, mentioning she can see the large elm trees near the cathedral, their dark trunks stark against the old yellow stone, from her bedroom and the drawing-room. She also hears the constant cawing and chattering of rooks throughout the day, noting how they resemble humans in their gossip. Mina is occupied with setting up the house and managing domestic affairs. Jonathan and Mr. Hawkins are busy with work; now that Jonathan is a partner in the firm, Mr. Hawkins is sharing all the client information with him. Mina then inquires about Lucy’s mother's health. She expresses a strong desire to visit London for a day or two to see Lucy but feels unable to leave yet due to her current responsibilities and Jonathan still needing care. She mentions Jonathan is slowly regaining weight after his severe illness, which left him considerably weakened. He still occasionally wakes up suddenly from sleep, trembling, until she comforts him back to calmness. However, she thankfully notes these incidents are becoming less frequent and trusts they will eventually stop entirely. Having shared her own news, Mina turns to Lucy's, eagerly asking for every detail about her upcoming marriage: the date, location, who will perform the ceremony, what she will wear, and whether it will be public or private. She stresses how much everything concerning Lucy matters to her. Jonathan sends his regards, initially suggesting 'respectful duty,' but Mina decides a simple 'love' is more fitting from the junior partner of the significant firm Hawkins & Harker, given their close relationship. She concludes the letter by bidding Lucy farewell and sending her many blessings, signing off as Mina Harker.",

You will forgive me, I’m sure, once you hear all the news I have to share. Everything went well with my husband: when we reached Exeter, there was a carriage waiting, and inside, despite a bout of gout, was Mr. Hawkins. He took us to his home, where we were given lovely, comfortable rooms, and we enjoyed dinner together. After the meal, Mr. Hawkins said:\n\n\"My dear ones, I’d like to toast your future happiness and success. I have known both of you since childhood, and have watched you grow with love and pride. Now I want you to make this house your home too. I have no family left, and I have made all my estate over to you in my will.\" I cried, Lucy, as Jonathan and Mr. Hawkins shook hands. We spent a truly happy evening.\n\nNow we are settled in this beautiful old house, from which I can see the tall elms outside the cathedral, their dark trunks contrasting with the yellow cathedral stones, and all day long I hear the rooks calling and chattering, just like people do. I have been kept busy with household arrangements, as you might expect. Jonathan and Mr. Hawkins are always occupied with work; since Jonathan is now a partner, Mr. Hawkins wants to update him on all the firm’s clients.\n\nHow is your dear mother? I wish I could visit you in town for a day or two, but there is too much to manage here right now—plus, Jonathan still needs my care. He is finally starting to regain some weight after his long illness, but it left him very weak; sometimes he wakes from sleep suddenly and trembling, until I can calm him down. Thankfully, these episodes are becoming less frequent, and I hope they’ll go away entirely.\n\nThat’s my news—now I want to hear all of yours. When is your wedding? Where will it be? Who will officiate? What will you wear? Will it be public or private? Tell me everything, dear. Anything that matters to you matters to me. Jonathan sends his ‘respectful duty,’ but I think that’s too formal for the junior partner of Hawkins & Harker, so—as you love me and he loves me and I love you in every possible way—I simply send you his love instead. Farewell, dearest Lucy, and may all good things come to you.\n\nYours,\nMina Harker."

          "text_segment": "Dr. Seward’s Diary.\n20 September.—Only resolution and habit can let me make an entry to-night. I am too miserable, too low-spirited, too sick of the world and all in it, including life itself, that I would not care if I heard this moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death. And he has been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late—Lucy’s mother and Arthur’s father, and now.... Let me get on with my work.\nI duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy. We wanted Arthur to go to rest also, but he refused at first. It was only when I told him that we should want him to help us during the day, and that we must not all break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreed to go. Van Helsing was very kind to him. “Come, my child,” he said; “come with me. You are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and much mental pain, as well as that tax on your strength that we know of. You must not be alone; for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms. Come to the drawing-room, where there is a big fire, and there are two sofas. You shall lie on one, and I on the other, and our sympathy will be comfort to each other, even though we do not speak, and even if we sleep.” Arthur went off with him, casting back a longing look on Lucy’s face, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn. She lay quite still, and I looked round the room to see that all was as it should be. I could see that the Professor had carried out in this room, as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic; the whole of the window-sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy’s neck, over the silk handkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough chaplet of the same odorous flowers. Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and her face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums. Her teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they had been in the morning. In particular, by some trick of the light, the canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest. I sat down by her, and presently she moved uneasily. At the same moment there came a sort of dull flapping or buffeting at the window. I went over to it softly, and peeped out by the corner of the blind. There was a full moonlight, and I could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeled round—doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim—and every now and again struck the window with its wings. When I came back to my seat, I found that Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic flowers from her throat. I replaced them as well as I could, and sat watching her.\nPresently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had prescribed. She took but a little, and that languidly. There did not seem to be with her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto so marked her illness. It struck me as curious that the moment she became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her. It was certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with the stertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her; but that when she waked she clutched them close. There was no possibility of making any mistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had many spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times.\nAt six o’clock Van Helsing came to relieve me. Arthur had then fallen into a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on. When he saw Lucy’s face I could hear the sissing indraw of his breath, and he said to me in a sharp whisper: “Draw up the blind; I want light!” Then he bent down, and, with his face almost touching Lucy’s, examined her carefully. He removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat. As he did so he started back, and I could hear his ejaculation, “Mein Gott!” as it was smothered in his throat. I bent over and looked, too, and as I noticed some queer chill came over me.\nThe wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared.\nFor fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at her, with his face at its sternest. Then he turned to me and said calmly:—\n“She is dying. It will not be long now. It will be much difference, mark me, whether she dies conscious or in her sleep. Wake that poor boy, and let him come and see the last; he trusts us, and we have promised him.”\nI went to the dining-room and waked him. He was dazed for a moment, but when he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters he thought he was late, and expressed his fear. I assured him that Lucy was still asleep, but told him as gently as I could that both Van Helsing and I feared that the end was near. He covered his face with his hands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where he remained, perhaps a minute, with his head buried, praying, whilst his shoulders shook with grief. I took him by the hand and raised him up. “Come,” I said, “my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude: it will be best and easiest for her.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "September 20th — Dr. Seward's Diary: Tonight, only sheer willpower and routine allow me to write. I feel so miserable, so down, so utterly disgusted with the world and everything in it, including my own existence, that I wouldn't even care if the angel of death arrived right now. And that grim figure has certainly been active recently—first Lucy's mother, then Arthur's father, and now... I must focus on my task. I took over watching Lucy from Van Helsing as scheduled. We tried to persuade Arthur to rest, but he initially refused. He only agreed when I explained that his help would be needed tomorrow and that we couldn't all collapse from exhaustion, as that would harm Lucy. Van Helsing was very kind to him. He said, 'Come, my boy, come with me. You are ill and weak from much sorrow and mental anguish, not to mention the strain you've endured. You shouldn't be alone; being alone breeds fear and anxiety. Let's go to the drawing-room by the large fire; there are two sofas. You can lie on one and I on the other. Our shared presence will offer comfort, even if we don't speak or if we fall asleep.' Arthur left with him, glancing back wistfully at Lucy's face on the pillow, which was almost whiter than the sheets. She lay completely still. I checked the room to ensure everything was in order. The Professor had clearly used garlic here, just as elsewhere; the window frames strongly smelled of it, and around Lucy's neck, over the silk scarf Van Helsing insisted she wear, was a crude necklace of the same fragrant flowers. Lucy was breathing somewhat heavily, and her condition looked worse; her open mouth revealed pale gums. In the faint, shifting light, her teeth appeared longer and sharper than they had that morning. The canine teeth, in particular, seemed longer and sharper due to a trick of the light. I sat beside her, and she soon shifted restlessly. Just then, a dull flapping or thumping sound came from the window. I quietly approached it and peered out from the corner of the blind. The moon was full, and I saw that the noise was caused by a large bat circling—likely drawn by the light, despite its dimness—and hitting the window repeatedly with its wings. When I returned to my seat, I saw Lucy had moved slightly and pulled the garlic flowers from her throat. I rearranged them as best as I could and continued watching her. She woke eventually, and I gave her the food Van Helsing had instructed. She ate very little, and listlessly. The unconscious struggle for life and strength that had characterized her illness until now seemed absent. It struck me as strange that the moment she became conscious, she pulled the garlic flowers close to her. It was certainly peculiar that whenever she entered that sluggish state with heavy breathing, she pushed the flowers away, but upon waking, she clutched them tightly. There was no room for misinterpretation, as over the long hours that followed, she had numerous periods of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times. At six o'clock, Van Helsing arrived to relieve me. Arthur had fallen asleep, and mercifully, Van Helsing let him rest. When he saw Lucy's face, I heard his sharp intake of breath, and he whispered urgently, 'Pull up the blind; I need light!' He then leaned down, his face almost touching Lucy's, and examined her closely. He removed the flowers and lifted the silk scarf from her throat. As he did so, he flinched back, and I heard his stifled exclamation, 'Mein Gott!' I leaned over to look as well, and a strange chill came over me when I saw it. The wounds on her throat had completely vanished. Van Helsing stood there for a full five minutes, staring at her with a grim expression. Then he turned to me and stated calmly, 'She is dying. It will not be much longer now. It will make a great difference, mark my words, whether she dies awake or asleep. Wake that poor boy and let him come and see her last moments; he trusts us, and we promised him.' I went to the dining room and woke him. He was disoriented for a moment, but seeing the sunlight through the shutters made him think he was late, and he expressed concern. I reassured him Lucy was still sleeping but gently told him that both Van Helsing and I feared the end was near. He covered his face with his hands and sank to his knees by the sofa, where he remained for perhaps a minute, head bowed in prayer, his shoulders shaking with sorrow. I took his hand and helped him up. 'Come,' I said, 'my dear old friend, gather all your strength; it will be best and easiest for her.'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Dr. Seward’s Diary, September 20th. Tonight, I can only write thanks to sheer determination and routine. I am deeply unhappy, forlorn, and so weary of life and the world that I would not mind hearing the wings of death’s angel at this very moment. Lately, death seems to have been busy around us—with the loss of Lucy’s mother, then Arthur’s father, and now... I must focus on my duties.\n\nI took over from Van Helsing in keeping watch over Lucy. We encouraged Arthur to get some rest too, but he at first refused. I convinced him he would need his strength to help us the next day, and that it wouldn’t do for us all to be exhausted and risk Lucy’s well-being—he finally agreed. Van Helsing kindly took Arthur away, telling him it wasn’t good to be alone when he was so worn by sorrow and illness, and suggested they rest together in the drawing-room by the fire, offering each other comfort in silence or sleep. Arthur left, looking longingly at Lucy as she lay pale and still.\n\nI checked the room to make sure all was as it should be. I noticed Van Helsing had, as before, used garlic throughout the room—around the window frames and as a rough necklace on Lucy over her scarf. Lucy breathed heavily, her face at its worst, mouth open to reveal pale gums and, in the dim light, her teeth looked longer and sharper, especially the canines. Sitting beside her, I soon noticed her uneasy movements, and then heard a dull flapping sound at the window. Quietly, I looked out and, in the moonlight, spotted a large bat circling and occasionally striking the pane.\n\nWhen I returned to Lucy, I saw she had pulled the garlic flowers from her neck. I replaced them and watched her. When she awoke, I gave her the food Van Helsing had suggested, but she ate little and seemed listless; the inner fight for life she’d shown before seemed gone. Oddly, as soon as she was conscious, she held the garlic close, though in her heavy lethargy she always pushed the flowers away. This pattern repeated throughout the long night as she drifted in and out of sleep.\n\nVan Helsing arrived at six to relieve me. Arthur, dozing, was left to rest. Van Helsing looked at Lucy, inhaled sharply, and asked for more light. Leaning over her, he examined her neck, removing the garlic flowers and scarf. Suddenly, he recoiled with a muffled exclamation—\"Mein Gott!\" I, too, looked and felt a strange chill; the wounds on her throat had vanished.\n\nVan Helsing spent five minutes watching her sternly, then said to me quietly that Lucy was dying and it would not take long. He noted it mattered whether she died awake or in sleep, and that Arthur should be there for the end as they had promised him. I woke Arthur, who at first was confused, but when I gently explained that Lucy was near death, he wept and knelt by the sofa in sorrow. I encouraged him to summon his courage, insisting it would be best for her."

He had even brushed Lucy’s hair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples. When we came into the room she opened her eyes, and seeing him, whispered softly:—\n“Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!” He was stooping to kiss her, when Van Helsing motioned him back. “No,” he whispered, “not yet! Hold her hand; it will comfort her more.”\nSo Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she looked her best, with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes. Then gradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep. For a little bit her breast heaved softly, and her breath came and went like a tired child’s.\nAnd then insensibly there came the strange change which I had noticed in the night. Her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the pale gums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever. In a sort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way she opened her eyes, which were now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft, voluptuous voice, such as I had never heard from her lips:—\n“Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come! Kiss me!” Arthur bent eagerly over to kiss her; but at that instant Van Helsing, who, like me, had been startled by her voice, swooped upon him, and catching him by the neck with both hands, dragged him back with a fury of strength which I never thought he could have possessed, and actually hurled him almost across the room.\n“Not for your life!” he said; “not for your living soul and hers!” And he stood between them like a lion at bay.\nArthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do or say; and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realised the place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting.\nI kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, and we saw a spasm as of rage flit like a shadow over her face; the sharp teeth champed together. Then her eyes closed, and she breathed heavily.\nVery shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, and putting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took Van Helsing’s great brown one; drawing it to her, she kissed it. “My true friend,” she said, in a faint voice, but with untellable pathos, “My true friend, and his! Oh, guard him, and give me peace!”\n“I swear it!” he said solemnly, kneeling beside her and holding up his hand, as one who registers an oath. Then he turned to Arthur, and said to him: “Come, my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on the forehead, and only once.”\nTheir eyes met instead of their lips; and so they parted.\nLucy’s eyes closed; and Van Helsing, who had been watching closely, took Arthur’s arm, and drew him away.\nAnd then Lucy’s breathing became stertorous again, and all at once it ceased.\n“It is all over,” said Van Helsing. “She is dead!”\nI took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawing-room, where he sat down, and covered his face with his hands, sobbing in a way that nearly broke me down to see.\nI went back to the room, and found Van Helsing looking at poor Lucy, and his face was sterner than ever. Some change had come over her body. Death had given back part of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks had recovered some of their flowing lines; even the lips had lost their deadly pallor. It was as if the blood, no longer needed for the working of the heart, had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as might be.\n“We thought her dying whilst she slept,\nAnd sleeping when she died.”\nI stood beside Van Helsing, and said:—\n“Ah, well, poor girl, there is peace for her at last. It is the end!”\nHe turned to me, and said with grave solemnity:—\n“Not so; alas! not so. It is only the beginning!”\nWhen I asked him what he meant, he only shook his head and answered:—\n“We can do nothing as yet. Wait and see.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Upon entering Lucy’s room, I observed that Van Helsing had thoughtfully tidied up, making the space as pleasant as possible. He had even arranged Lucy's hair, allowing her characteristic sunny waves to rest on the pillow. As we stepped in, she opened her eyes and, seeing him, softly whispered, 'Arthur! Oh, my dearest, I am so happy you're here!' As Arthur leaned down to kiss her, Van Helsing gently held him back, whispering, 'No, not yet! Just hold her hand; that will comfort her more.' So Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her. She looked her loveliest then, with her gentle features complementing the angelic beauty of her eyes. Gradually, her eyes closed, and she drifted into sleep. For a short while, her chest rose and fell softly, and her breathing was faint, like a tired child's. Then, almost imperceptibly, the peculiar transformation I had witnessed during the night began. Her breathing grew heavy and rattling, her mouth fell open, and her pale gums receded, making her teeth appear abnormally long and sharp. In a kind of hazy, semi-conscious state, she opened her eyes, which now seemed both dull and hard, and spoke in a low, alluring voice I had never heard from her before: 'Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come! Kiss me!' Arthur eagerly bent forward to kiss her, but at that instant, Van Helsing, who, like me, had been startled by her voice, lunged at him. Grabbing Arthur by the neck with both hands, he pulled him back with incredible force, a strength I hadn't imagined he possessed, even hurling him halfway across the room. 'Absolutely not!' he declared. 'Not for your life! Not for your very soul and hers!' He stood between them like a cornered lion. Arthur was so taken aback that he momentarily froze, unsure what to do or say. Before any aggressive reaction could emerge, he recognized the seriousness of the situation and the place, becoming silent and watchful. Both Van Helsing and I kept our gaze fixed on Lucy. We saw a flicker of what seemed like fury pass over her face; her sharp teeth snapped shut. Then her eyes closed, and she breathed heavily. Very soon after, her eyes reopened, full of their usual softness. Extending her frail, pale hand, she grasped Van Helsing’s large, strong one. Pulling it towards her, she kissed it. 'My true friend,' she said in a weak voice filled with profound emotion, 'My true friend, and his! Oh, protect him, and give me peace!' 'I promise!' he stated solemnly, kneeling beside her and raising his hand as if taking an oath. He then turned to Arthur and instructed him, 'Come, my boy, take her hand in yours, and kiss her forehead, just once.' Their eyes met instead of their lips; thus, they bid their final farewells. Lucy's eyes closed. Van Helsing, who had been observing intently, took Arthur’s arm and led him away. Immediately after, Lucy’s breathing became stertorous again, and then, all at once, it stopped. 'It is over,' Van Helsing pronounced. 'She is dead!' I guided Arthur by the arm to the drawing-room, where he collapsed into a chair, covering his face and sobbing uncontrollably, which was agonizing to witness. I returned to the room and found Van Helsing looking down at poor Lucy. His expression was grimmer than ever. A transformation had occurred in her body after death. It seemed death had restored some of her former beauty; her forehead and cheeks had regained some of their soft contours, and even her lips had lost their deathly pallor. It was as if the blood, no longer needed by the heart, had smoothed out the harshness of death as much as possible. We had thought her dying while she slept, and sleeping when she died. I stood beside Van Helsing and said, 'Ah, well, poor girl, she has found peace at last. It is finished!' He turned to me and replied with serious gravity, 'Not so; alas! not so. This is only the beginning!' When I questioned what he meant, he simply shook his head and responded, 'There is nothing we can do yet. Wait and see.'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As we entered Lucy's room, I noticed that Van Helsing, ever thoughtful, had tidied everything and made the room look as nice as possible. He had even arranged Lucy’s hair so it looked as it usually did on her pillow. As soon as we entered, Lucy opened her eyes and, upon seeing Arthur, softly whispered her delight at his arrival. Arthur leaned down to kiss her, but Van Helsing stopped him, telling him to comfort her instead by holding her hand. Arthur did so, kneeling beside her while Lucy, looking angelic, soon drifted off into sleep, breathing gently at first. Gradually, however, a strange transformation came over her; her breathing became labored, her mouth opened, making her teeth appear longer and sharper. In this sleepy, semi-conscious state, she called out to Arthur in a seductive tone, asking for a kiss. Arthur moved to kiss her, but Van Helsing, alarmed, forcefully pulled Arthur away and admonished him not to risk either of their souls. Arthur, shocked, stood in silence. Van Helsing and I watched as Lucy showed a brief flash of anger, baring her sharp teeth, before settling down and breathing heavily once more. Soon after, Lucy, now her gentle self again, reached out to Van Helsing, kissed his hand, and, with great emotion, asked him to protect Arthur and give her peace. Van Helsing solemnly swore to do so, then asked Arthur to gently kiss Lucy’s forehead, which he did—their gazes meeting in place of their lips. After this, Lucy drifted off, her breathing again growing harsh until it stopped altogether. Van Helsing declared that she was dead. I led a devastated Arthur away, and when I returned, I saw Van Helsing standing over Lucy, his face stern. In death, some of Lucy’s beauty was restored, as if the blood had softened death's appearance. I remarked that at least she was at peace, but Van Helsing solemnly replied that this was only the beginning. When I pressed him for clarity, he simply told me to wait and see, as there was nothing more we could do for now."

          "text_segment": "THE funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that Lucy and her mother might be buried together. I attended to all the ghastly formalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff were afflicted—or blessed—with something of his own obsequious suavity. Even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to me, in a confidential, brother-professional way, when she had come out from the death-chamber:—\n“She makes a very beautiful corpse, sir. It’s quite a privilege to attend on her. It’s not too much to say that she will do credit to our establishment!”\nI noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away. This was possible from the disordered state of things in the household. There were no relatives at hand; and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend at his father’s funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should have been bidden. Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it upon ourselves to examine papers, etc. He insisted upon looking over Lucy’s papers himself. I asked him why, for I feared that he, being a foreigner, might not be quite aware of English legal requirements, and so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble. He answered me:—\n“I know; I know. You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor. But this is not altogether for the law. You knew that, when you avoided the coroner. I have more than him to avoid. There may be papers more—such as this.”\nAs he spoke he took from his pocket-book the memorandum which had been in Lucy’s breast, and which she had torn in her sleep.\n“When you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs. Westenra, seal all her papers, and write him to-night. For me, I watch here in the room and in Miss Lucy’s old room all night, and I myself search for what may be. It is not well that her very thoughts go into the hands of strangers.”\nI went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had found the name and address of Mrs. Westenra’s solicitor and had written to him. All the poor lady’s papers were in order; explicit directions regarding the place of burial were given. I had hardly sealed the letter, when, to my surprise, Van Helsing walked into the room, saying:—\n“Can I help you, friend John? I am free, and if I may, my service is to you.”\n“Have you got what you looked for?” I asked, to which he replied:—\n“I did not look for any specific thing. I only hoped to find, and find I have, all that there was—only some letters and a few memoranda, and a diary new begun. But I have them here, and we shall for the present say nothing of them. I shall see that poor lad to-morrow evening, and, with his sanction, I shall use some.”\nWhen we had finished the work in hand, he said to me:—\n“And now, friend John, I think we may to bed. We want sleep, both you and I, and rest to recuperate. To-morrow we shall have much to do, but for the to-night there is no need of us. Alas!”\nBefore turning in we went to look at poor Lucy. The undertaker had certainly done his work well, for the room was turned into a small chapelle ardente. There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers, and death was made as little repulsive as might be. The end of the winding-sheet was laid over the face; when the Professor bent over and turned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before us, the tall wax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well. All Lucy’s loveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that had passed, instead of leaving traces of “decay’s effacing fingers,” had but restored the beauty of life, till positively I could not believe my eyes that I was looking at a corpse.\nThe Professor looked sternly grave. He had not loved her as I had, and there was no need for tears in his eyes. He said to me: “Remain till I return,” and left the room. He came back with a handful of wild garlic from the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, and placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed. Then he took from his neck, inside his collar, a little gold crucifix, and placed it over the mouth. He restored the sheet to its place, and we came away.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The funeral for Lucy and her mother was scheduled for the following day so they could be buried together. I handled all the unpleasant arrangements, and the refined undertaker and his team displayed a similar level of overly polite smoothness. Even the woman who prepared the bodies commented to me, speaking like a colleague, after she came out of the room where Lucy lay: \"She looks incredibly beautiful in death, sir. It's genuinely an honor to attend to her. It's fair to say she'll be a credit to our establishment!\" I noticed Van Helsing stayed nearby constantly. This was possible because the household was in such disarray. There were no family members present, and since Arthur had to leave the next day for his father's funeral, we couldn't invite anyone who should have been there. Given the circumstances, Van Helsing and I decided to sort through papers and other items. He was insistent on going through Lucy's documents himself. I asked him why, concerned that as a foreigner, he might not understand English legal procedures and could inadvertently cause problems. He responded: \"I understand; I do. You're forgetting I'm a lawyer as well as a doctor. But this isn't solely about the law. You realized that when you avoided the coroner. I have more than him to avoid. There might be other papers—like this one.\" As he spoke, he pulled out the note from his pocketbook that had been inside Lucy's nightdress, the one she had torn while sleeping. \"Once you find the solicitor for the late Mrs. Westenra, seal up all her documents and write to him tonight. As for me, I will stay here in this room and in Miss Lucy's former room all night, searching for whatever I can find. It's not right for her most private thoughts to fall into the hands of strangers.\" I continued with my task and within another thirty minutes had found the name and address of Mrs. Westenra's lawyer and had drafted a letter to him. All the poor lady's papers were organized; she had left clear instructions for her burial place. I had just finished sealing the letter when, to my surprise, Van Helsing came into the room and said: \"Can I assist you, my friend John? I am finished, and if I can be of service, I am yours.\" \"Did you find what you were looking for?\" I inquired, and he replied: \"I wasn't searching for anything specific. I simply hoped to discover, and I have found, everything that was there—just some letters, a few notes, and a newly started diary. But I have them here, and we will keep them private for now. I will see the poor young man tomorrow evening, and, with his permission, I will make use of some of these.\" After we had completed the work we set out to do, he said to me: \"And now, friend John, I believe we should retire. We both need sleep and rest to recover. Tomorrow will be very busy, but for tonight, our work is done. Alas!\" Before we went to bed, we went to see poor Lucy. The undertaker had certainly done an excellent job, transforming the room into a small candlelit chamber of rest. There was an abundance of beautiful white flowers, making death appear as peaceful as possible. The end of her winding-sheet covered her face; when the Professor gently folded it back, we were both startled by the sight before us, illuminated clearly by the tall wax candles. All of Lucy's beauty had returned to her in death, and the intervening hours, rather than showing signs of decay, seemed to have restored her vitality, so much so that I genuinely couldn't believe I was looking at a corpse. The Professor looked profoundly solemn. He hadn't loved her with the same intensity I had, and there was no sign of tears in his eyes. He told me: \"Wait here until I return,\" and left the room. He came back carrying a bunch of wild garlic from a box in the hall that hadn't been opened yet, and he placed the flowers among the others on and around the bed. Then, he took a small gold crucifix from inside his collar and placed it over her mouth. He covered her face again with the sheet, and we left the room.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The funeral was scheduled for the following day so that Lucy and her mother could be buried at the same time. I took care of the distressing details, and the polite undertaker showed that his staff had inherited his courteous manner. Even the woman who attended to the last preparations for the deceased confided to me professionally, after leaving the room, that Lucy was an exceptionally beautiful corpse, and considered it a privilege to care for her, saying she would reflect well on their establishment.\n\nI observed that Van Helsing stayed close by, which was possible due to the house being in disarray and the absence of relatives. Arthur had to return the next day for his own father’s funeral, so we couldn’t contact anyone else who might have been invited. Given the situation, Van Helsing and I assumed responsibility for searching through papers. Van Helsing insisted on looking over Lucy’s documents himself. Concerned that he might unknowingly cause legal problems, since he was not from England, I questioned him. He assured me he was not only a doctor but also a lawyer, and that his reasons were not purely legal. He suggested there might be other important documents, referring specifically to the note Lucy had written and torn in her sleep, which he pulled from his pocket.\n\nHe instructed me to contact Mrs. Westenra’s solicitor as soon as I found his details, sealing all her papers and writing to him that night. Meanwhile, he would spend the night watching in Lucy’s room, searching for anything significant, insisting that such matters should not fall into strangers’ hands.\n\nContinuing with my tasks, I soon located the solicitor’s details and wrote to him, finding all of Mrs. Westenra’s documents were in order, including clear burial instructions. Just as I finished sealing the letter, Van Helsing entered and offered his assistance. When I asked if he’d found what he was looking for, he said he had uncovered some letters, memoranda, and a newly started diary, though he hadn’t searched for anything in particular. He planned to consult with Arthur about using some of these items.\n\nAfter we completed our tasks, Van Helsing suggested we get some sleep to recover, since there would be more work tomorrow. Before going to bed, we went to see Lucy’s body. The undertaker had done a remarkable job, turning the room into a kind of small chapel, filled with beautiful white flowers that softened the harshness of death. Lucy looked so beautiful that, instead of the usual effects of decay, she appeared as lovely as if she were alive, making it hard to believe she was dead.\n\nVan Helsing, looking serious, told me to wait while he left the room, returning with a handful of wild garlic flowers, which he placed among the others around Lucy’s bed. Then, he took a small gold crucifix from his own neck and placed it on her mouth before replacing the sheet and leaving the room with me."

I want to operate, but not as you think. Let me tell you now, but not a word to another. I want to cut off her head and take out her heart. Ah! you a surgeon, and so shocked! You, whom I have seen with no tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and death that make the rest shudder. Oh, but I must not forget, my dear friend John, that you loved her; and I have not forgotten it, for it is I that shall operate, and you must only help. I would like to do it to-night, but for Arthur I must not; he will be free after his father’s funeral to-morrow, and he will want to see her—to see it. Then, when she is coffined ready for the next day, you and I shall come when all sleep. We shall unscrew the coffin-lid, and shall do our operation: and then replace all, so that none know, save we alone.”\n“But why do it at all? The girl is dead. Why mutilate her poor body without need? And if there is no necessity for a post-mortem and nothing to gain by it—no good to her, to us, to science, to human knowledge—why do it? Without such it is monstrous.”\nFor answer he put his hand on my shoulder, and said, with infinite tenderness:—\n“Friend John, I pity your poor bleeding heart; and I love you the more because it does so bleed. If I could, I would take on myself the burden that you do bear. But there are things that you know not, but that you shall know, and bless me for knowing, though they are not pleasant things. John, my child, you have been my friend now many years, and yet did you ever know me to do any without good cause? I may err—I am but man; but I believe in all I do. Was it not for these causes that you send for me when the great trouble came? Yes! Were you not amazed, nay horrified, when I would not let Arthur kiss his love—though she was dying—and snatched him away by all my strength? Yes! And yet you saw how she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so weak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me? Yes! And did you not hear me swear promise to her, that so she closed her eyes grateful? Yes!\n“Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do. You have for many years trust me; you have believe me weeks past, when there be things so strange that you might have well doubt. Believe me yet a little, friend John. If you trust me not, then I must tell what I think; and that is not perhaps well. And if I work—as work I shall, no matter trust or no trust—without my friend trust in me, I work with heavy heart and feel, oh! so lonely when I want all help and courage that may be!” He paused a moment and went on solemnly: “Friend John, there are strange and terrible days before us. Let us not be two, but one, that so we work to a good end. Will you not have faith in me?”\nI took his hand, and promised him. I held my door open as he went away, and watched him go into his room and close the door.",

Let me explain now, but you must keep this strictly confidential. I plan to cut off her head and remove her heart. Ah! You, a surgeon, seem so taken aback! You, whose hand and heart have remained steady through life-and-death procedures that would make others flinch. Oh, but I mustn't forget, my dear friend John, that you cared deeply for her; and I haven't forgotten it, for it is I who will perform the operation, and you will merely assist. I would prefer to do it tonight, but I must not for Arthur's sake; he will be free after his father's funeral tomorrow and will wish to see her—to see the body. Then, once she is placed in the coffin and ready for the following day, you and I will return when everyone is asleep. We will unscrew the coffin lid, carry out our procedure, and then put everything back as it was, so that only we will know.” I questioned, “But why undertake this at all? The young woman is deceased. Why unnecessarily disfigure her poor body? And if there's no medical need for a post-mortem examination and nothing to be gained from it—no benefit to her, to us, to science, or to human knowledge—why proceed? Without such justification, it is monstrous.” In response, he placed his hand on my shoulder and said with profound tenderness, “Friend John, I feel for your aching heart, and I love you all the more because it bleeds so. If it were possible, I would bear the burden you are carrying. But there are matters you are unaware of, which you will come to know, and you will be grateful to me for knowing them, even though they are unpleasant. John, my dear boy, you have been my friend for many years now, and yet have you ever known me to act without good reason? I might make mistakes—I am only human; but I believe in everything I do. Wasn't it for these very reasons that you summoned me when this great misfortune struck? Yes! Weren't you shocked, indeed horrified, when I prevented Arthur from kissing his beloved—even though she was dying—and pulled him away with all my might? Yes! And yet you witnessed how she thanked me, with her beautiful dying eyes and weak voice, and how she kissed my rough old hand and blessed me? Yes! And didn't you hear me make a promise to her, which brought a look of gratitude as she closed her eyes? Yes! “Well, I have strong reasons now for everything I intend to do. For many years, you have trusted me; you have believed me these past few weeks, when things have been so strange that you might well have doubted. Please trust me just a little longer, friend John. If you do not trust me, then I must reveal what I believe; and perhaps that is not ideal. And if I proceed—as I shall, whether I have your trust or not—without my friend trusting me, I will work with a heavy heart and feel so utterly alone when I need all the help and courage possible!” He paused briefly and then continued gravely, “Friend John, difficult and terrifying days lie ahead of us. Let us not be two separate people, but one, so that we can work towards a positive outcome. Will you not have faith in me?” I took his hand and gave him my promise.

I need to carry out an operation, but not in the usual sense. I'll explain, but please speak of this to no one else. I intend to remove her head and heart. Surprised? For a surgeon who has calmly performed the gravest procedures, I didn't expect such shock. Of course, I remember that you loved her. That is why I will perform the task; your role is simply to assist. I would do it tonight, but Arthur cannot be left out. After his father's funeral tomorrow, he will want to see her, the body. Once she is placed in her coffin, you and I will return after everyone is asleep, discreetly open the coffin, perform the procedure, and restore everything so only we know.\"\n\nI protested, \"But why? She's dead; why defile her remains? If there is no scientific gain, no necessity, it seems horrible.\"\n\nHe placed his hand softly on my shoulder and replied with great compassion, \"John, I grieve for your suffering, and my care for you grows in your pain. If I could, I would bear your burden. But there are things you do not yet understand, but you will—and you will thank me, though the truth is hard. Have I ever acted without reason? Did I not refuse Arthur a last kiss, even as she was dying, because I foresaw the consequences? You saw her gratitude even in her last moments, her weak voice blessing me. Did you not hear my promise to her as she slipped away?\"\n\nHe continued, \"I have important reasons for what I ask. You have trusted me for years, and even recently through unimaginable events. Continue to trust me now. If you do not, I will be forced to speak my worst fears, which is for the worse. Regardless, I must act—even if I feel alone without your faith. These are perilous times; let us unite our efforts. Will you trust me?\"\n\nI agreed, shook his hand, watched him leave, and close his door behind him."

          "text_segment": "The forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came: Mr. Marquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand & Lidderdale. He was very genial and very appreciative of what we had done, and took off our hands all cares as to details. During lunch he told us that Mrs. Westenra had for some time expected sudden death from her heart, and had put her affairs in absolute order; he informed us that, with the exception of a certain entailed property of Lucy’s father’s which now, in default of direct issue, went back to a distant branch of the family, the whole estate, real and personal, was left absolutely to Arthur Holmwood. When he had told us so much he went on:—\n“Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition, and pointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter either penniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonial alliance. Indeed, we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into collision, for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry out her wishes. Of course, we had then no alternative but to accept. We were right in principle, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred we should have proved, by the logic of events, the accuracy of our judgment. Frankly, however, I must admit that in this case any other form of disposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her wishes. For by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have come into possession of the property, and, even had she only survived her mother by five minutes, her property would, in case there were no will—and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case—have been treated at her decease as under intestacy. In which case Lord Godalming, though so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the world; and the inheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon their just rights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger. I assure you, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced.”\nHe was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part—in which he was officially interested—of so great a tragedy, was an object-lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The morning was quite gloomy, but at noon, the lawyer, Mr. Marquand from the firm Wholeman, Sons, Marquand & Lidderdale, arrived. He was very kind and grateful for our efforts, and he relieved us of all the worries concerning the practical details. During lunch, he informed us that Mrs. Westenra had anticipated a sudden death due to her heart condition for some time and had meticulously arranged her affairs. He revealed that, apart from a specific entailed property inherited by Lucy's father which now reverted to a distant relative because there were no direct descendants, her entire estate, both real estate and personal belongings, was bequeathed entirely to Arthur Holmwood. After sharing this information, he continued:\n\"Honestly, we tried our best to prevent this specific arrangement in the will, highlighting potential situations where her daughter might be left without money or not have the freedom she needed concerning marriage choices. In fact, we pushed this point so strongly that we nearly had a disagreement, as she questioned whether we were willing to follow her instructions or not. Naturally, at that point, we had no other choice but to agree. We were correct in principle, and in nearly every other instance, the outcome of events would have proven the accuracy of our judgment. However, I must confess that in this particular case, any other form of inheritance distribution would have made it impossible to fulfill her wishes. Because if she died before her daughter, Lucy would have inherited the property, and even if Lucy only survived her mother by just five minutes, if there were no will (which would have been practically impossible in such a scenario), her property would have been handled as if she died without one. In that situation, Lord Godalming, despite being such a close friend, would have had no legal right to anything; and the heirs, being distant relatives, would unlikely waive their rightful claims for sentimental reasons concerning someone they didn't know at all. I assure you, gentlemen, I am extremely pleased with the outcome, perfectly delighted.\"\nHe was a decent man, but his obvious pleasure in the one small aspect of this major tragedy – the part he was professionally involved in – served as a clear example of how limited sympathetic understanding can be.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The morning passed slowly and gloomily, but at midday the solicitor, Mr. Marquand from Wholeman, Sons, Marquand & Lidderdale, arrived. He was friendly and praised our efforts, assuring us that he would handle all the necessary details. Over lunch, he explained that Mrs. Westenra had anticipated the possibility of dying suddenly due to her heart condition, so she had organized her affairs thoroughly. With the exception of a certain property from Lucy’s father’s side, which due to inheritance rules reverted to a distant relative, the rest of Mrs. Westenra’s assets—both real estate and personal items—were left entirely to Arthur Holmwood. Mr. Marquand admitted that their firm had tried to persuade Mrs. Westenra not to arrange her will in this way, pointing out situations where Lucy might be left with little or her independence could be restricted if she wished to marry. They pressed her on this point until she challenged them to say whether they would follow her wishes or not. With no other reasonable choice, they agreed. Mr. Marquand said that, in most cases, their advice would have been justified by the outcome, but in this instance, any other will would have prevented Mrs. Westenra’s wishes from being fulfilled. If her daughter survived her by only a short time and there was no separate will possible in such circumstances, the estate would have been handled as if Lucy died without a will, and Arthur Holmwood would have had no legal claim, despite his close relationship. Instead, distant relatives would inherit, unlikely to forgo their rights for sentimental reasons relating to someone they hardly knew. Mr. Marquand expressed genuine satisfaction at the result. He was a decent man, yet his happiness over a narrow professional aspect of such a sad situation illustrated how limited one’s empathy can be."

His coming, however, had been a certain comfort to us, since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile criticism as to any of our acts. Arthur was expected at five o’clock, so a little before that time we visited the death-chamber. It was so in very truth, for now both mother and daughter lay in it. The undertaker, true to his craft, had made the best display he could of his goods, and there was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits at once. Van Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to, explaining that, as Lord Godalming was coming very soon, it would be less harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his fiancée quite alone. The undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and exerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left them the night before, so that when Arthur came such shocks to his feelings as we could avoid were saved.\nPoor fellow! He looked desperately sad and broken; even his stalwart manhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his much-tried emotions. He had, I knew, been very genuinely and devotedly attached to his father; and to lose him, and at such a time, was a bitter blow to him. With me he was warm as ever, and to Van Helsing he was sweetly courteous; but I could not help seeing that there was some constraint with him. The Professor noticed it, too, and motioned me to bring him upstairs. I did so, and left him at the door of the room, as I felt he would like to be quite alone with her, but he took my arm and led me in, saying huskily:—\n“You loved her too, old fellow; she told me all about it, and there was no friend had a closer place in her heart than you. I don’t know how to thank you for all you have done for her. I can’t think yet....”\nHere he suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my shoulders and laid his head on my breast, crying:—\n“Oh, Jack! Jack! What shall I do! The whole of life seems gone from me all at once, and there is nothing in the wide world for me to live for.”\nI comforted him as well as I could. In such cases men do not need much expression. A grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm over the shoulder, a sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear to a man’s heart. I stood still and silent till his sobs died away, and then I said softly to him:—\n“Come and look at her.”\nTogether we moved over to the bed, and I lifted the lawn from her face. God! how beautiful she was. Every hour seemed to be enhancing her loveliness. It frightened and amazed me somewhat; and as for Arthur, he fell a-trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague. At last, after a long pause, he said to me in a faint whisper:—\n“Jack, is she really dead?”\nI assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest—for I felt that such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer than I could help—that it often happened that after death faces became softened and even resolved into their youthful beauty; that this was especially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged suffering. It seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and, after kneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her lovingly and long, he turned aside. I told him that that must be good-bye, as the coffin had to be prepared; so he went back and took her dead hand in his and kissed it, and bent over and kissed her forehead. He came away, fondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he came.\nI left him in the drawing-room, and told Van Helsing that he had said good-bye; so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker’s men to proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin. When he came out of the room again I told him of Arthur’s question, and he replied:—\n“I am not surprised. Just now I doubted for a moment myself!”",

However, his presence offered us some comfort, reassuring us that our recent actions wouldn't face hostile criticism. Arthur was expected at five o'clock, so shortly before then, we went into the room that was truly a death-chamber, now holding both mother and daughter. The undertaker, in keeping with his profession, had arranged his 'goods' in a somewhat theatrical display, creating a morbid atmosphere that instantly weighed on our spirits. Van Helsing ordered the original arrangement restored, explaining that since Lord Godalming was arriving soon, it would be less upsetting for him to see his fiancée's remains simply laid out alone. The undertaker seemed taken aback by his own lapse in judgment and quickly worked to restore things to how we had left them the previous night, thus avoiding any unnecessary shock to Arthur's feelings upon his arrival. The poor man looked terribly sad and broken; even his usual strong presence seemed diminished by the strain of his recent severe emotional trials. I knew he had been genuinely and deeply devoted to his father; losing him at such a time was a painful blow. With me, he was as warm as ever, and he was sweetly courteous to Van Helsing, but I couldn't ignore a certain tension in him. The Professor also noticed it and gestured for me to take him upstairs. I did so and paused at the door to the room, assuming he would want complete privacy with her, but he took my arm and led me inside, speaking with difficulty:— \"You loved her too, old friend; she told me everything, and no friend held a dearer place in her heart than you. I don't know how to thank you for everything you did for her. I can't even think yet....\" At this point, he suddenly broke down, wrapping his arms around my shoulders and resting his head on my chest, sobbing:— \"Oh, Jack! Jack! What will I do! My whole life seems to have vanished at once, and there is nothing left in this wide world for me to live for.\" I offered him comfort as best I could. In such moments, men don't need many words. A firm handshake, a supportive arm around the shoulder, a shared sob—these are gestures of sympathy precious to a man's heart. I remained still and silent until his sobs subsided, and then I gently said to him:— \"Come and look at her.\" Together, we moved towards the bed, and I lifted the fine cloth from her face. My God, how incredibly beautiful she was. Every hour seemed to be enhancing her loveliness. It somewhat frightened and astonished me; and as for Arthur, he began trembling and was finally seized by doubt as if with a fever. At last, after a long silence, he said to me in a faint whisper:— \"Jack, is she... is she really dead?\" I sadly confirmed that she was and went on to suggest—because I felt such a terrible doubt must be eliminated immediately—that it's common for faces to soften and even regain their youthful beauty after death, especially when preceded by intense or prolonged suffering. This explanation seemed to entirely dispel his doubt, and after kneeling by the couch for a while and looking at her with love and for a long time, he turned away. I told him that this had to be good-bye now as the coffin needed to be prepared. So he returned and took her cold hand in his and kissed it, then bent over and kissed her forehead. He walked away, looking back fondly over his shoulder at her as he left. I left him in the drawing-room and informed Van Helsing that Arthur had finished his farewells. Van Helsing then went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker's men to continue with the preparations and close the coffin.

The room truly was one of death now, as both mother and daughter rested there. The undertaker had, in his professional fashion, arranged everything as best he could, yet the space felt oppressively somber, which immediately dampened our spirits. Van Helsing instructed that the room be kept as it was before, explaining that, since Lord Godalming would arrive soon, it would be kinder for him to find his fiancée’s remains alone. The undertaker, realizing his oversight, worked quickly to restore things to how they’d been, so Arthur would be spared additional distress.\n\nArthur arrived appearing utterly grief-stricken, the strain of his emotions even seeming to diminish his normally strong presence. I knew how deeply he cared for his father, so this loss, especially at such a time, was especially cruel to him. He remained warm toward me and was respectfully courteous to Van Helsing, but there was a notable restraint in his demeanor. Van Helsing noticed as well, silently signaling me to bring Arthur upstairs. I did so and intended to leave him alone at the door, but he stopped me, taking my arm and bringing me inside, saying with a choked voice that I, too, had loved her and no one had been closer to her than me. He said he didn’t know how to thank me for all I’d done.\n\nSuddenly he broke down, hugging me and crying, mourning how life had suddenly lost all meaning for him. I did my best to comfort him. In such moments, words aren’t really necessary: a firm handshake, a comforting arm around the shoulder, shared tears all speak sympathy to a man’s soul. I stood silently until his crying stopped, then gently encouraged him to come see her.\n\nWe went together to the bed, and I lifted the cloth from her face. She looked more beautiful than ever, her beauty increasing with each hour, which both amazed and unsettled me. Arthur trembled, overcome with doubt and emotion, and after a while whispered, asking me if she was really dead. I sadly assured him she was, explaining that it is common for people’s faces to look softer and regain youthfulness after death, especially following intense suffering. This seemed to comfort him, and after spending some time kneeling beside her, gazing at her fondly, he said goodbye. He held her hand, kissed it, kissed her forehead, and as he left the room, kept looking back at her fondly.\n\nI left him in the sitting room and told Van Helsing Arthur was ready, so the Professor told the undertaker’s men to continue with the preparations and seal the coffin. When Van Helsing returned, I told him about Arthur’s question, and he admitted that he himself had briefly wondered the same thing."

And let me say that I am at a loss for words to thank you for your goodness to my poor dear.” He paused a moment, and went on: “I know that she understood your goodness even better than I do; and if I was rude or in any way wanting at that time you acted so—you remember”—the Professor nodded—“you must forgive me.”\nHe answered with a grave kindness:—\n“I know it was hard for you to quite trust me then, for to trust such violence needs to understand; and I take it that you do not—that you cannot—trust me now, for you do not yet understand.

Then you shall bless me from first to last for your own sake, and for the sake of others and for her dear sake to whom I swore to protect.”\n“And, indeed, indeed, sir,” said Arthur warmly, “I shall in all ways trust you. I know and believe you have a very noble heart, and you are Jack’s friend, and you were hers. You shall do what you like.”\nThe Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as though about to speak, and finally said:—\n“May I ask you something now?”\n“Certainly.”\n“You know that Mrs. Westenra left you all her property?”\n“No, poor dear; I never thought of it.”\n“And as it is all yours, you have a right to deal with it as you will. I want you to give me permission to read all Miss Lucy’s papers and letters. Believe me, it is no idle curiosity. I have a motive of which, be sure, she would have approved. I have them all here.

I shall keep them, if I may; even you may not see them yet, but I shall keep them safe. No word shall be lost; and in the good time I shall give them back to you. It’s a hard thing I ask, but you will do it, will you not, for Lucy’s sake?”\nArthur spoke out heartily, like his old self:—\n“Dr. Van Helsing, you may do what you will. I feel that in saying this I am doing what my dear one would have approved. I shall not trouble you with questions till the time comes.”\nThe old Professor stood up as he said solemnly:—\n“And you are right. There will be pain for us all; but it will not be all pain, nor will this pain be the last. We and you too—you most of all, my dear boy—will have to pass through the bitter water before we reach the sweet. But we must be brave of heart and unselfish, and do our duty, and all will be well!”\nI slept on a sofa in Arthur’s room that night. Van Helsing did not go to bed at all. He went to and fro, as if patrolling the house, and was never out of sight of the room where Lucy lay in her coffin, strewn with the wild garlic flowers, which sent, through the odour of lily and rose, a heavy, overpowering smell into the night.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "We all ate together, and I could tell that poor Arthur was doing his best to remain composed. Van Helsing had remained silent throughout the meal, but after we lit our cigars, he began, saying, \"Lord...\" but Arthur quickly interrupted him. \"No, no, please, not that! For God's sake, not yet anyway. Please forgive me, sir; I didn't mean to sound rude. It's just that my loss is so recent.\" The Professor replied very gently, \"I only used that title because I was uncertain what to call you. I cannot address you as 'Mr.,' and I have grown to feel deep affection for you - yes, my dear boy, to love you - and wish to call you Arthur.\" Arthur reached out his hand and clasped the old man's warmly. \"Call me whatever you wish,\" he said. \"I hope I can always hold the title of a friend. And let me say that I am completely at a loss for words to express my gratitude for your kindness to my poor dear.\" He paused for a moment and then continued, \"I know that she understood your kindness even better than I do; and if I was impolite or lacking in any way at the time you acted as you did - you remember\" - the Professor nodded in agreement - \"you must forgive me.\" Van Helsing responded with a serious yet kind tone, \"I understand it was difficult for you to entirely trust me then, for such drastic actions require understanding, and I gather that you do not - that you cannot - trust me now, because you do not yet understand. And there may be more times when I will need you to trust when you cannot - and perhaps may not - and must not yet understand. But the time will arrive when your trust in me will be complete and unwavering, and when you will understand as if the sun itself were shining through. Then you will bless me from beginning to end, for your own good, for the good of others, and for the sake of her dear soul, whom I swore to protect.\" \"And truly, indeed, sir,\" Arthur said with warmth, \"I shall trust you in every way. I know and believe you possess a very noble heart, and you are Jack's friend, and you were hers. You shall do as you see fit.\" The Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as if preparing to speak, and finally said, \"May I ask you something now?\" \"Certainly.\" \"Do you know that Mrs. Westenra left you all her property?\" \"No, poor dear; I never even thought about it.\" \"And since it all belongs to you, you have the right to handle it as you please. I wish for you to grant me permission to read all of Miss Lucy's papers and letters. Believe me, this is not mere curiosity. I have a purpose that I am sure she would have approved of. I have them all here. I took them before we knew everything was yours, so that no stranger's hand might touch them - no stranger's eye look through her words into her soul. I shall keep them, if I may; even you may not see them yet, but I will keep them safe. Not a single word shall be lost; and in due time, I shall return them to you. It is a difficult request I make, but you will grant it, won't you, for Lucy's sake?\" Arthur spoke out heartily, sounding like his former self, \"Dr. Van Helsing, you may do whatever you wish. I feel that by saying this, I am doing what my dear one would have approved. I will not trouble you with questions until the time comes.\" The old Professor stood up and said solemnly, \"And you are correct. There will be pain for all of us; but it will not be solely pain, nor will this pain be the last. We, and you too - you most of all, my dear boy - will have to pass through the difficult times before we reach the peace. But we must be brave-hearted and unselfish, and fulfil our duty, and all will be well!\" That night, I slept on a sofa in Arthur's room. Van Helsing did not go to bed at all. He paced back and forth continuously, as if guarding the house, and was never out of sight of the room where Lucy lay in her coffin, covered with wild garlic flowers, which, mingling with the scent of lily and rose, sent a heavy, overwhelming odour into the night air.",

Van Helsing was quiet throughout the meal, but after we had lit our cigars, he began to speak—\n\n\"Lord—\" but Arthur quickly stopped him,\n\n\"Please, not that, not yet—for God’s sake. Forgive me, sir, I didn’t mean to be rude; it’s just that my loss is still so fresh.\"\n\nThe Professor gently replied,\n\n\"I only used that title because I wasn’t sure what else to call you. I can’t refer to you as 'Mr.' anymore, and I’ve come to care for you—yes, my dear boy, to care for you deeply—as Arthur.\"\n\nArthur reached out and shook his hand warmly.\n\n\"Call me whatever you like,\" he said. \"I hope you will always consider me a friend. I cannot thank you enough for all you’ve done for my dear one.\" He paused and continued, \"I know she appreciated your kindness even more than I do, and if I seemed rude or ungrateful when you acted as you did then—you know the time—I hope you can forgive me.\"\n\nWith gentle seriousness, Van Helsing said,\n\n\"I understand it was difficult for you to trust me then, for trust sometimes requires understanding; and perhaps you don’t, or can’t, trust me fully now, because you don’t yet understand. There may be times ahead when I need you to trust me even though you cannot—and must not—yet fully grasp why. But one day, you will trust me completely, and all will be made clear, as if by sunlight. On that day, you’ll thank me for your own sake, for the sake of others, and especially for her, whom I promised to protect.\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir,\" Arthur replied warmly, \"I will always trust you. I believe in your goodness, you are a friend of Jack’s, and you were also her friend. You may do as you see fit.\"\n\nThe Professor cleared his throat a few times, as if preparing to say something important, and finally asked,\n\n\"May I ask you something now?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Are you aware that Mrs. Westenra left all her property to you?\"\n\n\"No, poor lady; I had not thought of it.\"\n\n\"Since it all belongs to you, you have the right to decide how to handle it. I would like your permission to read all of Miss Lucy’s letters and papers. I assure you it is not out of idle curiosity, but because I have a reason that she herself would have approved of. I have all her papers here. I took them before we knew they would belong to you, so that no stranger would have access to them. I’ll keep them safe for now, if you allow me; even you may not see them yet, but I will make sure nothing is lost. When the time is right, I’ll return them to you. I know it is a lot to ask, but will you do this for Lucy’s sake?\"\n\nArthur answered warmly, sounding like his old self,\n\n\"Dr. Van Helsing, you can do as you wish. I believe my dear one would agree with this, and I will not question you until the time comes.\"\n\nThe Professor stood up and said solemnly,\n\n\"You are right. There will be suffering for all of us, but it will not be endless, nor will it be the last pain we endure. We—including you especially, my dear boy—will have to endure hardship before finding peace. We must remain brave and selfless, and do what is right, and all will turn out well.\"\n\nThat night, I slept on a sofa in Arthur’s room. Van Helsing did not sleep at all; he paced the house, keeping watch, never straying far from the room where Lucy lay in her coffin, surrounded by wild garlic flowers, whose strong scent mingled with lilies and roses, filling the house with a heavy perfume."

          "text_segment": "Mina Harker’s Journal.\n22 September.—In the train to Exeter. Jonathan sleeping.\nIt seems only yesterday that the last entry was made, and yet how much between then, in Whitby and all the world before me, Jonathan away and no news of him; and now, married to Jonathan, Jonathan a solicitor, a partner, rich, master of his business, Mr. Hawkins dead and buried, and Jonathan with another attack that may harm him. Some day he may ask me about it. Down it all goes. I am rusty in my shorthand—see what unexpected prosperity does for us—so it may be as well to freshen it up again with an exercise anyhow....\nThe service was very simple and very solemn. There were only ourselves and the servants there, one or two old friends of his from Exeter, his London agent, and a gentleman representing Sir John Paxton, the President of the Incorporated Law Society. Jonathan and I stood hand in hand, and we felt that our best and dearest friend was gone from us....\nWe came back to town quietly, taking a ’bus to Hyde Park Corner. Jonathan thought it would interest me to go into the Row for a while, so we sat down; but there were very few people there, and it was sad-looking and desolate to see so many empty chairs. It made us think of the empty chair at home; so we got up and walked down Piccadilly. Jonathan was holding me by the arm, the way he used to in old days before I went to school. I felt it very improper, for you can’t go on for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the pedantry of it biting into yourself a bit; but it was Jonathan, and he was my husband, and we didn’t know anybody who saw us—and we didn’t care if they did—so on we walked. I was looking at a very beautiful girl, in a big cart-wheel hat, sitting in a victoria outside Guiliano’s, when I felt Jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt me, and he said under his breath: “My God!” I am always anxious about Jonathan, for I fear that some nervous fit may upset him again; so I turned to him quickly, and asked him what it was that disturbed him.\nHe was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as, half in terror and half in amazement, he gazed at a tall, thin man, with a beaky nose and black moustache and pointed beard, who was also observing the pretty girl. He was looking at her so hard that he did not see either of us, and so I had a good view of him. His face was not a good face; it was hard, and cruel, and sensual, and his big white teeth, that looked all the whiter because his lips were so red, were pointed like an animal’s. Jonathan kept staring at him, till I was afraid he would notice. I feared he might take it ill, he looked so fierce and nasty. I asked Jonathan why he was disturbed, and he answered, evidently thinking that I knew as much about it as he did: “Do you see who it is?”\n“No, dear,” I said; “I don’t know him; who is it?” His answer seemed to shock and thrill me, for it was said as if he did not know that it was to me, Mina, to whom he was speaking:—\n“It is the man himself!”\nThe poor dear was evidently terrified at something—very greatly terrified; I do believe that if he had not had me to lean on and to support him he would have sunk down. He kept staring; a man came out of the shop with a small parcel, and gave it to the lady, who then drove off. The dark man kept his eyes fixed on her, and when the carriage moved up Piccadilly he followed in the same direction, and hailed a hansom. Jonathan kept looking after him, and said, as if to himself:—\n“I believe it is the Count, but he has grown young. My God, if this be so! Oh, my God! my God! If I only knew! if I only knew!” He was distressing himself so much that I feared to keep his mind on the subject by asking him any questions, so I remained silent. I drew him away quietly, and he, holding my arm, came easily. We walked a little further, and then went in and sat for a while in the Green Park. It was a hot day for autumn, and there was a comfortable seat in a shady place. After a few minutes’ staring at nothing, Jonathan’s eyes closed, and he went quietly into a sleep, with his head on my shoulder. I thought it was the best thing for him, so did not disturb him. In about twenty minutes he woke up, and said to me quite cheerfully:—\n“Why, Mina, have I been asleep! Oh, do forgive me for being so rude. Come, and we’ll have a cup of tea somewhere.” He had evidently forgotten all about the dark stranger, as in his illness he had forgotten all that this episode had reminded him of. I don’t like this lapsing into forgetfulness; it may make or continue some injury to the brain. I must not ask him, for fear I shall do more harm than good; but I must somehow learn the facts of his journey abroad. The time is come, I fear, when I must open that parcel, and know what is written. Oh, Jonathan, you will, I know, forgive me if I do wrong, but it is for your own dear sake.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Mina Harker's Diary. September 22nd. Aboard the train en route to Exeter, while Jonathan sleeps. It feels as though the previous entry was just yesterday, yet so much has occurred since then, from being in Whitby with the future uncertain and no word from Jonathan, to now being married to him. Jonathan is a solicitor, a partner, financially secure, and in control of his professional life. Mr. Hawkins has passed away and been buried. However, Jonathan has suffered another episode of illness that worries me. Someday he might question me about these events. I must record everything. My shorthand skills have become rusty – an unforeseen consequence of our improved fortunes – so perhaps using it for this exercise is a good way to refresh them. The funeral service for Mr. Hawkins was understated but deeply solemn. Only we, the household staff, a couple of his old friends from Exeter, his London representative, and a man representing the President of the Incorporated Law Society were present. Jonathan and I stood together, hand in hand, feeling the profound loss of our closest and dearest friend. Afterwards, we returned quietly to the city, taking a bus to Hyde Park Corner. Jonathan thought a brief visit to the Row might interest me, so we found seats. However, there were hardly any people there, and the sight of so many empty chairs felt bleak and mournful. It reminded us of the empty chair awaiting us at home, prompting us to get up and walk towards Piccadilly. Jonathan held my arm, just as he used to in the old days before I attended school. It felt rather inappropriate to me, as after years of instructing other girls on proper behaviour, a degree of strictness about etiquette becomes ingrained in oneself. But it was Jonathan, my husband, and we saw no one we knew – nor did we care if anyone did – so we continued our walk. I was observing a very beautiful young woman wearing a large, wide-brimmed hat, seated in a victoria carriage outside Guiliano's, when Jonathan suddenly grasped my arm so tightly it pained me, whispering, \"My God!\" I am constantly concerned for Jonathan, fearing he might suffer another nervous collapse, so I turned to him immediately, asking what had upset him. He was extremely pale, and his eyes seemed to protrude as he stared, a mixture of terror and astonishment on his face, at a tall, slender man with a prominent, beaky nose, dark moustache, and a pointed beard, who was also watching the attractive girl. He was so focused on her that he didn't notice us, allowing me to get a clear look at him. His face was unpleasant; it looked hard, cruel, and lustful, and his large white teeth, which appeared even whiter against his very red lips, were sharply pointed, like those of an animal. Jonathan continued to stare at him, making me anxious that he might be observed. I worried the man might react negatively, given his fierce and menacing appearance. I asked Jonathan why he was troubled, and he responded, clearly assuming I understood the situation as well as he did: \"Do you see who that is?\" \"No, dear,\" I replied, \"I don't recognize him; who is it?\" His reply both shocked and disturbed me, spoken as if he wasn't even aware he was speaking to me, Mina: \"It is the very man!\" My poor husband was obviously terrified by something – profoundly terrified; I truly believe he would have collapsed if he hadn't been able to lean on and be supported by me. He kept staring. A man emerged from the shop with a small package and handed it to the lady, who then drove away. The dark-haired man kept his gaze fixed on her, and as her carriage moved up Piccadilly, he followed in the same direction and hailed a hansom cab. Jonathan kept watching after him, saying, as if to himself: \"I think it's the Count, but he looks younger. My God, if that's true! Oh, my God! my God! If only I knew! If only I knew!\" He was so distressed that I feared asking questions would only worsen his state, so I remained silent. I gently guided him away, and holding my arm, he came along easily. We walked a little further, then found a place to sit for a while in Green Park. It was unusually warm for autumn, and we found a comfortable, shady spot. After a few minutes of staring blankly into space, Jonathan's eyes closed, and he peacefully fell asleep with his head resting on my shoulder. I felt this was the best thing for him, so I didn't disturb him. After about twenty minutes, he woke up, saying quite cheerfully: \"Why, Mina, was I sleeping! Oh, please forgive me for being so impolite. Come, let's find somewhere to have a cup of tea.\" He had clearly forgotten all about the encounter with the mysterious stranger, just as his illness had erased the memories this incident had momentarily brought back. I dislike this tendency to forgetfulness; it might indicate or perpetuate some damage to his brain. I mustn't ask him directly, for fear of causing more harm than good. However, I must somehow uncover the truth about his journey abroad. I fear the time has come when I must open that package and read what is written inside. Oh, Jonathan, I know you will forgive me if this is wrong, but I must do it for your own dear sake.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Mina Harker’s Journal, September 22.—I'm on the train to Exeter while Jonathan sleeps beside me. It feels like just yesterday since I made my last journal entry, although so much has happened since then—my time in Whitby, waiting for Jonathan with no word from him; now we're married, Jonathan is successful in his work as a solicitor and partner, Mr. Hawkins has passed away, and Jonathan has suffered another attack which worries me. Perhaps he'll want to talk about it one day, so I want to record everything. My shorthand is a bit rusty—prosperity can be distracting—so I ought to practice it nonetheless.\n\nThe funeral service was simple and very solemn, with just Jonathan, me, some servants, a few of Mr. Hawkins's old friends, his London agent, and a representative from the Law Society. Jonathan and I held hands, mourning for the loss of a dear friend.\n\nWe returned to town quietly, riding a bus to Hyde Park Corner. Jonathan suggested we walk in the Row for a bit, but the park was nearly empty and felt lonely, reminding us of the loss at home. Trying to distract ourselves, we walked down Piccadilly. Jonathan, as he used to when we were younger, held my arm; I was self-conscious because of all the etiquette I've taught, but he was my husband and we no longer cared if anyone saw us.\n\nWhile I was admiring a beautiful young woman in a large hat sitting in a carriage, Jonathan suddenly gripped my arm tightly and gasped out \"My God!\" I worry so much about him, fearing for his nerves, so I quickly turned to see what had frightened him. Jonathan was pale and wide-eyed, staring at a tall, thin man with a sharp nose, black mustache, and pointed beard, who was looking intently at the young woman. The man's face seemed cruel and animal-like, with very white, pointed teeth and red lips. Jonathan continued to stare, and I worried the man might notice or react badly.\n\nWhen I asked Jonathan what was wrong, he replied as if I should know: “Do you see who it is?”\n\nI told him I did not know the man. Jonathan’s answer sent a chill through me: “It is the man himself!” He was so frightened, I think he would have collapsed if I had not been supporting him. We watched as a man brought a parcel out to the woman, who then left in her carriage, followed by the sinister-looking man. Jonathan watched after him, muttering to himself, “I believe it is the Count, but he has grown young. My God, if this is true! If I only knew!” He was so distressed that I decided not to question him more, hoping not to worsen his state. We walked on and sat in the Green Park, where Jonathan, exhausted, fell asleep on my shoulder. When he woke up about twenty minutes later, he seemed cheerful and had no recollection of the dark stranger or his earlier panic. Although relieved, I'm uneasy about his forgetfulness—it might signal further harm to his mind. I dare not ask him more for fear of making things worse, but I know I must look into his papers and uncover what happened during his trip abroad. Jonathan, please forgive me if this is wrong, but I do it for your sake."

          "text_segment": "Dr. Seward’s Diary.\n22 September.—It is all over. Arthur has gone back to Ring, and has taken Quincey Morris with him. What a fine fellow is Quincey! I believe in my heart of hearts that he suffered as much about Lucy’s death as any of us; but he bore himself through it like a moral Viking. If America can go on breeding men like that, she will be a power in the world indeed. Van Helsing is lying down, having a rest preparatory to his journey. He goes over to Amsterdam to-night, but says he returns to-morrow night; that he only wants to make some arrangements which can only be made personally. He is to stop with me then, if he can; he says he has work to do in London which may take him some time. Poor old fellow! I fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even his iron strength. All the time of the burial he was, I could see, putting some terrible restraint on himself. When it was all over, we were standing beside Arthur, who, poor fellow, was speaking of his part in the operation where his blood had been transfused to his Lucy’s veins; I could see Van Helsing’s face grow white and purple by turns. Arthur was saying that he felt since then as if they two had been really married and that she was his wife in the sight of God. None of us said a word of the other operations, and none of us ever shall. Arthur and Quincey went away together to the station, and Van Helsing and I came on here. The moment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular fit of hysterics. He has denied to me since that it was hysterics, and insisted that it was only his sense of humour asserting itself under very terrible conditions. He laughed till he cried, and I had to draw down the blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge; and then he cried, till he laughed again; and laughed and cried together, just as a woman does. I tried to be stern with him, as one is to a woman under the circumstances; but it had no effect. Men and women are so different in manifestations of nervous strength or weakness! Then when his face grew grave and stern again I asked him why his mirth, and why at such a time. His reply was in a way characteristic of him, for it was logical and forceful and mysterious. He said:—\n“Ah, you don’t comprehend, friend John. Do not think that I am not sad, though I laugh. See, I have cried even when the laugh did choke me. But no more think that I am all sorry when I cry, for the laugh he come just the same. Keep it always with you that laughter who knock at your door and say, ‘May I come in?’ is not the true laughter. No! he is a king, and he come when and how he like. He ask no person; he choose no time of suitability. He say, ‘I am here.’ Behold, in example I grieve my heart out for that so sweet young girl; I give my blood for her, though I am old and worn; I give my time, my skill, my sleep; I let my other sufferers want that so she may have all. And yet I can laugh at her very grave—laugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon her coffin and say ‘Thud! thud!’ to my heart, till it send back the blood from my cheek. My heart bleed for that poor boy—that dear boy, so of the age of mine own boy had I been so blessed that he live, and with his hair and eyes the same. There, you know now why I love him so. And yet when he say things that touch my husband-heart to the quick, and make my father-heart yearn to him as to no other man—not even to you, friend John, for we are more level in experiences than father and son—yet even at such moment King Laugh he come to me and shout and bellow in my ear, ‘Here I am! here I am!’ till the blood come dance back and bring some of the sunshine that he carry with him to my cheek. Oh, friend John, it is a strange world, a sad world, a world full of miseries, and woes, and troubles; and yet when King Laugh come he make them all dance to the tune he play. Bleeding hearts, and dry bones of the churchyard, and tears that burn as they fall—all dance together to the music that he make with that smileless mouth of him. And believe me, friend John, that he is good to come, and kind. Ah, we men and women are like ropes drawn tight with strain that pull us different ways. Then tears come; and, like the rain on the ropes, they brace us up, until perhaps the strain become too great, and we break. But King Laugh he come like the sunshine, and he ease off the strain again; and we bear to go on with our labour, what it may be.”\nI did not like to wound him by pretending not to see his idea; but, as I did not yet understand the cause of his laughter, I asked him. As he answered me his face grew stern, and he said in quite a different tone:—\n“Oh, it was the grim irony of it all—this so lovely lady garlanded with flowers, that looked so fair as life, till one by one we wondered if she were truly dead; she laid in that so fine marble house in that lonely churchyard, where rest so many of her kin, laid there with the mother who loved her, and whom she loved; and that sacred bell going ‘Toll! toll! toll!’ so sad and slow; and those holy men, with the white garments of the angel, pretending to read books, and yet all the time their eyes never on the page; and all of us with the bowed head. And all for what? She is dead; so! Is it not?”\n“Well, for the life of me, Professor,” I said, “I can’t see anything to laugh at in all that. Why, your explanation makes it a harder puzzle than before. But even if the burial service was comic, what about poor Art and his trouble? Why, his heart was simply breaking.”\n“Just so. Said he not that the transfusion of his blood to her veins had made her truly his bride?”\n“Yes, and it was a sweet and comforting idea for him.”\n“Quite so. But there was a difficulty, friend John. If so that, then what about the others? Ho, ho! Then this so sweet maid is a polyandrist, and me, with my poor wife dead to me, but alive by Church’s law, though no wits, all gone—even I, who am faithful husband to this now-no-wife, am bigamist.”\n“I don’t see where the joke comes in there either!” I said; and I did not feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things. He laid his hand on my arm, and said:—\n“Friend John, forgive me if I pain. I showed not my feeling to others when it would wound, but only to you, my old friend, whom I can trust. If you could have looked into my very heart then when I want to laugh; if you could have done so when the laugh arrived; if you could do so now, when King Laugh have pack up his crown, and all that is to him—for he go far, far away from me, and for a long, long time—maybe you would perhaps pity me the most of all.”\nI was touched by the tenderness of his tone, and asked why.\n“Because I know!”\nAnd now we are all scattered; and for many a long day loneliness will sit over our roofs with brooding wings. Lucy lies in the tomb of her kin, a lordly death-house in a lonely churchyard, away from teeming London; where the air is fresh, and the sun rises over Hampstead Hill, and where wild flowers grow of their own accord.\nSo I can finish this diary; and God only knows if I shall ever begin another. If I do, or if I even open this again, it will be to deal with different people and different themes; for here at the end, where the romance of my life is told, ere I go back to take up the thread of my life-work, I say sadly and without hope,\n“FINIS.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Dr. Seward’s Journal. September 22nd.—Everything is now concluded. Arthur has gone back to his estate, Ring, with Quincey Morris accompanying him. Quincey is truly an exceptional person! I honestly believe he grieved over Lucy’s death as deeply as any of us; yet, he endured it with the resolve of a principled Viking. If America continues to produce men like him, it will indeed become a formidable global power. Van Helsing is resting up in preparation for his trip. He is traveling to Amsterdam tonight but plans to return tomorrow night; he mentioned needing to make some arrangements that require his personal presence. He intends to stay with me if possible, stating he has work in London that may take some time. Poor dear fellow! I worry that the strain of the past week has exhausted even his formidable strength. During the entire burial service, I could clearly see him exercising a tremendous effort to control himself. After it was all finished, we were standing by Arthur, who, heartbroken, was speaking of his involvement in the procedure where his blood was given to Lucy; I watched Van Helsing’s face turn alternately white and purple. Arthur was saying that since then he felt as though they were genuinely married and that she was his wife in God’s eyes. None of us mentioned the other blood transfusions, and none of us ever will. Arthur and Quincey departed together for the station, and Van Helsing and I returned here. The moment we were alone in the carriage, he broke down in a fit of intense hysterics. He has since denied to me that it was hysterics, insisting it was merely his sense of humor asserting itself under extremely difficult circumstances. He laughed until he cried, and I had to pull down the window blinds so no one would see us and misunderstand; then he cried until he laughed again; and laughed and cried simultaneously, just like a woman might. I tried to be firm with him, as one would with a woman in that state; but it had no effect. Men and women certainly display nervous strength or weakness so differently! Then, when his expression became serious and composed again, I asked him why he was laughing, and why at such a moment. His answer was characteristic of him, for it was both logical, impactful, and mysterious. He said:—\n\n“Ah, you do not understand, my friend John. Do not think I am not sad, even though I laugh. Look, I have cried even when laughter choked me. But do not think either that I am entirely sad when I cry, for the laughter arrives just the same. Always remember that laughter that politely knocks at your door and asks, ‘May I enter?’ is not true laughter. No! It is a monarch, and it comes whenever and however it pleases. It does not seek permission; it selects no suitable moment. It declares, ‘I am here.’ See, for example, I grieve deeply for that sweet young girl; I gave my blood for her, though I am old and tired; I gave my time, my expertise, my sleep; I allowed my other suffering patients to wait so she could have everything. And yet I can laugh at her very grave—laugh when the soil from the sexton’s shovel drops onto her coffin and says ‘Thud! thud!’ to my heart, until it drains the blood from my cheeks. My heart aches for that poor boy—that dear boy, so close to the age my own son would have been if I had been blessed enough for him to live, and with the same hair and eyes. There, now you know why I love him so deeply. And yet, when he says things that pierce my core as a husband, and make my fatherly heart yearn for him more than anyone else—not even you, friend John, for our experiences are more similar than father and son—yet even in such moments King Laugh comes to me and roars and bellows in my ear, ‘Here I am! here I am!’ until the blood rushes back and brings some of the radiance he carries with him to my cheeks. Oh, friend John, it is a strange world, a sorrowful world, a world filled with pain, and misery, and troubles; and yet when King Laugh comes he makes them all dance to his tune. Aching hearts, the dry bones of the graveyard, and tears that burn as they fall—all dance together to the music made by his smileless mouth. And believe me, friend John, it is good and kind of him to come. Ah, we men and women are like ropes pulled taut by stresses pulling us in different directions. Then tears come; and, like rain on the ropes, they strengthen us, until perhaps the strain becomes too great, and we snap. But King Laugh comes like sunshine, and he eases the tension again; and we are able to continue our work, whatever it may be.”\n\nI did not want to hurt him by pretending not to grasp his idea; but, as I still did not understand the specific reason for his laughter, I asked him directly. As he replied, his face became stern, and he spoke in a completely different tone:—\n\n“Oh, it was the cruel irony of it all—this beautiful lady adorned with flowers, who looked so alive, until one by one we wondered if she was truly dead; she was laid in that magnificent marble structure in that solitary churchyard, where so many of her relatives rest, laid there with the mother who loved her, and whom she loved; and that sacred bell tolling ‘Toll! toll! toll!’ so mournfully and slowly; and those holy men, in the white robes of angels, appearing to read from books, and yet all the while their eyes were never on the page; and all of us with our heads bowed. And what was it all for? She is dead; is that not so?”\n\n“Well, for the life of me, Professor,” I said, “I cannot see anything at all to laugh at in that. Why, your explanation makes it even more puzzling than before. But even if the burial service was somehow comical, what about poor Art and his sorrow? His heart was utterly broken.”\n\n“Precisely. Did he not say that the transfer of his blood to her veins had truly made her his bride?”\n\n“Yes, and it was a tender and comforting thought for him.”\n\n“Quite so. But there was a complication, friend John. If that were true, then what about the others? Ho, ho! Then this sweet young woman is a polyandrist, and I, with my poor wife dead to me, but legally alive by the Church’s law, though completely out of her mind—even I, who am a devoted husband to this now-absent wife, am a bigamist.”\n\n“I still don’t see where the joke is there either!” I stated; and I was not particularly pleased with him for saying such things. He placed his hand on my arm and said:—\n\n“Friend John, please forgive me if I cause pain. I did not show my feelings to others where it would hurt them, but only to you, my old friend, whom I can trust. If you could have looked into my deepest heart then when I felt the urge to laugh; if you could have done so when the laughter erupted; if you could do so now, when King Laugh has departed with his crown and everything he embodies—for he has gone far, far away from me, and for a very long time—perhaps you would pity me the most of all.”\n\nI was moved by the kindness in his tone and asked why.\n\n“Because I know!”\n\nAnd now we are all dispersed; and for a long time to come, loneliness will settle over our homes like a brooding presence. Lucy rests in her family’s tomb, a magnificent resting place in a quiet graveyard, away from the bustling city of London; where the air is clean, and the sun rises over Hampstead Hill, and where wild flowers grow on their own. So I can conclude this journal; and only God knows if I will ever start another. If I do, or if I even open this one again, it will be to write about different people and different matters; for here at the end, where the significant part of my life story is told, before I return to my professional work, I write sadly and without hope,\n\n“THE END.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Dr. Seward’s Diary. 22 September.—Everything is finished now. Arthur has returned to Ring, taking Quincey Morris with him. Quincey is truly a remarkable man; I honestly believe he felt the loss of Lucy as deeply as any of us, but managed to get through it with the fortitude of a heroic Viking. If America continues to produce men like him, it will truly become a great power in the world. Van Helsing is resting now before traveling to Amsterdam tonight; he says he’ll be back by tomorrow evening, as he needs to arrange something in person. He plans to stay with me for a while, as he has work to do in London that may take some time. The past week seems to have finally overwhelmed even his formidable strength. During the funeral, I could see him constantly keeping himself under strict control. When it was over, as we stood with Arthur—who spoke movingly about having given his blood to Lucy and how it connected them as if they were truly married—I saw Van Helsing’s face change color with emotion. We never mentioned the other transfusions and we never will. Arthur and Quincey left together for the station, while Van Helsing and I went elsewhere. Once alone, Van Helsing broke down in a fit of uncontrolled emotion—he called it his sense of humor expressing itself under terrible circumstances, though it looked like hysterics to me. He alternated between laughing and crying, sometimes doing both at once, much as a distressed woman might. I tried to admonish him gently, but it had no effect. People show their emotional strength and weakness in very different ways. When he became serious again, I asked him about his laughter, especially at such a difficult time. He replied, characteristically blending logic with mystery, that laughter comes of its own accord, asking no one's permission. He explained that he deeply mourned Lucy, having given his time, energy, and even blood for her, and yet, even at her grave, laughter could seize him, if only for a moment, bringing slight relief from grief. He likened laughter to a king that arrives unexpectedly, offering respite amid suffering; in a world full of sadness and heartbreak, laughter lightens burdens. He said men and women are like tightly pulled ropes strained in different directions; tears can strengthen us for a while, but sunshine—laughter—relieves the tension so we can carry on. I tried to understand, but still didn’t see the humor. Van Helsing explained further, pointing out the bitter irony in Lucy’s beautiful funeral: the lovely young woman, gracefully laid to rest among her ancestors, the solemn bells, the priests reading, and all the mourners present—yet he felt a grim irony in it all. When I questioned further, especially about Arthur’s pain, Van Helsing referred to Arthur’s idea that giving his blood made him Lucy’s husband, but noted dryly that by that measure, Lucy was wed to several men, even himself—a rather jarring thought, which he shared only with me in confidence. If I could see straight into his heart, he said, I’d probably pity him more than anyone, for he truly suffered. Now, all of us have gone our separate ways, and loneliness will hang over us for many days to come. Lucy is at rest in her family’s tomb, far from busy London, among wildflowers and fresh air. Thus I end this diary, and God alone knows if I will write in it again. If I do, it will be about other people and other matters, for the chapter of my life chronicled here is closed. With little hope and great sadness, I write: “The End.”"

          "text_segment": "“The Westminster Gazette,” 25 September.\nA HAMPSTEAD MYSTERY.\nThe neighbourhood of Hampstead is just at present exercised with a series of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of what was known to the writers of headlines as “The Kensington Horror,” or “The Stabbing Woman,” or “The Woman in Black.” During the past two or three days several cases have occurred of young children straying from home or neglecting to return from their playing on the Heath. In all these cases the children were too young to give any properly intelligible account of themselves, but the consensus of their excuses is that they had been with a “bloofer lady.” It has always been late in the evening when they have been missed, and on two occasions the children have not been found until early in the following morning. It is generally supposed in the neighbourhood that, as the first child missed gave as his reason for being away that a “bloofer lady” had asked him to come for a walk, the others had picked up the phrase and used it as occasion served. This is the more natural as the favourite game of the little ones at present is luring each other away by wiles. A correspondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending to be the “bloofer lady” is supremely funny. Some of our caricaturists might, he says, take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing the reality and the picture. It is only in accordance with general principles of human nature that the “bloofer lady” should be the popular rôle at these al fresco performances. Our correspondent naïvely says that even Ellen Terry could not be so winningly attractive as some of these grubby-faced little children pretend—and even imagine themselves—to be.\nThere is, however, possibly a serious side to the question, for some of the children, indeed all who have been missed at night, have been slightly torn or wounded in the throat. The wounds seem such as might be made by a rat or a small dog, and although of not much importance individually, would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has a system or method of its own. The police of the division have been instructed to keep a sharp look-out for straying children, especially when very young, in and around Hampstead Heath, and for any stray dog which may be about.\n“The Westminster Gazette,” 25 September.\nExtra Special.\nTHE HAMPSTEAD HORROR.\nANOTHER CHILD INJURED.\nThe “Bloofer Lady.”\nWe have just received intelligence that another child, missed last night, was only discovered late in the morning under a furze bush at the Shooter’s Hill side of Hampstead Heath, which is, perhaps, less frequented than the other parts. It has the same tiny wound in the throat as has been noticed in other cases. It was terribly weak, and looked quite emaciated. It too, when partially restored, had the common story to tell of being lured away by the “bloofer lady.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "According to \"The Westminster Gazette\" on September 25th, the Hampstead area is currently dealing with a series of perplexing incidents, similar in nature to previous notorious events known as \"The Kensington Horror\" or \"The Stabbing Woman.\" Over the past few days, several young children have either wandered off or failed to return home from playing on Hampstead Heath. These children are all too young to provide clear, detailed accounts, but their stories consistently mention being with a \"bloofer lady.\" They were always reported missing late in the evening, and on two occasions, were not located until the following morning. The local belief is that after the first child used the \"bloofer lady\" excuse, others adopted the phrase, perhaps incorporating it into their current favourite game of luring each other away playfully. A correspondent notes that watching the little ones impersonate the \"bloofer lady\" is quite humorous, suggesting it offers a lesson in ironic grotesque for caricaturists by highlighting the contrast between the playful imitation and the potentially grim reality. The correspondent adds, somewhat amusingly, that even the renowned actress Ellen Terry couldn't be as captivatingly charming as these often-dirty-faced children imagine themselves to be in this role. However, there may be a more serious side, as some children—specifically those found after dark—have had small wounds or tears on their throats. These injuries resemble bites from a rat or a small dog and, while minor individually, suggest a systematic or methodical pattern by whatever caused them. Police in the district have been ordered to diligently watch for young children straying, especially near Hampstead Heath, and also to look out for any potentially involved stray dogs.\n\nA later \"Extra Special\" report from \"The Westminster Gazette\" on the same day adds another disturbing incident. Another child, who disappeared the previous night, was discovered late that morning hidden under a furze bush on the less frequented Shooter's Hill section of Hampstead Heath. This child also exhibited the characteristic small throat wound seen in the other cases and was found in a state of extreme weakness and emaciation. Upon partial recovery, this child too recounted the shared tale of being drawn away by the \"bloofer lady.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "From \"The Westminster Gazette,\" dated September 25th: \n\nA Mystery in Hampstead.\n\nResidents in Hampstead are currently unsettled by a series of incidents resembling infamous cases once dubbed by the press as \"The Kensington Horror,\" \"The Stabbing Woman,\" and \"The Woman in Black.\" Over the last few days, a number of young children have either wandered away from home or failed to return from their playtime on the Heath. These children, being very young, have not provided clear explanations for their disappearances, though they commonly claim they had been with a \"bloofer lady.\" The children often go missing late in the day, with a couple only being located early the next morning. Locals suppose that, since the first missing child said that a \"bloofer lady\" invited him on a walk, the others have copied the phrase. This seems especially likely because the current favorite game among these children is to tempt each other away with tricks, and some are even parodying the \"bloofer lady\" while playing, which a correspondent finds particularly amusing. He remarks that any caricaturist could learn from seeing these children act out the role, and that their performances can outshine even the famous actress Ellen Terry for charm and appeal, despite their dirty faces and imaginations.\n\nStill, a more serious concern arises as all the children who have gone missing at night have been found with slight tears or wounds on their necks. The injuries resemble the bites of a rat or small dog; individually not dangerous, but their similarity suggests a deliberate method. Police have been instructed to vigilantly watch for lost children, especially the younger ones, around Hampstead Heath, as well as for wandering dogs.\n\nAnother segment from \"The Westminster Gazette,\" also dated September 25th:\n\nExtra News: The Hampstead Horror—Another Child Injured by the \"Bloofer Lady.\"\n\nLatest reports say that another child, missing the previous night, was found badly weakened and thin under a furze bush on the Shooter’s Hill side of Hampstead Heath, a less frequented area. This child had the same small throat wound seen in previous cases. Once revived, the child also insisted that the \"bloofer lady\" had lured them away."

I wonder if there is any truth to what he wrote—did his brain fever cause those horrors, or was there some real reason behind it? I am not sure I’ll ever know because I can’t bring myself to ask. Yet, the man we saw yesterday believed him completely... perhaps the funeral brought back painful memories for Jonathan. He truly believes in what he wrote.

That is the reason of his coming; it is concerning Lucy and her sleep-walking, and not about Jonathan. Then I shall never know the real truth now! How silly I am. That awful journal gets hold of my imagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour. Of course it is about Lucy. That habit came back to the poor dear, and that awful night on the cliff must have made her ill. I had almost forgotten in my own affairs how ill she was afterwards. She must have told him of her sleep-walking adventure on the cliff, and that I knew all about it; and now he wants me to tell him what she knows, so that he may understand.

His purpose for coming is actually related to Lucy and her sleepwalking issues, not Jonathan. This means I won't get to the bottom of the situation after all! How foolish I'm being. That horrifying journal is capturing my imagination and making everything seem tainted by its unsettling tone. Naturally, the visit is about Lucy.

I also hope Dr. Van Helsing doesn't hold me responsible; I've been under so much strain and worry lately that I don't feel capable of enduring any more pressure right now. Perhaps a good cry helps everyone sometimes—it clears the air, much like rain does.

If I had not read Jonathan’s journal first, I should never have accepted even a possibility. Poor, poor, dear Jonathan! How he must have suffered. Please the good God, all this may not upset him again. I shall try to save him from it; but it may be even a consolation and a help to him—terrible though it be and awful in its consequences—to know for certain that his eyes and ears and brain did not deceive him, and that it is all true. It may be that it is the doubt which haunts him; that when the doubt is removed, no matter which—waking or dreaming—may prove the truth, he will be more satisfied and better able to bear the shock. Dr. Van Helsing must be a good man as well as a clever one if he is Arthur’s friend and Dr. Seward’s, and if they brought him all the way from Holland to look after Lucy. I feel from having seen him that he is good and kind and of a noble nature. When he comes to-morrow I shall ask him about Jonathan; and then, please God, all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a good end. I used to think I would like to practise interviewing; Jonathan’s friend on “The Exeter News” told him that memory was everything in such work—that you must be able to put down exactly almost every word spoken, even if you had to refine some of it afterwards. Here was a rare interview; I shall try to record it verbatim.\nIt was half-past two o’clock when the knock came. I took my courage à deux mains and waited. In a few minutes Mary opened the door, and announced “Dr. Van Helsing.”\nI rose and bowed, and he came towards me; a man of medium weight, strongly built, with his shoulders set back over a broad, deep chest and a neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck. The poise of the head strikes one at once as indicative of thought and power; the head is noble, well-sized, broad, and large behind the ears. The face, clean-shaven, shows a hard, square chin, a large, resolute, mobile mouth, a good-sized nose, rather straight, but with quick, sensitive nostrils, that seem to broaden as the big, bushy brows come down and the mouth tightens. The forehead is broad and fine, rising at first almost straight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart; such a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it, but falls naturally back and to the sides. Big, dark blue eyes are set widely apart, and are quick and tender or stern with the man’s moods. He said to me:—\n“Mrs. Harker, is it not?” I bowed assent.\n“That was Miss Mina Murray?” Again I assented.\n“It is Mina Murray that I came to see that was friend of that poor dear child Lucy Westenra. Madam Mina, it is on account of the dead I come.”\n“Sir,” I said, “you could have no better claim on me than that you were a friend and helper of Lucy Westenra.” And I held out my hand. He took it and said tenderly:—\n“Oh, Madam Mina, I knew that the friend of that poor lily girl must be good, but I had yet to learn——” He finished his speech with a courtly bow. I asked him what it was that he wanted to see me about, so he at once began:—\n“I have read your letters to Miss Lucy. Forgive me, but I had to begin to inquire somewhere, and there was none to ask. I know that you were with her at Whitby. She sometimes kept a diary—you need not look surprised, Madam Mina; it was begun after you had left, and was in imitation of you—and in that diary she traces by inference certain things to a sleep-walking in which she puts down that you saved her. In great perplexity then I come to you, and ask you out of your so much kindness to tell me all of it that you can remember.”\n“I can tell you, I think, Dr. Van Helsing, all about it.”\n“Ah, then you have good memory for facts, for details? It is not always so with young ladies.”\n“No, doctor, but I wrote it all down at the time. I can show it to you if you like.”\n“Oh, Madam Mina, I will be grateful; you will do me much favour.” I could not resist the temptation of mystifying him a bit—I suppose it is some of the taste of the original apple that remains still in our mouths—so I handed him the shorthand diary. He took it with a grateful bow, and said:—\n“May I read it?”\n“If you wish,” I answered as demurely as I could. He opened it, and for an instant his face fell. Then he stood up and bowed.\n“Oh, you so clever woman!” he said. “I knew long that Mr. Jonathan was a man of much thankfulness; but see, his wife have all the good things. And will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me? Alas! I know not the shorthand.” By this time my little joke was over, and I was almost ashamed; so I took the typewritten copy from my workbasket and handed it to him.\n“Forgive me,” I said: “I could not help it; but I had been thinking that it was of dear Lucy that you wished to ask, and so that you might not have time to wait—not on my account, but because I know your time must be precious—I have written it out on the typewriter for you.”\nHe took it and his eyes glistened. “You are so good,” he said. “And may I read it now? I may want to ask you some things when I have read.”\n“By all means,” I said, “read it over whilst I order lunch; and then you can ask me questions whilst we eat.” He bowed and settled himself in a chair with his back to the light, and became absorbed in the papers, whilst I went to see after lunch chiefly in order that he might not be disturbed. When I came back, I found him walking hurriedly up and down the room, his face all ablaze with excitement. He rushed up to me and took me by both hands.\n“Oh, Madam Mina,” he said, “how can I say what I owe to you? This paper is as sunshine. It opens the gate to me. I am daze, I am dazzle, with so much light, and yet clouds roll in behind the light every time. But that you do not, cannot, comprehend. Oh, but I am grateful to you, you so clever woman. Madam”—he said this very solemnly—“if ever Abraham Van Helsing can do anything for you or yours, I trust you will let me know. It will be pleasure and delight if I may serve you as a friend; as a friend, but all I have ever learned, all I can ever do, shall be for you and those you love. There are darknesses in life, and there are lights; you are one of the lights. You will have happy life and good life, and your husband will be blessed in you.”\n“But, doctor, you praise me too much, and—and you do not know me.”\n“Not know you—I, who am old, and who have studied all my life men and women; I, who have made my specialty the brain and all that belongs to him and all that follow from him! And I have read your diary that you have so goodly written for me, and which breathes out truth in every line. I, who have read your so sweet letter to poor Lucy of your marriage and your trust, not know you! Oh, Madam Mina, good women tell all their lives, and by day and by hour and by minute, such things that angels can read; and we men who wish to know have in us something of angels’ eyes. Your husband is noble nature, and you are noble too, for you trust, and trust cannot be where there is mean nature. And your husband—tell me of him. Is he quite well? Is all that fever gone, and is he strong and hearty?” I saw here an opening to ask him about Jonathan, so I said:—\n“He was almost recovered, but he has been greatly upset by Mr. Hawkins’s death.” He interrupted:—\n“Oh, yes, I know, I know. I have read your last two letters.” I went on:—\n“I suppose this upset him, for when we were in town on Thursday last he had a sort of shock.”\n“A shock, and after brain fever so soon! That was not good. What kind of a shock was it?”\n“He thought he saw some one who recalled something terrible, something which led to his brain fever.” And here the whole thing seemed to overwhelm me in a rush. The pity for Jonathan, the horror which he experienced, the whole fearful mystery of his diary, and the fear that has been brooding over me ever since, all came in a tumult. I suppose I was hysterical, for I threw myself on my knees and held up my hands to him, and implored him to make my husband well again. He took my hands and raised me up, and made me sit on the sofa, and sat by me; he held my hand in his, and said to me with, oh, such infinite sweetness:—\n“My life is a barren and lonely one, and so full of work that I have not had much time for friendships; but since I have been summoned to here by my friend John Seward I have known so many good people and seen such nobility that I feel more than ever—and it has grown with my advancing years—the loneliness of my life. Believe, me, then, that I come here full of respect for you, and you have given me hope—hope, not in what I am seeking of, but that there are good women still left to make life happy—good women, whose lives and whose truths may make good lesson for the children that are to be. I am glad, glad, that I may here be of some use to you; for if your husband suffer, he suffer within the range of my study and experience. I promise you that I will gladly do all for him that I can—all to make his life strong and manly, and your life a happy one. Now you must eat. You are overwrought and perhaps over-anxious. Husband Jonathan would not like to see you so pale; and what he like not where he love, is not to his good. Therefore for his sake you must eat and smile. You have told me all about Lucy, and so now we shall not speak of it, lest it distress. I shall stay in Exeter to-night, for I want to think much over what you have told me, and when I have thought I will ask you questions, if I may. And then, too, you will tell me of husband Jonathan’s trouble so far as you can, but not yet. You must eat now; afterwards you shall tell me all.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Later, after Van Helsing left, Mina recorded her thoughts. It was a strange encounter that left her head spinning, feeling as though she were in a dream. She wondered if it could possibly be real. Only having read Jonathan’s journal beforehand allowed her to entertain the possibility. She felt deeply for Jonathan’s suffering and prayed that this new information wouldn't cause him further distress. She intended to protect him but also considered that knowing the truth, no matter how terrible, might bring him some comfort and validation, confirming his experiences weren't delusions. She hoped removing the uncertainty would help him cope better. Mina believed Dr. Van Helsing must be a good and intelligent man, given he was a friend to Arthur Holmwood and Dr. Seward, and was brought from Holland to care for Lucy. Her personal impression of him upon meeting solidified this belief; she felt he was kind, good, and inherently noble. She planned to ask him about Jonathan the next day, hoping this period of sadness and worry would ultimately have a positive outcome. Recalling how she once considered practicing interviewing, where, as Jonathan’s journalist friend advised, memory was key – needing to transcribe almost every word spoken, even if edited later – she decided this rare interview with Van Helsing warranted a precise record.At half-past two, the expected knock came. Summoning all her courage, she waited. A few minutes later, her maid, Mary, announced, “Dr. Van Helsing.”Mina stood and bowed as he approached. He was a man of average build but strong, with broad shoulders, a deep chest, and a head well-proportioned on his neck. His head's posture immediately conveyed intelligence and strength; it was well-shaped, broad, and large behind the ears. His face, clean-shaven, featured a strong, square jaw, a large, determined, expressive mouth, a good-sized, rather straight nose with quick, sensitive nostrils that seemed to widen when his large, bushy eyebrows lowered and his mouth tightened. His forehead was broad and fine, rising almost vertically before sloping back above two distinct ridges. His reddish hair naturally fell back and to the sides, unable to cover the prominent forehead. His large, dark blue eyes were set wide apart, reflecting his moods – quick and tender or stern.He addressed her, “Mrs. Harker, is it not?” She confirmed with a bow. “That was Miss Mina Murray?” She assented again. “It is Mina Murray I came to see, who was a friend of that poor dear child, Lucy Westenra. Madam Mina, I come concerning the deceased.” “Sir,” she replied, “you could have no stronger claim on my attention than being a friend and helper to Lucy Westenra.” She extended her hand. He took it gently and said, “Oh, Madam Mina, I knew that the friend of that poor lily girl must be good, but I had yet to learn——” He finished with a formal bow. She asked what he wished to see her about, and he began immediately: “I have read your letters to Miss Lucy. Forgive me, but I had to start my inquiry somewhere, and there was no one else to ask. I know you were with her at Whitby. She sometimes kept a diary—please do not look surprised, Madam Mina; it was started after you left, in imitation of you—and in that diary, she infers certain events were connected to sleepwalking during which, she notes, you saved her. It is with great confusion, then, that I come to you and ask you, with your abundant kindness, to tell me everything you can recall.” “I believe I can tell you everything about it, Dr. Van Helsing.” “Ah, then you possess a good memory for facts, for details? This is not always the case with young ladies.” “No, Doctor, but I wrote it all down at the time. I can show it to you if you wish.” “Oh, Madam Mina, I would be most grateful; you would be doing me a great kindness.” She couldn't resist a small bit of teasing—perhaps, she thought, a lingering taste of the original apple remains in human nature—so she handed him her diary written in shorthand. He accepted it with a grateful bow and asked, “May I read it?” “If you desire,” she replied as innocently as she could. He opened it, and for a moment, his face fell. Then he stood and bowed. “Oh, you are so clever, woman!” he exclaimed. “I have long known Mr. Jonathan is a man of great gratitude; but see, his wife possesses all good qualities. And will you not grant me such honour and help me by reading it for me? Alas! I do not understand the shorthand.” By this point, her little joke was over, and she felt slightly embarrassed. She retrieved the typewritten copy from her sewing basket and gave it to him. “Forgive me,” she said, “I couldn’t help it; but I had been thinking that you wished to ask about dear Lucy, and so that you might not have to wait—not on my account, but because I know your time must be valuable—I have typed it out for you.” He took it, his eyes sparkling. “You are so kind,” he said. “And may I read it now? I may wish to ask you some questions after I have read it.” “By all means,” she said. “Please read it while I arrange for lunch; then you can ask me questions as we eat.” He bowed and settled into a chair with his back to the light, becoming engrossed in the papers, while she went to oversee lunch preparations, mainly to ensure he wouldn't be interrupted. When she returned, she found him pacing rapidly around the room, his face radiant with excitement. He rushed over, taking both her hands. “Oh, Madam Mina,” he said, “how can I express my debt to you? This document is like sunshine. It opens a path for me. I am stunned, I am dazzled by so much light, and yet clouds gather behind the light every time. But that is something you do not, cannot, understand. Oh, but I am thankful to you, you so intelligent woman. Madam”—he spoke very seriously—“if Abraham Van Helsing can ever do anything for you or yours, I trust you will let me know. It would be a pleasure and a joy to serve you as a friend; as a friend, but everything I have ever learned, everything I can ever do, shall be for you and those you love. There are dark parts in life, and there are bright parts; you are one of the lights. You will have a happy life and a good life, and your husband will be fortunate to have you.” “But, Doctor, you praise me too much, and—and you do not know me.” “Not know you—I, who am old, and have spent my life studying men and women; I, who have specialized in the brain and all that pertains to it and all that results from it! And I have read your diary, which you have so thoughtfully written for me, and which breathes truth in every line. I, who have read your sweet letter to poor Lucy about your marriage and your faith, not know you! Oh, Madam Mina, good women live lives, day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute, in a way that angels can perceive; and we men who seek knowledge possess something of angels' sight. Your husband has a noble spirit, and you are noble too, for you possess trust, and trust cannot exist where there is a base nature. And your husband—tell me about him. Is he completely well? Has all that fever subsided, and is he strong and vigorous?” Seeing an opportunity to inquire about Jonathan, she said, “He was almost fully recovered, but he has been greatly distressed by Mr. Hawkins’s death.” He interrupted: “Oh, yes, I know, I know. I have read your last two letters.” She continued: “I suppose this upset him, because when we were in town last Thursday, he had a kind of shock.” “A shock, and so soon after brain fever! That was not good. What sort of shock was it?” “He thought he saw someone who reminded him of something terrible, something that led to his brain fever.” At this point, the full weight of the situation seemed to overcome her in a rush. Pity for Jonathan, the horror he endured, the entire terrifying mystery of his diary, and the fear that had overshadowed her ever since—all came surging forward. She supposed she became hysterical, for she fell to her knees, raised her hands to him, and begged him to restore her husband’s health. He took her hands, helped her up, and guided her to sit on the sofa beside him; he held her hand and spoke to her with infinite tenderness: “My life is solitary and barren, and so filled with work that I have not had much time for friendships; but since my friend John Seward called me here, I have met so many good people and witnessed such nobility that I feel more strongly than ever—and this feeling has grown with my advancing years—the loneliness of my life. Believe me, then, that I come here with great respect for you, and you have given me hope—hope, not in the goal I am pursuing, but hope that good women still exist to make life happy—good women whose lives and truths can serve as good lessons for future children. I am glad, glad, that I may be of some help to you here; for if your husband suffers, his suffering falls within the scope of my study and expertise. I promise you that I will gladly do everything I can for him—everything to make his life strong and manly, and your life a happy one. Now, you must eat. You are overly emotional and perhaps too anxious. Your husband Jonathan would not like to see you so pale; and what he dislikes in someone he loves is not good for him. Therefore, for his sake, you must eat and smile. You have told me everything about Lucy, so we will not speak of it anymore, lest it cause distress. I shall stay in Exeter tonight, for I need to think deeply about what you have told me, and after I have thought, I will ask you questions, if I may. And then, too, you will tell me about your husband Jonathan’s trouble, as much as you can, but not yet. You must eat now; afterwards, you shall tell me everything.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Later.—He has been and gone. The meeting was so unusual that I feel dizzy, as if I’m dreaming. Is any of this really possible? If I hadn’t read Jonathan’s journal, I would never have believed even a small part of it. Poor Jonathan, he must have been through so much. God willing, I hope this won’t trouble him again. I’ll do my best to protect him; but perhaps knowing these incredible things for certain—even though they’re dreadful—will reassure him. Maybe his worst torment is his uncertainty, and if that is resolved, he might bear the truth better. Dr. Van Helsing must be a good and wise man: he’s friends with Arthur and Dr. Seward, and they brought him from Holland to help Lucy. From meeting him, I can sense his goodness and kindness. When he visits tomorrow, I’ll discuss Jonathan with him, and hopefully, all our pain and worry will have a positive outcome. I used to think of interviewing as a skill; Jonathan’s friend said it’s crucial to remember everything, even to refine it later. This was certainly an extraordinary interview, and I’ll try to set it all down as it happened.\n\nIt was half-past two when someone knocked. I gathered my courage and waited. Mary soon announced Dr. Van Helsing. I greeted him politely. He’s a medium-sized, solid man with a powerful build and a head that immediately suggests intelligence and strength. His face, smooth-shaven, has a firm jaw, a large expressive mouth, and a good-sized straight nose, with alert nostrils that seem to move when his heavy brows come down. His wide, high forehead is so shaped that his reddish hair falls away from it. His large, deep blue eyes are very expressive, kind or stern with his mood. He addressed me:\n\n“You’re Mrs. Harker, aren’t you?” I nodded. \n\n“You used to be Miss Mina Murray?” I nodded again.\n\n“I’ve come to talk to Mina Murray, the friend of the late Lucy Westenra. Madam Mina, it’s for the sake of the dead that I’ve come.”\n\n“You couldn’t ask for a better reason than being Lucy’s friend and helper,” I said, offering him my hand. He took it and replied warmly: “Oh, Madam Mina, I knew Lucy’s friend would be good, but I’ve discovered so much more.” He ended with a courteous bow. I asked what he wanted to discuss with me, and he started right away:\n\n“I have read your letters to Lucy. Forgive me; I needed to start somewhere, and had no one else to ask. I know you were with her in Whitby. She sometimes kept a diary—don’t be surprised; she started after you left, copying you. In it, she refers to sleepwalking and writes that you saved her. I am confused, so I ask if you could tell me all you can remember.”\n\n“I can tell you everything about it, Dr. Van Helsing.”\n\n“You remember the details? Not all young ladies do.”\n\n“No, but I wrote it all down at the time, and can show it to you.”\n\nHe thanked me, and I couldn’t resist playing a little joke—I offered him my shorthand diary. He took it with thanks, but quickly realized he couldn’t read shorthand. Smiling, he said: “You’re such a clever woman! Jonathan is lucky. Would you honour me by reading it for me? I can’t understand shorthand.” Slightly embarrassed, I handed him the typed version instead, saying I’d prepared it for him to save his time. He was grateful and asked if he could read it at once, as he might have questions. I agreed, saying he could read as I get lunch ready. He sat down, engrossed in the papers. When I returned, he was pacing with excitement. He rushed to me, clasped my hands, and said: “Madam Mina, how can I thank you? This document is like sunlight—it reveals everything, though shadows linger too. You may not fully understand, but I am truly grateful. If ever I can help you or your loved ones, please let me know—it would be my joy to serve you. There is darkness and light in life; you are one of the lights. May you and your husband be happy and blessed.”\n\nI replied that he praised me too much and didn’t really know me. He disagreed, saying he was experienced in people, especially studying the mind, and after reading my writing, he felt he knew me well. He asked about Jonathan’s health. I told him Jonathan was nearly recovered but distressed by Mr. Hawkins’s death, and on a recent visit to town had been shocked by seeing someone who brought back painful memories. Thinking about Jonathan’s suffering overwhelmed me, and I asked Dr. Van Helsing to make my husband well. He comforted me, saying his life had been lonely and focused on work, but meeting good people here gave him hope. He promised to do all he could for Jonathan and for our happiness. He urged me to eat and recover myself for Jonathan’s sake, suggesting we not talk about Lucy anymore for now. Dr. Van Helsing said he would stay in Exeter that night to consider everything and would ask me more questions later, including about Jonathan’s struggles. For now, he insisted I eat and rest."

As I write, I have just received a telegram from Jonathan, saying he will leave Launceston on the 6:25 train tonight and arrive at 10:18, so I will not need to be afraid tonight. Instead of joining us for lunch, would you please come for breakfast at eight o’clock, unless that is too early? If you are in a hurry, you can take the 10:30 train and reach Paddington by 2:35. Please don't bother replying; I'll assume you'll come to breakfast unless I hear otherwise. Sincerely, Your devoted and grateful friend, Mina Harker."

When I got home last night Mina had supper ready, and when we had supped she told me of Van Helsing’s visit, and of her having given him the two diaries copied out, and of how anxious she has been about me. She showed me in the doctor’s letter that all I wrote down was true. It seems to have made a new man of me. It was the doubt as to the reality of the whole thing that knocked me over. I felt impotent, and in the dark, and distrustful. But, now that I know, I am not afraid, even of the Count. He has succeeded after all, then, in his design in getting to London, and it was he I saw. He has got younger, and how? Van Helsing is the man to unmask him and hunt him out, if he is anything like what Mina says. We sat late, and talked it all over. Mina is dressing, and I shall call at the hotel in a few minutes and bring him over....\nHe was, I think, surprised to see me. When I came into the room where he was, and introduced myself, he took me by the shoulder, and turned my face round to the light, and said, after a sharp scrutiny:—\n“But Madam Mina told me you were ill, that you had had a shock.” It was so funny to hear my wife called “Madam Mina” by this kindly, strong-faced old man. I smiled, and said:—\n“I was ill, I have had a shock; but you have cured me already.”\n“And how?”\n“By your letter to Mina last night. I was in doubt, and then everything took a hue of unreality, and I did not know what to trust, even the evidence of my own senses. Not knowing what to trust, I did not know what to do; and so had only to keep on working in what had hitherto been the groove of my life. The groove ceased to avail me, and I mistrusted myself. Doctor, you don’t know what it is to doubt everything, even yourself. No, you don’t; you couldn’t with eyebrows like yours.” He seemed pleased, and laughed as he said:—\n“So! You are physiognomist. I learn more here with each hour. I am with so much pleasure coming to you to breakfast; and, oh, sir, you will pardon praise from an old man, but you are blessed in your wife.” I would listen to him go on praising Mina for a day, so I simply nodded and stood silent.\n“She is one of God’s women, fashioned by His own hand to show us men and other women that there is a heaven where we can enter, and that its light can be here on earth. So true, so sweet, so noble, so little an egoist—and that, let me tell you, is much in this age, so sceptical and selfish. And you, sir—I have read all the letters to poor Miss Lucy, and some of them speak of you, so I know you since some days from the knowing of others; but I have seen your true self since last night. You will give me your hand, will you not? And let us be friends for all our lives.”\nWe shook hands, and he was so earnest and so kind that it made me quite choky.\n“And now,” he said, “may I ask you for some more help? I have a great task to do, and at the beginning it is to know. You can help me here. Can you tell me what went before your going to Transylvania? Later on I may ask more help, and of a different kind; but at first this will do.”\n“Look here, sir,” I said, “does what you have to do concern the Count?”\n“It does,” he said solemnly.\n“Then I am with you heart and soul. As you go by the 10:30 train, you will not have time to read them; but I shall get the bundle of papers. You can take them with you and read them in the train.”\nAfter breakfast I saw him to the station. When we were parting he said:—\n“Perhaps you will come to town if I send to you, and take Madam Mina too.”\n“We shall both come when you will,” I said.",

Upon returning home the previous night, he found Mina with dinner ready. She recounted Van Helsing's visit, explaining she had given him copied versions of their diaries and expressed her deep concern for Jonathan. Mina also showed him Van Helsing's letter, confirming the accuracy of everything Jonathan had written, which had a profoundly revitalizing effect on him. He admitted that the uncertainty about the reality of the situation had incapacitated him, leaving him feeling helpless, bewildered, and suspicious. However, knowing the truth now meant he was no longer afraid, even of the Count. He accepted that the Count's plan to reach London had been successful and that it was indeed the Count he had seen, now appearing younger, a change Jonathan questioned. He felt confident that Van Helsing was the right person to expose and pursue the Count, based on Mina's description. They stayed up late discussing everything. Jonathan noted Mina was getting dressed, and he intended to go to the hotel shortly to bring Van Helsing over.\n\nJonathan found Van Helsing seemingly surprised by his appearance. When he entered the room and introduced himself, Van Helsing placed a hand on his shoulder, turned his face towards the light for a close examination, and commented, \"But Madam Mina told me you were ill, that you had had a shock.\" Jonathan found the term \"Madam Mina\" used by this kind, strong-featured older man quite amusing. He smiled and replied, \"I was ill, I did have a shock; but you have already healed me.\" Van Helsing asked how, and Jonathan explained it was through his letter to Mina the night before. He had been plagued by doubt, causing everything to feel unreal and making him question even his own senses. This uncertainty about what to trust left him unsure of what action to take, forcing him to continue merely following his established routine, which had become ineffective, leading him to distrust himself. Jonathan told the doctor, \"you don't know what it is to doubt everything, even yourself. No, you don't; you couldn't with eyebrows like yours.\" Van Helsing appeared pleased, laughing as he responded, \"So! You are physiognomist. I learn more here with each hour. I am with so much pleasure coming to you to breakfast; and, oh, sir, you will pardon praise from an old man, but you are blessed in your wife.\" Jonathan was so moved by praise for Mina that he would have listened all day, so he simply nodded and remained silent.\n\nVan Helsing elaborated on Mina's virtues, calling her \"one of God’s women, fashioned by His own hand to show us men and other women that there is a heaven where we can enter, and that its light can be here on earth. So true, so sweet, so noble, so little an egoist—and that, let me tell you, is much in this age, so sceptical and selfish.\" Turning his attention back to Jonathan, Van Helsing said, \"And you, sir—I have read all the letters to poor Miss Lucy, and some of them speak of you, so I know you since some days from the knowing of others; but I have seen your true self since last night. You will give me your hand, will you not? And let us be friends for all our lives.\" They shook hands, and Van Helsing's sincerity and warmth brought tears to Jonathan's eyes.\n\nVan Helsing then requested further assistance, explaining he had a significant task that required initial information, which Jonathan could provide. He asked for details about Jonathan's experiences before his journey to Transylvania, noting that different kinds of help might be needed later. Jonathan immediately asked if the task involved the Count. Van Helsing solemnly confirmed that it did. Jonathan pledged his complete support, saying, \"Then I am with you heart and soul.\" He realized Van Helsing wouldn't have time to read before his 10:30 train, so he promised to get the bundle of papers for him to read during the journey.\n\nAfter breakfast, Jonathan accompanied Van Helsing to the train station. As they parted, Van Helsing suggested, \"Perhaps you will come to town if I send to you, and take Madam Mina too.\" Jonathan assured him, \"We shall both come when you will.\"",

When I arrived home last night, Mina had supper prepared. During our meal, she told me that Van Helsing had visited, that she had given him copies of our two diaries, and shared how worried she had been about me. She showed me a letter from the doctor, confirming that all I had written was true. This revelation revitalized me. The uncertainty I felt about whether everything was real is what had shaken me so badly. I had felt powerless, confused, and suspicious, but now that I know the truth, I am not even afraid of the Count. He made it to London after all, and it was indeed him that I saw. He appears younger now—how, I wonder? If Van Helsing is as Mina describes, he is the man to expose and hunt down the Count. Mina and I stayed up late discussing all of this. She is getting dressed now, and I plan to visit Van Helsing’s hotel soon to bring him here. When I saw Van Helsing at the hotel, he seemed surprised by my visit. As I introduced myself, he looked me over intently and said, ‘But Madam Mina told me you were ill, that you’d suffered a shock.’ I found it amusing to hear Mina called ‘Madam Mina’ by this wise, kind old man. I smiled and replied, ‘I was ill, I did have a shock—but your letter last night cured me.’ He asked how, and I explained that his letter ended my doubts. Before that, everything around me felt unreal, and I didn’t know what to trust, not even myself. That uncertainty paralyzed me. I jokingly told him he couldn’t possibly understand such self-doubt, not with his confident eyebrows. Van Helsing was pleased, and laughed, appreciating the remark. He told me he was looking forward to breakfast and praised Mina, saying I was very lucky to have her as my wife. I was happy to listen to him speak well of Mina. Van Helsing went on to call Mina one of God’s women, a true example of goodness, sweetness, and selflessness—qualities rare in our skeptical, selfish age. He said he’d read letters referencing me and now felt he knew my real character since meeting me. He asked for my friendship, which I happily gave. Then he requested my help, saying his great task required knowledge, and asked me to tell him what happened before I traveled to Transylvania. He indicated that he’d likely need more help in the future. I asked if his task involved the Count, and he confirmed it did. I assured him of my full support. Since he was leaving soon by the 10:30 train, I offered a bundle of papers for him to read on his journey. After breakfast I accompanied him to the station. As we parted, he said he might summon me and Mina to the city, and I promised we would come whenever he needed us."

          "text_segment": "Dr. Seward’s Diary.\n26 September.—Truly there is no such thing as finality. Not a week since I said “Finis,” and yet here I am starting fresh again, or rather going on with the same record. Until this afternoon I had no cause to think of what is done. Renfield had become, to all intents, as sane as he ever was. He was already well ahead with his fly business; and he had just started in the spider line also; so he had not been of any trouble to me. I had a letter from Arthur, written on Sunday, and from it I gather that he is bearing up wonderfully well. Quincey Morris is with him, and that is much of a help, for he himself is a bubbling well of good spirits. Quincey wrote me a line too, and from him I hear that Arthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy; so as to them all my mind is at rest. As for myself, I was settling down to my work with the enthusiasm which I used to have for it, so that I might fairly have said that the wound which poor Lucy left on me was becoming cicatrised. Everything is, however, now reopened; and what is to be the end God only knows. I have an idea that Van Helsing thinks he knows, too, but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity. He went to Exeter yesterday, and stayed there all night. To-day he came back, and almost bounded into the room at about half-past five o’clock, and thrust last night’s “Westminster Gazette” into my hand.\n“What do you think of that?” he asked as he stood back and folded his arms.\nI looked over the paper, for I really did not know what he meant; but he took it from me and pointed out a paragraph about children being decoyed away at Hampstead. It did not convey much to me, until I reached a passage where it described small punctured wounds on their throats. An idea struck me, and I looked up. “Well?” he said.\n“It is like poor Lucy’s.”\n“And what do you make of it?”\n“Simply that there is some cause in common. Whatever it was that injured her has injured them.” I did not quite understand his answer:—\n“That is true indirectly, but not directly.”\n“How do you mean, Professor?” I asked. I was a little inclined to take his seriousness lightly—for, after all, four days of rest and freedom from burning, harrowing anxiety does help to restore one’s spirits—but when I saw his face, it sobered me. Never, even in the midst of our despair about poor Lucy, had he looked more stern.\n“Tell me!” I said. “I can hazard no opinion. I do not know what to think, and I have no data on which to found a conjecture.”\n“Do you mean to tell me, friend John, that you have no suspicion as to what poor Lucy died of; not after all the hints given, not only by events, but by me?”\n“Of nervous prostration following on great loss or waste of blood.”\n“And how the blood lost or waste?” I shook my head. He stepped over and sat down beside me, and went on:—\n“You are clever man, friend John; you reason well, and your wit is bold; but you are too prejudiced. You do not let your eyes see nor your ears hear, and that which is outside your daily life is not of account to you. Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand, and yet which are; that some people see things that others cannot? But there are things old and new which must not be contemplate by men’s eyes, because they know—or think they know—some things which other men have told them. Ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants to explain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to explain. But yet we see around us every day the growth of new beliefs, which think themselves new; and which are yet but the old, which pretend to be young—like the fine ladies at the opera. I suppose now you do not believe in corporeal transference. No? Nor in materialisation. No? Nor in astral bodies. No? Nor in the reading of thought. No? Nor in hypnotism——”\n“Yes,” I said. “Charcot has proved that pretty well.” He smiled as he went on: “Then you are satisfied as to it. Yes? And of course then you understand how it act, and can follow the mind of the great Charcot—alas that he is no more!—into the very soul of the patient that he influence. No? Then, friend John, am I to take it that you simply accept fact, and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusion be a blank? No? Then tell me—for I am student of the brain—how you accept the hypnotism and reject the thought reading. Let me tell you, my friend, that there are things done to-day in electrical science which would have been deemed unholy by the very men who discovered electricity—who would themselves not so long before have been burned as wizards. There are always mysteries in life. Why was it that Methuselah lived nine hundred years, and ‘Old Parr’ one hundred and sixty-nine, and yet that poor Lucy, with four men’s blood in her poor veins, could not live even one day? For, had she live one more day, we could have save her. Do you know all the mystery of life and death? Do you know the altogether of comparative anatomy and can say wherefore the qualities of brutes are in some men, and not in others? Can you tell me why, when other spiders die small and soon, that one great spider lived for centuries in the tower of the old Spanish church and grew and grew, till, on descending, he could drink the oil of all the church lamps? Can you tell me why in the Pampas, ay and elsewhere, there are bats that come at night and open the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry their veins; how in some islands of the Western seas there are bats which hang on the trees all day, and those who have seen describe as like giant nuts or pods, and that when the sailors sleep on the deck, because that it is hot, flit down on them, and then—and then in the morning are found dead men, white as even Miss Lucy was?”\n“Good God, Professor!” I said, starting up. “Do you mean to tell me that Lucy was bitten by such a bat; and that such a thing is here in London in the nineteenth century?” He waved his hand for silence, and went on:—\n“Can you tell me why the tortoise lives more long than generations of men; why the elephant goes on and on till he have seen dynasties; and why the parrot never die only of bite of cat or dog or other complaint? Can you tell me why men believe in all ages and places that there are some few who live on always if they be permit; that there are men and women who cannot die? We all know—because science has vouched for the fact—that there have been toads shut up in rocks for thousands of years, shut in one so small hole that only hold him since the youth of the world. Can you tell me how the Indian fakir can make himself to die and have been buried, and his grave sealed and corn sowed on it, and the corn reaped and be cut and sown and reaped and cut again, and then men come and take away the unbroken seal and that there lie the Indian fakir, not dead, but that rise up and walk amongst them as before?” Here I interrupted him. I was getting bewildered; he so crowded on my mind his list of nature’s eccentricities and possible impossibilities that my imagination was getting fired. I had a dim idea that he was teaching me some lesson, as long ago he used to do in his study at Amsterdam; but he used then to tell me the thing, so that I could have the object of thought in mind all the time. But now I was without this help, yet I wanted to follow him, so I said:—\n“Professor, let me be your pet student again. Tell me the thesis, so that I may apply your knowledge as you go on. At present I am going in my mind from point to point as a mad man, and not a sane one, follows an idea. I feel like a novice lumbering through a bog in a mist, jumping from one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to move on without knowing where I am going.”\n“That is good image,” he said. “Well, I shall tell you. My thesis is this: I want you to believe.”\n“To believe what?”\n“To believe in things that you cannot. Let me illustrate. I heard once of an American who so defined faith: ‘that faculty which enables us to believe things which we know to be untrue.’ For one, I follow that man. He meant that we shall have an open mind, and not let a little bit of truth check the rush of a big truth, like a small rock does a railway truck. We get the small truth first. Good! We keep him, and we value him; but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth in the universe.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Dr. Seward’s Diary. September 26th. I truly believed I was finished with these records last week, writing 'Finis,' yet here I am beginning again, or rather, continuing the same narrative. Up until this afternoon, I had no reason to reflect on recent events. Renfield appeared as mentally sound as he ever was, fully engrossed in his fly and now spider collecting, causing me no problems. I received a letter from Arthur, written Sunday, indicating he is coping remarkably well. Quincey Morris is with him, which is a great comfort due to his infectious good spirits. Quincey also sent a short note, confirming Arthur is starting to regain his usual cheerful demeanor, so I feel at ease regarding their well-being. As for myself, I was settling back into my work with my former passion, feeling that the emotional wound left by poor Lucy was beginning to heal. However, everything has now been disrupted, and only God knows the outcome. I suspect Van Helsing believes he knows the answer, but he only offers just enough information at a time to increase my curiosity. He traveled to Exeter yesterday and stayed overnight. Today, he returned around half-past five, almost bursting into the room, and practically shoved last night’s 'Westminster Gazette' into my hands. 'What do you make of this?' he asked, stepping back and folding his arms. I scanned the newspaper, unsure of his meaning, but he took it back and directed my attention to a paragraph about children being lured away in Hampstead. It didn't make much sense to me until I read the description of small punctured wounds on their throats. A realization dawned on me, and I looked up. 'Well?' he prompted. 'It resembles poor Lucy’s injuries.' 'And what do you conclude from that?' 'Simply that there is a shared cause. Whatever harmed her has harmed them.' I didn't quite grasp his response: 'That is true in an indirect sense, but not directly.' 'What do you mean, Professor?' I asked. I was somewhat inclined to dismiss his seriousness lightly – after all, four days of peace and freedom from agonizing worry does help restore one's spirits – but seeing his face sobered me instantly. Never, not even during our deepest despair over poor Lucy, had he looked so stern. 'Tell me!' I urged. 'I cannot even venture a guess. I don't know what to think, and I have no evidence on which to base any theory.' 'Are you seriously telling me, my friend John, that you have no suspicion about what caused poor Lucy to die, even after all the hints provided, not only by the events themselves but by me?' 'Of nervous collapse following severe blood loss or depletion.' 'And how was the blood lost or depleted?' I shook my head, unable to answer. He stepped closer, sat down beside me, and continued: 'You are a clever man, friend John; you reason well, and your mind is sharp; but you are too rigid. You don't allow your eyes to see or your ears to hear, and anything outside your everyday experience is disregarded. Don't you believe that there are things you cannot comprehend, yet which exist; that some individuals perceive things others cannot? But there are matters, both ancient and modern, which men refuse to consider because they 'know'—or believe they know—certain things based on what others have told them. Ah, it is the flaw of our science that it strives to explain everything; and if it fails to explain, it claims there is nothing there to explain. Yet, we see around us daily the emergence of new beliefs, which consider themselves new; but which are merely the old, masquerading as young—like the fashionable ladies at the opera. I suppose you don't believe in corporeal transference now? No? Nor in materialization? No? Nor in astral bodies? No? Nor in reading thoughts? No? Nor in hypnotism—' 'Yes,' I interrupted. 'Charcot has demonstrated that quite conclusively.' He smiled and continued: 'Then you are convinced about it. Yes? And naturally, then you understand how it operates, and can follow the mind of the great Charcot—alas that he is gone!—into the very essence of the patient he influences. No? Then, friend John, am I to assume that you simply accept the fact without bridging the gap from premise to conclusion? No? Then tell me—for I study the brain—how you embrace hypnotism but reject thought reading. Let me tell you, my friend, things are being done in electrical science today that would have been considered sacrilegious by the very men who discovered electricity—men who, not long before, might themselves have been burned as sorcerers. There are always mysteries in life. Why did Methuselah live nine hundred years, and 'Old Parr' one hundred and sixty-nine, yet poor Lucy, with the blood of four men in her frail veins, could not survive even one additional day? For, if she had lived one more day, we could have saved her. Do you understand the complete mystery of life and death? Do you possess the full knowledge of comparative anatomy and can explain why traits of animals appear in some men but not others? Can you explain why, when other spiders die small and quickly, one enormous spider lived for centuries in the tower of an old Spanish church, growing larger and larger until, upon descending, it could drain the oil from all the church lamps? Can you tell me why in the Pampas, and elsewhere, there are bats that emerge at night, open the veins of cattle and horses, and drain them dry; how on some islands in the Western seas there are bats that hang in trees all day, described by those who have seen them as resembling giant nuts or pods, and that when sailors sleep on deck due to the heat, these bats swoop down on them, and then—and then in the morning, dead men are found, as pale as even Miss Lucy was?' 'Good God, Professor!' I exclaimed, leaping up. 'Are you suggesting that Lucy was bitten by such a bat; and that such a creature exists here in London in the nineteenth century?' He motioned for silence and continued: 'Can you explain why the tortoise lives longer than generations of humans; why the elephant endures until it has seen dynasties come and go; and why the parrot only dies if bitten by a cat or dog or from some other ailment? Can you explain why men throughout all ages and places believe that there are a select few who can live on indefinitely if permitted; that there are men and women who cannot die? We all know—because science has verified it—that toads have been found enclosed within rocks for thousands of years, trapped in a space so small it could only contain them since the world was young. Can you explain how the Indian fakir can make himself appear dead, be buried, his grave sealed with corn sown on it, the corn reaped and harvested and sown and reaped and harvested again, and then men come and remove the unbroken seal to find the Indian fakir not dead, but rising up to walk among them as before?' At this point, I interrupted him. I was becoming overwhelmed; he was flooding my mind with such a list of nature's oddities and apparent impossibilities that my imagination was ignited. I had a vague sense that he was teaching me a lesson, as he used to do in his study in Amsterdam long ago; but he would then state the subject clearly, allowing me to keep the object of thought in mind constantly. Without that guidance now, yet eager to follow him, I said: 'Professor, please let me be your dedicated student again. State your main point, your thesis, so that I can apply your knowledge as you proceed. At present, my mind is leaping from point to point like a madman, not a rational person, chasing an idea. I feel like a novice clumsily traversing a bog in a mist, jumping from one clump of grass to another in a blind effort to move forward without knowing my destination.' 'That is a good comparison,' he agreed. 'Well, I will tell you. My thesis is this: I want you to believe.' 'To believe what?' 'To believe in things that you think are impossible. Let me give you an example. I once heard an American define faith as 'that ability which allows us to believe things that we know are not true.' Personally, I agree with that man. He meant that we must keep an open mind, and not let a small piece of truth obstruct the onward movement of a great truth, just as a small rock can derail a railway car. We grasp the small truth first. Good! We keep it, and we value it; but we must never allow it to think it represents the entirety of truth in the universe.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Dr. Seward’s Diary. September 26.—I’ve realized there’s really never any true ending. Just a week ago I thought I was done, yet here I am continuing my notes. Up until this afternoon, I hadn’t worried about past events. Renfield had been as stable as could be expected. He’d even gone back to his insect collecting and recently taken up spiders, but he hadn’t troubled me. I received a letter from Arthur, dated Sunday, and it seems he’s coping quite well. Quincey Morris is staying with him, spreading his constant good cheer. Quincey himself wrote me, saying Arthur’s spirits are improving. So I felt at ease about my friends. As for myself, I was finally getting back into my work, feeling enthusiasm again, as if the pain of Lucy’s loss was beginning to heal. But now everything is unsettled once more, and only God knows how it will end. I suspect Van Helsing has some idea, but he only hints at things to spark curiosity. He traveled to Exeter yesterday and returned today, bursting into the room around five-thirty and handing me the previous night’s “Westminster Gazette.” \n\nHe asked, “What do you make of that?” and stood back, arms folded. As I scanned the paper, not being sure what he meant, he took it and pointed out a report about children being lured away in Hampstead. It made little impression on me until I read about the strange small wounds on their throats. Suddenly, I thought of Lucy and looked up. “Well?” he asked. \n\n“It’s like what happened to poor Lucy.”\n\n“And what conclusion do you draw?”\n\n“That there’s a common cause. Whatever harmed her is harming them.” He replied, “That’s true, but only indirectly.” \n\nI asked him to explain, not taking his seriousness to heart, since four days’ rest had finally relieved my anxiety. But seeing his stern expression, I sobered. Never, not even at our worst with Lucy, had he looked so grave. \n\nI pleaded for guidance, confessing I had no theory and no data. He said, “Do you mean to tell me, friend John, you have no suspicion about Lucy’s death, after all the hints from events and from me?”\n\n“I thought it was nervous collapse from severe blood loss.” \n\n“And how was that blood lost?” I shook my head. He sat beside me and continued:\n\n“You’re a clever man, John; logical, daring, but you’re too narrow-minded. You ignore what doesn’t fit your usual experience. Don’t you think there are things we can’t understand that still exist? Some see what others don’t. There are ancient and new things men shouldn’t look at, just because they think they know what others have told them. Science always wants to explain, and if it cannot, it says there is nothing there. But new beliefs sprout up—only they’re old beliefs pretending to be new, like ladies at the opera. Now, I suppose you don’t believe in bodily transference, or in materialization, or in astral bodies, or mind-reading, or hypnotism?”\n\n“I believe in hypnotism,” I replied. “Charcot proved it.” He smiled, “So if you accept hypnotism, do you understand how it works, following the mind of Charcot into a patient’s soul? No? Do you just accept facts without understanding links? Then why accept hypnotism and not mind-reading? Let me tell you, there are things electrical science achieves today that would have seemed supernatural to the early pioneers, who themselves would have been burned as witches. Mysteries always exist. Why did Methuselah live 900 years, ‘Old Parr’ for 169, but Lucy, after several transfusions, could not survive another day? If she had, we might have saved her. Do you know life and death’s entire mystery? Can you explain why some men have animalistic qualities, others not? Why do some spiders die young, but one lived for centuries in a Spanish church, feeding off the lamp oil? Why do bats in South America draw blood from cattle and horses at night, or in the Western seas hang in trees and suck the blood of sleeping sailors, leaving white corpses like Lucy’s in the morning?”\n\n“Good heavens!” I gasped. “Are you saying Lucy was bitten by such a bat, and that such things dwell in London in the nineteenth century?” He gestured for quiet and continued:\n\n“Why does the tortoise outlive men, the elephant see dynasties, the parrot die only from accident? Why do people across ages believe in those who could, with permission, live forever? Science has proven that toads can survive sealed in rocks for thousands of years. Can you explain how an Indian fakir can appear to die, be buried, crops sown and reaped over him, then, when the grave is opened years later, rise untouched? ” I interrupted—overwhelmed by his examples of life’s wonders and near impossibilities. I sensed he was teaching, as in Amsterdam—but this time, without a clear guiding lesson. Wanting to follow, I said:\n\n“Professor, please be my mentor again. State your thesis, so I can apply your points as we continue. Right now my mind leaps from idea to idea aimlessly, like a novice stumbling blindly through a misty bog.”\n\n“Good image,” he said. “Here’s my thesis: I want you to believe.”\n\n“To believe what?”\n\n“To believe in what seems impossible. For example, I once heard an American describe faith as ‘the faculty that allows us to believe things we know are untrue.’ I agree—we must keep open minds and not let a small truth block our progress to greater ones, as a tiny rock blocks a train. We must value the small truth, but not let it pretend to be all the truth there is.”"

Oh, my friend, why, think you, did I go so far round, why take so long to tell you so simple a thing? Was it because I hate you and have hated you all my life? Was it because I wished to give you pain? Was it that I wanted, now so late, revenge for that time when you saved my life, and from a fearful death? Ah no!”\n“Forgive me,” said I. He went on:—\n“My friend, it was because I wished to be gentle in the breaking to you, for I know you have loved that so sweet lady. But even yet I do not expect you to believe. It is so hard to accept at once any abstract truth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always believed the ‘no’ of it; it is more hard still to accept so sad a concrete truth, and of such a one as Miss Lucy. To-night I go to prove it. Dare you come with me?”\nThis staggered me. A man does not like to prove such a truth; Byron excepted from the category, jealousy.\n“And prove the very truth he most abhorred.”\nHe saw my hesitation, and spoke:—\n“The logic is simple, no madman’s logic this time, jumping from tussock to tussock in a misty bog. If it be not true, then proof will be relief; at worst it will not harm. If it be true! Ah, there is the dread; yet very dread should help my cause, for in it is some need of belief. Come, I tell you what I propose: first, that we go off now and see that child in the hospital. Dr. Vincent, of the North Hospital, where the papers say the child is, is friend of mine, and I think of yours since you were in class at Amsterdam. He will let two scientists see his case, if he will not let two friends. We shall tell him nothing, but only that we wish to learn. And then——”\n“And then?” He took a key from his pocket and held it up. “And then we spend the night, you and I, in the churchyard where Lucy lies. This is the key that lock the tomb.

Oh, my friend, tell me, why do you think I took such a long, roundabout path, why did I take so much time to explain something so straightforward? Was it because I hate you, and have hated you my whole life? Was it because I wanted to cause you pain? Was it because I desired revenge, so late in the day, for that time you saved my life from a terrible death? No, absolutely not!\" \"Forgive me,\" I said.

Tonight, I will go to prove it. Do you dare to come with me?\" This request stunned me. A person doesn't want to prove such a truth; with the exception of Byron discussing jealousy, \"And prove the very truth he most abhorred.\" He noticed my hesitation and spoke: \"The logic is simple, this isn't the reasoning of a madman, wildly jumping between obstacles in a misty swamp.

We asked Vincent to what he attributed them, and he replied that it must have been a bite of some animal, perhaps a rat; but, for his own part, he was inclined to think that it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern heights of London. “Out of so many harmless ones,” he said, “there may be some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species. Some sailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape; or even from the Zoölogical Gardens a young one may have got loose, or one be bred there from a vampire. These things do occur, you know. Only ten days ago a wolf got out, and was, I believe, traced up in this direction. For a week after, the children were playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on the Heath and in every alley in the place until this ‘bloofer lady’ scare came along, since when it has been quite a gala-time with them. Even this poor little mite, when he woke up to-day, asked the nurse if he might go away. When she asked him why he wanted to go, he said he wanted to play with the ‘bloofer lady.’”\n“I hope,” said Van Helsing, “that when you are sending the child home you will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it. These fancies to stray are most dangerous; and if the child were to remain out another night, it would probably be fatal.

He noted that such incidents occur, recalling a wolf escape recently that had local children playing 'Red Riding Hood' until the 'bloofer lady' scare emerged, which ironically became a source of excitement for them. Even this young boy, upon waking, asked his nurse if he could leave to play with the 'bloofer lady.' Van Helsing emphasized the importance of warning the child's parents to supervise him closely once he is sent home, stressing the danger of letting him wander and stating that another night out would likely be fatal.

When Van Helsing saw how dark it was, he said:—\n“There is no hurry. It is more late than I thought. Come, let us seek somewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way.”\nWe dined at “Jack Straw’s Castle” along with a little crowd of bicyclists and others who were genially noisy. About ten o’clock we started from the inn. It was then very dark, and the scattered lamps made the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual radius. The Professor had evidently noted the road we were to go, for he went on unhesitatingly; but, as for me, I was in quite a mixup as to locality. As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till at last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horse police going their usual suburban round. At last we reached the wall of the churchyard, which we climbed over. With some little difficulty—for it was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange to us—we found the Westenra tomb. The Professor took the key, opened the creaky door, and standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously, motioned me to precede him. There was a delicious irony in the offer, in the courtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion. My companion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew the door to, after carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring, one. In the latter case we should have been in a bad plight. Then he fumbled in his bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle, proceeded to make a light. The tomb in the day-time, and when wreathed with fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough; but now, some days afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whites turning to rust and their greens to browns; when the spider and the beetle had resumed their accustomed dominance; when time-discoloured stone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished brass, and clouded silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a candle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been imagined. It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life—animal life—was not the only thing which could pass away.\nVan Helsing went about his work systematically. Holding his candle so that he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the sperm dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he made assurance of Lucy’s coffin. Another search in his bag, and he took out a turnscrew.\n“What are you going to do?” I asked.\n“To open the coffin. You shall yet be convinced.” Straightway he began taking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing the casing of lead beneath. The sight was almost too much for me. It seemed to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living; I actually took hold of his hand to stop him. He only said: “You shall see,” and again fumbling in his bag, took out a tiny fret-saw. Striking the turnscrew through the lead with a swift downward stab, which made me wince, he made a small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point of the saw. I had expected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse. We doctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become accustomed to such things, and I drew back towards the door. But the Professor never stopped for a moment; he sawed down a couple of feet along one side of the lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side. Taking the edge of the loose flange, he bent it back towards the foot of the coffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to me to look.\nI drew near and looked. The coffin was empty.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Our visit to the hospital unexpectedly took longer than we anticipated, and by the time we emerged, the sun had already set. Seeing how dark it had become, Van Helsing remarked, \"There is no rush. It is later than I had estimated. Come, let us find a place to eat before we continue.\" We ate dinner at \"Jack Straw’s Castle\" among a lively group of cyclists and others who were quite jovial. Around ten o'clock, we departed from the inn. It was exceedingly dark then, and the scattered streetlights seemed only to accentuate the gloom once we were beyond their immediate glow. The Professor clearly had the intended route mapped out, as he proceeded without hesitation, but I felt utterly lost regarding our location. As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, eventually becoming somewhat surprised when we encountered even the usual suburban patrol of horse police. Finally, we reached the cemetery wall and climbed over it. With some difficulty—due to the intense darkness and the strangeness of the place—we managed to find the Westenra tomb. The Professor took out the key, opened the creaky door, and stepping back, extended a polite but seemingly unconscious gesture for me to enter first. There was a subtle humor in this offer, an ironic courtesy in yielding precedence on such a morbid occasion. My companion quickly followed me inside, carefully drawing the door shut after confirming it had a falling lock that would secure us (unlike a spring lock which would have put us in a difficult situation). He then searched his bag, produced a matchbox and a piece of candle, and created a light. During the day, and adorned with fresh flowers, the tomb had appeared grim and unsettling enough; but now, days later, with the flowers drooping and dead, their white turning to rust and their green to brown; with spiders and beetles reclaiming their familiar territory; with time-stained stone, dust-covered mortar, rusty, damp iron, tarnished brass, and cloudy silver-plating reflecting the faint candlelight, the effect was more wretched and squalid than imaginable. It powerfully suggested that the cessation of life—animal life—was not the only thing that could decay. Van Helsing methodically set about his task. Holding his candle so he could read the coffin plates, and positioning it so that drops of melted wax congealed in white spots as they touched the metal, he confirmed it was Lucy's coffin. Another search in his bag, and he withdrew a turnscrew (screwdriver). \"What do you intend to do?\" I inquired. \"To open the coffin,\" he replied. \"You will be convinced.\" He immediately began removing the screws and finally lifted off the lid, revealing the lead casing underneath. The sight was almost unbearable for me. It felt as much an insult to the dead woman as if her clothes had been stripped off while she slept when alive; I actually reached out and took his hand to stop him. He simply stated, \"You shall see,\" and again fumbled in his bag, taking out a small fret-saw. Driving the turnscrew through the lead with a swift, sharp downward thrust that made me flinch, he created a small opening, though it was large enough to insert the saw's point. As a doctor familiar with such risks, I had expected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse and instinctively drew back towards the door. But the Professor did not pause for a moment. He sawed down the lead coffin for about two feet along one side, then across, and down the other side. Grabbing the edge of the loosened flap, he bent it back towards the foot of the coffin, held the candle into the opening, and motioned for me to look. I stepped closer and peered inside. The coffin was empty.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Our trip to the hospital ended up taking longer than we had expected, and by the time we left, the sun had already set. Noticing how late it was, Van Helsing remarked, \"There’s no rush. It’s even later than I thought. Let’s find a place to eat, and then we can continue.\" We ate at Jack Straw’s Castle, sharing the space with a lively group of cyclists and others. Around ten o’clock, we left the inn. It was very dark outside, and the nearby lamps only made the darkness beyond them feel deeper. Van Helsing clearly knew the route and led the way confidently, while I was unsure of where we were. As we traveled on, we saw fewer and fewer people, and eventually we were surprised to encounter even a passing patrol of mounted police. Finally, we reached the churchyard wall, climbed over it, and, after some difficulty in the unfamiliar darkness, located the Westenra tomb. Van Helsing unlocked its creaky door and, in a gesture both polite and ironically formal given the grim situation, let me go in first. He quickly followed, carefully closing the door to make sure it locked in a way that wouldn’t trap us inside. Then, he took a matchbox and candle from his bag to illuminate the tomb. In daylight and decorated with fresh flowers, the tomb had already seemed forbidding; now, days later, with wilted and browned flowers, insects reclaiming their space, and surfaces dulled by dust and age, it looked even more dismal and neglected under the candlelight, suggesting not just the passing of life, but decay itself. Van Helsing got to work, using the candle to read nameplates on the coffins, and let wax fall in white blobs all over the metal as he confirmed which was Lucy’s. He produced a screwdriver from his bag. When I asked what he was doing, he said, \"To open the coffin. You will be convinced.\" He proceeded to remove the screws from the coffin and lifted off its lid, revealing an underlying lead casing. The act felt like a violation of the dead, and I instinctively tried to stop him, but he reassured me, took out a small saw, stabbed a hole in the lead, and began cutting. As a doctor, I was prepared for the possible release of gas from the week-old corpse, and I stepped back. But Van Helsing worked without pause, cutting a panel in the lead, then folding it back and shining the candle inside, motioning for me to look. I stepped forward and saw that the coffin was empty."

          "text_segment": "It was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock, but Van Helsing was unmoved. He was now more sure than ever of his ground, and so emboldened to proceed in his task. “Are you satisfied now, friend John?” he asked.\nI felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as I answered him:—\n“I am satisfied that Lucy’s body is not in that coffin; but that only proves one thing.”\n“And what is that, friend John?”\n“That it is not there.”\n“That is good logic,” he said, “so far as it goes. But how do you—how can you—account for it not being there?”\n“Perhaps a body-snatcher,” I suggested. “Some of the undertaker’s people may have stolen it.” I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet it was the only real cause which I could suggest. The Professor sighed. “Ah well!” he said, “we must have more proof. Come with me.”\nHe put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all his things and placed them in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the bag. We opened the door, and went out. Behind us he closed the door and locked it. He handed me the key, saying: “Will you keep it? You had better be assured.” I laughed—it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am bound to say—as I motioned him to keep it. “A key is nothing,” I said; “there may be duplicates; and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock of that kind.” He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. Then he told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at the other. I took up my place behind a yew-tree, and I saw his dark figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my sight.\nIt was a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my place I heard a distant clock strike twelve, and in time came one and two. I was chilled and unnerved, and angry with the Professor for taking me on such an errand and with myself for coming. I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly observant, and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether I had a dreary, miserable time.\nSuddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a white streak, moving between two dark yew-trees at the side of the churchyard farthest from the tomb; at the same time a dark mass moved from the Professor’s side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards it. Then I too moved; but I had to go round headstones and railed-off tombs, and I stumbled over graves. The sky was overcast, and somewhere far off an early cock crew. A little way off, beyond a line of scattered juniper-trees, which marked the pathway to the church, a white, dim figure flitted in the direction of the tomb. The tomb itself was hidden by trees, and I could not see where the figure disappeared. I heard the rustle of actual movement where I had first seen the white figure, and coming over, found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny child. When he saw me he held it out to me, and said:—\n“Are you satisfied now?”\n“No,” I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.\n“Do you not see the child?”\n“Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is it wounded?” I asked.\n“We shall see,” said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our way out of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child.\nWhen we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump of trees, and struck a match, and looked at the child’s throat. It was without a scratch or scar of any kind.\n“Was I right?” I asked triumphantly.\n“We were just in time,” said the Professor thankfully.\nWe had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so consulted about it. If we were to take it to a police-station we should have to give some account of our movements during the night; at least, we should have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child. So finally we decided that we would take it to the Heath, and when we heard a policeman coming, would leave it where he could not fail to find it; we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could. All fell out well. At the edge of Hampstead Heath we heard a policeman’s heavy tramp, and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro. We heard his exclamation of astonishment, and then we went away silently. By good chance we got a cab near the “Spaniards,” and drove to town.\nI cannot sleep, so I make this entry. But I must try to get a few hours’ sleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon. He insists that I shall go with him on another expedition.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I was definitely taken aback, experiencing considerable shock, yet Van Helsing remained composed. His certainty in his findings had grown, empowering him to continue his work. “Do you accept it now, friend John?” he inquired. My ingrained tendency for stubborn argument surfaced as I responded: “I accept that Lucy’s remains are absent from the coffin; however, that only establishes one fact.” “And what is that, friend John?” “Simply that it is not there.” “That reasoning is sound, as far as it goes,” he stated, “but how do you explain—how can you explain—its absence?” “Perhaps a grave robber,” I suggested. “Maybe some individuals connected with the funeral home stole it.” I recognized the foolishness of my words, yet it was the sole credible explanation I could offer. The Professor sighed. “Alright then,” he remarked, “we require more conclusive evidence. Accompany me.” He replaced the coffin lid, collected all his belongings and placed them into his bag, extinguished the light, and put the candle also in the bag. We unfastened the door and exited. Behind us, he shut the door and secured it with the lock. He offered me the key, saying: “Would you care to keep it? You should feel confident.” I gave a laugh—I must admit it was not a cheerful one—as I gestured for him to retain it. “A key is insignificant,” I commented; “there could be copies; and in any case, picking such a lock isn’t difficult.” He offered no reply but pocketed the key. Then he instructed me to keep watch on one side of the cemetery while he would watch on the other. I positioned myself behind a yew tree, observing his dark shape move until the intervening gravestones and trees obstructed my view. It was a solitary watch. Shortly after taking my position, I heard a distant clock chime midnight, followed by one and two. I felt cold and anxious, annoyed at the Professor for involving me in such an undertaking and at myself for agreeing to it. I was too chilled and weary to be acutely observant, and yet not drowsy enough to completely neglect my duty, resulting in an altogether bleak and unpleasant experience. Suddenly, as I turned, I thought I detected something resembling a white streak, moving between two dark yew trees on the farthest side of the cemetery from the tomb; simultaneously, a dark mass moved from the Professor’s location and quickly approached it. Then I too started moving; but I had to navigate around headstones and fenced-off burial plots, stumbling over graves. The sky was clouded over, and somewhere in the distance, an early rooster crowed. A short distance away, past a line of scattered juniper trees marking the path to the church, a pale, indistinct figure darted towards the tomb. The tomb itself was hidden by trees, and I could not see where the figure vanished. I heard the faint sound of actual movement where I had first glimpsed the white figure, and upon arriving, I discovered the Professor holding a small child in his arms. When he saw me, he extended the child towards me and asked: “Are you convinced now?” “No,” I replied, in a manner I perceived as challenging. “Do you not see the child?” “Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is it injured?” I inquired. “We shall discover that,” said the Professor, and acting on impulse, we made our way out of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child. After we had distanced ourselves somewhat, we entered a cluster of trees, struck a match, and examined the child’s throat. It was completely unmarked, without any scratches or scars. “Was I correct?” I asked with a sense of triumph. “We arrived just in time,” the Professor said gratefully. We then had to decide what to do with the child, so we conferred about it. Taking it to a police station would necessitate explaining our activities during the night; at the very least, we would have to provide some account of how we came to find the child. Consequently, we ultimately resolved to take it to the Heath, and upon hearing a policeman approaching, leave it where he was sure to discover it; we would then make our way home as swiftly as possible. Everything proceeded smoothly. At the edge of Hampstead Heath, we heard the heavy footsteps of a policeman, and placing the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until he spotted it as he swept his lantern back and forth. We heard his exclamation of surprise, and then we departed quietly. By good fortune, we found a taxi near “The Spaniards” pub and were driven into the city. I am unable to sleep, so I am making this record. However, I must endeavor to get a few hours of rest, as Van Helsing is scheduled to pick me up at noon. He insists that I accompany him on another expedition.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The discovery shocked me, though Van Helsing seemed completely unfazed. In fact, he was even more convinced and confident in his actions. He asked, “Are you satisfied now, John?” My argumentative nature surfaced as I replied, “I’m satisfied that Lucy’s body isn’t in the coffin—that’s all this shows.”\n\nHe queried, “And what does that prove?”\n\n“Just that the body isn’t there.”\n\nHe agreed, saying my logic made sense to a point, but pressed me to explain why the body wasn’t present. I suggested perhaps a grave robber had taken it—maybe someone from the undertaker’s staff. Even as I said it, I realized how unlikely it sounded, but I didn’t have a better explanation. Van Helsing sighed and said we needed more evidence, urging me to follow him.\n\nAfter securing the coffin and gathering his things, he extinguished the light, packed up, and locked the tomb’s door behind us. He gave me the key, suggesting I keep it for reassurance, but I told him the key’s not that important since locks like these are easy to open and there might be duplicates. He kept the key in his pocket and told me to watch one side of the churchyard while he watched the other. I took up my spot behind a yew tree and watched as he disappeared into the darkness.\n\nStanding watch was lonely. Soon after taking my place, I heard a distant clock strike midnight, then one, then two. I felt cold, tense, and annoyed at both the Professor for bringing me here and myself for agreeing to come. Sleepy, uncomfortable, and unable to focus, I found the vigil miserable.\n\nSuddenly, turning around, I thought I saw a white figure moving quickly between the yew trees on the far side of the churchyard. At the same time, a dark shape hurried from Van Helsing’s side toward it. I began to follow but had to work my way around gravestones, stumbling over uneven ground. The overcast sky dimmed the night, and I heard a distant rooster crow. Not far away, beyond some scattered trees along the church path, I glimpsed a pale, ghostly figure moving toward the tomb, which was hidden by trees. I couldn’t see where it went, but I heard faint movement where I’d seen the white figure before, and found the Professor there, holding a small child. He handed it to me and asked again if I was satisfied.\n\nI replied sharply, “No.” He asked if I saw the child. I admitted I did, but wondered who brought it there and whether it was hurt. The Professor assured me we’d soon find out, and together we left the churchyard with the sleeping child.\n\nOnce we were well away, we stopped to examine the child under the light of a match. Its throat bore no marks or wounds. Feeling vindicated, I asked if I’d been right. The Professor said we’d arrived just in time.\n\nWe considered what to do: If we took the child to the police, we’d have to explain why we were out so late and how we’d found the child. Instead, we decided to leave it on Hampstead Heath where a patrolling policeman would find it. As planned, when we heard one approaching, we left the child where he couldn’t miss it and quietly left after making sure he found it. Fortunately, we got a cab near the “Spaniards” and returned to town.\n\nI’m too restless to sleep and decided to record these events, but I hope to get some rest since Van Helsing will call for me at noon and insists I join him for another outing."

The funeral held at noon was all completed, and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily away, when, looking carefully from behind a clump of alder-trees, we saw the sexton lock the gate after him. We knew then that we were safe till morning did we desire it; but the Professor told me that we should not want more than an hour at most. Again I felt that horrid sense of the reality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed out of place; and I realised distinctly the perils of the law which we were incurring in our unhallowed work. Besides, I felt it was all so useless. Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman dead nearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly to open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own eyesight, that the coffin was empty. I shrugged my shoulders, however, and rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road, no matter who remonstrated. He took the key, opened the vault, and again courteously motioned me to precede. The place was not so gruesome as last night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when the sunshine streamed in. Van Helsing walked over to Lucy’s coffin, and I followed. He bent over and again forced back the leaden flange; and then a shock of surprise and dismay shot through me.\nThere lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her funeral. She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever; and I could not believe that she was dead. The lips were red, nay redder than before; and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom.\n“Is this a juggle?” I said to him.\n“Are you convinced now?” said the Professor in response, and as he spoke he put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder, pulled back the dead lips and showed the white teeth.\n“See,” he went on, “see, they are even sharper than before. With this and this”—and he touched one of the canine teeth and that below it—“the little children can be bitten. Are you of belief now, friend John?” Once more, argumentative hostility woke within me. I could not accept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested; so, with an attempt to argue of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I said:—\n“She may have been placed here since last night.”\n“Indeed? That is so, and by whom?”\n“I do not know. Some one has done it.”\n“And yet she has been dead one week. Most peoples in that time would not look so.” I had no answer for this, so was silent.",

The funeral service from noon was finished, and the last few mourners had slowly drifted away. Peeking carefully from behind a cluster of alder trees, we watched the sexton lock the gate as he left. This told us we were secure until morning if we wished, but the Professor was certain we wouldn't need more than an hour at most. Again, I was struck by the stark reality of the situation, where imagination felt out of place. I was keenly aware of the legal dangers we faced with this sacrilegious task. On top of that, it all felt utterly futile. While it had been audacious enough to open a lead coffin just to see if a woman dead for nearly a week was actually deceased, repeating the act now seemed the height of foolishness, especially since we had seen with our own eyes that the coffin was empty the night before. I shrugged my shoulders and remained quiet, knowing Van Helsing would proceed with his plan no matter what objections were raised. He took the key, unlocked the crypt, and politely indicated for me to go first again. The place wasn't as horrifying as the previous night, but it looked incredibly shabby and pathetic now that sunlight was streaming in. Van Helsing walked over to Lucy's coffin, and I followed. He bent down and once more forced back the lead seal. Then, a surge of shock and disbelief washed over me. Lucy lay there, appearing exactly as she had the night before we buried her. She looked even more breathtakingly beautiful, if that were possible, and I simply couldn't believe she was dead. Her lips were red, even redder than before, and her cheeks had a soft, delicate colour. \"Is this some kind of trick?\" I asked him. \"Are you convinced now?\" the Professor responded. As he spoke, he reached out his hand and, in a manner that made me recoil, pulled back her lifeless lips to expose her white teeth. \"Look,\" he continued, \"look, they are even sharper than they were. With these\"—touching an upper and lower fang—\"she can bite the little children. Do you believe me now, my friend John?\" My instinctive desire to argue flared up again. I couldn't accept the overwhelming concept he proposed. So, in an attempt to reason that I was instantly ashamed of, I said, \"Maybe she was put back here since last night.\" \"Oh, really? Is that so? And by whom?\" \"I don't know. Someone must have.\" \"But she has been dead for a week. Most people wouldn't look like that after that time.\" I had no reply to this point and remained silent.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "September 27.—We waited until two o’clock before we found the right moment for our plan. The noon funeral had finished, and the last of the mourners eventually wandered off. From behind some alder-trees, we watched as the sexton locked the gate. Now we knew we’d be safe and undisturbed until morning, although the Professor assured me we’d need no more than an hour. Again, I was gripped by a ghastly awareness of our situation, where even imagining things felt pointless; the very real risks we faced with the law because of our grave violation were obvious. Moreover, the whole endeavor seemed pointless. As reckless as it was to open a leaden coffin simply to determine if a woman dead almost a week was truly dead, it seemed utter madness to revisit the tomb now, especially when we’d seen for ourselves the coffin was empty. Still, I didn’t say anything, since Van Helsing always followed his own judgment regardless. He took the key, opened the vault, and politely gestured for me to enter first. In the daylight, the tomb was less frightening than at night but looked miserably shabby as sunshine flooded in. We approached Lucy’s coffin together. Van Helsing leaned over, pried back the lead lid again, and to my shock and horror, I saw something astonishing.\n\nThere lay Lucy, appearing just as we had seen her the night before her burial. She seemed, if anything, even more lovely and full of life; I found it hard to accept that she was truly dead. Her lips were bright red—redder than before—and her cheeks even showed a gentle flush. \n\n“Is this some trick?” I asked.\n\n“Do you believe now?” replied the Professor, as he pulled back her lips with a disturbingly clinical gesture to reveal her white teeth.\n\n“Look,” he said. “See, they’re sharper than ever. With these”—and he indicated the upper and lower canine teeth—“she can bite the little children. Do you believe me yet, John?” My instinct was still to resist his theory. I couldn’t bring myself to accept what he implied, so, slightly embarrassed by my own nonsense, I argued: \n\n“She could have been put here after last night.”\n\n“Really? And who would do that?”\n\n“I don’t know. Someone must have.”\n\n“And yet she’s been dead a week. Most people would not look like this after such a time.” I had nothing to say in reply, so I remained quiet."

He was looking intently at the face of the dead woman, raising the eyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more opening the lips and examining the teeth. Then he turned to me and said:—\n“Here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded; here is some dual life that is not as the common. She was bitten by the vampire when she was in a trance, sleep-walking—oh, you start; you do not know that, friend John, but you shall know it all later—and in trance could he best come to take more blood. In trance she died, and in trance she is Un-Dead, too. So it is that she differ from all other. Usually when the Un-Dead sleep at home”—as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of his arm to designate what to a vampire was “home”—“their face show what they are, but this so sweet that was when she not Un-Dead she go back to the nothings of the common dead. There is no malign there, see, and so it make hard that I must kill her in her sleep.” This turned my blood cold, and it began to dawn upon me that I was accepting Van Helsing’s theories; but if she were really dead, what was there of terror in the idea of killing her? He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in my face, for he said almost joyously:—\n“Ah, you believe now?”\nI answered: “Do not press me too hard all at once. I am willing to accept. How will you do this bloody work?”\n“I shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and I shall drive a stake through her body.” It made me shudder to think of so mutilating the body of the woman whom I had loved. And yet the feeling was not so strong as I had expected. I was, in fact, beginning to shudder at the presence of this being, this Un-Dead, as Van Helsing called it, and to loathe it. Is it possible that love is all subjective, or all objective?\nI waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood as if wrapped in thought. Presently he closed the catch of his bag with a snap, and said:—\n“I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best. If I did simply follow my inclining I would do now, at this moment, what is to be done; but there are other things to follow, and things that are thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know. This is simple. She have yet no life taken, though that is of time; and to act now would be to take danger from her for ever. But then we may have to want Arthur, and how shall we tell him of this? If you, who saw the wounds on Lucy’s throat, and saw the wounds so similar on the child’s at the hospital; if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and full to-day with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more beautiful in a whole week, after she die—if you know of this and know of the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard, and yet of your own senses you did not believe, how, then, can I expect Arthur, who know none of those things, to believe? He doubted me when I took him from her kiss when she was dying. I know he has forgiven me because in some mistaken idea I have done things that prevent him say good-bye as he ought; and he may think that in some more mistaken idea this woman was buried alive; and that in most mistake of all we have killed her. He will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, that have killed her by our ideas; and so he will be much unhappy always. Yet he never can be sure; and that is the worst of all. And he will sometimes think that she he loved was buried alive, and that will paint his dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered; and again, he will think that we may be right, and that his so beloved was, after all, an Un-Dead. No! I told him once, and since then I learn much. Now, since I know it is all true, a hundred thousand times more do I know that he must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet. He, poor fellow, must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to him; then we can act for good all round and send him peace. My mind is made up. Let us go. You return home for to-night to your asylum, and see that all be well. As for me, I shall spend the night here in this churchyard in my own way. To-morrow night you will come to me to the Berkeley Hotel at ten of the clock. I shall send for Arthur to come too, and also that so fine young man of America that gave his blood. Later we shall all have work to do. I come with you so far as Piccadilly and there dine, for I must be back here before the sun set.”\nSo we locked the tomb and came away, and got over the wall of the churchyard, which was not much of a task, and drove back to Piccadilly.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Van Helsing seemed not to notice my lack of speech, displaying neither frustration nor victory. He concentrated intensely on the deceased woman's face, lifting her eyelids to examine her eyes and again opening her lips to inspect her teeth. Then he turned to me and stated:\r\n“Here, there is something unique, unlike anything previously documented; here is a dual existence that deviates from the norm. She was bitten by the vampire while she was in a trance, sleepwalking—oh, you are surprised; you were unaware of that, my friend John, but you will learn all about it later—and being in a trance allowed him to more easily take blood. She died while in a trance, and she continues as Un-Dead while in a trance as well. This is how she differs from all others. Typically when the Un-Dead 'sleep' in their homes”—as he spoke, he swept his arm comprehensively to indicate what serves as a vampire's \"home\"—\"their faces reveal their true nature, but this sweet being, when not Un-Dead, reverts to the appearance of a normal corpse. There is no malice visible, you see, which makes it difficult that I must end her while she appears to be sleeping.” This statement chilled me, and I began to realize I was accepting Van Helsing’s theories; but if she were truly dead, what was frightening about the idea of killing her? He looked up at me and clearly saw the change in my expression, for he said almost gleefully:\r\n“Ah, do you believe now?”\r\nI replied: “Do not pressure me too much at once. I am willing to accept. How will you carry out this gruesome task?”\r\n“I will decapitate her, fill her mouth with garlic, and drive a stake through her body.” It made me recoil at the thought of such a terrible mutilation to the body of the woman I had loved. And yet the feeling was not as intense as I had anticipated. I was, in fact, beginning to shrink away from the presence of this creature, this Un-Dead, as Van Helsing termed it, and to despise it. Is it possible that love is entirely internal, or entirely external?\r\nI waited for a considerable period for Van Helsing to start, but he remained still, seemingly deep in thought. Presently, he closed the clasp of his bag with a sharp sound and said:\r\n“I have been considering the matter and have made up my mind about the best course of action. If I were simply to follow my immediate impulse, I would perform what needs to be done right now, at this very instant; but there are subsequent steps to take, and those are a thousand times more challenging because we are uncertain about them. This is simple. She has not yet taken a life, though that is only a matter of time; and acting now would remove the danger she poses permanently. But then we may require Arthur's presence, and how shall we explain this to him? If you, who witnessed the wounds on Lucy’s neck, and saw the identical wounds on the child at the hospital; if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and full today with a woman who has only become more radiant and more beautiful over a whole week after she died—if you know all this and saw the pale shape last night that brought the child to the graveyard, and yet despite your own senses, you did not believe, how, then, can I expect Arthur, who is unaware of any of these things, to believe? He doubted me when I pulled him away from her kiss as she was dying. I know he has pardoned me, perhaps thinking in some mistaken way I prevented him from saying a proper goodbye; and he may believe that in some further error, this woman was buried alive; and that in the greatest mistake of all, we have killed her. He will then argue that it is we, in our error, who have killed her with our ideas; and so he will forever be deeply unhappy. Yet he can never be certain; and that is the cruelest aspect. And he will sometimes believe that the woman he loved was interred alive, which will fill his dreams with horrors of her presumed suffering; and other times, he will think we might be correct, and that his beloved was, after all, an Un-Dead. No! I spoke to him once, and since then I have learned much. Now that I know it is all true, I realize a hundred thousand times more that he must endure profound hardship to reach peace. He, poor fellow, must face an hour that will darken the very face of heaven for him; then we can act effectively for everyone involved and bring him peace. My decision is made. Let us go. You will return to your home tonight to your asylum, and ensure everything is in order. As for me, I will spend the night here in this churchyard in my own way. Tomorrow night, come to me at the Berkeley Hotel at ten o'clock. I will arrange for Arthur to come too, as well as that fine young American man who gave his blood. Later, we will all have tasks to accomplish. I will accompany you as far as Piccadilly and dine there, as I must be back here before the sun sets.”\r\nSo we secured the tomb and departed, climbing over the graveyard wall, which was not a difficult feat, and drove back to Piccadilly.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Van Helsing seemed unaffected by my silence, neither annoyed nor triumphant. He carefully studied the dead woman’s face, lifting her eyelids to look at her eyes, and inspecting her teeth once again. Then he told me that there was something about her case unlike anything previously known: she had a kind of dual existence. She was bitten while in a trance, sleepwalking—even though I was startled to hear that, Van Helsing said I would learn everything in time. That state of trance made her an easier victim for the vampire, and that was how she died and became ‘Un-Dead’ while still in a trance. This, he said, set her apart from other cases. Normally, when vampires rest in their coffins, their faces reveal what they are, but Lucy’s face looked just as sweet as before she became a vampire, reverting to the peaceful appearance of a typical corpse—no sign of evil, which made the thought of killing her in her sleep even more difficult. This chilled me, and I realized I was beginning to accept Van Helsing’s theories. Yet, I wondered why the act of destroying her should seem so frightening if she was already dead. Van Helsing, perceiving my change in attitude, asked if I finally believed him. I replied cautiously, willing to accept but not to rush. I asked how he would carry out such a brutal act. He replied bluntly: he would cut off her head, stuff her mouth with garlic, and drive a stake through her body. The thought of such violence to the woman I loved made me shudder, but not as much as I imagined; instead, I began to feel disgust for her as a vampire rather than love for her as I once did, making me wonder about the nature of love itself. I waited a while for Van Helsing to begin, but he remained still in thought. Eventually, he snapped his bag shut, saying he had made up his mind. He confessed that, if he followed his inclinations, he would proceed immediately, but other, far more complicated considerations needed to be resolved. Though destroying Lucy now would remove the danger she posed forever, there was the matter of Arthur. How could they explain everything to Arthur, who didn’t know all the facts? If even I, who witnessed all the wounds and strange events, still struggled to believe, how could Arthur—who knew none of it—accept the truth? If they acted without telling him, Arthur might think they had buried Lucy alive, and that the actions Van Helsing took from love were actually mistaken and cruel, filling Arthur’s dreams with horror. Alternatively, Arthur might eventually believe the truth and be tormented by the idea the woman he loved was a vampire. Van Helsing concluded Arthur needed to endure a terrible moment before achieving peace. Firm in his decision, Van Helsing told me to return home to check on things at my asylum, while he would stay in the churchyard that night. The next night, I was to meet him at the Berkeley Hotel with Arthur and the American who had also given blood, as they would all have much to do. Van Helsing would accompany me as far as Piccadilly to dine before returning to the churchyard before sunset. So we locked the tomb, left the churchyard, and returned to Piccadilly."

It pleases me that the Un-Dead, Miss Lucy, shall not leave to-night, that so on the morrow night she may be more eager. Therefore I shall fix some things she like not—garlic and a crucifix—and so seal up the door of the tomb. She is young as Un-Dead, and will heed. Moreover, these are only to prevent her coming out; they may not prevail on her wanting to get in; for then the Un-Dead is desperate, and must find the line of least resistance, whatsoever it may be. I shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the sunrise, and if there be aught that may be learned I shall learn it. For Miss Lucy or from her, I have no fear; but that other to whom is there that she is Un-Dead, he have now the power to seek her tomb and find shelter. He is cunning, as I know from Mr. Jonathan and from the way that all along he have fooled us when he played with us for Miss Lucy’s life, and we lost; and in many ways the Un-Dead are strong. He have always the strength in his hand of twenty men; even we four who gave our strength to Miss Lucy it also is all to him. Besides, he can summon his wolf and I know not what. So if it be that he come thither on this night he shall find me; but none other shall—until it be too late. But it may be that he will not attempt the place. There is no reason why he should; his hunting ground is more full of game than the churchyard where the Un-Dead woman sleep, and the one old man watch.\n“Therefore I write this in case.... Take the papers that are with this, the diaries of Harker and the rest, and read them, and then find this great Un-Dead, and cut off his head and burn his heart or drive a stake through it, so that the world may rest from him.\n“If it be so, farewell.\n“Van Helsing.”",

I am proceeding alone to keep vigil in the cemetery. My intention is that the creature known as the Un-Dead, Miss Lucy, will be unable to leave tonight, thereby making her more desperate tomorrow evening. To achieve this, I shall arrange certain items she dislikes—specifically, garlic and a crucifix—to secure the entrance to the tomb. Since she is recently converted to the Un-Dead state, she is likely to be affected by these measures. Furthermore, these items are solely for preventing her exit; they might not stop her intense desire to enter the tomb should she become desperate, as the Un-Dead will then follow the easiest path available, whatever it may be. I will remain on guard throughout the entire night, from dusk until after dawn, resolved to discover whatever information can be gleaned. I feel no apprehension regarding Miss Lucy or from her; however, I am concerned about the other entity responsible for her condition. He now possesses the capability to locate her tomb and use it as a refuge. He is incredibly shrewd, as I have learned both from Mr. Jonathan Harker's account and from observing how completely he deceived us while we struggled for Miss Lucy’s life—a struggle we unfortunately lost. The Un-Dead possess many forms of power. His physical strength is equivalent to that of twenty men; even the combined strength we four exerted to save Miss Lucy is insignificant to him. Additionally, he can summon his wolf companion and other unknown forces. Therefore, if he attempts to come to this place tonight, he will encounter me; but no one else will discover my presence until it is too late. Yet, it is possible he may not try to reach the location. There is no compelling reason for him to do so; his usual hunting territories offer far more prey than this graveyard containing the sleeping Un-Dead woman and the solitary old man keeping watch.\n\nFor these reasons, I am writing this in case... Please take the documents accompanying this note, including the journals of Harker and the others, and read them thoroughly. Then, locate this formidable Un-Dead being, sever his head, and either incinerate his heart or pierce it with a stake, so that humanity may finally be free from his evil.\n\nShould this be the outcome, farewell.\n\nVan Helsing.\"",

He plans to use garlic and a crucifix to seal the tomb’s door, since as a new Un-Dead, Lucy will obey these barriers. These defenses are just to stop her from leaving, but he notes that if she becomes desperate to enter, they might not be enough, as the Un-Dead are resourceful. Van Helsing will be on guard all night, looking to learn whatever he can. He is not afraid of Lucy, but worries about the other Un-Dead, known for their cunning and immense strength—strong enough to equal that of twenty men, and able to command wolves and perhaps even more. If this other vampire appears, Van Helsing will confront him alone, and no one else will be there in time to help. However, the vampire may not come, since the cemetery holds less value as a hunting ground than other places. Van Helsing urges John, if anything happens, to read the attached papers and diaries, seek out the main vampire, and destroy him by beheading, burning the heart, or staking him, to save the world from his evil.

I'm certain that he sincerely believes everything he says. I question if perhaps his mental state has deteriorated. There must surely be a logical explanation for all these strange occurrences. Could the Professor himself possibly be behind it? He is so exceptionally intelligent that if he were to lose his sanity, he would pursue a particular obsession with astonishing effectiveness. I am reluctant to consider this, and indeed, discovering Van Helsing was insane would be almost as incredible as the alternative explanation, but regardless, I will observe him closely. Perhaps I can shed some light on this enigma.",

Yesterday, I almost found myself accepting Van Helsing’s unbelievable theories, but now in the clear light of day, they seem completely illogical and absurd. I have no doubt that he truly believes what he says, but I wonder if his mind might be unbalanced in some way. There has to be a logical explanation for all these strange events. Could it be possible that the Professor himself is responsible? He is so incredibly intelligent that, if he lost his sanity, he could easily act on a singular obsession in a remarkable manner. I hesitate to believe this, and it would be just as astonishing as his other claims to find that Van Helsing was actually insane; in any case, I will keep a close eye on him. Perhaps I will discover some clue to explain the mystery."

Last night, at a little before ten o’clock, Arthur and Quincey came into Van Helsing’s room; he told us all that he wanted us to do, but especially addressing himself to Arthur, as if all our wills were centred in his. He began by saying that he hoped we would all come with him too, “for,” he said, “there is a grave duty to be done there. You were doubtless surprised at my letter?” This query was directly addressed to Lord Godalming.\n“I was. It rather upset me for a bit. There has been so much trouble around my house of late that I could do without any more. I have been curious, too, as to what you mean. Quincey and I talked it over; but the more we talked, the more puzzled we got, till now I can say for myself that I’m about up a tree as to any meaning about anything.”\n“Me too,” said Quincey Morris laconically.\n“Oh,” said the Professor, “then you are nearer the beginning, both of you, than friend John here, who has to go a long way back before he can even get so far as to begin.”\nIt was evident that he recognised my return to my old doubting frame of mind without my saying a word. Then, turning to the other two, he said with intense gravity:—\n“I want your permission to do what I think good this night. It is, I know, much to ask; and when you know what it is I propose to do you will know, and only then, how much. Therefore may I ask that you promise me in the dark, so that afterwards, though you may be angry with me for a time—I must not disguise from myself the possibility that such may be—you shall not blame yourselves for anything.”\n“That’s frank anyhow,” broke in Quincey. “I’ll answer for the Professor. I don’t quite see his drift, but I swear he’s honest; and that’s good enough for me.”\n“I thank you, sir,” said Van Helsing proudly. “I have done myself the honour of counting you one trusting friend, and such endorsement is dear to me.” He held out a hand, which Quincey took.",

He explained what he needed us all to do, but directed his explanation primarily at Arthur, as if Arthur embodied our collective determination. He started by hoping we would all go with him, because, as he put it, 'there is a significant duty to be performed there.' He then asked Lord Godalming directly if his letter had taken him by surprise. 'It did,' Arthur replied. 'It rather disturbed me for a while. There has been so much trouble near my home recently that I could do without any more. I've also been curious about what you mean. Quincey and I discussed it at length, but the more we talked, the more perplexed we became, until now I can say I am completely at a loss regarding any meaning in anything.' 'Me too,' added Quincey Morris succinctly. 'Oh,' said the Professor, 'then you are both closer to the beginning of understanding than our friend John here, who has a long way to go back before he can even reach the point of beginning.' It was clear he had noticed my return to a skeptical mindset without me saying a word. Then, turning to the other two, he said with intense seriousness, 'I request your permission to do what I believe is right tonight. I know this is a great deal to ask; and when you know what I intend to do, you will then, and only then, understand how much. Therefore, may I ask that you promise me blindly, so that afterwards, even though you might be angry with me for a period—I must admit the possibility exists—you won't blame yourselves for anything.' 'That's certainly direct,' Quincey broke in. 'I'll stand by the Professor. I don't entirely see what he's getting at, but I swear he's honest, and that's enough for me.' 'I thank you, sir,' said Van Helsing with pride. 'I have had the honour of counting you as a trusting friend, and such confirmation is precious to me.' He extended a hand, which Quincey took.",

Van Helsing explained what he wanted us to do, directing his comments mainly to Arthur as if he were our leader. He began by saying he wanted us all to join him because there was an important and solemn task ahead, and asked if Lord Godalming had been surprised by his letter. Lord Godalming replied that he was indeed surprised and that, given the recent troubles affecting his home, he was unsettled and had been trying to figure it all out with Quincey—without success. Quincey agreed, stating he was just as confused. The Professor responded that, in fact, both of them were closer to understanding than John, who had to overcome his own doubts first. Recognizing my uncertainty without me saying anything, the professor turned seriously to the others and asked if they would give him permission to act as he saw fit that night. He knew it was a big request and admitted that when they found out his intentions, they might be upset, but he wanted their promise now so they wouldn’t blame themselves later. Quincey interjected, saying he trusted the Professor’s honesty, even if he didn’t fully understand, and that was enough for him. Van Helsing thanked him warmly and, calling him a trusted friend, shook his hand."

Arthur went on: “And when there?”\n“To enter the tomb!” Arthur stood up.\n“Professor, are you in earnest; or it is some monstrous joke? Pardon me, I see that you are in earnest.” He sat down again, but I could see that he sat firmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity. There was silence until he asked again:—\n“And when in the tomb?”\n“To open the coffin.”\n“This is too much!” he said, angrily rising again. “I am willing to be patient in all things that are reasonable; but in this—this desecration of the grave—of one who——” He fairly choked with indignation.

But if she be not dead——”\nArthur jumped to his feet.\n“Good God!” he cried. “What do you mean? Has there been any mistake; has she been buried alive?” He groaned in anguish that not even hope could soften.\n“I did not say she was alive, my child; I did not think it. I go no further than to say that she might be Un-Dead.”\n“Un-Dead! Not alive! What do you mean? Is this all a nightmare, or what is it?”\n“There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they may solve only in part. Believe me, we are now on the verge of one. But I have not done. May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy?”\n“Heavens and earth, no!” cried Arthur in a storm of passion. “Not for the wide world will I consent to any mutilation of her dead body. Dr. Van Helsing, you try me too far. What have I done to you that you should torture me so? What did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want to cast such dishonour on her grave? Are you mad to speak such things, or am I mad to listen to them? Don’t dare to think more of such a desecration; I shall not give my consent to anything you do. I have a duty to do in protecting her grave from outrage; and, by God, I shall do it!”\nVan Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated, and said, gravely and sternly:—\n“My Lord Godalming, I, too, have a duty to do, a duty to others, a duty to you, a duty to the dead; and, by God, I shall do it! All I ask you now is that you come with me, that you look and listen; and if when later I make the same request you do not be more eager for its fulfilment even than I am, then—then I shall do my duty, whatever it may seem to me. And then, to follow of your Lordship’s wishes I shall hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you, when and where you will.” His voice broke a little, and he went on with a voice full of pity:—\n“But, I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me. In a long life of acts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes did wring my heart, I have never had so heavy a task as now. Believe me that if the time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look from you will wipe away all this so sad hour, for I would do what a man can to save you from sorrow. Just think. For why should I give myself so much of labour and so much of sorrow? I have come here from my own land to do what I can of good; at the first to please my friend John, and then to help a sweet young lady, whom, too, I came to love. For her—I am ashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness—I gave what you gave; the blood of my veins; I gave it, I, who was not, like you, her lover, but only her physician and her friend. I gave to her my nights and days—before death, after death; and if my death can do her good even now, when she is the dead Un-Dead, she shall have it freely.” He said this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much affected by it. He took the old man’s hand and said in a broken voice:—\n“Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand; but at least I shall go with you and wait.”",

He stated that if Van Helsing could guarantee his plan didn't violate either of these, he would consent immediately, though he admitted he had no idea what Van Helsing was suggesting. Van Helsing accepted Arthur's condition, asking only that if Arthur felt compelled to disapprove of any action, he first consider it carefully to ensure it genuinely went against his reservations. Arthur agreed, calling it fair, and asked what they were supposed to do now that the preliminary discussions were finished. Van Helsing revealed he wanted Arthur to accompany him, secretly, to the Kingstead churchyard. Arthur's face fell as he asked, surprised, if that was where poor Lucy was buried. The Professor nodded. Arthur then asked what they would do there. \"Enter the tomb!\" Van Helsing replied. Arthur stood up, asking if the Professor was serious or making a cruel joke, but quickly saw he was serious and sat back down, looking firm and dignified. After a silence, he asked again what they would do once inside the tomb. \"To open the coffin.\" Arthur exclaimed angrily, standing again. \"This is too much! I can be patient with anything reasonable, but this—this desecration of the grave—of someone who—\" He was overcome with indignation and couldn't finish. The Professor looked at him with pity. \"If I could spare you any pain, my poor friend,\" he said, \"God knows I would. But tonight we must face difficult paths; otherwise, the feet you love will forever walk in paths of flame!\" Arthur looked up, his face pale and set, and warned Van Helsing to be careful. Van Helsing suggested it would be best to hear him out to understand the full scope of his intention, asking if he should continue. Morris interrupted, saying that was fair enough.

But if she isn't dead—\" Arthur sprang to his feet. \"Good God!\" he cried. \"What do you mean? Was there a mistake? Was she buried alive?\" He groaned in agony. \"I didn't say she was alive, my dear boy; I don't believe that. I only suggest she *might* be Un-Dead.\" \"Un-Dead! Not alive! What is this? Is it a nightmare?\" \"There are mysteries that men can only guess at, mysteries that may take ages to solve fully. Believe me, we are on the edge of one now. But I'm not finished. May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy?\" \"Heavens and earth, no!\" Arthur cried in a burst of fury. \"Not for anything in the world will I consent to any mutilation of her dead body. Dr. Van Helsing, you are pushing me too far. What have I done to deserve such torment? What did that poor, sweet girl do to warrant such dishonor on her grave? Are you insane to suggest this, or am I insane to listen? Don't even think about such a desecration again; I will not allow anything you do. I have a duty to protect her grave from outrage, and I swear to God I will do it!\" Van Helsing stood up from where he had been sitting, saying gravely and sternly: \"My Lord Godalming, I, too, have a duty—a duty to others, to you, to the dead; and by God, I will fulfill it! All I ask now is that you come with me, that you observe and listen. And if later, when I make the same request, you are not more eager for its completion than I am, then—then I will do my duty as I see fit. And then, respecting your Lordship's wishes, I will make myself available to explain myself to you, whenever and wherever you desire.\" His voice broke slightly, and he continued with great pity: \"But, I implore you, do not be angry with me. In a long life filled with unpleasant tasks that sometimes pained me deeply, I have never faced a task as difficult as this. Believe me, if the time comes for you to change your mind about me, a single look from you will erase the pain of this sad hour, for I want to do everything possible to spare you sorrow. Just consider. Why else would I subject myself to such effort and grief? I came here from my own country to do good, first to help my friend John, and then to assist a sweet young lady whom I also came to love. For her—I am hesitant to say this much, but I speak out of kindness—I gave what you gave: the blood from my veins. I gave it, I, who was not her lover like you, but only her physician and friend. I gave her my days and nights—before death, after death; and if my own death can help her now, even in her state as the dead Un-Dead, she shall have it freely.\" He spoke with quiet, noble pride, and Arthur was deeply moved.

I only ask that you come with me, observe, and when I repeat my request, if you are not more eager than I, I will still do my duty. Afterwards, I’ll answer to you, however you require.” His voice faltered, then, with compassion, he added, “Please, don’t be angry with me. I’ve had to do many hard things in my life, but never one as painful as this. If ever you think differently of me, I’ll forget this sad hour at your word; I want to save you from pain. Why else do I endure this sorrow? I came from my homeland first to help my friend John, then to aid a dear young woman whom I also grew to care for. For her, I gave as you did: my own blood, though I was only her doctor and friend. I gave her my time and care—before and after her death; and if my own death could help her now, as the Un-Dead, I would give it.” He spoke with earnestness, and Arthur, deeply moved, took his hand and said, his voice cracking, “It is hard for me to comprehend, but I will go with you and wait.”"

When we had come close to the tomb I looked well at Arthur, for I feared that the proximity to a place laden with so sorrowful a memory would upset him; but he bore himself well. I took it that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant to his grief. The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing a natural hesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the difficulty by entering first himself. The rest of us followed, and he closed the door. He then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin. Arthur stepped forward hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to me:—\n“You were with me here yesterday. Was the body of Miss Lucy in that coffin?”\n“It was.” The Professor turned to the rest saying:—\n“You hear; and yet there is no one who does not believe with me.” He took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin. Arthur looked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed he stepped forward. He evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or, at any rate, had not thought of it. When he saw the rent in the lead, the blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away again, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness; he was still silent. Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in and recoiled.\nThe coffin was empty!\nFor several minutes no one spoke a word. The silence was broken by Quincey Morris:—\n“Professor, I answered for you. Your word is all I want. I wouldn’t ask such a thing ordinarily—I wouldn’t so dishonour you as to imply a doubt; but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour. Is this your doing?”\n“I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed nor touched her. What happened was this: Two nights ago my friend Seward and I came here—with good purpose, believe me. I opened that coffin, which was then sealed up, and we found it, as now, empty. We then waited, and saw something white come through the trees. The next day we came here in day-time, and she lay there. Did she not, friend John?”\n“Yes.”\n“That night we were just in time. One more so small child was missing, and we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves. Yesterday I came here before sundown, for at sundown the Un-Dead can move. I waited here all the night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing. It was most probable that it was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic, which the Un-Dead cannot bear, and other things which they shun. Last night there was no exodus, so to-night before the sundown I took away my garlic and other things. And so it is we find this coffin empty. But bear with me. So far there is much that is strange. Wait you with me outside, unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be. So”—here he shut the dark slide of his lantern—“now to the outside.” He opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking the door behind him.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "It was just before midnight, a quarter to twelve, when we climbed over the low wall into the churchyard. The night was dark, with only occasional glimpses of moonlight breaking through the thick clouds overhead. We stayed close together, with Van Helsing slightly ahead, leading the way. As we neared the tomb, I carefully watched Arthur, concerned that being close to such a sorrowful place might distress him, but he seemed to handle it well. I thought the strange nature of our task might be distracting him from his grief. The Professor unlocked the door. Noticing that we were all hesitant for different reasons, he resolved the issue by entering first himself. We followed him inside, and he closed the door behind us. He then lit a dark lantern and directed our attention to the coffin. Arthur stepped forward with some hesitation. Van Helsing asked me, 'You were here with me yesterday. Was Miss Lucy's body in that coffin?' I replied, 'It was.' The Professor then turned to the others and said, 'You heard that; yet everyone here believes me.' He picked up his screwdriver and removed the coffin lid again. Arthur watched, very pale but silent. When the lid was off, he stepped closer. He clearly hadn't known there was a lead coffin or hadn't considered it. When he saw the tear in the lead, color rushed to his face for a moment, but it quickly vanished, leaving him frighteningly white; he remained silent. Van Helsing pushed back the leaden edge, and we all looked inside and drew back in shock. The coffin was empty! For several minutes, no one spoke. Quincey Morris broke the silence, saying, 'Professor, I vouched for you. Your word is enough for me. I wouldn't usually ask such a thing—I wouldn't insult you by suggesting a doubt; but this mystery goes beyond any question of honor or dishonor. Did you do this?' Van Helsing swore to them by everything he held sacred that he had not removed or touched her. He explained, 'Here's what happened: Two nights ago, my friend Seward and I came here—with good intentions, I assure you. I opened that coffin, which was sealed then, and we found it, just as it is now, empty. We waited and saw something white move through the trees. The next day, we returned during the daytime, and she was lying there. Isn't that right, friend John?' Seward confirmed, 'Yes.' Van Helsing continued, 'That night we arrived just in time. Another small child was missing, and thank God, we found it unharmed among the graves. Yesterday, I came here before sundown, because the Un-Dead can move after the sun sets. I waited here all night until sunrise, but I didn't see anything. It was most likely because I had placed garlic, which the Un-Dead cannot stand, and other things they avoid, on the clamps of these doors. Last night there was no departure, so tonight, before sundown, I removed my garlic and the other things. And that's why we find this coffin empty now. But be patient with me. So far, much is strange. Wait with me outside, where we can't be seen or heard, and things much stranger are still to come. So'—here he closed the dark slide on his lantern—'now let's go outside.' He opened the door, and we exited in single file, with him coming last and locking the door behind him.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "It was just before midnight when we entered the churchyard by climbing over the low wall. The night was mostly dark, though moonlight would sometimes shine through breaks in the thick, fast-moving clouds. We stayed close together, with Van Helsing leading us. As we neared the tomb, I watched Arthur closely, worried that being near such a painful memory might distress him; but he handled it bravely. I suspected that the mysterious nature of what we were doing helped distract him from his grief. The Professor unlocked the door, and, sensing our hesitation, went in first, then we all followed and he shut the door. He lit a dark lantern and indicated the coffin. Arthur moved forward uncertainly. Van Helsing addressed me: \"You were with me here yesterday. Was Miss Lucy's body in that coffin then?\" I confirmed that it was. Van Helsing then told the others, emphasizing our agreement. He unscrewed the coffin lid. Arthur, very pale and silent, watched; he didn't seem to know about the lead coffin, or at least hadn't thought of it. When he saw the torn lead, blood briefly rushed to his face before he turned very pale again, still saying nothing. Van Helsing pulled back the lead, and when we looked inside, we all recoiled in shock: the coffin was empty! No one spoke for several minutes until Quincey Morris broke the silence, asking the Professor directly if he was responsible, though he trusted him. Van Helsing swore he hadn't touched or moved Lucy, and explained that two nights ago, he and Dr. Seward had opened the previously sealed coffin to find it empty. That night, they saw something white among the trees. The next day, in daylight, Lucy's body was present again. Dr. Seward confirmed this. That night, they discovered a missing child, unharmed, among the graves. Van Helsing then described how, before sunset the previous night, he placed garlic and other protective items on the coffin to prevent the \"Un-Dead\" from leaving; nothing happened that night. But the next night, he removed the protections before sunset, and now the coffin was empty. He urged everyone to wait outside, as stranger things were yet to happen. He then covered his lantern and led everyone out, locking the door behind him."

          "text_segment": "Oh! but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of that vault. How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the passing gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and passing—like the gladness and sorrow of a man’s life; how sweet it was to breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and decay; how humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city. Each in his own way was solemn and overcome. Arthur was silent, and was, I could see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the mystery. I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again to throw aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing’s conclusions. Quincey Morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, and accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all he has to stake. Not being able to smoke, he cut himself a good-sized plug of tobacco and began to chew. As to Van Helsing, he was employed in a definite way. First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like thin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a white napkin; next he took out a double-handful of some whitish stuff, like dough or putty. He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the mass between his hands. This he then took, and rolling it into thin strips, began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its setting in the tomb. I was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close, asked him what it was that he was doing. Arthur and Quincey drew near also, as they too were curious. He answered:—\n“I am closing the tomb, so that the Un-Dead may not enter.”\n“And is that stuff you have put there going to do it?” asked Quincey. “Great Scott! Is this a game?”\n“It is.”\n“What is that which you are using?” This time the question was by Arthur. Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered:—\n“The Host. I brought it from Amsterdam. I have an Indulgence.” It was an answer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt individually that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the Professor’s, a purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it was impossible to distrust. In respectful silence we took the places assigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any one approaching. I pitied the others, especially Arthur. I had myself been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror; and yet I, who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink within me. Never did tombs look so ghastly white; never did cypress, or yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom; never did tree or grass wave or rustle so ominously; never did bough creak so mysteriously; and never did the far-away howling of dogs send such a woeful presage through the night.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Upon leaving the terrifying vault, the night air felt wonderfully clean and refreshing. It was a pleasure to watch the swift-moving clouds and the intermittent moonlight breaking through them, much like the alternating periods of happiness and sadness in a person's life. Breathing the pure air, free from any hint of death or decay, was a comfort. It felt grounding and humanizing to see the distant red glow of the city lights on the horizon and hear the muffled sounds of its life. Each of us was solemn and affected in our own way. Arthur was quiet, visibly trying to comprehend the significance and deeper meaning of the mystery. I myself remained reasonably calm, again almost ready to cast aside my doubts and accept Van Helsing's beliefs. Quincey Morris displayed the stoicism of a man who accepts everything with cool courage, prepared to risk whatever he possesses. Unable to smoke, he cut off a substantial piece of chewing tobacco. Van Helsing, meanwhile, was focused on a specific task. First, he took from his bag a thin, delicate item resembling a wafer, which was carefully wrapped in a white cloth. Next, he produced a double handful of a pale substance, like dough or putty. He crumbled the wafer into small pieces and worked it into the other material with his hands. He then took this mixture, rolled it into thin strips, and began pressing them into the gaps between the tomb's door and its frame. I was quite puzzled by this and, being nearby, asked him what he was doing. Arthur and Quincey also came closer, equally curious. He replied, \"I am sealing the tomb so the Un-Dead cannot get in.\" Quincey asked, \"And that stuff you've put there is supposed to do that? Great Scott! Is this a joke?\" Van Helsing stated, \"It is.\" Arthur then asked, \"What is that material you are using?\" Van Helsing reverently removed his hat before answering, \"The Host. I brought it from Amsterdam. I have special permission.\" This answer startled even the most skeptical among us, and we individually felt that in the face of the Professor's profound dedication – a purpose that allowed him to use something so sacred to him – it was impossible to be suspicious. In respectful silence, we took the positions assigned to us, close to the tomb but concealed from anyone who might approach. I felt pity for the others, especially Arthur. My previous experiences observing this horror had somewhat prepared me, yet even I, who had been rejecting the evidence just an hour earlier, felt a wave of dread wash over me. The tombs had never looked so terrifyingly white; the cypress, yew, or juniper trees had never seemed such perfect symbols of sorrowful darkness; no tree or grass had ever rustled or swayed so menacingly; no branch had ever creaked so strangely; and the distant howling of dogs had never conveyed such a dreadful warning through the night.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "After the terror of the vault, the outside air felt wonderfully fresh and clean. It was comforting to look up and watch clouds racing across the sky, with glimpses of moonlight shining through between them—reminding me of the ups and downs in a person’s life. The air was sweet, untouched by any trace of death or decay, making it feel revitalizing just to breathe. Seeing the distant red glow of the sky over the hill and hearing the faint, low roar of the city far away felt deeply humanizing. We were all solemn and subdued in our own ways. Arthur stayed quiet, clearly trying to comprehend the true meaning of what we’d witnessed. I managed to remain calm and was even ready to accept Van Helsing’s explanations without further doubt. Quincey Morris seemed cool and composed, as though he was ready to face whatever came, bravely taking things as they were. Since he couldn’t smoke, he took out some tobacco to chew instead. Van Helsing, meanwhile, busied himself with a specific task: from his bag, he produced what looked like thin, biscuit-like wafers in a napkin, along with a double handful of something pale like dough or putty. He crumbled the wafer into the mixture and kneaded it in his hands, forming it into thin strips and pressing them into the crevices around the tomb door. Curious, I asked what he was doing, and Arthur and Quincey came closer as well. Van Helsing explained that he was sealing the tomb to stop the Un-Dead from entering. When asked if his method would really work and what exactly he was using, Van Helsing respectfully removed his hat and answered it was the Host, which he had brought from Amsterdam with a special permission. This response filled even the most skeptical among us with awe, and, sensing his deep sincerity in employing such sacred items, we followed his instructions and took up our watch near the tomb, hidden from anyone who might approach. I felt a sense of pity for the others—especially Arthur. Having already endured previous vigils, I was somewhat more accustomed to the ordeal, yet I still found myself deeply unsettled despite having previously denied the evidence before me. The tombs had never looked so unnaturally white, the dark trees so oppressive, and every sound—branches creaking, grass rustling, dogs howling in the distance—felt ominous and hauntingly sorrowful."

The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray of moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startling prominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave. We could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we saw to be a fair-haired child. There was a pause and a sharp little cry, such as a child gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams. We were starting forward, but the Professor’s warning hand, seen by us as he stood behind a yew-tree, kept us back; and then as we looked the white figure moved forwards again. It was now near enough for us to see clearly, and the moonlight still held. My own heart grew cold as ice, and I could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognised the features of Lucy Westenra. Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed. The sweetness was turned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuous wantonness. Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, we all advanced too; the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the tomb. Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide; by the concentrated light that fell on Lucy’s face we could see that the lips were crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over her chin and stained the purity of her lawn death-robe.\nWe shuddered with horror. I could see by the tremulous light that even Van Helsing’s iron nerve had failed. Arthur was next to me, and if I had not seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen.\nWhen Lucy—I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore her shape—saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat gives when taken unawares; then her eyes ranged over us. Lucy’s eyes in form and colour; but Lucy’s eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead of the pure, gentle orbs we knew. At that moment the remnant of my love passed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, I could have done it with savage delight. As she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy light, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile. Oh, God, how it made me shudder to see it! With a careless motion, she flung to the ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now she had clutched strenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog growls over a bone. The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning. There was a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from Arthur; when she advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell back and hid his face in his hands.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Following a lengthy period of intense quiet, an agonizing void, a sharp 'S-s-s-s!' came from the Professor. He gestured, and far off, down the yew-lined path, we observed a pale figure moving—an indistinct white form clutching something dark to its chest. The figure paused, and a shaft of moonlight suddenly penetrated the thick, moving clouds, starkly illuminating a dark-haired woman clothed in funeral garments. We couldn't see her face, as it was bent low over what we then discerned was a fair-haired child. A brief pause was followed by a sharp little cry, like a child's sound in sleep or a dog's yelp while dreaming by the fire. We began to step forward, but the Professor's warning hand, visible as he stood hidden behind a yew tree, held us back. As we continued to watch, the white figure moved forward again. It was now close enough for us to see distinctly, with the moonlight still strong. My heart immediately turned to ice, and I heard Arthur's gasp as we identified the features as Lucy Westenra's. It was Lucy Westenra, yet utterly transformed. Her sweetness had morphed into an unyielding, heartless cruelty, and her purity into a sensuous, unrestrained depravity. Van Helsing stepped forward, and, following his motion, we all advanced as well, the four of us arrayed in a line before the tomb's entrance. Van Helsing raised his lantern and adjusted the slide; by the concentrated beam falling on Lucy's face, we could see that her lips were a vivid crimson with fresh blood, which had trickled down her chin and stained the pristine white of her burial shroud. We recoiled in horror. I could tell from the unsteady light that even Van Helsing's renowned composure had faltered. Arthur was beside me, and I had to grasp his arm and support him to prevent him from collapsing. When Lucy—I refer to the entity before us as Lucy because it bore her appearance—saw us, she pulled back with an angry snarl, similar to a cat startled unaware. Then her gaze swept over us. Her eyes were Lucy's in form and color, but they were corrupted and filled with hellish fire, not the innocent, gentle eyes we remembered. In that moment, the last remnants of my love were replaced by hate and revulsion; had she needed to be killed then, I could have done it with savage pleasure. As she looked, her eyes blazed with an unholy glow, and her face twisted into a voluptuous smile. Oh, God, how it made me shudder to witness it! With a careless gesture, cruelly indifferent as a demon, she flung the child she had been gripping tightly to her breast onto the ground, growling over it like a dog guarding a bone. The child let out a sharp cry and lay there moaning. The sheer cold-bloodedness of the act wrung a groan from Arthur; when she approached him with outstretched arms and a seductive smile, he retreated, covering his face with his hands.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "A long and tense silence followed, filling the air with an almost painful emptiness. Suddenly, the Professor whispered urgently to get our attention and pointed down the avenue of yew trees. In the dim distance, we saw a pale figure slowly approaching, carrying something dark close to its chest. The figure stopped, and just then, moonlight broke through the fast-moving clouds, revealing a woman with dark hair clothed in burial garments. We couldn't see her face, as it was bent over a fair-haired child. There was a brief pause, and then we heard a soft cry, like that of a dreaming child or a dog. We were about to move forward, but the Professor signaled us to stay put. Watching silently, we saw the pale figure move closer, becoming clearer in the moonlight. A chill ran through me as I heard Arthur gasp; we realized the figure was Lucy Westenra, though she was terribly changed. Her previous sweetness had become hard and cruel, her innocence replaced by sensual depravity. Van Helsing stepped forward, and we followed, forming a line before the tomb’s entrance. He lifted his lantern, and in its focused beam we saw that Lucy’s lips were red with fresh blood, which had dripped down onto her burial dress. Horrified, we stood shaken; even Van Helsing seemed rattled. Arthur, beside me, almost collapsed, but I grabbed his arm to steady him. When the creature that once was Lucy saw us, she recoiled and snarled angrily like an animal, her gaze sweeping over us. Her eyes were the same in shape and color as Lucy’s, but now wicked and burning instead of gentle and pure. In that moment, all feelings of love I had for her changed to hatred and disgust; I could have destroyed her without hesitation. Her eyes glowed with unnatural light, and her face twisted into a seductive smile that made me shudder. Casually, she threw the child she had been holding to the ground, indifferent and cruel, growling over it like a dog with a bone. The child cried out and lay there whimpering. The heartlessness of her action made Arthur groan; when she advanced towards him with outstretched arms and a seductive smile, he recoiled and covered his face in his hands."

As for Arthur, he seemed under a spell; moving his hands from his face, he opened wide his arms. She was leaping for them, when Van Helsing sprang forward and held between them his little golden crucifix. She recoiled from it, and, with a suddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enter the tomb.\nWhen within a foot or two of the door, however, she stopped, as if arrested by some irresistible force. Then she turned, and her face was shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no quiver from Van Helsing’s iron nerves. Never did I see such baffled malice on a face; and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again by mortal eyes. The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throw out sparks of hell-fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of the flesh were the coils of Medusa’s snakes, and the lovely, blood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of the Greeks and Japanese.

Come, my beloved, come!” There was a wickedly enticing quality in her voice—like the sharp ring of glass when struck—that echoed deeply in the minds of even those of us who only overheard the words. As for Arthur, he seemed completely under a spell; lowering his hands from his face, he spread his arms wide. She was about to leap into his embrace when Van Helsing suddenly stepped forward and held his small golden crucifix between them. She recoiled sharply from it, her face suddenly twisted into a mask of fury, and she rushed past him as if to escape into the tomb.",

Come to me, my husband, come!” Her voice had a wicked sweetness to it, with a quality as sharp and unnerving as striking glass, so much so that even those not directly addressed felt its effect in their minds. Arthur seemed enchanted; he lowered his hands from his face and reached out his arms toward her. She was about to run into his embrace, but Van Helsing quickly intervened, holding his small golden crucifix between them. She drew back from it, her face suddenly twisted in fury, and rushed past him as if trying to enter the tomb. Just before she reached the door, she halted as if held back by an invisible power. She turned around, and in the bright moonlight and the steady lamp, her face was revealed. It was contorted with frustrated evil—a sight I hope no human ever has to see again. Her beautiful complexion turned pale, her eyes seemed to burn with a hellish glow, her brows furrowed deeply like twisted snakes, and her once-attractive, blood-red mouth opened wide into a harsh, mask-like expression, reminiscent of the dramatic masks from Greek and Japanese theater. In that moment, if looks could kill, her gaze would have meant certain death."

It was odd to notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes. Of course, Arthur wore black, for he was in deep mourning, but the rest of us wore it by instinct. We got to the churchyard by half-past one, and strolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when the gravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the belief that every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place all to ourselves. Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him a long leather one, something like a cricketing bag; it was manifestly of fair weight.\nWhen we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up the road, we silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed the Professor to the tomb. He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing it behind us. Then he took from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and also two wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck, by melting their own ends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient to work by. When he again lifted the lid off Lucy’s coffin we all looked—Arthur trembling like an aspen—and saw that the body lay there in all its death-beauty. But there was no love in my own heart, nothing but loathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy’s shape without her soul. I could see even Arthur’s face grow hard as he looked. Presently he said to Van Helsing:—\n“Is this really Lucy’s body, or only a demon in her shape?”\n“It is her body, and yet not it. But wait a while, and you all see her as she was, and is.”\nShe seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there; the pointed teeth, the bloodstained, voluptuous mouth—which it made one shudder to see—the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like a devilish mockery of Lucy’s sweet purity. Van Helsing, with his usual methodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and placing them ready for use. First he took out a soldering iron and some plumbing solder, and then a small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit in a corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue flame; then his operating knives, which he placed to hand; and last a round wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and about three feet long. One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, and was sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a heavy hammer, such as in households is used in the coal-cellar for breaking the lumps. To me, a doctor’s preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and bracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey was to cause them a sort of consternation. They both, however, kept their courage, and remained silent and quiet.",

It was strange that, without prior agreement, we had all decided to wear black. Arthur was understandably in black due to his deep mourning, but the rest of us seemed to have chosen it instinctively. We arrived at the churchyard by half-past one in the morning and discreetly moved about, staying out of sight of any officials. This allowed us to have the entire place to ourselves once the gravediggers had finished their work and the sexton, assuming everyone had left, had locked the gate. Van Helsing was not carrying his usual small black bag but a large leather one, similar to a cricket bag, which was clearly quite heavy. Once we were alone and the sounds of the last departing footsteps faded up the road, we followed the Professor silently, as if by prearranged plan, to the tomb. He unlocked the door, and we went inside, closing it behind us. He then took a lantern from his bag and lit it, along with two wax candles, which he lit and then stuck onto other coffins by melting their bases, providing sufficient light for our work. When he lifted the lid off Lucy’s coffin again, we all looked—Arthur trembling uncontrollably—and saw that the body lay there, still possessing its appearance of deathly beauty. However, I felt no love in my heart, only utter revulsion for the vile entity that had taken Lucy’s physical form but was devoid of her soul. I could even see Arthur’s face harden as he stared. After a moment, he asked Van Helsing, “Is this truly Lucy’s body, or merely a demon disguised in her shape?” Van Helsing responded, “It is her body, and yet simultaneously, it is not. But wait a short while, and you will all see her as she was and as she currently is.” As she lay there, she resembled a horrifying version of Lucy; the sharp teeth, the bloodstained, sensuous mouth—which was sickening to see—her entire physical and soulless appearance seemed like a cruel, devilish parody of Lucy’s gentle purity. Van Helsing, with his characteristic systematic approach, began taking various items out of his bag and arranging them for immediate use. First, he produced a soldering iron and some plumbing solder, followed by a small oil lamp which, when lit in a corner of the tomb, produced gas that burned with intense heat and a blue flame. Then came his surgical knives, which he placed within easy reach. Finally, he retrieved a thick, round wooden stake, approximately two and a half to three inches in diameter and about three feet long. One end had been hardened by charring in a fire and sharpened to a fine point. Along with this stake, he had a heavy hammer, like the kind used in households for breaking coal lumps in a cellar. As a doctor, I find preparations for any procedure stimulating and invigorating, but these items had a disturbing effect on both Arthur and Quincey, causing them a sense of shock and dismay.

But I felt no love, only revulsion for the creature that wore Lucy’s form without her soul. Even Arthur’s expression became stern. He soon asked Van Helsing if this was truly Lucy’s body or a demon in her likeness. Van Helsing replied that it was her body, but not entirely; he told us to wait and we would see her as she was and is.\n\nLying there, she seemed a nightmarish version of Lucy—her pointed teeth, her blood-red, sensual mouth, made her look like a grotesque mockery of her former purity. Van Helsing, ever thorough, began to take out tools from his bag: a soldering iron and solder, then a small oil-lamp that, when lit in a corner, produced a fierce blue flame; his surgical knives, set close at hand; and finally, a thick wooden stake, about three feet long, sharpened to a point and charred at one end, along with a heavy hammer like those used for breaking coal.

And so the circle goes on ever widening, like as the ripples from a stone thrown in the water. Friend Arthur, if you had met that kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die; or again, last night when you open your arms to her, you would in time, when you had died, have become nosferatu, as they call it in Eastern Europe, and would all time make more of those Un-Deads that so have fill us with horror. The career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun. Those children whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse; but if she live on, Un-Dead, more and more they lose their blood and by her power over them they come to her; and so she draw their blood with that so wicked mouth. But if she die in truth, then all cease; the tiny wounds of the throats disappear, and they go back to their plays unknowing ever of what has been. But of the most blessed of all, when this now Un-Dead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the poor lady whom we love shall again be free. Instead of working wickedness by night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, she shall take her place with the other Angels. So that, my friend, it will be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free. To this I am willing; but is there none amongst us who has a better right? Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the night when sleep is not: ‘It was my hand that sent her to the stars; it was the hand of him that loved her best; the hand that of all she would herself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?’ Tell me if there be such a one amongst us?”",

When someone undergoes this transformation, they are afflicted with the curse of unending life; they cannot die, but must persist century after century, generating new victims and increasing the evil in the world. This is because all who die from the predation of the Un-Dead themselves become Un-Dead, and then prey on others of their kind. This cycle thus expands relentlessly, much like the ever-growing ripples created by a stone dropped into water. My friend Arthur, if you had received that kiss you know of before poor Lucy passed away; or similarly, last night when you held her, you would eventually, after your own death, have turned into a nosferatu, as they are called in Eastern Europe, and would have spent eternity creating more of these Un-Dead beings that have filled us with such dread. The path of this poor, beloved woman has only just commenced. The children whose blood she has consumed are not yet severely harmed; but if she continues to live as Un-Dead, they will progressively lose more blood, and her power over them will compel them to come to her. Thus, she will drain their blood with that horrific mouth. However, if she truly dies, then everything ceases; the tiny marks on their throats will vanish, and they will return to their games, never knowing what occurred. But most importantly, when this now Un-Dead being is finally put to rest as truly dead, the soul of the unfortunate lady we cherish will be free once more. Instead of performing evil deeds by night and growing more depraved by absorbing its effects during the day, she will take her rightful place among the Angels. Therefore, my friend, the hand that delivers the blow to set her free will be a blessed one for her. I am ready to do this; but is there anyone among us who has a greater right? Wouldn't it bring some comfort to reflect upon later, in the quiet of the night when sleep eludes you: 'It was my hand that sent her to the heavens; it was the hand of the one who loved her most; the hand that she herself would have chosen above all others, had she been able to choose?' Tell me if such a person is here among us?\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "After everything was set up, Van Helsing spoke: \"Before we proceed, let me explain this point, which comes from ancient knowledge and the studies of all who have learned about the Un-Dead. When someone becomes one of them, they are cursed with immortality—they cannot die but continue through the ages, creating new victims and spreading greater evil. Whoever dies as a result of an Un-Dead's attack becomes Un-Dead themselves and preys upon others in turn. This cycle keeps expanding, like ripples made by a stone in water. Arthur, if you had received that certain kiss from Lucy before she died, or last night when you embraced her, then after your own death you too would have become a nosferatu, as Eastern Europeans call them, and you would create more Un-Dead like those who have haunted us. The sad journey of our dear Lucy is only just beginning. The children she has fed upon so far are not yet greatly harmed, but if she remains Un-Dead, she will drain more and more life from them, and they will fall under her influence. By drawing their blood, she does them harm. However, if she is truly killed, all this will end; the tiny wounds on their necks will vanish, and they will return to their innocent play, never knowing what happened. Most importantly, if the Un-Dead is finally laid to true rest, the soul of our beloved Lucy will be freed. Rather than spreading evil at night and becoming more corrupt, she will join the Angels. So, the hand that releases her will be performing a blessing. I am prepared to do this, but is there anyone among us with a greater claim? Would it not bring comfort in sleepless nights to reflect: 'It was I who released her spirit; I, the one who loved her most, as she herself would have wished?' Is there such a person among us?\""

Tell me what I am to do, and I shall not falter!” Van Helsing laid a hand on his shoulder, and said:—\n“Brave lad! A moment’s courage, and it is done. This stake must be driven through her. It will be a fearful ordeal—be not deceived in that—but it will be only a short time, and you will then rejoice more than your pain was great; from this grim tomb you will emerge as though you tread on air. But you must not falter when once you have begun. Only think that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray for you all the time.”\n“Go on,” said Arthur hoarsely. “Tell me what I am to do.”\n“Take this stake in your left hand, ready to place the point over the heart, and the hammer in your right. Then when we begin our prayer for the dead—I shall read him, I have here the book, and the others shall follow—strike in God’s name, that so all may be well with the dead that we love and that the Un-Dead pass away.”\nArthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind was set on action his hands never trembled nor even quivered. Van Helsing opened his missal and began to read, and Quincey and I followed as well as we could. Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked I could see its dint in the white flesh. Then he struck with all his might.\nThe Thing in the coffin writhed; and a hideous, blood-curdling screech came from the opened red lips. The body shook and quivered and twisted in wild contortions; the sharp white teeth champed together till the lips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam. But Arthur never faltered. He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling arm rose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilst the blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it. His face was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it; the sight of it gave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little vault.\nAnd then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the teeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver. Finally it lay still. The terrible task was over.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "We all directed our gaze towards Arthur. He, like us, understood the immense compassion behind the suggestion that he should be the one to perform the act that would restore Lucy to a sacred, rather than cursed, memory. He stepped forward and spoke with courage, although his hand shook and his face was stark white like snow:\n“My dearest friend, my heart is broken, but I thank you from its depths. Just tell me what must be done, and I will not hesitate!” Van Helsing placed a hand on his shoulder and responded:\n“Excellent young man! It only takes a moment of courage, and the task will be complete. This stake must be driven all the way through her. Make no mistake, it will be an extremely difficult experience—a terrible trial—but it will pass quickly. Afterward, your relief and joy will far outweigh your suffering. From this grim burial place, you will walk away feeling light, as if you are floating on air. However, you must not stop once you have begun the process. Simply remember that we, your loyal friends, are standing beside you, offering continuous prayers for your strength.”\n“Proceed,” Arthur said in a rough voice. “Tell me exactly what I need to do.”\n“Hold this stake in your left hand, ready to position the tip directly over the heart, and grip the hammer in your right. Then, as we begin our prayer for the deceased—I will read from this book I have here, and the others will join in—strike with all your might, in the name of God. This way, the soul of our loved one will find peace, and the Un-Dead creature will be destroyed.”\nArthur took hold of the stake and the hammer. Once he was focused on the action, his hands became perfectly steady, without the slightest tremor. Van Helsing opened his prayer book and started to read aloud, while Quincey and I followed the prayers as best we could. Arthur carefully placed the tip of the stake over the heart. As I watched, I could see it making an indentation in the pale skin. Then, he struck with the full force of his body.\nThe entity in the coffin convulsed violently; a horrific, terrifying shriek erupted from the open, blood-red lips. The body jerked, trembled, and twisted in uncontrolled spasms. The sharp white teeth gnashed together so fiercely that they cut the lips, smearing the mouth with frothy red blood. But Arthur did not hesitate for an instant. He seemed as imposing as the mythological figure Thor, his arm rising and falling without wavering, driving the merciful stake deeper and deeper. Meanwhile, blood from the pierced heart surged and sprayed around the stake. His face was determined, radiant with a sense of profound duty. The sight of his resolution bolstered our courage, making our voices seem to echo loudly within the small crypt.\nFollowing this, the violent movements and trembling of the body gradually subsided, the gnashing of teeth lessened, and the facial twitching decreased. Eventually, it lay completely still. The dreadful ordeal was finished.",

He saw, as we all did, the deep kindness behind the decision that he, of all people, should be the one to restore Lucy’s memory to something sacred, rather than profane.

Just tell me what to do, and I won't hesitate!\" Van Helsing placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder and replied, \"You're brave indeed. Just a moment of courage, and it will be over. You must drive this stake through her. It will be a dreadful ordeal—don't think it won't—but it will only take a moment. Afterward, you’ll be glad, and your relief will outweigh your pain. When it is done, you will leave this grim place feeling as if you’re walking on air. Remember, you are not alone; we, your friends, are here, supporting and praying for you.\" Arthur, his voice rough with emotion, insisted, \"Continue. Tell me exactly what to do.\" Van Helsing directed, \"Grip the stake in your left hand and position its point over her heart. Hold the hammer with your right. As we begin prayers for the dead—I have the book, and the others will join—we will pray, and you must strike in the name of God so that all may be well for the one we love, and so the Un-Dead will perish.\" Arthur took hold of the stake and hammer, and with determination, his shaking ceased. Van Helsing opened his prayer book, and Quincey and I followed along as best we could. Arthur set the stake in position over Lucy’s heart, and I witnessed the indentation it made in her pale skin. Then, using all his strength, he struck. The creature in the coffin writhed and let out a horrifying, chilling scream from its open, red lips. The body writhed and twisted savagely; the sharp white teeth clacked so hard they cut the lips, smearing the mouth with bloody foam. Yet Arthur did not waver. He looked almost like the god Thor as his steady arm rose and fell, driving the mercy-filled stake deeper and deeper, even as blood spouted from the pierced heart. Determined, his face glowed with a sense of purpose, and seeing him gave us strength so that even our voices seemed stronger as we prayed in the crypt. Gradually, the thrashing subsided, and the body became still; even the jaw stopped working, and the face became calm at last. The awful deed was complete."

The great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead, and his breath came in broken gasps. It had indeed been an awful strain on him; and had he not been forced to his task by more than human considerations he could never have gone through with it. For a few minutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the coffin. When we did, however, a murmur of startled surprise ran from one to the other of us. We gazed so eagerly that Arthur rose, for he had been seated on the ground, and came and looked too; and then a glad, strange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom of horror that lay upon it.\nThere, in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that we had so dreaded and grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as a privilege to the one best entitled to it, but Lucy as we had seen her in her life, with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity. True that there were there, as we had seen them in life, the traces of care and pain and waste; but these were all dear to us, for they marked her truth to what we knew. One and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever.\nVan Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur’s shoulder, and said to him:—\n“And now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven?”\nThe reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man’s hand in his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said:—\n“Forgiven! God bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again, and me peace.” He put his hands on the Professor’s shoulder, and laying his head on his breast, cried for a while silently, whilst we stood unmoving. When he raised his head Van Helsing said to him:—\n“And now, my child, you may kiss her. Kiss her dead lips if you will, as she would have you to, if for her to choose. For she is not a grinning devil now—not any more a foul Thing for all eternity. No longer she is the devil’s Un-Dead. She is God’s true dead, whose soul is with Him!”\nArthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out of the tomb; the Professor and I sawed the top off the stake, leaving the point of it in the body.

For a few moments, we were so preoccupied with Arthur that we didn't look at the coffin. However, when we did, a collective gasp of surprise passed between us. We stared so intently that Arthur, who had been sitting on the ground, got up to look as well; then, a joyful, unfamiliar expression lit up his face, completely erasing the look of horror it had held. Inside the coffin was no longer the repulsive creature we had so dreaded and hated, whose destruction felt like a deserved task for the one most entitled to it. Instead, it was Lucy, just as we remembered her in life, with her extraordinarily sweet and pure face. It was true that the marks of suffering, pain, and illness were still there, as we had seen them in life, but these were precious to us because they testified to her true nature. We all felt that the sacred peace covering her thin face and body was just an earthly sign and representation of the calm that would now last eternally. Van Helsing approached, put his hand on Arthur's shoulder, and said, \"Now, Arthur, my dear friend, haven't I been forgiven?\" The release from the terrible tension came as Arthur took the old man's hand, raised it to his lips, pressed it, and said, \"Forgiven! May God bless you for giving my beloved one her soul back, and bringing me peace.\" He placed his hands on the Professor's shoulders, rested his head on his chest, and cried silently for a while as we stood still.

She is God's true dead, whose soul is with Him!\" Arthur bent down and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out of the tomb.

For a short time, our focus was entirely on Arthur, and we didn’t look at the coffin. When we finally did, we all expressed shock and amazement. We stared so intently that Arthur, who had been sitting, stood and joined us in looking. Suddenly, his face lit up with joy, wiping away the fear and horror that had previously marked his expression. In the coffin, where once lay the dreadful creature we had come to fear and hate, now rested Lucy, appearing as she had in life: sweet and pure. Although there were still signs of suffering, these impressions were familiar and even precious, showing her to be true to what we remembered. All of us felt the peacefulness on her face and form was a sign of the eternal peace she had found. Van Helsing rested his hand on Arthur’s shoulder and gently asked if he was forgiven. In response to the relief after such stress, Arthur kissed Van Helsing’s hand, thanking him for restoring Lucy’s soul and granting him peace. He rested his head on Van Helsing, quietly weeping as we looked on. When he finally composed himself, Van Helsing told him he could now kiss Lucy goodbye, as she was no longer a horror, but at peace. Arthur kissed her, after which we sent him and Quincey outside. The Professor and I then removed the top of the stake, left its tip within Lucy, removed her head, filled her mouth with garlic, sealed the coffin, replaced the lid, and gathered our things.

However, a much bigger task remains: to find the person responsible for all this suffering and eliminate him.

Afterward, we will renew our commitment to each other, because we face a formidable challenge, and once we start this difficult path, there can be no turning back.\"",

There was happiness, laughter, and calm everywhere, because we finally had some peace about one thing, and though we were happy, it was a measured happiness. Before we left, Van Helsing said to us: \"My friends, we have completed an important and painful part of our work. But a larger mission remains: to discover who is responsible for our sorrow and to put an end to him. I have some clues to guide us, but the path ahead will be long, tough, and full of danger and suffering. Will you all join me? We now all believe; isn’t that right? And because of that, don’t we see what we must do? Yes! And do we all promise to see this through to the end?\" Each of us shook his hand and made this promise. The Professor then said, as we started to leave: \"In two nights, you'll join me for dinner with John at seven. I’ll invite two more people whom you haven't met yet, and I’ll share all our plans and show you how we’ll proceed. John, come with me—I have things to discuss with you, and you can help. Tonight I leave for Amsterdam but will return tomorrow night. After that, our great quest begins. First, I’ll explain what we must do and what to be wary of. Then we’ll renew our promise to each other, for we have a daunting task ahead, and once we start, we cannot turn back.\""

As, however, he had pressed me to be quick, I knocked at the door, and on his calling out, “Come in,” I entered.\nTo my intense surprise, there was no one with him. He was quite alone, and on the table opposite him was what I knew at once from the description to be a phonograph. I had never seen one, and was much interested.\n“I hope I did not keep you waiting,” I said; “but I stayed at the door as I heard you talking, and thought there was some one with you.”\n“Oh,” he replied with a smile, “I was only entering my diary.”\n“Your diary?” I asked him in surprise.\n“Yes,” he answered. “I keep it in this.” As he spoke he laid his hand on the phonograph. I felt quite excited over it, and blurted out:—\n“Why, this beats even shorthand! May I hear it say something?”\n“Certainly,” he replied with alacrity, and stood up to put it in train for speaking. Then he paused, and a troubled look overspread his face.\n“The fact is,” he began awkwardly, “I only keep my diary in it; and as it is entirely—almost entirely—about my cases, it may be awkward—that is, I mean——” He stopped, and I tried to help him out of his embarrassment:—\n“You helped to attend dear Lucy at the end. Let me hear how she died; for all that I know of her, I shall be very grateful. She was very, very dear to me.”\nTo my surprise, he answered, with a horrorstruck look in his face:—\n“Tell you of her death? Not for the wide world!”\n“Why not?” I asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over me. Again he paused, and I could see that he was trying to invent an excuse. At length he stammered out:—\n“You see, I do not know how to pick out any particular part of the diary.” Even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him, and he said with unconscious simplicity, in a different voice, and with the naïveté of a child: “That’s quite true, upon my honour. Honest Indian!” I could not but smile, at which he grimaced. “I gave myself away that time!” he said. “But do you know that, although I have kept the diary for months past, it never once struck me how I was going to find any particular part of it in case I wanted to look it up?” By this time my mind was made up that the diary of a doctor who attended Lucy might have something to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible Being, and I said boldly:—\n“Then, Dr. Seward, you had better let me copy it out for you on my typewriter.” He grew to a positively deathly pallor as he said:—\n“No! no! no! For all the world, I wouldn’t let you know that terrible story!”\nThen it was terrible; my intuition was right! For a moment I thought, and as my eyes ranged the room, unconsciously looking for something or some opportunity to aid me, they lit on a great batch of typewriting on the table.

To my considerable astonishment, he was by himself. He was entirely alone, and placed on the table before him was an object I immediately recognized from descriptions as a phonograph. I had never seen one before and found it quite fascinating. \"I hope I didn't cause a delay,\" I said. \"I lingered at the door because I heard talking and assumed you had company.\" With a smile, he responded, \"Oh, I was just recording my diary.\" \"Your diary?\" I questioned, surprised. \"Yes,\" he confirmed. \"I maintain it using this.\" As he spoke, he placed his hand on the phonograph. Feeling quite intrigued, I impulsively exclaimed, \"Why, this is even more efficient than shorthand! Could I hear it play something?\" \"Certainly,\" he replied promptly, rising to get it ready. He then paused, a worried expression clouding his face. \"The truth is,\" he began awkwardly, \"I only use it for my diary, and as it is entirely—well, almost entirely—concerned with my medical cases, it might be uncomfortable—what I mean is...\" He trailed off, and I attempted to help him overcome his embarrassment: \"You were there for dear Lucy in her final moments. Please, let me hear how she died; any details about her would mean so much to me. She was truly, truly precious to me.\" To my shock, he replied, his face filled with horror, \"Tell you about her death? Absolutely not!\" \"Why not?\" I pressed, a deep, unsettling feeling washing over me. He paused again, and I could tell he was struggling to find an excuse. Finally, he stumbled out, \"You see, I wouldn't know how to find any particular section of the diary.\" Even as he said it, a realization struck him, and he spoke with simple honesty, in a different tone, with childlike innocence: \"That's completely true, honestly. Scout's honor!\" I couldn't help but smile, and he made a face. \"I really gave myself away there!\" he said. \"But isn't it strange that even though I've kept this diary for months, it never occurred to me how I would locate a specific entry if I ever needed to reference it?\" By now, I was convinced that the diary of a doctor who had treated Lucy might offer crucial insights into that terrible Being. I stated directly, \"Then, Dr. Seward, perhaps it would be best if I transcribed it for you on my typewriter.\" He turned an ashen, deathly pale and declared, \"No! No! No! I wouldn't let you learn that terrible story for anything in the world!\" So, it truly was terrible; my instincts were correct!

Suddenly, he hesitated and looked troubled.\n\n“The thing is,” he said awkwardly, “my diary is chiefly about my cases, so it might be awkward…” He trailed off, and I tried to help ease his embarrassment, saying, “You helped care for dear Lucy at the end—may I hear about her death? I would truly appreciate it, for she meant very much to me.”\n\nTo my astonishment, he looked horrified.\n\n“Tell you about her death? Never!”\n\n“Why not?” I asked, feeling a grave apprehension. He paused, clearly searching for an excuse, and eventually said, “I don’t actually know how to locate a specific entry in the diary.” But as he spoke, he seemed struck by a realization and continued, almost childlike, “That’s honestly true. Honest Indian!” I couldn’t help but smile, and he pulled a face. “I really gave myself away just now! You know, even though I’ve kept this diary for months, I never thought about how I’d find a particular passage if I needed it.”\n\nI decided then that Dr. Seward’s diary could be valuable for understanding the mysterious events around Lucy, and boldly offered, “Then, Dr. Seward, maybe I could type it out for you.” He turned deathly pale and said, “No! Absolutely not! I could never let you know that terrible story!”\n\nThat confirmed the horror I’d suspected. My intuition was right! Glancing around, perhaps seeking some advantage, I noticed a large bundle of typewritten pages on the table.

Take these cylinders and listen to them—the initial half dozen are personal and will not distress you; then you will know me better. Dinner will be prepared by that time. Meanwhile, I will read through some of these papers to gain a better comprehension of certain matters.\" He personally carried the phonograph device upstairs to my room and set it up for me. Now, I am confident I will learn something enjoyable, as it will provide the other perspective of a genuine love story, one side of which I am already acquainted with.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I told him, \"You don't really know me yet. Once you've read the papers—my diary and my husband's, which I've typed out—you'll understand me better. I've held nothing back about my feelings for this cause, but it's natural that you wouldn't trust me yet, and I shouldn't expect you to.\" He really is a noble person; Lucy had judged him well. He stood and opened a large drawer filled with neat rows of metallic cylinders coated in dark wax. He said, \"You're right; I didn't trust you because I didn't know you. But now I do, and I realize I should have gotten to know you sooner. Lucy spoke to you about me, and she spoke to me about you as well. Please let me make amends in the only way I can: take these cylinders and listen to them—the first few are about my own experiences, and they won't be disturbing. This way, you'll know more about me. Dinner will be ready by the time you're done. In the meantime, I'll read through some of these documents, which will help me understand some things better.\" He brought the phonograph up to my sitting room and set it up for me himself. Now I'm sure I'll learn something pleasant—I'll finally hear the other side of a love story that I already partly know."

Mrs. Harker was not down when the maid came to announce dinner, so I said: “She is possibly tired; let dinner wait an hour,” and I went on with my work. I had just finished Mrs. Harker’s diary, when she came in. She looked sweetly pretty, but very sad, and her eyes were flushed with crying. This somehow moved me much. Of late I have had cause for tears, God knows! but the relief of them was denied me; and now the sight of those sweet eyes, brightened with recent tears, went straight to my heart. So I said as gently as I could:—\n“I greatly fear I have distressed you.”\n“Oh, no, not distressed me,” she replied, “but I have been more touched than I can say by your grief. That is a wonderful machine, but it is cruelly true. It told me, in its very tones, the anguish of your heart. It was like a soul crying out to Almighty God. No one must hear them spoken ever again! See, I have tried to be useful. I have copied out the words on my typewriter, and none other need now hear your heart beat, as I did.”\n“No one need ever know, shall ever know,” I said in a low voice. She laid her hand on mine and said very gravely:—\n“Ah, but they must!”\n“Must! But why?” I asked.\n“Because it is a part of the terrible story, a part of poor dear Lucy’s death and all that led to it; because in the struggle which we have before us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all the knowledge and all the help which we can get. I think that the cylinders which you gave me contained more than you intended me to know; but I can see that there are in your record many lights to this dark mystery. You will let me help, will you not? I know all up to a certain point; and I see already, though your diary only took me to 7 September, how poor Lucy was beset, and how her terrible doom was being wrought out. Jonathan and I have been working day and night since Professor Van Helsing saw us. He is gone to Whitby to get more information, and he will be here to-morrow to help us. We need have no secrets amongst us; working together and with absolute trust, we can surely be stronger than if some of us were in the dark.” She looked at me so appealingly, and at the same time manifested such courage and resolution in her bearing, that I gave in at once to her wishes. “You shall,” I said, “do as you like in the matter. God forgive me if I do wrong! There are terrible things yet to learn of; but if you have so far travelled on the road to poor Lucy’s death, you will not be content, I know, to remain in the dark. Nay, the end—the very end—may give you a gleam of peace. Come, there is dinner. We must keep one another strong for what is before us; we have a cruel and dreadful task. When you have eaten you shall learn the rest, and I shall answer any questions you ask—if there be anything which you do not understand, though it was apparent to us who were present.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "September 29th. I became so lost in the remarkable journals of Jonathan Harker and his wife that I completely forgot the passage of time. When the maid announced dinner, Mrs. Harker wasn't present, so I instructed her to delay the meal by an hour, saying she might be tired, and I continued my work. Just after I finished reading Mrs. Harker's diary, she entered. She looked lovely but appeared very sad, her eyes red from crying. This sight deeply affected me. Heaven knows I've had reasons to weep recently, but I've been unable to find relief through tears. Seeing those beautiful eyes, brightened by recent crying, went straight to my heart. So, I said as gently as possible, \"I am very much afraid I have caused you pain.\" \"Oh, no, you haven't distressed me,\" she replied, \"but your sorrow has touched me more deeply than I can express. That recording device is incredible, but it reveals truth with cruel precision. In its very sound, it conveyed the agony of your heart. It was like a soul crying out to God Almighty. No one else must ever hear those recordings! Look, I've tried to be helpful. I've typed out the words on my typewriter, so now no one else needs to hear your heart's beat as I did.\" \"No one ever needs to know, or ever shall know,\" I said softly. She placed her hand on mine and stated very seriously, \"Ah, but they must!\" \"Must! But why?\" I questioned. \"Because it is a crucial part of this terrible narrative, a part of poor dear Lucy's demise and everything that led up to it,\" she explained. \"Because in the battle we face to cleanse the world of this dreadful creature, we require every bit of knowledge and assistance we can gather. I suspect the cylinders you gave me contained more than you intended for me to learn; however, I can see that your record provides many insights into this dark mystery. You will allow me to help, won't you? I understand everything up to a certain point, and even though your diary only took me to September 7th, I can already see how poor Lucy was plagued and how her awful fate was unfolding. Jonathan and I have been working nonstop since Professor Van Helsing came to us. He has gone to Whitby to gather more information and will return tomorrow to help us. We must have no secrets between us; by working together with absolute trust, we can undoubtedly be stronger than if some of us were kept uninformed.\" She looked at me with such earnest appeal, and at the same time, displayed such bravery and determination in her demeanor, that I immediately agreed to her wishes. \"You shall,\" I told her, \"do exactly as you wish in this matter. May God forgive me if I am wrong! There are still terrible things to be discovered; but if you have come this far in learning about poor Lucy's death, I know you won't be satisfied staying in the dark. In fact, the conclusion—the very end—might even offer you a glimmer of peace. Come, dinner is ready. We must strengthen ourselves for what lies ahead; we have a cruel and fearful task before us. After you have eaten, you shall learn the rest, and I will answer any questions you have—if there is anything you don't grasp, even though it was clear to those of us who were present.\"}",

He placed me in a comfortable chair, and arranged the phonograph so that I could touch it without getting up, and showed me how to stop it in case I should want to pause. Then he very thoughtfully took a chair, with his back to me, so that I might be as free as possible, and began to read. I put the forked metal to my ears and listened.\nWhen the terrible story of Lucy’s death, and—and all that followed, was done, I lay back in my chair powerless. Fortunately I am not of a fainting disposition. When Dr. Seward saw me he jumped up with a horrified exclamation, and hurriedly taking a case-bottle from a cupboard, gave me some brandy, which in a few minutes somewhat restored me. My brain was all in a whirl, and only that there came through all the multitude of horrors, the holy ray of light that my dear, dear Lucy was at last at peace, I do not think I could have borne it without making a scene. It is all so wild, and mysterious, and strange that if I had not known Jonathan’s experience in Transylvania I could not have believed. As it was, I didn’t know what to believe, and so got out of my difficulty by attending to something else. I took the cover off my typewriter, and said to Dr. Seward:—\n“Let me write this all out now. We must be ready for Dr. Van Helsing when he comes. I have sent a telegram to Jonathan to come on here when he arrives in London from Whitby. In this matter dates are everything, and I think that if we get all our material ready, and have every item put in chronological order, we shall have done much. You tell me that Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris are coming too. Let us be able to tell him when they come.” He accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace, and I began to typewrite from the beginning of the seventh cylinder. I used manifold, and so took three copies of the diary, just as I had done with all the rest. It was late when I got through, but Dr. Seward went about his work of going his round of the patients; when he had finished he came back and sat near me, reading, so that I did not feel too lonely whilst I worked. How good and thoughtful he is; the world seems full of good men—even if there are monsters in it. Before I left him I remembered what Jonathan put in his diary of the Professor’s perturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station at Exeter; so, seeing that Dr. Seward keeps his newspapers, I borrowed the files of “The Westminster Gazette” and “The Pall Mall Gazette,” and took them to my room. I remember how much “The Dailygraph” and “The Whitby Gazette,” of which I had made cuttings, helped us to understand the terrible events at Whitby when Count Dracula landed, so I shall look through the evening papers since then, and perhaps I shall get some new light. I am not sleepy, and the work will help to keep me quiet.",

He settled me comfortably in a chair, placed the phonograph within easy reach, and showed me how to pause it if necessary. Then, considerately sitting with his back towards me to allow me freedom, he began to read from the phonograph cylinder. Using the earpieces, I listened.\nWhen the horrific narrative of Lucy’s death and everything that ensued was finished, I leaned back in my chair, feeling completely overwhelmed. Fortunately, I don't have a tendency to faint. Seeing my state, Dr. Seward sprang up with a horrified gasp, quickly fetched some brandy from a cabinet, and gave me a drink, which helped to revive me within a few minutes. My mind was in turmoil; if not for the comforting thought that, amidst all the many horrors, a ray of light shone through knowing my dear Lucy had finally found peace, I don't think I could have endured it without becoming distraught. It's all so chaotic, mysterious, and strange that had I not known about Jonathan's experiences in Transylvania, I couldn't possibly have believed it. As it was, I was uncertain what to accept, so I resolved my confusion by focusing on a practical task. I uncovered my typewriter and said to Dr. Seward, 'Let me transcribe all of this immediately. We must have everything prepared for Dr. Van Helsing's arrival. I've sent a telegram to Jonathan asking him to come here once he reaches London from Whitby. Accuracy regarding dates is crucial in this situation, and I think if we prepare all our evidence and arrange it chronologically, we will have accomplished a great deal. You mentioned Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris are also coming. We should be ready to present this information to them when they arrive.' Consequently, he set the phonograph speed to slow, and I began typing, starting with the contents of the seventh cylinder. I used carbon paper to create three copies of the diary entries, following my previous practice. It was late by the time I finished, but Dr. Seward proceeded with his routine of checking on his patients. After completing his rounds, he returned and sat nearby, reading, so I didn't feel isolated while working. He is so kind and considerate; it feels as though the world has many good people, despite the existence of evil. Before leaving, I recalled Jonathan's diary note about the Professor's distress upon reading an evening newspaper at Exeter station. Knowing Dr. Seward keeps his old newspapers, I borrowed past editions of 'The Westminster Gazette' and 'The Pall Mall Gazette' and took them to my room. I remember how helpful 'The Dailygraph' and 'The Whitby Gazette', from which I'd saved clippings, were in understanding the frightening events in Whitby following Count Dracula's arrival. Therefore, I plan to examine the evening papers published since then, hoping to gain further insight. I am not tired, and the task will help keep my mind occupied.",

Thoughtfully, he sat with his back to me so I could work freely, then started to read as I listened through the earpieces.\n\nOnce I heard the dreadful account of Lucy's death and everything that happened after, I reclined in my chair, feeling completely drained. Thankfully, I am not someone who faints easily. When Dr. Seward noticed my condition, he sprang up in alarm and quickly got some brandy from a cupboard. The drink helped to revive me within a few minutes. My mind reeled with all that I had heard, and if not for the comforting thought that my beloved Lucy was finally at peace, I do not think I could have managed to hold myself together. The entire situation is so bewildering and strange that, had I not known about Jonathan's experiences in Transylvania, I would not have believed it. Even so, I was unsure what to think, so I distracted myself by focusing on something else. I uncovered my typewriter and told Dr. Seward:\n\n\"Let me type all this out now.

He is uncommonly clever, if one can judge from his face, and full of energy. If this journal be true—and judging by one’s own wonderful experiences, it must be—he is also a man of great nerve. That going down to the vault a second time was a remarkable piece of daring. After reading his account of it I was prepared to meet a good specimen of manhood, but hardly the quiet, business-like gentleman who came here to-day.\nLater.—After lunch Harker and his wife went back to their own room, and as I passed a while ago I heard the click of the typewriter. They are hard at it. Mrs. Harker says that they are knitting together in chronological order every scrap of evidence they have. Harker has got the letters between the consignee of the boxes at Whitby and the carriers in London who took charge of them. He is now reading his wife’s typescript of my diary. I wonder what they make out of it. Here it is....\nStrange that it never struck me that the very next house might be the Count’s hiding-place! Goodness knows that we had enough clues from the conduct of the patient Renfield! The bundle of letters relating to the purchase of the house were with the typescript. Oh, if we had only had them earlier we might have saved poor Lucy! Stop; that way madness lies! Harker has gone back, and is again collating his material. He says that by dinner-time they will be able to show a whole connected narrative. He thinks that in the meantime I should see Renfield, as hitherto he has been a sort of index to the coming and going of the Count. I hardly see this yet, but when I get at the dates I suppose I shall. What a good thing that Mrs. Harker put my cylinders into type! We never could have found the dates otherwise....\nI found Renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands folded, smiling benignly. At the moment he seemed as sane as any one I ever saw. I sat down and talked with him on a lot of subjects, all of which he treated naturally. He then, of his own accord, spoke of going home, a subject he has never mentioned to my knowledge during his sojourn here. In fact, he spoke quite confidently of getting his discharge at once. I believe that, had I not had the chat with Harker and read the letters and the dates of his outbursts, I should have been prepared to sign for him after a brief time of observation. As it is, I am darkly suspicious. All those outbreaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the Count. What then does this absolute content mean? Can it be that his instinct is satisfied as to the vampire’s ultimate triumph? Stay; he is himself zoöphagous, and in his wild ravings outside the chapel door of the deserted house he always spoke of “master.” This all seems confirmation of our idea. However, after a while I came away; my friend is just a little too sane at present to make it safe to probe him too deep with questions. He might begin to think, and then—! So I came away. I mistrust these quiet moods of his; so I have given the attendant a hint to look closely after him, and to have a strait-waistcoat ready in case of need.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "On September 30th, Mr. Harker arrived at nine in the morning. He had received his wife's telegram just before leaving. He seems unusually intelligent and energetic, judging by his appearance. If his journal is accurate - and based on my own remarkable experiences, it must be - he also possesses significant courage. Going down into that vault a second time was an extraordinarily brave act. After reading his account, I expected to meet a strong, capable man, but not quite the calm, practical gentleman who appeared today. Later, after lunch, the Harkers went back to their room, and as I passed by earlier, I heard the sound of the typewriter. They are working intensely. Mrs. Harker mentioned they are meticulously organizing all their evidence in chronological order. Harker has acquired the letters exchanged between the person who received the boxes in Whitby and the London carriers who handled them. He is currently reading his wife's typed copy of my diary. I wonder what they are concluding from it. It's strange that it never occurred to me that the house right next door could be the Count's hiding place! We certainly had plenty of hints from our patient Renfield's behaviour! The correspondence about the purchase of the house was included with the typed documents. Oh, if only we had had them earlier, we might have saved poor Lucy! But I must stop thinking like that; it leads to madness! Harker has returned to his work and is sorting through his material again. He believes that by dinner, they will have assembled a complete, connected narrative. He suggested that in the meantime, I should see Renfield, as his condition has previously indicated the Count's presence. I don't fully grasp this yet, but I suppose it will become clear once I look at the dates. How fortunate that Mrs. Harker transcribed my phonograph recordings! We would never have been able to pinpoint the dates otherwise. I found Renfield sitting peacefully in his room, his hands clasped, smiling gently. At that moment, he seemed as rational as anyone I have ever encountered. I sat down and discussed various topics with him, all of which he addressed normally. Then, without prompting, he brought up the idea of going home, a subject he has never mentioned to my knowledge during his stay here. In fact, he spoke quite confidently about being discharged immediately. I believe that if I hadn't had the conversation with Harker and read the letters detailing the dates of his violent episodes, I would have been prepared to approve his release after a brief period of observation. As it is, I am deeply suspicious. All those outbreaks were somehow linked to the Count's proximity. What, then, does this absolute contentment mean? Could it be that his instinct is satisfied regarding the vampire's eventual triumph? Wait; he himself is a carnivore of sorts, and during his wild rants outside the deserted house's chapel door, he consistently referred to a \"master.\" This all seems to confirm our theory. However, after a while, I left; my patient is currently a little too normal for it to be safe to question him too deeply. He might start thinking, and then...! So I left. I distrust these quiet phases of his, so I have subtly instructed the attendant to monitor him closely and to have a straitjacket ready if necessary.",

As it stands, I am greatly suspicious. All of his outbursts appear to coincide with the Count's presence. So what does this present calmness mean? Perhaps he feels sure of the vampire's success? Then again, Renfield eats living creatures and, in his manic times outside the chapel of the empty house, always talked about his 'master.' This all supports our theory. Nevertheless, I left after a while; Renfield seems a bit too lucid right now to safely interrogate—he might start thinking harder, and then who knows! So I left.

It was now my object to trace that horrid cargo of the Count’s to its place in London. Later, we may be able to deal with it. Billington junior, a nice lad, met me at the station, and brought me to his father’s house, where they had decided that I must stay the night. They are hospitable, with true Yorkshire hospitality: give a guest everything, and leave him free to do as he likes. They all knew that I was busy, and that my stay was short, and Mr. Billington had ready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes. It gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which I had seen on the Count’s table before I knew of his diabolical plans. Everything had been carefully thought out, and done systematically and with precision. He seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which might be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carried out. To use an Americanism, he had “taken no chances,” and the absolute accuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled, was simply the logical result of his care. I saw the invoice, and took note of it: “Fifty cases of common earth, to be used for experimental purposes.” Also the copy of letter to Carter Paterson, and their reply; of both of these I got copies. This was all the information Mr. Billington could give me, so I went down to the port and saw the coastguards, the Customs officers and the harbour-master. They had all something to say of the strange entry of the ship, which is already taking its place in local tradition; but no one could add to the simple description “Fifty cases of common earth.” I then saw the station-master, who kindly put me in communication with the men who had actually received the boxes. Their tally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to add except that the boxes were “main and mortal heavy,” and that shifting them was dry work. One of them added that it was hard lines that there wasn’t any gentleman “such-like as yourself, squire,” to show some sort of appreciation of their efforts in a liquid form; another put in a rider that the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had elapsed had not completely allayed it. Needless to add, I took care before leaving to lift, for ever and adequately, this source of reproach.\n30 September.—The station-master was good enough to give me a line to his old companion the station-master at King’s Cross, so that when I arrived there in the morning I was able to ask him about the arrival of the boxes. He, too, put me at once in communication with the proper officials, and I saw that their tally was correct with the original invoice. The opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here limited; a noble use of them had, however, been made, and again I was compelled to deal with the result in an ex post facto manner.\nFrom thence I went on to Carter Paterson’s central office, where I met with the utmost courtesy. They looked up the transaction in their day-book and letter-book, and at once telephoned to their King’s Cross office for more details. By good fortune, the men who did the teaming were waiting for work, and the official at once sent them over, sending also by one of them the way-bill and all the papers connected with the delivery of the boxes at Carfax. Here again I found the tally agreeing exactly; the carriers’ men were able to supplement the paucity of the written words with a few details. These were, I shortly found, connected almost solely with the dusty nature of the job, and of the consequent thirst engendered in the operators. On my affording an opportunity, through the medium of the currency of the realm, of the allaying, at a later period, this beneficial evil, one of the men remarked:—\n“That ’ere ’ouse, guv’nor, is the rummiest I ever was in. Blyme! but it ain’t been touched sence a hundred years. There was dust that thick in the place that you might have slep’ on it without ’urtin’ of yer bones; an’ the place was that neglected that yer might ’ave smelled ole Jerusalem in it. But the ole chapel—that took the cike, that did! Me and my mate, we thort we wouldn’t never git out quick enough. Lor’, I wouldn’t take less nor a quid a moment to stay there arter dark.”\nHaving been in the house, I could well believe him; but if he knew what I know, he would, I think, have raised his terms.\nOf one thing I am now satisfied: that all the boxes which arrived at Whitby from Varna in the Demeter were safely deposited in the old chapel at Carfax. There should be fifty of them there, unless any have since been removed—as from Dr. Seward’s diary I fear.\nI shall try to see the carter who took away the boxes from Carfax when Renfield attacked them. By following up this clue we may learn a good deal.\nLater.—Mina and I have worked all day, and we have put all the papers into order.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "September 29th, on the train to London. After Mr. Billington's kind offer of assistance, I decided the best course was to go to Whitby and investigate firsthand. My primary objective was to trace the location of Count Dracula's unsettling cargo in London so we might address it later. Young Mr. Billington, a pleasant young man, met me at the station and took me to his father's home, where they insisted I stay the night. Their hospitality was truly characteristic of Yorkshire; they provided everything a guest could need but allowed complete freedom. Understanding my urgent business and short visit, Mr. Billington had all the documents concerning the box shipment prepared in his office. Seeing one of the letters I had previously seen on the Count's desk before realizing his evil intentions was quite a shock. It was clear everything had been planned and executed with extreme care, precision, and systematic thinking. He seemed to have anticipated every possible accidental hindrance to his plans. To borrow an American phrase, he 'took no chances,' and the absolute accuracy with which his instructions were followed was simply a result of his meticulous planning. I examined the invoice and noted its description: 'Fifty cases of common earth, to be used for experimental purposes.' I also obtained copies of the letter sent to Carter Paterson and their reply. Mr. Billington had no further information. I then went to the port and spoke with the coastguards, Customs officers, and the harbour-master. While they all had tales about the ship's strange arrival, which is becoming a local tale, none could add anything beyond the simple description 'Fifty cases of common earth.' Next, I saw the station-master, who kindly put me in touch with the men who had handled the boxes. Their count matched the list exactly. Their only additional comments were that the boxes were 'extremely heavy' and that moving them was thirsty work. One commented it was unfair there wasn't a gentleman like myself present to offer some liquid thanks, while another added the thirst was so great it hadn't fully subsided even after some time. Naturally, before leaving, I made sure to adequately and permanently remedy this complaint. September 30th. The Whitby station-master was kind enough to give me an introduction to his colleague, the station-master at King's Cross. Upon arriving there in the morning, I was able to inquire about the boxes' arrival. He promptly directed me to the relevant officials, and I confirmed their count matched the original invoice. The opportunities for developing excessive thirst were more limited here, but they had been utilized nobly, requiring me once again to address the outcome retroactively. From there, I proceeded to Carter Paterson's central office, where I was met with great courtesy. They located the transaction in their records and immediately contacted their King's Cross office for more specifics. Fortunately, the men who performed the delivery were available and were sent over. One of them also brought the waybill and all paperwork related to the delivery of the boxes at Carfax. Here too, the tally was exact. The carriers' men were able to add a few details to the sparse written record. These details, I quickly discovered, were almost entirely related to how dusty the job was and the significant thirst it created in the workers. After I provided a way, using money, to satisfy this 'beneficial evil' later on, one of the men remarked: 'That house, sir, is the oddest I've ever been in. Goodness! it hasn't been touched in a hundred years. There was dust so thick you could have slept on it without hurting your bones; and the place was so neglected it smelled like old Jerusalem. But the old chapel – that was the worst! My mate and I thought we'd never get out fast enough. Lord, I wouldn't stay there after dark for less than a pound a minute.' Having visited the house myself, I could easily believe him, but I suspect if he knew what I know, he would have asked for more. I am now convinced of one thing: all the boxes that arrived at Whitby from Varna on the Demeter were safely delivered to the old chapel at Carfax. There should be fifty boxes there, unless any have been removed since – which I fear may be the case based on Dr. Seward's diary. I intend to find the carter who was present when Renfield attacked the boxes at Carfax. Following this lead might reveal a great deal. Later. Mina and I have spent the entire day working to organize all the papers.",

          "text_segment": "30 September.—I am so glad that I hardly know how to contain myself. It is, I suppose, the reaction from the haunting fear which I have had: that this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound might act detrimentally on Jonathan. I saw him leave for Whitby with as brave a face as I could, but I was sick with apprehension. The effort has, however, done him good. He was never so resolute, never so strong, never so full of volcanic energy, as at present. It is just as that dear, good Professor Van Helsing said: he is true grit, and he improves under strain that would kill a weaker nature. He came back full of life and hope and determination; we have got everything in order for to-night. I feel myself quite wild with excitement. I suppose one ought to pity any thing so hunted as is the Count. That is just it: this Thing is not human—not even beast. To read Dr. Seward’s account of poor Lucy’s death, and what followed, is enough to dry up the springs of pity in one’s heart.\nLater.—Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived earlier than we expected. Dr. Seward was out on business, and had taken Jonathan with him, so I had to see them. It was to me a painful meeting, for it brought back all poor dear Lucy’s hopes of only a few months ago. Of course they had heard Lucy speak of me, and it seemed that Dr. Van Helsing, too, has been quite “blowing my trumpet,” as Mr. Morris expressed it. Poor fellows, neither of them is aware that I know all about the proposals they made to Lucy. They did not quite know what to say or do, as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge; so they had to keep on neutral subjects. However, I thought the matter over, and came to the conclusion that the best thing I could do would be to post them in affairs right up to date. I knew from Dr. Seward’s diary that they had been at Lucy’s death—her real death—and that I need not fear to betray any secret before the time. So I told them, as well as I could, that I had read all the papers and diaries, and that my husband and I, having typewritten them, had just finished putting them in order. I gave them each a copy to read in the library. When Lord Godalming got his and turned it over—it does make a pretty good pile—he said:—\n“Did you write all this, Mrs. Harker?”\nI nodded, and he went on:—\n“I don’t quite see the drift of it; but you people are all so good and kind, and have been working so earnestly and so energetically, that all I can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you. I have had one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man humble to the last hour of his life. Besides, I know you loved my poor Lucy—” Here he turned away and covered his face with his hands. I could hear the tears in his voice. Mr. Morris, with instinctive delicacy, just laid a hand for a moment on his shoulder, and then walked quietly out of the room. I suppose there is something in woman’s nature that makes a man free to break down before her and express his feelings on the tender or emotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood; for when Lord Godalming found himself alone with me he sat down on the sofa and gave way utterly and openly. I sat down beside him and took his hand. I hope he didn’t think it forward of me, and that if he ever thinks of it afterwards he never will have such a thought. There I wrong him; I know he never will—he is too true a gentleman. I said to him, for I could see that his heart was breaking:—\n“I loved dear Lucy, and I know what she was to you, and what you were to her. She and I were like sisters; and now she is gone, will you not let me be like a sister to you in your trouble? I know what sorrows you have had, though I cannot measure the depth of them. If sympathy and pity can help in your affliction, won’t you let me be of some little service—for Lucy’s sake?”\nIn an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief. It seemed to me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found a vent at once. He grew quite hysterical, and raising his open hands, beat his palms together in a perfect agony of grief. He stood up and then sat down again, and the tears rained down his cheeks. I felt an infinite pity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly. With a sob he laid his head on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child, whilst he shook with emotion.\nWe women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above smaller matters when the mother-spirit is invoked; I felt this big sorrowing man’s head resting on me, as though it were that of the baby that some day may lie on my bosom, and I stroked his hair as though he were my own child. I never thought at the time how strange it all was.\nAfter a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised himself with an apology, though he made no disguise of his emotion. He told me that for days and nights past—weary days and sleepless nights—he had been unable to speak with any one, as a man must speak in his time of sorrow. There was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or with whom, owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was surrounded, he could speak freely. “I know now how I suffered,” he said, as he dried his eyes, “but I do not know even yet—and none other can ever know—how much your sweet sympathy has been to me to-day. I shall know better in time; and believe me that, though I am not ungrateful now, my gratitude will grow with my understanding. You will let me be like a brother, will you not, for all our lives—for dear Lucy’s sake?”\n“For dear Lucy’s sake,” I said as we clasped hands. “Ay, and for your own sake,” he added, “for if a man’s esteem and gratitude are ever worth the winning, you have won mine to-day. If ever the future should bring to you a time when you need a man’s help, believe me, you will not call in vain. God grant that no such time may ever come to you to break the sunshine of your life; but if it should ever come, promise me that you will let me know.” He was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that I felt it would comfort him, so I said:—\n“I promise.”\nAs I came along the corridor I saw Mr. Morris looking out of a window. He turned as he heard my footsteps. “How is Art?” he said. Then noticing my red eyes, he went on: “Ah, I see you have been comforting him. Poor old fellow! he needs it. No one but a woman can help a man when he is in trouble of the heart; and he had no one to comfort him.”\nHe bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him. I saw the manuscript in his hand, and I knew that when he read it he would realise how much I knew; so I said to him:—\n“I wish I could comfort all who suffer from the heart. Will you let me be your friend, and will you come to me for comfort if you need it? You will know, later on, why I speak.” He saw that I was in earnest, and stooping, took my hand, and raising it to his lips, kissed it. It seemed but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, and impulsively I bent over and kissed him. The tears rose in his eyes, and there was a momentary choking in his throat; he said quite calmly:—\n“Little girl, you will never regret that true-hearted kindness, so long as ever you live!” Then he went into the study to his friend.\n“Little girl!”—the very words he had used to Lucy, and oh, but he proved himself a friend!",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "September 30th.\nI'm incredibly happy, almost unable to contain myself. I believe this joy is a reaction to the constant fear I've had that this dreadful situation and the reopening of his old wound might negatively impact Jonathan. I put on a brave face when he left for Whitby, but I was consumed with worry. However, the experience seems to have been beneficial for him. He's never been more determined, stronger, or filled with such intense energy. It's just as the kind Professor Van Helsing observed: he possesses true resilience and thrives under pressure that would break a weaker person. He returned full of energy, hope, and resolution; we've arranged everything for tonight. I feel a surge of wild excitement. Perhaps one should feel sorry for something as relentlessly pursued as the Count. But that's precisely it: this Entity isn't human – not even animalistic. Reading Dr. Seward’s account of poor Lucy’s death and the events that followed is enough to extinguish any flicker of pity in one's heart.\n\nLater.\nLord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived sooner than anticipated. Dr. Seward was out on business and had taken Jonathan with him, so I had to receive them. It was a difficult meeting for me, as it reminded me of dear Lucy's hopes from just a few months prior. Of course, they had heard Lucy mention me, and it seems Dr. Van Helsing had been praising me quite a bit, as Mr. Morris put it. Poor men, neither of them knows that I am fully aware of the marriage proposals they made to Lucy. They seemed uncertain about what to say or do, being unaware of how much I knew, so they stuck to neutral topics. However, after considering it, I concluded that the best course of action would be to bring them completely up to date on everything. From Dr. Seward’s diary, I knew they were present at Lucy’s actual death, so I didn't need to worry about revealing secrets prematurely. So, I explained, as clearly as I could, that I had read all the papers and diaries, and that my husband and I had typewritten and organized them. I gave each of them a copy to read in the library. When Lord Godalming took his copy and saw the considerable stack, he asked:\n\n“Did you write all this, Mrs. Harker?”\n\nI nodded, and he continued:\n\n“I don’t entirely grasp its purpose yet, but you all are so genuinely good and kind, and have been working with such dedication and energy, that all I can do is trust your judgment implicitly and offer my help. I've already learned one lesson about accepting difficult truths, a lesson that should keep a man humble for the rest of his life. Besides, I know you loved my poor Lucy—” At this point, he turned away and covered his face with his hands. I could hear the tears in his voice. Mr. Morris, showing innate sensitivity, gently placed a hand on his shoulder for a moment and then quietly left the room. I suppose there's something in a woman’s nature that allows a man to openly show his emotions regarding tender or sensitive matters without feeling it compromises his masculinity; for when Lord Godalming found himself alone with me, he sat on the sofa and completely and openly surrendered to his grief. I sat next to him and took his hand. I hope he didn’t find it presumptuous of me, and that if he ever reflects on it later, he won't think that way. Actually, I’m wrong about him; I know he never will – he is too true a gentleman. I said to him, seeing that his heart was breaking:\n\n“I loved dear Lucy, and I understand how much she meant to you, and you to her. She and I were like sisters; now that she is gone, won’t you allow me to be like a sister to you in your time of sorrow? I know you have suffered greatly, though I cannot comprehend the full depth of your pain. If sympathy and compassion can offer any comfort in your grief, please let me be of some small help – for Lucy’s sake?”\n\nImmediately, the poor man was overcome with sorrow. It seemed that all the suffering he had been silently enduring recently found a release at once. He became quite distraught, raising his hands and clapping them together in sheer anguish. He stood up and then sat down again, tears streaming down his face. I felt immense pity for him and instinctively opened my arms. With a sob, he leaned his head on my shoulder and wept like a tired child, trembling with emotion.\n\nWe women have an element of motherhood that enables us to rise above lesser concerns when that maternal instinct is called upon; I felt this big, grieving man's head resting on me as if it were the head of the baby who might one day lie on my chest, and I stroked his hair as though he were my own child. At the time, I didn’t stop to think how unusual it all was.\n\nAfter a while, his sobs subsided, and he straightened up with an apology, though he didn't try to hide his emotions. He told me that for the past weary days and sleepless nights, he hadn't been able to talk openly with anyone, as a man needs to do when in grief. There was no woman whose sympathy he could readily accept, or with whom, due to the terrible circumstances surrounding his sorrow, he could speak freely. “I understand now how much I’ve been suffering,” he said, wiping his eyes, “but even now – and no one else ever can – do I fully grasp how much your sweet sympathy has meant to me today. I will understand it better in time; and believe me, while I am grateful now, my gratitude will deepen as my understanding grows. You will let me be like a brother to you, won't you, for the rest of our lives – for dear Lucy’s sake?”\n\n“For dear Lucy’s sake,” I replied, as we clasped hands. “Yes, and for your own sake,” he added, “for if a man’s respect and gratitude are ever worth earning, you have earned mine today. If the future ever brings a time when you require a man’s assistance, believe me, you will not ask in vain. May God grant that such a time never comes to cast a shadow on your life; but if it ever should, promise me that you will let me know.” He was so sincere, and his grief so raw, that I felt agreeing would comfort him, so I said:\n\n“I promise.”\n\nAs I walked down the corridor, I saw Mr. Morris looking out a window. He turned when he heard my footsteps. “How is Art?” he asked. Noticing my reddened eyes, he continued: “Ah, I see you’ve been comforting him. Poor old fellow! He really needed it. Only a woman can truly help a man when he’s suffering emotionally, and he had no one else to comfort him.”\n\nHe bore his own pain so stoically that my heart ached for him. I saw the manuscript in his hand and knew that upon reading it, he would realize how much I knew; so I said to him:\n\n“I wish I could comfort everyone who suffers emotionally. Will you let me be your friend, and will you come to me for comfort if you need it? You’ll understand later why I say this.” He saw my sincerity, stooped down, took my hand, raised it to his lips, and kissed it. It seemed such inadequate comfort for such a brave and selfless soul, and on impulse, I leaned forward and kissed him. Tears welled up in his eyes, and for a moment, his voice was choked; he then said very calmly:\n\n“Little girl, you will never regret that truly heartfelt kindness, not as long as you live!” Then he went into the study to join his friend.\n\n“Little girl!”—the very words he used for Lucy, and indeed, he proved himself a true friend!",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "30 September.—I am so happy right now that it’s hard to contain myself. I think it’s the relief after all my recent worries that this frightening situation—along with Jonathan having to relive his old traumas—might harm him. When he left for Whitby, I did my best to appear composed, but inside I was overwhelmed with anxiety. However, the experience has actually been good for him. He’s more determined, stronger, and more energetic than ever. Just like Professor Van Helsing said, Jonathan has a firm character and thrives under pressure that would break lesser people. He returned full of vitality, hope, and resolve; we have made preparations for tonight. I am practically bursting with excitement. I suppose it’s natural to feel sorry for anything so mercilessly pursued as the Count. But that’s the thing: he’s not really human—not even an animal. Reading Dr. Seward’s account of Lucy’s death and what came after has hardened my heart against pity.\n\nLater.—Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived sooner than we expected. Dr. Seward was out on business with Jonathan, so I greeted them. It was a difficult encounter for me, reminding me of all of Lucy’s lost hopes from just months ago. They had heard of me through Lucy, and Dr. Van Helsing seems to have praised me highly as well. The poor dears didn’t know that I was aware of their proposals to Lucy, so they seemed awkward and stuck to safe topics. After thinking it over, I decided the best thing would be to bring them fully up to speed. From Dr. Seward’s diary I knew they had been present at Lucy’s actual death and that it was safe to share the truth. I told them I’d read all the diaries and letters, and that Jonathan and I had just finished organizing and typing them up. I gave them each a copy in the library. When Lord Godalming saw the papers, he asked if I’d written all of it.\n\nI nodded, and he said he didn’t fully understand it all, but trusted our group completely given everyone’s courage and effort. He said he’d just have to accept everything we say and help however he could. He also recognized how much I loved Lucy, and was so overcome with emotion he had to turn away. Mr. Morris gently comforted him and left the room to give us privacy. It seems that men can more freely show emotion in the presence of women, and Lord Godalming, finding himself alone with me, broke down openly. I sat with him and took his hand, hoping he wouldn’t think me too forward; but I knew he wouldn’t—he’s a true gentleman. Seeing his heartbreak, I told him I loved Lucy like a sister and wanted to be a sister to him now in his sorrow, offering my sympathy and support.\n\nImmediately, his grief poured out, and all the pain he had been bottling up was released. He became quite hysterical, crying and shaking with emotion. I felt deep compassion for him, holding him as if I were comforting a child, even stroking his hair, without thinking how odd it must have seemed.\n\nEventually, his sobs subsided, and he apologized without hiding his feelings. He confided in me that he’d spent endless days and sleepless nights unable to express his sorrow to anyone, especially lacking a woman’s understanding after such a tragic loss. He thanked me sincerely, saying he could not imagine how much my kindness meant to him, but that his gratitude would only grow with time. He asked if we could remain close like a brother and sister for Lucy’s sake, and I agreed. He told me that if I ever needed help in the future, I could always count on him, though he hoped I’d never face such trouble. I promised I would.\n\nLater, I saw Mr. Morris looking out the window. He asked about Lord Godalming, then noticed I had been crying and observed that he needed support. He said that only a woman could help a man suffering from heartbreak, and Art (Lord Godalming) had no one to do so. Seeing the manuscript in his hand, I told him I wished I could comfort all who suffer, and offered my friendship and support should he ever need it. He appreciated my words and gently kissed my hand, and, moved by his obvious pain, I kissed him on the forehead. He teared up, and with feeling told me I would never regret my kindness to him. Then he left to join his friend. When he called me “little girl”—just as he did with Lucy—it deeply touched me and proved his genuine friendship."

Harker had not yet returned from his visit to the carriers’ men, of whom Dr. Hennessey had written to me. Mrs. Harker gave us a cup of tea, and I can honestly say that, for the first time since I have lived in it, this old house seemed like home. When we had finished, Mrs. Harker said:—\n“Dr. Seward, may I ask a favour? I want to see your patient, Mr. Renfield. Do let me see him. What you have said of him in your diary interests me so much!” She looked so appealing and so pretty that I could not refuse her, and there was no possible reason why I should; so I took her with me. When I went into the room, I told the man that a lady would like to see him; to which he simply answered: “Why?”\n“She is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it,” I answered. “Oh, very well,” he said; “let her come in, by all means; but just wait a minute till I tidy up the place.” His method of tidying was peculiar: he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes before I could stop him. It was quite evident that he feared, or was jealous of, some interference.

Mrs. Harker served us tea, and I must say honestly that, for the first time since I've resided in it, this old residence felt truly welcoming.

It was quite clear that he was apprehensive of, or perhaps protective against, any interference.

She came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command the respect of any lunatic—for easiness is one of the qualities mad people most respect. She walked over to him, smiling pleasantly, and held out her hand.\n“Good-evening, Mr. Renfield,” said she. “You see, I know you, for Dr. Seward has told me of you.” He made no immediate reply, but eyed her all over intently with a set frown on his face. This look gave way to one of wonder, which merged in doubt; then, to my intense astonishment, he said:—\n“You’re not the girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you? You can’t be, you know, for she’s dead.” Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replied:—\n“Oh no! I have a husband of my own, to whom I was married before I ever saw Dr. Seward, or he me. I am Mrs. Harker.”\n“Then what are you doing here?”\n“My husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr. Seward.”\n“Then don’t stay.”\n“But why not?” I thought that this style of conversation might not be pleasant to Mrs. Harker, any more than it was to me, so I joined in:—\n“How did you know I wanted to marry any one?” His reply was simply contemptuous, given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from Mrs. Harker to me, instantly turning them back again:—\n“What an asinine question!”\n“I don’t see that at all, Mr. Renfield,” said Mrs. Harker, at once championing me. He replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as he had shown contempt to me:—\n“You will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker, that when a man is so loved and honoured as our host is, everything regarding him is of interest in our little community. Dr. Seward is loved not only by his household and his friends, but even by his patients, who, being some of them hardly in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes and effects. Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, I cannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates lean towards the errors of non causa and ignoratio elenchi.” I positively opened my eyes at this new development. Here was my own pet lunatic—the most pronounced of his type that I had ever met with—talking elemental philosophy, and with the manner of a polished gentleman. I wonder if it was Mrs. Harker’s presence which had touched some chord in his memory. If this new phase was spontaneous, or in any way due to her unconscious influence, she must have some rare gift or power.\nWe continued to talk for some time; and, seeing that he was seemingly quite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me questioningly as she began, to lead him to his favourite topic. I was again astonished, for he addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of the completest sanity; he even took himself as an example when he mentioned certain things.\n“Why, I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief. Indeed, it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed, and insisted on my being put under control. I used to fancy that life was a positive and perpetual entity, and that by consuming a multitude of live things, no matter how low in the scale of creation, one might indefinitely prolong life. At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually tried to take human life. The doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion I tried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers by the assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his blood—relying, of course, upon the Scriptural phrase, ‘For the blood is the life.’ Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum has vulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt. Isn’t that true, doctor?” I nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly knew what to either think or say; it was hard to imagine that I had seen him eat up his spiders and flies not five minutes before. Looking at my watch, I saw that I should go to the station to meet Van Helsing, so I told Mrs. Harker that it was time to leave. She came at once, after saying pleasantly to Mr. Renfield: “Good-bye, and I hope I may see you often, under auspices pleasanter to yourself,” to which, to my astonishment, he replied:—\n“Good-bye, my dear. I pray God I may never see your sweet face again. May He bless and keep you!”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "For a brief moment, I suspected he might intend harm, recalling his quiet demeanor right before his attack in my office. I positioned myself carefully to intervene instantly should he try to lunge at her. She entered the room with a serene elegance that would naturally command respect from any disturbed individual, as ease is a quality the mentally unstable often value most. Approaching him with a pleasant smile, she extended her hand. \"Good evening, Mr. Renfield,\" she greeted him. \"As you see, I know who you are; Dr. Seward has told me about you.\" He didn't respond immediately, instead scrutinizing her intensely with a deep frown. His expression then shifted to one of surprise, blending into doubt, before, to my utter astonishment, he inquired, \"You're not the young woman the doctor wanted to marry, are you? You couldn't be, because she's gone.\" Mrs. Harker smiled gently as she replied, \"Oh no! I am already married; I have a husband, and we were wed long before I ever met Dr. Seward, or he met me. I am Mrs. Harker.\" \"Then what brings you here?\" he asked. \"My husband and I are visiting Dr. Seward,\" she explained. \"Then you shouldn't stay,\" he advised. \"But why ever not?\" Sensing that this line of questioning might be as uncomfortable for Mrs. Harker as it was for me, I interjected, \"How did you know I had plans to marry someone?\" His response was purely scornful, delivered during a brief pause when he glanced from Mrs. Harker to me, then back to her just as quickly. \"What a ridiculous question!\" \"I don't find it ridiculous at all, Mr. Renfield,\" Mrs. Harker countered immediately, coming to my defense. He responded to her with the same level of politeness and consideration he had just denied me. \"You will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker,\" he began, \"that when someone is as esteemed and cherished as our host, everything concerning him is of interest within our small community. Dr. Seward is admired not just by his household and friends, but even by his patients. Some of them, being somewhat unstable mentally, tend to misinterpret causes and effects. Having myself been a resident of an asylum, I can't help but notice how the deceptive reasoning common among some inmates leans towards the logical errors of non causa pro causa and ignoratio elenchi.\" I was absolutely wide-eyed at this sudden turn. Here was my own prime example of a lunatic, the most extreme I had ever encountered, discussing fundamental philosophy with the refinement of a cultured gentleman. I wondered if Mrs. Harker's presence had somehow awakened a memory or a part of his mind. If this new phase was genuine and spontaneous, or somehow influenced by her mere presence, she must possess a remarkable gift or power. We continued our conversation for some time. Seeing that he seemed quite rational, she cautiously steered the discussion towards his usual obsession, glancing at me for approval as she started. I was surprised yet again, as he addressed the topic with the objectivity one would expect from complete sanity, even using himself as an illustration at times. \"Indeed, I myself am an example of a man with a strange conviction,\" he stated. \"In fact, it's no surprise my friends were concerned and insisted I be confined. I used to believe that life was a tangible and never-ending force, and that by consuming many living beings, regardless of their place in the natural world, one could significantly extend life. At times, this belief was so strong I actually attempted to take human life. The doctor here can confirm that on one occasion I tried to kill him, intending to boost my own vitality by absorbing his life through his blood, relying, of course, on the biblical saying, 'For the blood is the life.' Although, frankly, the seller of a certain quack remedy has made that truth seem utterly commonplace and contemptible. Isn't that right, doctor?\" I nodded in agreement, so astonished that I barely knew what to think or say. It was hard to believe I had seen him consuming spiders and flies just minutes earlier. Checking my watch, I realized I needed to head to the station to meet Van Helsing, so I informed Mrs. Harker it was time to depart. She rose immediately, saying pleasantly to Mr. Renfield, \"Goodbye, and I hope to see you often, perhaps under circumstances more favorable to you.\" To my astonishment, he replied, \"Goodbye, my dear. I pray to God I never see your lovely face again. May He bless and protect you!\"",

She entered the room with a calm, graceful demeanor that would impress any madman, since such calmness is something lunatics highly esteem. Approaching him with a warm smile, she offered her hand.\n\n\"Good evening, Mr. Renfield,\" she said. \"I know who you are—Dr. Seward has spoken of you.\" He didn't respond right away, instead scrutinizing her closely with a deep frown. This look shifted to surprise, then doubt. To my amazement, he asked:\n\n\"You're not the woman the doctor wanted to marry, are you? That can't be—you know she's dead.\" Mrs. Harker smiled and replied kindly:\n\n\"No, I'm married to my own husband; I was wed before Dr. Seward and I ever met. My name is Mrs. Harker.\"\n\n\"Why are you here, then?\"\n\n\"My husband and I are staying with Dr. Seward for a visit.\"\n\n\"Then don't stay.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" I thought this might be an uncomfortable direction for Mrs. Harker, so I stepped in:\n\n\"How did you know I wanted to marry anyone?\" Renfield shot me a contemptuous glare before answering, then quickly returned his gaze to Mrs. Harker:\n\n\"What a foolish question!\"\n\n\"I don't think so, Mr. Renfield,\" Mrs. Harker said, defending me.\n\nWith more politeness than he'd shown to me, he addressed her:\n\n\"Of course you understand, Mrs. Harker, that when a man is as admired as our host, every detail about him draws attention in our community. Dr. Seward is loved not only by his staff and friends, but even by his patients, some of whom are mentally unstable and liable to misinterpret things. Having been an asylum patient myself, I notice that some inmates are prone to logical fallacies like 'non causa' and 'ignoratio elenchi.'\" I was stunned—my most eccentric patient was now speaking with philosophical depth and the manners of a cultured man. Perhaps Mrs. Harker's presence stirred something in him. Whether this change was spontaneous or somehow influenced by her, she clearly had a unique effect.\n\nWe spoke for some time, and since he seemed quite lucid, Mrs. Harker—after glancing to me for approval—steered the conversation to Renfield's favorite subject. I was yet again amazed, as he discussed the topic with total clarity, using himself as an example:\n\n\"I am a case in point—a man gripped by a strange notion. It's little wonder my friends were worried and had me placed under care. I once believed life was a perpetual force, and that by consuming live creatures, no matter how simple, one could extend life endlessly. At times my conviction was so strong I even tried to take a human life. The doctor will confirm that I once attempted to kill him, thinking I could absorb his vitality through his blood, in line with the Biblical phrase, 'For the blood is the life.' A certain medicine peddler has cheapened this truth to the point of ridicule. Isn't that right, doctor?\" I nodded, too surprised to properly respond. It was hard to believe he had been eating flies and spiders only moments before.\n\nSeeing it was time to collect Van Helsing from the station, I told Mrs. Harker we should leave. She agreed quickly, wishing Mr. Renfield well: \"Goodbye. I hope we meet again in better circumstances for you.\" Shockingly, he answered:\n\n\"Goodbye, my dear. I truly hope I never see your lovely face again. May God bless and protect you!\""

He saw me at once, and rushed up to me, saying:—\n“Ah, friend John, how goes all? Well? So! I have been busy, for I come here to stay if need be. All affairs are settled with me, and I have much to tell. Madam Mina is with you? Yes. And her so fine husband? And Arthur and my friend Quincey, they are with you, too?

She has man’s brain—a brain that a man should have were he much gifted—and a woman’s heart. The good God fashioned her for a purpose, believe me, when He made that so good combination. Friend John, up to now fortune has made that woman of help to us; after to-night she must not have to do with this so terrible affair. It is not good that she run a risk so great. We men are determined—nay, are we not pledged?—to destroy this monster; but it is no part for a woman. Even if she be not harmed, her heart may fail her in so much and so many horrors; and hereafter she may suffer—both in waking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams. And, besides, she is young woman and not so long married; there may be other things to think of some time, if not now. You tell me she has wrote all, then she must consult with us; but to-morrow she say good-bye to this work, and we go alone.” I agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what we had found in his absence: that the house which Dracula had bought was the very next one to my own. He was amazed, and a great concern seemed to come on him. “Oh that we had known it before!” he said, “for then we might have reached him in time to save poor Lucy. However, ‘the milk that is spilt cries not out afterwards,’ as you say. We shall not think of that, but go on our way to the end.” Then he fell into a silence that lasted till we entered my own gateway. Before we went to prepare for dinner he said to Mrs. Harker:—\n“I am told, Madam Mina, by my friend John that you and your husband have put up in exact order all things that have been, up to this moment.”\n“Not up to this moment, Professor,” she said impulsively, “but up to this morning.”\n“But why not up to now? We have seen hitherto how good light all the little things have made. We have told our secrets, and yet no one who has told is the worse for it.”\nMrs. Harker began to blush, and taking a paper from her pockets, she said:—\n“Dr. Van Helsing, will you read this, and tell me if it must go in. It is my record of to-day. I too have seen the need of putting down at present everything, however trivial; but there is little in this except what is personal. Must it go in?” The Professor read it over gravely, and handed it back, saying:—\n“It need not go in if you do not wish it; but I pray that it may. It can but make your husband love you the more, and all us, your friends, more honour you—as well as more esteem and love.” She took it back with another blush and a bright smile.",

I have been busy, as I'm here to stay if required. All my affairs are settled, and I have much to tell. Is Mrs. Mina with you? Yes. And her fine husband? And Arthur and my acquaintance Quincey, are they there as well?

Believe me, the good God created her for a purpose when He formed that excellent combination. Friend John, until now, circumstances have made that woman a help to us; after tonight, however, she must not be involved in this dreadful business. It is not good for her to face such great risk. We men are determined—indeed, are we not pledged?—to destroy this monster; but it is not a role for a woman. Even if she is not harmed physically, her spirit may be overwhelmed by so much and so many horrors; and afterward, she may suffer—both when awake, from her anxieties, and in sleep, from her dreams. Furthermore, she is a young woman and recently married; there may be other things to consider someday, if not now. You tell me she has documented everything, so she must confer with us; but tomorrow she must withdraw from this work, and we shall proceed alone.\" I agreed wholeheartedly with him, and then I told him what we had discovered in his absence: that the house Dracula had acquired was the one immediately next to mine.

Surely, God made her this way for a purpose, combining both gifts so perfectly. John, up till now she has been a tremendous support to us, but after tonight she must no longer be involved in such a dangerous matter. It’s not right for her to be at such risk. We men are committed—we have even sworn—to end this evil, but a woman should not be part of the struggle. Even if she escapes unharmed, the terror might deeply affect her, causing future distress both awake and in dreams. Besides, she is newly married and young; there could be other things to consider eventually. Since you said she has recorded everything, she should help us for now, but tomorrow she says goodbye to this mission and we continue alone.\"\n\nI agreed wholeheartedly, and then explained what we had discovered in his absence: that Dracula’s purchased house was actually next to mine. Van Helsing was shocked and deeply troubled. \n\n\"If only we had known sooner! Perhaps we could have saved Lucy. But, as the saying goes, ‘we can’t cry over spilled milk.’ Let’s not dwell on it, but proceed towards our goal.\"\n\nHe was silent until we arrived at my home.

Professor Van Helsing took the head of the table, to which Dr. Seward motioned him as he came into the room. He made me sit next to him on his right, and asked me to act as secretary; Jonathan sat next to me. Opposite us were Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris—Lord Godalming being next the Professor, and Dr. Seward in the centre. The Professor said:—\n“I may, I suppose, take it that we are all acquainted with the facts that are in these papers.” We all expressed assent, and he went on:—\n“Then it were, I think good that I tell you something of the kind of enemy with which we have to deal. I shall then make known to you something of the history of this man, which has been ascertained for me. So we then can discuss how we shall act, and can take our measure according.\n“There are such beings as vampires; some of us have evidence that they exist. Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience, the teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane peoples. I admit that at the first I was sceptic. Were it not that through long years I have train myself to keep an open mind, I could not have believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear. ‘See! see! I prove; I prove.’ Alas! Had I known at the first what now I know—nay, had I even guess at him—one so precious life had been spared to many of us who did love her. But that is gone; and we must so work, that other poor souls perish not, whilst we can save. The nosferatu do not die like the bee when he sting once. He is only stronger; and being stronger, have yet more power to work evil. This vampire which is amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men; he is of cunning more than mortal, for his cunning be the growth of ages; he have still the aids of necromancy, which is, as his etymology imply, the divination by the dead, and all the dead that he can come nigh to are for him at command; he is brute, and more than brute; he is devil in callous, and the heart of him is not; he can, within limitations, appear at will when, and where, and in any of the forms that are to him; he can, within his range, direct the elements; the storm, the fog, the thunder; he can command all the meaner things: the rat, and the owl, and the bat—the moth, and the fox, and the wolf; he can grow and become small; and he can at times vanish and come unknown. How then are we to begin our strike to destroy him? How shall we find his where; and having found it, how can we destroy? My friends, this is much; it is a terrible task that we undertake, and there may be consequence to make the brave shudder. For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win; and then where end we? Life is nothings; I heed him not. But to fail here, is not mere life or death. It is that we become as him; that we henceforward become foul things of the night like him—without heart or conscience, preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best. To us for ever are the gates of heaven shut; for who shall open them to us again? We go on for all time abhorred by all; a blot on the face of God’s sunshine; an arrow in the side of Him who died for man. But we are face to face with duty; and in such case must we shrink? For me, I say, no; but then I am old, and life, with his sunshine, his fair places, his song of birds, his music and his love, lie far behind. You others are young. Some have seen sorrow; but there are fair days yet in store. What say you?”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Mina Harker's journal entry begins by stating that all documented information collected thus far is now complete and organized. Professor Van Helsing took a copy for review after dinner, ahead of their meeting scheduled for nine o'clock. The others have already read the material, ensuring everyone will be fully informed about the facts when they convene in the study, allowing them to formulate a strategy to combat their formidable and mysterious adversary. The entry for September 30th describes the meeting two hours after their six o'clock dinner in Dr. Seward's study. They felt they had unconsciously formed a type of official group or committee. Dr. Seward gestured for Professor Van Helsing to take the main seat at the table upon entering the room. Van Helsing asked Mina to sit next to him on his right and serve as the secretary; Jonathan sat beside her. Across from them sat Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris, with Lord Godalming opposite the Professor and Dr. Seward in the middle. The Professor began by saying he assumed everyone was familiar with the details contained in the papers. After they all agreed, he continued by stating he thought it best to inform them about the nature of the enemy they must face. He then intended to share information he had gathered about this individual's history. Following this, they could discuss their course of action and plan accordingly. He declared that beings like vampires truly exist, and they themselves had proof. He argued that even without their own difficult experiences, historical teachings and records provide sufficient evidence for reasonable people. He confessed that he was initially skeptical, but his many years of training himself to maintain an open mind allowed him to eventually believe, though he felt it was too late. He expressed sorrow that if he had known or even suspected earlier, a precious life could have been saved for those who loved her. However, he noted that the past is unchangeable and their focus must now be on working to ensure no other innocent souls perish, so long as they have the means to save them. He explained that the 'nosferatu' (vampires) do not die like a bee after a single sting; instead, such an act only strengthens them, granting them even greater capacity to cause harm. This particular vampire among them possesses physical strength equivalent to twenty men; his cunning surpasses human limits, having developed over ages. He still utilizes aids from necromancy, which, as the word suggests, involves divination or command through the dead, and any dead he can reach are under his power. He is brutal, worse than an animal, and completely lacks a heart or conscience. Within certain limits, he can appear whenever, wherever, and in any shape he desires. Within his influence, he can control the elements: storms, fog, thunder. He can command all lower creatures: rats, owls, bats, moths, foxes, and wolves. He can change his size, growing larger or becoming smaller, and at times can disappear and reappear unnoticed. Given this, he asked, how should they begin their effort to destroy him? How would they locate his hiding place, and having found it, how could they eliminate him? He stated that this task is immense; it is a terrifying undertaking with potential consequences that could make even brave individuals tremble. He warned that if they fail in this struggle, the vampire is certain to win, and then what would become of them? Life itself is insignificant to him; he does not fear death. But failure here is not just a matter of life or death. It means becoming like him; transforming from that moment onward into foul creatures of the night like him—without heart or conscience, preying on the bodies and souls of those they care about most. For them, the gates of heaven would be shut forever, as who could ever open them again? They would exist eternally abhorred by everyone, a stain on God's creation, a wound in the side of Christ who died for humanity. But they are confronted with their duty, and in such a situation, should they hesitate? For himself, he declared, no; but he added that he is old, and life, with its sunshine, beautiful places, bird songs, music, and love, lies far behind him. The others are young. Some have known sorrow, but there are still good days awaiting them. He concluded by asking for their thoughts and decision.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "At this moment, all our documents are complete and in order. The Professor took one copy with him to study after dinner, before our meeting scheduled for nine o’clock. The rest of us have read everything, so when we assemble in the study we’ll all be caught up and prepared to strategize against our frightening and mysterious adversary.\n\nMina Harker’s Journal.\nSeptember 30th.—We gathered in Dr. Seward’s study two hours after our six o’clock dinner. Without thinking, we arranged ourselves like a committee: Professor Van Helsing sat at the head of the table, as Dr. Seward indicated when he entered. He seated me to his right and asked me to be the secretary, with Jonathan beside me. Across from us were Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris, with Lord Godalming closest to the Professor, and Dr. Seward in the middle. The Professor began:\n\n“I assume you are all familiar with the information in these papers.” We all agreed, and he continued:\n\n“I think it’s best that I tell you what kind of enemy we’re facing. I’ll share with you what I’ve learned about his background, so we can discuss how to act and make our plans accordingly.\n\n“Vampires really do exist; some of us already have proof. Even if we didn’t have our own terrible experiences, the history and teachings of the past provide enough evidence for reasonable people. At first, I was skeptical. If I hadn’t trained myself over many years to keep an open mind, I wouldn’t have believed until the evidence was undeniable. Oh, if only I’d known sooner—or even suspected—I might have saved a dear life now lost to us. But that’s in the past; now we must act to save others while we can. The nosferatu aren’t like bees, who die after they sting; they only get stronger, and with that strength comes even more ability to do harm. The vampire among us is as physically strong as twenty men, is incredibly cunning from centuries of experience, and possesses the aid of necromancy—meaning the use of the dead, who he can command at will. He is both a brute and more than just a brute; heartless, devilish. He can, within limits, appear wherever and however he chooses. He can even influence the weather—storm, fog, thunder—and control animals like rats, owls, bats, moths, foxes, and wolves. He can change his size, and sometimes disappear unnoticed. So, how do we begin to defeat him? How can we track his lair, and having found it, destroy him? This task before us is terrible, enough to shake even the brave; for if we fail, he triumphs, and what becomes of us? To die is nothing; I don’t fear that. But to fail means something worse than death: we too become creatures like him, losing our hearts and consciences, preying on those we love. Heaven would be closed to us forever; we’d become eternally despised, a blemish in the light of God, a wound to Christ. But we must face our duty—should we shrink from it? For me, no; I am old, and the joys of life are behind me. The rest of you are young; though you’ve known sorrow, you’ve still many good days ahead. What do you say?”"

          "text_segment": "Whilst he was speaking, Jonathan had taken my hand. I feared, oh so much, that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when I saw his hand stretch out; but it was life to me to feel its touch—so strong, so self-reliant, so resolute. A brave man’s hand can speak for itself; it does not even need a woman’s love to hear its music.\nWhen the Professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes, and I in his; there was no need for speaking between us.\n“I answer for Mina and myself,” he said.\n“Count me in, Professor,” said Mr. Quincey Morris, laconically as usual.\n“I am with you,” said Lord Godalming, “for Lucy’s sake, if for no other reason.”\nDr. Seward simply nodded. The Professor stood up and, after laying his golden crucifix on the table, held out his hand on either side. I took his right hand, and Lord Godalming his left; Jonathan held my right with his left and stretched across to Mr. Morris. So as we all took hands our solemn compact was made. I felt my heart icy cold, but it did not even occur to me to draw back. We resumed our places, and Dr. Van Helsing went on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work had begun. It was to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike a way, as any other transaction of life:—\n“Well, you know what we have to contend against; but we, too, are not without strength. We have on our side power of combination—a power denied to the vampire kind; we have sources of science; we are free to act and think; and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally. In fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered, and we are free to use them. We have self-devotion in a cause, and an end to achieve which is not a selfish one. These things are much.\n“Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are restrict, and how the individual cannot. In fine, let us consider the limitations of the vampire in general, and of this one in particular.\n“All we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions. These do not at the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and death—nay of more than either life or death. Yet must we be satisfied; in the first place because we have to be—no other means is at our control—and secondly, because, after all, these things—tradition and superstition—are everything. Does not the belief in vampires rest for others—though not, alas! for us—on them? A year ago which of us would have received such a possibility, in the midst of our scientific, sceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century? We even scouted a belief that we saw justified under our very eyes. Take it, then, that the vampire, and the belief in his limitations and his cure, rest for the moment on the same base. For, let me tell you, he is known everywhere that men have been. In old Greece, in old Rome; he flourish in Germany all over, in France, in India, even in the Chernosese; and in China, so far from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples fear him at this day. He have follow the wake of the berserker Icelander, the devil-begotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar. So far, then, we have all we may act upon; and let me tell you that very much of the beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy experience. The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the time; he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the living. Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can even grow younger; that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though they refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty. But he cannot flourish without this diet; he eat not as others. Even friend Jonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him to eat, never! He throws no shadow; he make in the mirror no reflect, as again Jonathan observe. He has the strength of many of his hand—witness again Jonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs, and when he help him from the diligence too. He can transform himself to wolf, as we gather from the ship arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog; he can be as bat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby, and as friend John saw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend Quincey saw him at the window of Miss Lucy. He can come in mist which he create—that noble ship’s captain proved him of this; but, from what we know, the distance he can make this mist is limited, and it can only be round himself. He come on moonlight rays as elemental dust—as again Jonathan saw those sisters in the castle of Dracula. He become so small—we ourselves saw Miss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a hairbreadth space at the tomb door. He can, when once he find his way, come out from anything or into anything, no matter how close it be bound or even fused up with fire—solder you call it. He can see in the dark—no small power this, in a world which is one half shut from the light. Ah, but hear me through. He can do all these things, yet he is not free. Nay; he is even more prisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his cell. He cannot go where he lists; he who is not of nature has yet to obey some of nature’s laws—why we know not. He may not enter anywhere at the first, unless there be some one of the household who bid him to come; though afterwards he can come as he please. His power ceases, as does that of all evil things, at the coming of the day. Only at certain times can he have limited freedom. If he be not at the place whither he is bound, he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset. These things are we told, and in this record of ours we have proof by inference. Thus, whereas he can do as he will within his limit, when he have his earth-home, his coffin-home, his hell-home, the place unhallowed, as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide at Whitby; still at other time he can only change when the time come. It is said, too, that he can only pass running water at the slack or the flood of the tide. Then there are things which so afflict him that he has no power, as the garlic that we know of; and as for things sacred, as this symbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even now when we resolve, to them he is nothing, but in their presence he take his place far off and silent with respect. There are others, too, which I shall tell you of, lest in our seeking we may need them. The branch of wild rose on his coffin keep him that he move not from it; a sacred bullet fired into the coffin kill him so that he be true dead; and as for the stake through him, we know already of its peace; or the cut-off head that giveth rest. We have seen it with our eyes.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "As he spoke, Jonathan held my hand. Initially, seeing him reach out, I feared he was overwhelmed by the gravity of our situation, which worried me greatly. But feeling his touch – so strong, confident, and determined – was incredibly comforting, like receiving life itself. A brave man's hand conveys its message inherently; it doesn't even require a woman's affection to understand its unspoken strength. When the Professor finished, my husband and I exchanged glances, a silent communication passing between us. \"I commit Mina and myself,\" he stated. Mr. Quincey Morris, in his typical concise manner, said, \"Count me in, Professor.\" Lord Godalming added, \"I'm with you, especially for Lucy's sake.\" Dr. Seward simply nodded his agreement. The Professor then stood, placed his golden crucifix on the table, and extended his hands. I took his right hand, Lord Godalming his left; Jonathan held my right hand with his left and reached across to Mr. Morris. Joining hands thus, we made our solemn vow. My heart felt chillingly cold, yet I didn't even consider backing out. We returned to our seats, and Dr. Van Helsing continued with a tone that conveyed a sense of purposeful cheerfulness, signaling the serious work had begun. He intended for it to be treated as gravely and systematically as any important life transaction. \"Well, you are aware of the enemy we face,\" he began, \"but we, too, possess considerable strengths. We have the advantage of working together, a capability denied to the vampire kind. We have scientific knowledge at our disposal. We are free to think and act independently, and the hours of both day and night are equally accessible to us. In essence, our powers are unrestricted in their application. We are driven by dedication to a cause and a goal that is not self-serving. These are significant advantages.\" \"Now, let us examine the extent to which the broad powers aligned against us are limited, and how the individual vampire is constrained. In short, let's discuss the limitations of vampires in general, and of this specific one.\" \"Our information is derived solely from traditions and superstitions. At first glance, this might seem insufficient when dealing with matters of life and death – or rather, something beyond life or death. Nevertheless, we must accept this basis, firstly because we have no other option, and secondly, because, ultimately, these traditions and superstitions are paramount. Isn't belief in vampires founded upon them for everyone else – though sadly, for us, it's now based on painful experience? Just a year ago, which of us, in our scientific, skeptical, practical nineteenth century, would have entertained such a possibility? We even dismissed beliefs that were validated right before our eyes. Assume, then, that the vampire, and the belief in its weaknesses and how to destroy it, currently rest on the same foundation. For I assure you, the vampire is known wherever humans have lived – in ancient Greece, in ancient Rome; it has been widespread in Germany, in France, in India, even in the Chersonese; and in China, so distant in every way, it exists, and people fear it to this day. It has followed in the wake of the berserker Icelander, the devil-spawned Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar. So far, this gives us much to work with; and I must tell you that a great deal of these beliefs are confirmed by our own deeply unfortunate experiences. The vampire survives indefinitely and cannot die from the simple passage of time. It thrives when it can feed on the blood of the living. Even more, we have witnessed among us that it can grow younger; its vital forces become vigorous and appear to renew themselves when its special nourishment is plentiful. But it cannot thrive without this diet; it does not eat like others. Even our friend Jonathan, who lived with him for weeks, never saw him eat, not once! He casts no shadow, nor does he have a reflection in a mirror, as Jonathan also observed. He possesses the strength of many men – again, Jonathan is a witness from when he barred the door against the wolves and helped him from the carriage. He can transform into a wolf, as we inferred from the ship's arrival in Whitby, when he attacked the dog. He can appear as a bat, as Madam Mina saw him at the window in Whitby, as friend John saw him fly from this very house nearby, and as my friend Quincey saw him at Miss Lucy's window. He can materialize in mist that he creates – the noble ship's captain proved this; but, from what we know, the distance he can create this mist is limited, and it can only surround himself. He can travel on moonlight rays as elemental dust – just as Jonathan saw those sisters in Dracula's castle. He can become very small – we ourselves saw Miss Lucy, before she found peace, slip through a hair's breadth gap at the tomb door. Once he has found a way in, he can emerge from or enter anything, no matter how tightly sealed or even melted together it may be – what you call solder. He can see in the dark – no small advantage in a world half-deprived of light. Ah, but hear me fully. He can perform all these actions, yet he is not free. No, he is even more confined than the slave on a galley ship or the madman in his cell. He cannot go wherever he pleases; he who is not part of nature must still obey some of nature's laws – though we do not know why. He cannot enter a place for the first time unless someone in the household invites him; only afterward can he come and go as he wishes. His power, like that of all evil things, ceases with the coming of day. Only at specific times can he have limited freedom. If he is not at his designated resting place, he can only change form at noon or precisely at sunrise or sunset. These are the things we are told, and in our recent experiences, we have proof through inference. Thus, while he can do as he wills within his domain – his earth-home, his coffin-home, his unholy place, as we saw when he visited the suicide's grave in Whitby – at other times, he can only change when the appointed time arrives. It is also said that he can only cross running water at the slack or flood of the tide. Furthermore, there are things that so affect him that he becomes powerless, such as the garlic we are aware of; and as for sacred objects, like this symbol, my crucifix, which was with us just now when we made our resolve, to them he is nothing, but in their presence, he remains distant and silent out of respect. There are other things, too, that I will inform you of, in case we need them during our search. A branch of wild rose on his coffin keeps him from moving out of it; a sacred bullet fired into the coffin kills him, ensuring he is truly dead; and concerning the stake through him, we already know it brings peace; or the severed head that grants rest. We have witnessed these things with our own eyes.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As Jonathan spoke, he took my hand, and although I worried the terror we faced might overwhelm him as I saw his hand reach out, feeling his grasp—so firm and confident—gave me strength. The touch alone showed his courage, which needed no words or even my love to be understood. Once the Professor finished addressing us, Jonathan and I met each other’s eyes, needing no words between us. Jonathan then spoke up for both of us, accepting our role. Mr. Quincey Morris also agreed, in his usual brief way, and Lord Godalming joined in, especially for Lucy’s memory. Dr. Seward just nodded. The Professor stood up, placed his golden crucifix on the table, and reached out his hands, which I and Lord Godalming took; Jonathan held my hand and reached to Mr. Morris so we were all joined. By joining hands, we made a solemn pledge together. My heart felt cold with fear, but I didn't think of backing out. We sat down and Dr. Van Helsing continued, now showing a kind of determination that meant our serious task had begun. We had to approach it with the gravity and practicality of any major life event.\n\nHe reminded us of the strength we had: our unity, our knowledge, our freedom to act and think, and that we possessed the time of both day and night—for all this, our abilities outmatched our enemy’s in many ways. We had devotion to our cause and an unselfish purpose, which were powerful assets.\n\nVan Helsing then asked us to consider what limits our adversary had. Our knowledge was mostly from tradition and superstition, but since no other evidence was available, we had to accept this. Besides, these traditions were actually at the root of belief in vampires, and much of what we had seen confirmed them. He recounted that vampires were known in many cultures—Greece, Rome, Germany, France, India, China, and others, following warriors and peoples across history. Much of what legend described, we had witnessed ourselves: the vampire’s immortality as long as he had blood, the ability to become younger and stronger by feeding, and his strange habits—he eats only blood, casts no shadow or reflection, and has unnatural strength.\n\nVan Helsing listed Dracula’s powers: transforming into a wolf or bat, becoming mist, moving as dust, shrinking to fit through tiny spaces, entering and exiting anywhere once invited, and seeing in the dark. Yet, these abilities come with restrictions: he cannot enter a place unless someone invites him the first time, his powers end at sunrise, and he can only change form at certain times. He is limited to crossing running water at specific tide moments, and some things repel or harm him, like garlic, sacred objects (such as the crucifix), wild rose branches, or a sacred bullet. And as proven, a stake through the heart or beheading can truly kill him. These facts, drawn from our experience, would be vital for our mission."

I have asked my friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University, to make his record; and, from all the means that are, he tell me of what he has been. He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won his name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of Turkey-land. If it be so, then was he no common man; for in that time, and for centuries after, he was spoken of as the cleverest and the most cunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the ‘land beyond the forest.’ That mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to his grave, and are even now arrayed against us. The Draculas were, says Arminius, a great and noble race, though now and again were scions who were held by their coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One. They learned his secrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains over Lake Hermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due. In the records are such words as ‘stregoica’—witch, ‘ordog,’ and ‘pokol’—Satan and hell; and in one manuscript this very Dracula is spoken of as ‘wampyr,’ which we all understand too well. There have been from the loins of this very one great men and good women, and their graves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell. For it is not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in all good; in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest.”\nWhilst they were talking Mr. Morris was looking steadily at the window, and he now got up quietly, and went out of the room. There was a little pause, and then the Professor went on:—\n“And now we must settle what we do. We have here much data, and we must proceed to lay out our campaign. We know from the inquiry of Jonathan that from the castle to Whitby came fifty boxes of earth, all of which were delivered at Carfax; we also know that at least some of these boxes have been removed. It seems to me, that our first step should be to ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall where we look to-day; or whether any more have been removed. If the latter, we must trace——”\nHere we were interrupted in a very startling way. Outside the house came the sound of a pistol-shot; the glass of the window was shattered with a bullet, which, ricochetting from the top of the embrasure, struck the far wall of the room. I am afraid I am at heart a coward, for I shrieked out. The men all jumped to their feet; Lord Godalming flew over to the window and threw up the sash. As he did so we heard Mr. Morris’s voice without:—\n“Sorry! I fear I have alarmed you. I shall come in and tell you about it.” A minute later he came in and said:—\n“It was an idiotic thing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs. Harker, most sincerely; I fear I must have frightened you terribly. But the fact is that whilst the Professor was talking there came a big bat and sat on the window-sill. I have got such a horror of the damned brutes from recent events that I cannot stand them, and I went out to have a shot, as I have been doing of late of evenings, whenever I have seen one. You used to laugh at me for it then, Art.”\n“Did you hit it?” asked Dr. Van Helsing.\n“I don’t know; I fancy not, for it flew away into the wood.” Without saying any more he took his seat, and the Professor began to resume his statement:—",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Therefore, when we locate the dwelling of this being who was once a man, we can confine him to his coffin and destroy him, provided we follow the guidelines we know. But he is cunning. I asked my friend Arminius, from Buda-Pesth University, to compile his history, and based on available resources, he told me what he has been. He must indeed have been that military leader, Voivode Dracula, who earned his fame fighting the Turks across the great river on the very border of Turkish territory. If so, then he was no ordinary man, for in that era, and for centuries afterward, he was described as the most intelligent and devious, as well as the bravest of the people from the 'land beyond the forest'. That formidable intellect and unyielding determination accompanied him to his grave and are currently arrayed against us. According to Arminius, the Draculas were a great and noble lineage, although occasionally some descendants were believed by their contemporaries to have made pacts with the Evil One. They reputedly learned his secrets at the Scholomance, located in the mountains above Lake Hermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth student as his due. Records contain terms like 'stregoica'—witch, 'ordog,' and 'pokol'—Satan and hell; and in one manuscript, this specific Dracula is referred to as 'wampyr,' which we all understand too well. This very person has fathered great men and virtuous women, and their graves sanctify the ground where alone this contamination can reside. For one of its most terrifying aspects is that this evil is deeply rooted in all that is good; it cannot find rest in ground devoid of sacred memories.",

I have enlisted help from my friend Arminius at Buda-Pesth University to research his origins; based on all available information, he tells me who Dracula used to be. He must indeed have been the Voivode Dracula who earned his reputation battling the Turks along the border of their territory. If that's the case, he wasn't an ordinary man; in his time, and for many years after, he was reputed to be not only the bravest but also the most cunning and clever of his people. His powerful mind and unbreakable determination followed him even into death and are what face us now. Arminius describes the Dracula family as a once-great and noble lineage, though some descendants were believed to have dealings with evil forces. They supposedly learned dark secrets at the Scholomance, a school hidden in the mountains by Lake Hermanstadt where, it's said, the devil claims one student out of every ten. Historical records mention words like 'stregoica' (witch), 'ordog' and 'pokol' (meaning Satan and hell), and one document even refers to this Dracula as a 'wampyr'—a word we know all too well. Yet his descendants have included noble men and virtuous women, whose graves sanctify the ground on which this evil can survive. One of the worst things about it is that such a monster is anchored in the midst of goodness—without such hallowed ground, it could not exist.\n\nWhile this conversation took place, Mr. Morris kept his eyes on the window, eventually rising and quietly leaving the room. After a short silence, the Professor continued: 'Now we must decide our next steps. We have gathered much information and must plan our approach. Jonathan found that fifty boxes of earth came from the castle to Whitby and were delivered to Carfax; we also know that some of these have already been moved. I believe our first priority is to check whether the remaining boxes are still in the house behind that wall, or if more have disappeared. If any are missing, we must track them down—'\n\nSuddenly, we were interrupted by a shocking noise from outside: a gunshot broke the silence, shattering the window and sending a bullet ricocheting across the room. Startled, I screamed; the others jumped up as Lord Godalming rushed to throw open the window. Mr. Morris's voice could be heard outside: 'Sorry! I must have startled you. I’ll come in and explain.' He soon entered and said, 'I apologize, Mrs. Harker; it was a foolish thing for me to do, and I must have really frightened you. But as the Professor was speaking, a large bat perched on the window-sill. After what's happened recently, I can't stand bats anymore, so I went out to shoot it, as I've often done in the evenings. You used to make fun of me for that, Art.'\n\n'Were you able to hit it?' Dr. Van Helsing asked.\n\n'I don't think so; I believe it flew off into the woods.' He sat down again without another word, and the Professor resumed his explanation."

You are too precious to us to have such risk. When we part to-night, you no more must question. We shall tell you all in good time. We are men and are able to bear; but you must be our star and our hope, and we shall act all the more free that you are not in the danger, such as we are.”\nAll the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved; but it did not seem to me good that they should brave danger and, perhaps, lessen their safety—strength being the best safety—through care of me; but their minds were made up, and, though it was a bitter pill for me to swallow, I could say nothing, save to accept their chivalrous care of me.\nMr. Morris resumed the discussion:—\n“As there is no time to lose, I vote we have a look at his house right now. Time is everything with him; and swift action on our part may save another victim.”\nI own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came so close, but I did not say anything, for I had a greater fear that if I appeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work, they might even leave me out of their counsels altogether.

You are too precious to us to face such risks. When we separate this evening, you must ask no further questions. We will inform you of everything when the time is right. We are men and capable of enduring hardship; but you must be our guiding light and our source of encouragement, and we can act with greater freedom knowing you are not in the kind of danger we are. All the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved; but I did not feel it was right for them to face peril and potentially reduce their safety—as strength is the greatest protection—by worrying about me; however, they were resolute, and, although it was a difficult truth for me to accept, I could only agree to their protective care. Mr. Morris then continued the discussion: “Since time is critical, I propose we inspect his residence immediately. Time is crucial with him; and quick action on our part might prevent another person from becoming a victim. I admit that my resolve began to weaken as the moment for action drew near, but I remained silent, fearing even more that if I appeared as a burden or an impediment to their task, they might exclude me from their plans entirely. They have now departed for Carfax, equipped to enter the house. In their typical male fashion, they instructed me to retire and sleep; as if a woman could rest when those she cares for are in danger!

You're too important to us to risk your safety. After tonight, you must not ask questions. We will tell you everything in due course. We, as men, can handle the dangers, but you must remain our inspiration and hope.

            "Upon the four men entering his room, Renfield makes his request: he wishes to be immediately released from the asylum and sent home, backing his plea with arguments about his complete recovery and current sanity.",

I told the messenger to say that I would attend to his wishes in the morning; I was busy just at the moment. The attendant added:—\n“He seems very importunate, sir. I have never seen him so eager. I don’t know but what, if you don’t see him soon, he will have one of his violent fits.” I knew the man would not have said this without some cause, so I said: “All right; I’ll go now”; and I asked the others to wait a few minutes for me, as I had to go and see my “patient.”\n“Take me with you, friend John,” said the Professor. “His case in your diary interest me much, and it had bearing, too, now and again on our case. I should much like to see him, and especial when his mind is disturbed.”\n“May I come also?” asked Lord Godalming.\n“Me too?” said Quincey Morris. “May I come?” said Harker. I nodded, and we all went down the passage together.\nWe found him in a state of considerable excitement, but far more rational in his speech and manner than I had ever seen him. There was an unusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything I had ever met with in a lunatic; and he took it for granted that his reasons would prevail with others entirely sane. We all four went into the room, but none of the others at first said anything. His request was that I would at once release him from the asylum and send him home. This he backed up with arguments regarding his complete recovery, and adduced his own existing sanity. “I appeal to your friends,” he said, “they will, perhaps, not mind sitting in judgment on my case. By the way, you have not introduced me.” I was so much astonished, that the oddness of introducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment; and, besides, there was a certain dignity in the man’s manner, so much of the habit of equality, that I at once made the introduction: “Lord Godalming; Professor Van Helsing; Mr. Quincey Morris, of Texas; Mr. Renfield.” He shook hands with each of them, saying in turn:—\n“Lord Godalming, I had the honour of seconding your father at the Windham; I grieve to know, by your holding the title, that he is no more. He was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him; and in his youth was, I have heard, the inventor of a burnt rum punch, much patronised on Derby night. Mr. Morris, you should be proud of your great state. Its reception into the Union was a precedent which may have far-reaching effects hereafter, when the Pole and the Tropics may hold alliance to the Stars and Stripes. The power of Treaty may yet prove a vast engine of enlargement, when the Monroe doctrine takes its true place as a political fable. What shall any man say of his pleasure at meeting Van Helsing? Sir, I make no apology for dropping all forms of conventional prefix. When an individual has revolutionised therapeutics by his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain-matter, conventional forms are unfitting, since they would seem to limit him to one of a class. You, gentlemen, who by nationality, by heredity, or by the possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective places in the moving world, I take to witness that I am as sane as at least the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties. And I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, humanitarian and medico-jurist as well as scientist, will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one to be considered as under exceptional circumstances.” He made this last appeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its own charm.\nI think we were all staggered. For my own part, I was under the conviction, despite my knowledge of the man’s character and history, that his reason had been restored; and I felt under a strong impulse to tell him that I was satisfied as to his sanity, and would see about the necessary formalities for his release in the morning. I thought it better to wait, however, before making so grave a statement, for of old I knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable. So I contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared to be improving very rapidly; that I would have a longer chat with him in the morning, and would then see what I could do in the direction of meeting his wishes. This did not at all satisfy him, for he said quickly:—",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "At 4 o'clock in the morning on October 1st, just as we were getting ready to leave the building, an urgent communication arrived from Renfield. He desperately wanted to see me at once, claiming he had something critically important to discuss. I instructed the person who brought the message to tell him I would attend to his needs in the morning, as I was occupied at that moment. The attendant then added, 'He appears very insistent, sir. I've never seen him this eager. It's possible, if you don't see him soon, he might have one of his violent episodes.' Understanding that the attendant wouldn't make such a statement without reason, I decided, 'Very well; I will go now.' I asked the others to delay their departure for a few minutes while I went to check on my 'patient.' Professor Van Helsing immediately requested, 'Let me accompany you, friend John.' He explained, 'His situation, as documented in your journal, greatly interests me, and it has occasionally related to our current problem. I am eager to see him, especially when his mental state is agitated.' Lord Godalming inquired, 'May I join as well?' Quincey Morris asked, 'And me?' Harker also requested permission. I nodded in agreement, and we all proceeded down the corridor together. Upon finding him, we noted he was considerably agitated but spoke and behaved with significantly more coherence and rationality than I had ever observed before. He possessed an unusual degree of self-awareness, unlike any I had encountered in a mentally ill person; he seemed convinced that his reasoning would be accepted by others who were entirely sound of mind. The four of us entered the room, but initially, none of the others spoke. His demand was for me to immediately release him from the psychiatric hospital and allow him to return home. He supported this request with arguments about his complete recovery and cited his present state of sanity. 'I appeal to your companions,' he stated, 'perhaps they won't mind evaluating my circumstances. By the way, you haven't introduced me.' I was so taken aback that I didn't immediately register how strange it was to introduce a patient within an asylum. Furthermore, there was a certain dignity in his demeanor, a sense of behaving as an equal, which prompted me to proceed with the introductions without hesitation: 'Lord Godalming; Professor Van Helsing; Mr. Quincey Morris, from Texas; Mr. Renfield.' He shook hands with each man in turn, speaking to them individually. To Lord Godalming, he said, 'Lord Godalming, I had the honour of supporting your father at the Windham; I am saddened to learn, by your inheritance of the title, that he is no longer with us. He was a man universally admired and respected; and I have heard that in his youth, he invented a particularly potent burnt rum punch, which was very popular on Derby night.' Addressing Mr. Morris, he remarked, 'Mr. Morris, you should be immensely proud of your vast state. Its admission into the Union set a precedent that could have profound future implications, potentially leading to alliances between the Pole and the Tropics under the Stars and Stripes. The authority of treaties may yet become a powerful instrument for expansion, once the Monroe Doctrine is recognized as a political myth.' Regarding Van Helsing, he exclaimed, 'How can anyone express their pleasure at meeting Van Helsing? Sir, I offer no apology for setting aside all conventional titles. When an individual has fundamentally changed medical treatment through his discovery concerning the continuous development of brain matter, standard formalities seem inappropriate, as they would appear to confine him to a single category.' He then turned to all of us: 'You gentlemen, who by birth, lineage, or inherent talent are suited to occupy your respective positions in the dynamic world, bear witness that I am as mentally sound as the majority of individuals who enjoy full freedom. And I am certain that you, Dr. Seward, being a humanitarian and legal-medical expert as well as a scientist, will feel a moral obligation to treat me as someone whose situation must be considered under exceptional circumstances.' He delivered this final plea with a refined and convincing air that was quite compelling. I believe we were all stunned. Personally, despite my familiarity with the man's personality and history, I was convinced his sanity had returned. I felt a strong urge to tell him that I was satisfied he was sane and would arrange the necessary procedures for his release in the morning. However, I decided it was better to wait before making such a significant declaration, remembering the unpredictable and sudden shifts in this particular patient's condition over the years. So, I limited myself to a general statement that he seemed to be improving very rapidly, that I would have a more extensive conversation with him in the morning, and would then see what steps I could take to address his request. This response did not satisfy him in the least, and he quickly said:",

I told the attendant to inform Renfield I would see him in the morning since I was occupied at the moment. The attendant insisted Renfield seemed unusually insistent and more eager than ever, warning that if I didn’t see him soon, he might have a violent episode. Recognizing the attendant's concern, I agreed to visit Renfield right away, asking my companions to wait. Professor Van Helsing expressed interest in joining me, noting that Renfield’s case, as described in my journal, was fascinating and might relate to our own situation. Lord Godalming, Quincey Morris, and Harker each asked to accompany me as well, so we all made our way to Renfield together.\n\nWe found Renfield very agitated but surprisingly coherent—more logical and self-aware than I’d seen him before. He spoke as if expecting rational arguments to convince sane listeners. The four of us entered the room without saying anything at first. Renfield pleaded for immediate release from the asylum and to be sent home, arguing for his full recovery and clear mind. He asked my friends to act as judges of his case, pointing out I hadn’t introduced him yet. In my surprise at his poise and dignity, I made the introductions: Lord Godalming, Professor Van Helsing, Mr. Quincey Morris of Texas, and Mr. Renfield. Renfield shook hands with each man, offering personalized remarks:\n\nTo Lord Godalming, he recalled having seconded his father at the Windham and expressed his condolences, mentioning the senior Godalming’s popularity and invention of a famous punch. To Mr. Morris, he praised Texas and noted its historical significance in joining the Union. For Van Helsing, he dropped formalities, lauding Van Helsing’s revolutionary work in brain science. Addressing us all, Renfield declared himself as sane as most men, appealing to me as a physician and humanitarian to treat him as a special case. Renfield made this plea with a confident, dignified air.\n\nWe were all taken aback. Despite Renfield’s troubled history, I nearly believed he was sane and felt tempted to promise I would arrange his release in the morning; however, I decided to wait, recalling how quickly his condition could change. I told him he seemed to be improving rapidly and promised a more thorough conversation in the morning before making any decisions. Renfield was not satisfied with this answer and quickly responded."

Time presses, and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is of the essence of the contract. I am sure it is only necessary to put before so admirable a practitioner as Dr. Seward so simple, yet so momentous a wish, to ensure its fulfilment.” He looked at me keenly, and seeing the negative in my face, turned to the others, and scrutinised them closely. Not meeting any sufficient response, he went on:—\n“Is it possible that I have erred in my supposition?”\n“You have,” I said frankly, but at the same time, as I felt, brutally. There was a considerable pause, and then he said slowly:—\n“Then I suppose I must only shift my ground of request. Let me ask for this concession—boon, privilege, what you will. I am content to implore in such a case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of others. I am not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons; but you may, I assure you, take it from me that they are good ones, sound and unselfish, and spring from the highest sense of duty. Could you look, sir, into my heart, you would approve to the full the sentiments which animate me. Nay, more, you would count me amongst the best and truest of your friends.” Again he looked at us all keenly. I had a growing conviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method was but yet another form or phase of his madness, and so determined to let him go on a little longer, knowing from experience that he would, like all lunatics, give himself away in the end. Van Helsing was gazing at him with a look of utmost intensity, his bushy eyebrows almost meeting with the fixed concentration of his look. He said to Renfield in a tone which did not surprise me at the time, but only when I thought of it afterwards—for it was as of one addressing an equal:—\n“Can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free to-night? I will undertake that if you will satisfy even me—a stranger, without prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind—Dr. Seward will give you, at his own risk and on his own responsibility, the privilege you seek.” He shook his head sadly, and with a look of poignant regret on his face. The Professor went on:—\n“Come, sir, bethink yourself. You claim the privilege of reason in the highest degree, since you seek to impress us with your complete reasonableness. You do this, whose sanity we have reason to doubt, since you are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect. If you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course, how can we perform the duty which you yourself put upon us? Be wise, and help us; and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish.” He still shook his head as he said:—\n“Dr. Van Helsing, I have nothing to say. Your argument is complete, and if I were free to speak I should not hesitate a moment; but I am not my own master in the matter. I can only ask you to trust me. If I am refused, the responsibility does not rest with me.” I thought it was now time to end the scene, which was becoming too comically grave, so I went towards the door, simply saying:—\n“Come, my friends, we have work to do. Good-night.”\nAs, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient. He moved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared that he was about to make another homicidal attack. My fears, however, were groundless, for he held up his two hands imploringly, and made his petition in a moving manner. As he saw that the very excess of his emotion was militating against him, by restoring us more to our old relations, he became still more demonstrative. I glanced at Van Helsing, and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes; so I became a little more fixed in my manner, if not more stern, and motioned to him that his efforts were unavailing. I had previously seen something of the same constantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request of which at the time he had thought much, such, for instance, as when he wanted a cat; and I was prepared to see the collapse into the same sullen acquiescence on this occasion. My expectation was not realised, for, when he found that his appeal would not be successful, he got into quite a frantic condition. He threw himself on his knees, and held up his hands, wringing them in plaintive supplication, and poured forth a torrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his cheeks, and his whole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion:—\n“Let me entreat you, Dr. Seward, oh, let me implore you, to let me out of this house at once. Send me away how you will and where you will; send keepers with me with whips and chains; let them take me in a strait-waistcoat, manacled and leg-ironed, even to a gaol; but let me go out of this. You don’t know what you do by keeping me here. I am speaking from the depths of my heart—of my very soul. You don’t know whom you wrong, or how; and I may not tell. Woe is me! I may not tell. By all you hold sacred—by all you hold dear—by your love that is lost—by your hope that lives—for the sake of the Almighty, take me out of this and save my soul from guilt! Can’t you hear me, man? Can’t you understand? Will you never learn? Don’t you know that I am sane and earnest now; that I am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting for his soul? Oh, hear me! hear me! Let me go! let me go! let me go!”\nI thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get, and so would bring on a fit; so I took him by the hand and raised him up.\n“Come,” I said sternly, “no more of this; we have had quite enough already. Get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly.”\nHe suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments. Then, without a word, he rose and moving over, sat down on the side of the bed. The collapse had come, as on former occasion, just as I had expected.\nWhen I was leaving the room, last of our party, he said to me in a quiet, well-bred voice:—\n“You will, I trust, Dr. Seward, do me the justice to bear in mind, later on, that I did what I could to convince you to-night.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "However, I fear you don't grasp my desire, Dr. Seward. I want to leave immediately—right now—this very hour, this very moment, if possible. Time is critical, and regarding our implicit arrangement with death, time is of the essence of the agreement. I am confident that presenting such a straightforward, yet extremely important, request to a skilled professional like Dr. Seward is all that's needed to ensure it is fulfilled. He looked intently at me, and seeing my refusal reflected in my face, he turned to the others, observing them closely. Finding no adequate reaction, he continued: 'Is it possible that I was mistaken in my assumption?' 'Yes, you were,' I replied honestly, though I felt it sounded cruel. There was a long pause, and then he slowly said: 'Then I suppose I must change the nature of my request. Please grant me this favor—permission, privilege, whatever you wish to call it. In this situation, I am willing to plead, not for myself, but for the benefit of others. I am unable to disclose all of my reasons, but I assure you, they are sound, unselfish, and stem from the highest sense of duty. Sir, if you could see into my heart, you would completely approve of the feelings that motivate me. In fact, you would consider me among your best and most loyal friends.' Again, he scrutinized all of us sharply. I was increasingly convinced that this abrupt shift in his intellectual approach was merely another symptom or stage of his madness, so I decided to let him continue for a while, knowing from experience that, like all mentally ill individuals, he would eventually reveal his true state. Van Helsing was watching him with extreme intensity, his thick eyebrows nearly meeting with the fixed concentration of his gaze. He spoke to Renfield in a tone that didn't surprise me at the time, but did later upon reflection—as if speaking to an equal: 'Can you not frankly state your genuine reason for wanting freedom tonight? I guarantee that if you can convince even me—a neutral outsider, without bias, accustomed to keeping an open mind—Dr. Seward will, at his own risk and responsibility, grant the privilege you seek.' Renfield sadly shook his head, a look of deep regret on his face. The Professor persisted: 'Come, sir, think carefully. You claim the highest level of reason by trying to persuade us of your complete rationality. You do this, despite our having cause to question your sanity, as you are still receiving medical treatment for this very condition. If you won't help us decide the wisest course, how can we fulfill the duty you yourself have placed upon us? Be sensible and assist us; and if we can, we will help you achieve your wish.' He still shook his head as he replied: 'Dr. Van Helsing, I have nothing I can say. Your argument is perfectly valid, and if I were free to speak, I would not hesitate for a second; but I am not in control of this matter. I can only ask you to trust me. If I am refused, the responsibility does not fall on me.' I felt it was time to end the scene, which was becoming too bizarrely serious, so I walked towards the door, simply stating: 'Come, my friends, we have tasks to attend to. Good-night.' However, as I neared the door, a new transformation came over the patient. He moved towards me so rapidly that for a moment I feared he was about to launch another violent attack. My fears, however, were unfounded, as he held up both hands imploringly and made his appeal in a very moving way. Seeing that the very intensity of his emotion was working against him, by reinforcing our usual roles, he became even more expressive. I glanced at Van Helsing and saw my own belief mirrored in his eyes; so I became slightly firmer in my manner, though not more harsh, and signaled to him that his efforts were useless. I had seen a similar escalating excitement in him before when he strongly desired something he had thought about a great deal, such as when he wanted a cat; and I expected him to collapse into the same sullen acceptance this time. My expectation was not met, for when he realized his plea would not succeed, he became quite frantic. He threw himself onto his knees, held up his hands, wringing them in pitiful pleading, and poured out a flood of urgent requests, with tears streaming down his cheeks, his entire face and body showing the deepest anguish: 'Let me beg you, Dr. Seward, oh, let me implore you, to let me leave this house immediately. Send me away however you want and wherever you want; send attendants with me with whips and chains; let them take me in a straitjacket, shackled and leg-ironed, even to a prison; but just let me get out of here. You don't understand what you are doing by keeping me here. I am speaking from the depths of my heart—from my very soul. You don't know whom you are harming, or how; and I am forbidden to tell. Oh, the misery! I am forbidden to tell. By everything you consider sacred—by everything you hold dear—by your lost love—by your living hope—for the love of God, take me out of this and save my soul from guilt! Can't you hear me, man? Can't you comprehend? Will you never learn? Don't you understand that I am sane and sincere now; that I am not a madman having a fit, but a sane man fighting for his soul? Oh, listen to me! Listen to me! Let me leave! Let me leave! Let me leave!' I thought that the longer this continued, the wilder he would become, likely bringing on a fit; so I took his hand and helped him stand up. 'Come,' I said sternly, 'no more of this; we have had quite enough already. Go to bed and try to act more calmly.' He stopped abruptly and looked at me intently for several moments. Then, without a word, he stood up and, moving over, sat down on the edge of the bed. The sudden calming, just as I had anticipated based on previous incidents, had occurred. As I was leaving the room, the last of our group, he said to me in a quiet, cultured voice: 'I trust, Dr. Seward, that you will later grant me the fairness of remembering that I did everything I could to convince you tonight.'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"Dr. Seward, I fear you do not fully understand me. I wish to leave immediately—right here and now if possible. There's no time to lose, and in the deal we've made with old Father Time, being prompt is crucial. I believe that simply asking someone as experienced as yourself for this important but straightforward favor should be enough to grant it.\" He gave me a sharp look, and, noting my disapproving expression, turned to the others and studied them, but didn’t find support. He continued, “Am I mistaken in my assumption?”\n\n“You are,” I replied candidly, though I knew it might sound harsh. There was a pause, then he went on slowly, “Then let me change my request. Let me ask instead for a concession—call it a privilege or a kindness—whatever you wish. I am willing to beg, not for myself, but for others. I can’t tell you all my reasons, but rest assured they are good, genuine, selfless, and rooted in duty. If you could see my intentions, you’d understand and approve; you might even consider me among your best friends.” Again, he scrutinized us. I was increasingly convinced that this sudden change in his reasoning was another facet of his madness, so I decided to let him continue, knowing that, as with many patients, he would eventually reveal the truth himself. Van Helsing watched him intently, his brows drawn together in concentration. He addressed Renfield as one would an equal:\n\n“Can you not simply tell us your real reason for wanting to leave tonight? If you can convince even me—an impartial stranger with an open mind—Dr. Seward will take the risk and grant your request.” Renfield shook his head sadly, his face full of regret. The professor pressed on:\n\n“Think carefully. You claim supreme rationality by pleading your case with such logic, even though we doubt your sanity, since you’re still under care for this very issue. If you won’t help us decide what’s best, how can we fulfill the duty you’ve set before us? Be wise—help us help you achieve your goal.” Renfield still shook his head: “Dr. Van Helsing, I cannot say more. Your argument is sound; if I could speak openly I would. But this is not mine to decide. I can only ask you to trust me. If I am refused, the blame is not mine.”\n\nDeciding it was time to end the scene, which had grown almost absurdly serious, I moved to leave, saying, “Come, friends, we have work to do. Good night.”\n\nAs I neared the door, a sudden change came over the patient. He rushed towards me—I feared, for a moment, another violent outburst, but it was unfounded. Instead, he raised his hands in appeal, pleading desperately. His emotion seemed to undermine his own case, so he only became more fervent. I looked at Van Helsing, who seemed to share my thoughts; I became more unyielding, indicating that further pleading was pointless. I had seen him behave like this before when making big requests, such as asking for a pet cat, and expected he would soon sink into resignation. But this time, instead of calming down, he grew frantic. He dropped to his knees, wringing his hands, and begged passionately, tears streaming down his face:\n\n“Dr. Seward, I beg you, let me leave this place now. Send me away however you wish—with guards, in chains—take me even to prison, but get me out of here. You can’t know what harm you do by keeping me here. I speak from my soul. You don’t know whom you hurt, or how, and I can’t explain. God help me, I cannot explain. For all you hold sacred, for love, for hope, for the sake of your soul—take me from here and save me from guilt! Don’t you hear me? Don’t you understand? Can’t you see I am sane and earnest—not a madman in a fit, but a sane man fighting for his soul? Oh—let me go!”\n\nSeeing that the longer this continued, the worse he'd become, I raised him up by the hand. “Enough,” I said sternly. “We’ve had quite enough of this. Go to bed now and try to compose yourself.”\n\nHe abruptly stopped, looked at me intently, then silently sat on his bed. The anticipated collapse had arrived, just as in previous times.\n\nAs I was leaving the room—last out—he said to me quietly, \"I hope you’ll remember, Dr. Seward, that I did my best tonight to convince you.\""

          "text_segment": "1 October, 5 a. m.—I went with the party to the search with an easy mind, for I think I never saw Mina so absolutely strong and well. I am so glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work. Somehow, it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business at all; but now that her work is done, and that it is due to her energy and brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a way that every point tells, she may well feel that her part is finished, and that she can henceforth leave the rest to us. We were, I think, all a little upset by the scene with Mr. Renfield. When we came away from his room we were silent till we got back to the study. Then Mr. Morris said to Dr. Seward:—\n“Say, Jack, if that man wasn’t attempting a bluff, he is about the sanest lunatic I ever saw. I’m not sure, but I believe that he had some serious purpose, and if he had, it was pretty rough on him not to get a chance.” Lord Godalming and I were silent, but Dr. Van Helsing added:—\n“Friend John, you know more of lunatics than I do, and I’m glad of it, for I fear that if it had been to me to decide I would before that last hysterical outburst have given him free. But we live and learn, and in our present task we must take no chance, as my friend Quincey would say. All is best as they are.” Dr. Seward seemed to answer them both in a dreamy kind of way:—\n“I don’t know but that I agree with you. If that man had been an ordinary lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting him; but he seems so mixed up with the Count in an indexy kind of way that I am afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads. I can’t forget how he prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat, and then tried to tear my throat out with his teeth. Besides, he called the Count ‘lord and master,’ and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way. That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help him, so I suppose he isn’t above trying to use a respectable lunatic. He certainly did seem earnest, though. I only hope we have done what is best. These things, in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand, help to unnerve a man.” The Professor stepped over, and laying his hand on his shoulder, said in his grave, kindly way:—\n“Friend John, have no fear. We are trying to do our duty in a very sad and terrible case; we can only do as we deem best. What else have we to hope for, except the pity of the good God?” Lord Godalming had slipped away for a few minutes, but now he returned. He held up a little silver whistle, as he remarked:—\n“That old place may be full of rats, and if so, I’ve got an antidote on call.” Having passed the wall, we took our way to the house, taking care to keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shone out. When we got to the porch the Professor opened his bag and took out a lot of things, which he laid on the step, sorting them into four little groups, evidently one for each. Then he spoke:—\n“My friends, we are going into a terrible danger, and we need arms of many kinds. Our enemy is not merely spiritual. Remember that he has the strength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our windpipes are of the common kind—and therefore breakable or crushable—his are not amenable to mere strength. A stronger man, or a body of men more strong in all than him, can at certain times hold him; but they cannot hurt him as we can be hurt by him. We must, therefore, guard ourselves from his touch. Keep this near your heart”—as he spoke he lifted a little silver crucifix and held it out to me, I being nearest to him—“put these flowers round your neck”—here he handed to me a wreath of withered garlic blossoms—“for other enemies more mundane, this revolver and this knife; and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which you can fasten to your breast; and for all, and above all at the last, this, which we must not desecrate needless.” This was a portion of Sacred Wafer, which he put in an envelope and handed to me. Each of the others was similarly equipped. “Now,” he said, “friend John, where are the skeleton keys? If so that we can open the door, we need not break house by the window, as before at Miss Lucy’s.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "October 1st, 5 a.m.—Feeling reassured, I joined the search party, as Mina appeared stronger and healthier than I had ever seen her. I was greatly relieved that she agreed to stay behind and let the men handle the task. The thought of her being involved in this terrifying undertaking had distressed me, but now that her vital work is finished—having expertly and diligently compiled the entire narrative so that every detail is impactful—she can rightly feel her part is complete and entrust the rest to us. I believe we were all somewhat unsettled by the scene with Mr. Renfield. After leaving his room, we remained silent until we reached the study. Then, Mr. Morris commented to Dr. Seward, \"Look, Jack, if that fellow wasn't faking it, he's the most rational 'crazy' person I've ever encountered. I'm not certain, but I suspect he had a serious intention, and if so, it was quite harsh not to give him a chance.\" Lord Godalming and I said nothing, but Dr. Van Helsing added, \"My friend John, you understand more about those with mental illness than I do, and I am grateful for it. I fear that if it had been up to me, I might have released him before that final emotional outburst. But we gain wisdom through experience, and in our current mission, we must avoid taking any risks, as my friend Quincey would say. Everything is as it should be.\" Dr. Seward responded to them both in a somewhat distant manner, \"I'm not sure I don't agree with you. If he were just a typical patient, I might have risked trusting him. However, he seems so intricately connected to the Count, almost like an index, that I'm afraid of making a mistake by indulging his strange ideas. I cannot forget how he prayed with nearly equal passion for a cat, and then attempted to tear my throat out with his teeth. Furthermore, he referred to the Count as 'lord and master,' suggesting he might want to escape to assist him in some evil plan. That dreadful creature has wolves, rats, and his own kind to help him, so I suppose he wouldn't hesitate to try and use a seemingly respectable patient. He certainly did appear sincere, though. I only hope we've made the right decision. These events, combined with the dangerous work we're undertaking, tend to wear on a man's nerves.\" The Professor stepped closer and, placing his hand on Seward's shoulder, spoke in his serious, compassionate tone, \"Friend John, do not worry. We are striving to fulfill our duty in a profoundly sorrowful and terrible situation; we can only act as we believe is best. What else can we hope for, other than the mercy of the good God?\" Lord Godalming had briefly left but now returned. He held up a small silver whistle and remarked, \"That old place might be infested with rats, and if so, I've got a remedy ready.\" After crossing the wall, we headed towards the house, being careful to remain within the shadows cast by the trees on the lawn when the moonlight was bright. Upon reaching the porch, the Professor opened his bag and took out several items, placing them on the step and dividing them into four small piles, clearly one for each of us. Then he spoke, \"My friends, we are entering immense peril, and we require various means of defense. Our adversary is not merely spiritual. Remember that he possesses the strength of twenty men, and while our necks and windpipes are ordinary—and therefore vulnerable to breaking or crushing—his are not susceptible to mere physical force. A stronger man, or a group of men collectively stronger than him, can restrain him at times, but they cannot harm him as he can harm us. We must, therefore, protect ourselves from his touch. Keep this close to your heart\"—as he spoke, he lifted a small silver crucifix and extended it to me, being the nearest—\"put these flowers around your neck\"—here he handed me a wreath of dried garlic blossoms—\"for other, more worldly foes, this revolver and this knife; and to assist in everything, these very small electric lamps which you can attach to your chest; and for all, and most importantly at the end, this, which we must not needlessly disrespect.\" This was a piece of consecrated Sacred Wafer, which he placed in an envelope and gave to me. The others were similarly equipped. \"Now,\" he said, \"friend John, where are the skeleton keys? If we can open the door this way, we won't have to break in through a window, as we did before at Miss Lucy's place.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "October 1st, 5 a.m.—I joined the group to begin our search feeling calm, because I've never seen Mina so healthy and strong. I'm very relieved she agreed to stand back and let the men handle this mission. The idea of her being involved in such a dangerous business was always troubling to me; but now, her contribution—using her intelligence, energy, and foresight to organize all the information—has made it possible for her to step aside. She can confidently leave the rest to us. We were all a bit shaken by what happened with Mr. Renfield earlier. After leaving his room, we walked back in silence to the study. Then Mr. Morris remarked to Dr. Seward, “Jack, if that wasn’t an act, he’s the most reasonable madman I’ve ever met. I think he genuinely had a purpose, and if so, it’s rough he didn’t get a chance.” Lord Godalming and I said nothing, but Dr. Van Helsing replied: “John, you know more about the insane than I do, thankfully, since if it had been up to me, I might have let him go before his final outburst. But we must learn from experience, and now, as Quincey would say, we cannot risk anything. Things are best left as they are.” Dr. Seward responded dreamily: “Perhaps you’re right. If he were just an ordinary patient, I’d risk trusting him. But he’s so entangled with the Count that I’m afraid of enabling him. I can’t forget how fervently he prayed for a cat, then tried to bite my throat. He calls the Count his master—maybe he wants out to help him in some evil way. The Count already has wolves, rats, and his own kind to help; I suppose a madman is another tool. Still, Renfield did seem sincere. I hope we did the right thing. All of this, on top of everything else we have to do, unsettles me.” The Professor placed a comforting hand on him and said gravely: “John, don’t worry. We are doing our duty in a tragic situation; we can only act as we think is best, and trust in God’s mercy.” Lord Godalming had stepped out briefly, but returned holding up a small silver whistle, saying: “That old place might be crawling with rats, but this will deal with them if needed.” We passed over the wall and approached the house, sticking to the shadows cast by the trees whenever the moon came out. At the porch, the Professor opened his bag, took out several items, and organized them into four sets. He said: “My friends, we’re facing great danger and need many weapons. Our enemy is not simply a spirit. Remember, he has the strength of twenty men, and while we are vulnerable, he’s not harmed by physical strength as we are. Even the strongest people can restrain him at times, but not injure him. We must protect ourselves from his touch. Wear this close to your heart”—he handed me a silver crucifix—“place these dried garlic flowers around your neck—for earthly threats, carry this revolver and this knife; these small electric lamps you can pin to your chest; and above all, this, which must not be misused.” Then he gave me a piece of Sacred Wafer in an envelope. The others received similar equipment. “Now,” he said, “John, do you have the skeleton keys? If we can open the door, we won’t need to break a window as we did at Miss Lucy’s.”"

Presently he got one to suit; after a little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and, with a rusty clang, shot back. We pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and it slowly opened. It was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in Dr. Seward’s diary of the opening of Miss Westenra’s tomb; I fancy that the same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord they shrank back. The Professor was the first to move forward, and stepped into the open door.\n“In manus tuas, Domine!” he said, crossing himself as he passed over the threshold. We closed the door behind us, lest when we should have lit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road. The Professor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open it from within should we be in a hurry making our exit. Then we all lit our lamps and proceeded on our search.",

He soon found a key that worked, and after some manipulation, the bolt gave way with a loud, rusty noise. We pushed against the door; its ancient hinges groaned as it grudgingly swung open. This moment was strikingly similar to Dr. Seward's description in his diary of opening Miss Westenra's grave, and I suspect the others felt it too, as we all instinctively recoiled together. The Professor, however, was the first to step forward, entering through the now-open doorway. He uttered, \"Into your hands, O Lord!\" and made the sign of the cross as he stepped across the threshold.

Soon, he found a key that worked; after some fiddling, the bolt gave way with a rusty clatter. We pushed the door, and its old hinges squeaked as it opened slowly. The scene reminded me vividly of Dr. Seward’s account of opening Miss Westenra’s tomb; I think the others thought the same, because we all instinctively pulled back. The Professor was the first to step forward through the doorway, making the sign of the cross and saying, “In manus tuas, Domine!” As we entered, we closed the door behind us so that, once we lit our lamps, no one passing on the road would see any light. The Professor then carefully tested the lock from the inside to make sure we could get out quickly if needed. After that, we all lit our lamps and began to search."

          "text_segment": "The light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the rays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw great shadows. I could not for my life get away from the feeling that there was some one else amongst us. I suppose it was the recollection, so powerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings, of that terrible experience in Transylvania. I think the feeling was common to us all, for I noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every sound and every new shadow, just as I felt myself doing.\nThe whole place was thick with dust. The floor was seemingly inches deep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding down my lamp I could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked. The walls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were masses of spider’s webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old tattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down. On a table in the hall was a great bunch of keys, with a time-yellowed label on each. They had been used several times, for on the table were several similar rents in the blanket of dust, similar to that exposed when the Professor lifted them. He turned to me and said:—\n“You know this place, Jonathan. You have copied maps of it, and you know it at least more than we do. Which is the way to the chapel?” I had an idea of its direction, though on my former visit I had not been able to get admission to it; so I led the way, and after a few wrong turnings found myself opposite a low, arched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands. “This is the spot,” said the Professor as he turned his lamp on a small map of the house, copied from the file of my original correspondence regarding the purchase. With a little trouble we found the key on the bunch and opened the door. We were prepared for some unpleasantness, for as we were opening the door a faint, malodorous air seemed to exhale through the gaps, but none of us ever expected such an odour as we encountered. None of the others had met the Count at all at close quarters, and when I had seen him he was either in the fasting stage of his existence in his rooms or, when he was gloated with fresh blood, in a ruined building open to the air; but here the place was small and close, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul. There was an earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came through the fouler air. But as to the odour itself, how shall I describe it? It was not alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the pungent, acrid smell of blood, but it seemed as though corruption had become itself corrupt. Faugh! it sickens me to think of it. Every breath exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and intensified its loathsomeness.\nUnder ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our enterprise to an end; but this was no ordinary case, and the high and terrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which rose above merely physical considerations. After the involuntary shrinking consequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about our work as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses.\nWe made an accurate examination of the place, the Professor saying as we began:—\n“The first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left; we must then examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some clue as to what has become of the rest.” A glance was sufficient to show how many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and there was no mistaking them.\nThere were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty! Once I got a fright, for, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted door into the dark passage beyond, I looked too, and for an instant my heart stood still. Somewhere, looking out from the shadow, I seemed to see the high lights of the Count’s evil face, the ridge of the nose, the red eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor. It was only for a moment, for, as Lord Godalming said, “I thought I saw a face, but it was only the shadows,” and resumed his inquiry, I turned my lamp in the direction, and stepped into the passage. There was no sign of any one; and as there were no corners, no doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solid walls of the passage, there could be no hiding-place even for him. I took it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The beams from the small lamps created peculiar shapes where they overlapped or were blocked by our bodies, casting large shadows. I couldn't shake the sensation that another person was present with us. I believe this was due to the vivid memory of my dreadful experience in Transylvania, intensified by the gloomy surroundings. It seemed everyone felt it, as I observed the others constantly glancing over their shoulders at every noise or new shadow, just as I found myself doing.\n\nThe entire area was covered in a thick layer of dust. The floor was apparently inches deep, except for recent footprints where I could see the imprints of hobnails cracking the dust when I held my lamp low. The walls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and masses of spiderwebs in the corners had accumulated so much dust that they resembled old, torn fabric, partially pulled down by the weight. On a table in the hall lay a large cluster of keys, each bearing a time-yellowed label. They had clearly been used recently, as there were several similar marks in the dust layer on the table, matching the area exposed when the Professor picked them up. He then turned to me and said, 'You know this place, Jonathan. You've drawn maps of it, so you know it better than we do, at least. Which is the path to the chapel?' I had a general idea of its location, although I hadn't been able to access it during my previous visit. So, I led the way, and after a few wrong turns, I found myself in front of a low, arched oak door reinforced with iron bands. 'This is the spot,' the Professor stated, shining his lamp on a small map of the house, which was copied from the file of my original letters about the purchase. With a bit of searching, we found the correct key on the bunch and opened the door. We were braced for some unpleasantness, as a faint, foul-smelling air seemed to seep out through the gaps as we opened the door, but none of us anticipated the intensity of the odor we encountered. The others had never been near the Count before, and when I had seen him, he was either in a state of fasting in his rooms or, when full of fresh blood, in a ruined, airy building. But here, the space was small and confined, and the long period of disuse had made the air stagnant and putrid. There was an earthy smell, like a dry, noxious vapor, cutting through the already foul air. But how can I possibly describe the odor itself? It wasn't just a combination of the decay of life and the sharp, biting smell of blood; it was as if corruption itself had become rotten. Ugh! It makes me sick just thinking about it. It felt like every breath exhaled by that monster had clung to the place and intensified its repulsive nature.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, such a powerful stench would have ended our mission. However, this was no ordinary situation, and the significant and dreadful purpose we were engaged in provided us with a strength that transcended mere physical discomfort. After the automatic recoil triggered by the initial nauseating wave of smell, we all immediately began our work as if that repulsive place were a beautiful garden.\n\nWe thoroughly examined the area. As we started, the Professor remarked, 'The first task is to determine how many of the boxes remain; then we must search every nook, corner, and cranny to see if we can find any clues about what happened to the rest.' A single look was enough to count those left, as the large earth chests were substantial and easily identifiable.\n\nThere were only twenty-nine left out of the original fifty! At one point, I was startled when I saw Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out from the arched doorway into the dark passage beyond. I looked too, and for a second, my heart stopped. Somewhere in the shadow, I thought I saw the prominent features of the Count's sinister face: the bridge of his nose, the red eyes, the red lips, the dreadful paleness. It was only for a moment, because as Lord Godalming said, 'I thought I saw a face, but it was just the shadows,' and went back to his search, I shone my lamp in that direction and stepped into the passage. There was no one there, and since there were no corners, doors, or openings of any kind, just the solid walls of the passage, there was nowhere for him to hide, even for him. I concluded that fear had fueled my imagination and said nothing.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The small lamps cast strange and varied patterns of light and shadow as their beams intertwined or our bodies blocked them. I couldn’t shake the uneasy sense that someone else was with us, likely triggered by the grim surroundings and the memory of my ordeal in Transylvania. It seemed everyone felt the same, as I kept noticing the others nervously glancing around at every sound or shadow, just as I did.\n\nDust blanketed everything. The floor was covered in inches of it, except where recent footprints had disturbed it, marked with hobnail impressions. Dust clung thickly to the walls, while spider webs in the corners were so laden with it that they hung like ragged strips, weighed down until they tore. There was a large set of keys on a hall table, each with an old, yellowed tag. The keys had been moved before, as the dusty surface bore several similar marks to those made when the Professor picked them up. Turning to me, he said:\n\n\"You know this house, Jonathan. You've drawn its maps and are more familiar with it than we are. Where’s the chapel?\" I thought I knew the way, though before I hadn’t gotten inside it. I led us forward, getting turned around once or twice, until we reached a low, sturdy wooden door banded with iron. “This is it,” the Professor said, consulting a small map copied from my original documents about the property. We searched the keyring, found the right one, and unlocked the door. We expected something unpleasant, as a faint foul smell wafted from within while we opened it, but the stench that greeted us far surpassed our fears. None besides me had ever faced the Count up close; and when I had, it was either while he starved in his rooms or outside after feeding, so the air was not so thick. Here, the confined, disused chamber made the air stagnant and fetid. There was a dry, earthy reek under the oppressive odor, and the smell itself defied description—not just a mix of mortal decay and sharp blood, but as if rot itself had worsened. Just thinking of it sours my stomach. It seemed as though the Count's every foul breath had seeped into the room, compounding its horror.\n\nNormally, such a smell would have halted us, but this was no ordinary situation—we were driven by a desperate and urgent mission, which allowed us to overcome our physical revulsion. After recoiling from that first sickening breath, we all set to work as if the place smelled of roses.\n\nWe carefully inspected everything. The Professor announced, \"First, we must count how many boxes remain, then search every nook and cranny for clues about the missing ones.\" It was obvious how many were left—the big, earthen boxes were unmistakable. Only twenty-nine remained out of fifty. Suddenly, I was startled; Lord Godalming quickly turned to peer out the arched doorway into the darkness, and I did the same. For a moment, I thought I glimpsed the cruel features of the Count’s face—the nose, red eyes and lips, his ghastly pallor. But it was fleeting; Lord Godalming admitted, “I thought I saw a face, but it was just shadows,” and kept searching. I shone my lamp and stepped into the hall, but there was nothing there—just solid walls, no places to hide. I decided my fear had fueled my imagination and said nothing."

We all followed his movements with our eyes, for undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw a whole mass of phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars. We all instinctively drew back. The whole place was becoming alive with rats.\nFor a moment or two we stood appalled, all save Lord Godalming, who was seemingly prepared for such an emergency. Rushing over to the great iron-bound oaken door, which Dr. Seward had described from the outside, and which I had seen myself, he turned the key in the lock, drew the huge bolts, and swung the door open. Then, taking his little silver whistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call. It was answered from behind Dr. Seward’s house by the yelping of dogs, and after about a minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house. Unconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as we moved I noticed that the dust had been much disturbed: the boxes which had been taken out had been brought this way. But even in the minute that had elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased. They seemed to swarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on their moving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look like a bank of earth set with fireflies. The dogs dashed on, but at the threshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting their noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion. The rats were multiplying in thousands, and we moved out.\nLord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed him on the floor. The instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to recover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies. They fled before him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score, the other dogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small prey ere the whole mass had vanished.\nWith their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at their prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in the air with vicious shakes. We all seemed to find our spirits rise. Whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves in the open I know not; but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to slip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our coming lost something of its grim significance, though we did not slacken a whit in our resolution. We closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house. We found nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and all untouched save for my own footsteps when I had made my first visit. Never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even when we returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been rabbit-hunting in a summer wood.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Moments later, we observed Morris recoil sharply from a corner he had been examining. Our eyes tracked him, as a growing unease had settled over us. We saw a large patch of sparkling phosphorescence, like tiny stars. We instinctively retreated. The area was suddenly teeming with rats. For a brief time, we were stunned, everyone except Lord Godalming, who seemed prepared for this situation. He quickly went to the large, iron-bound oak door that Dr. Seward had described and I had seen previously. He unlocked it, pulled back the heavy bolts, and swung it open. Then, taking a small silver whistle from his pocket, he blew a low, sharp note. This was answered by the sound of barking dogs from behind Dr. Seward’s house, and about a minute later, three terriers bounded around the corner. Without realizing it, we had all moved closer to the door. As we did, I noticed the dust was heavily disturbed; the boxes that had been removed must have been carried this way. But even in that short minute, the number of rats had dramatically increased. They seemed to appear everywhere at once, so that the lamplight reflecting off their moving, dark bodies and gleaming, menacing eyes made the area look like a bank of earth covered in fireflies. The dogs charged forward but stopped abruptly at the doorway, snarling. Then, simultaneously raising their muzzles, they began to howl mournfully. The rats were multiplying by the thousands, so we withdrew. Lord Godalming lifted one of the dogs and carried it inside, placing it on the floor. The moment its paws touched the ground, it seemed to regain its bravery and attacked its natural enemies. The rats fled so rapidly that before this dog had dispatched twenty or so, the other dogs, who had also been carried in, had little prey left before the entire mass vanished. With their departure, it felt as though some malevolent presence had left. The dogs immediately became playful, barking cheerfully as they pounced on the dead rats, flipping them over and aggressively shaking them in the air. All of us felt our spirits lift. I’m unsure if this relief came from the chapel’s oppressive atmosphere being cleared by opening the door, or simply the comfort of being outside, but the oppressive feeling of dread certainly seemed to fall away from us like a cloak. The serious nature of our visit seemed less daunting, although our determination remained unchanged. We shut the outer door, secured it with bolts and the lock, and taking the dogs with us, began our search of the house. We found nothing inside but an immense amount of dust, completely undisturbed except for the footprints I had made during my first visit. Not once did the dogs show any sign of discomfort, and even when we returned to the chapel area, they were as lively as if they had been hunting rabbits in a summer woods.",

We all followed his movements nervously, our anxiety mounting. There, we saw a large area covered with glowing spots, flickering like stars: a swarm of rats was filling the place. Instinctively, we all recoiled. It felt as if the room was teeming with the creatures.\n\nFor a moment, we were all stunned—except for Lord Godalming, who was ready for such an event. He rushed to the heavy, iron-reinforced oak door—described earlier by Dr. Seward—and unlocked and unbolted it. Then, producing a small silver whistle, he blew a piercing sound. This call was answered by barking from the rear of Dr. Seward’s house, and within a minute, three terriers sprinted around the corner. All of us had edged toward the door, and as we moved, I noticed that the dust was noticeably disturbed—the boxes that had been removed had clearly come through that way. In a matter of moments, the number of rats had multiplied enormously. They spread through the room so thickly that, under the lamp’s light, the mass looked almost like a bank of earth alive with fireflies. The dogs charged, but stopped short at the threshold, snarling; soon they lifted their heads and began to howl mournfully. The rats kept multiplying, so we left the room.\n\nLord Godalming picked up one of the dogs, set it on the floor inside, and it immediately regained courage, attacking the rats. The vermin ran, and before that dog had killed twenty, the other two dogs—who had been brought in the same way—had only a few rats left to catch, since the main horde had already disappeared. \n\nAs the rats left, it felt as though an evil force departed with them—the dogs became playful again, barking and leaping at their vanquished prey, tossing them with energetic shakes. Our spirits, too, lifted; whether it was the clearing of the foul air by the open door or the relief of being outside, I could not say, but the dread that had weighed on us seemed to vanish, taking some of the seriousness of our mission with it—though our resolve was unchanged. We securely closed and locked the outer door, brought the dogs with us, and began to search the house. We found nothing except an immense amount of dust, undisturbed save for my own previous footprints. At no time did the dogs show any more fear, and even when we returned to the chapel, they played as if on a carefree summer hunt."

No harm has come to us such as I feared might be and yet we have ascertained how many boxes are missing. More than all do I rejoice that this, our first—and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous—step has been accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina or troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and smells of horror which she might never forget. One lesson, too, we have learned, if it be allowable to argue a particulari: that the brute beasts which are to the Count’s command are yet themselves not amenable to his spiritual power; for look, these rats that would come to his call, just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going and to that poor mother’s cry, though they come to him, they run pell-mell from the so little dogs of my friend Arthur. We have other matters before us, other dangers, other fears; and that monster—he has not used his power over the brute world for the only or the last time to-night. So be it that he has gone elsewhere. Good! It has given us opportunity to cry ‘check’ in some ways in this chess game, which we play for the stake of human souls. And now let us go home.

It may be ordained that we have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril; but we must go on, and from no danger shall we shrink.”\nThe house was silent when we got back, save for some poor creature who was screaming away in one of the distant wards, and a low, moaning sound from Renfield’s room. The poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself, after the manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain.\nI came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep, breathing so softly that I had to put my ear down to hear it. She looks paler than usual. I hope the meeting to-night has not upset her. I am truly thankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even of our deliberations. It is too great a strain for a woman to bear. I did not think so at first, but I know better now. Therefore I am glad that it is settled. There may be things which would frighten her to hear; and yet to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once she suspected that there was any concealment. Henceforth our work is to be a sealed book to her, till at least such time as we can tell her that all is finished, and the earth free from a monster of the nether world. I daresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after such confidence as ours; but I must be resolute, and to-morrow I shall keep dark over to-night’s doings, and shall refuse to speak of anything that has happened. I rest on the sofa, so as not to disturb her.",

Dr. Van Helsing took the key for the main door from the bunch, locked it properly, and put the key in his pocket. He stated, \"Our night has been exceptionally productive thus far. We avoided the harm I feared, and we've confirmed the number of missing boxes. What brings me the most joy is that this initial step - which is perhaps our most challenging and hazardous - was completed without involving our beloved Mina or disturbing her waking or sleeping thoughts with terrifying sights, sounds, or smells that could haunt her forever.\" He continued, \"We also learned a significant lesson, assuming we can draw a general conclusion from a specific instance: the animals under the Count's command are not entirely subject to his supernatural power. For example, the rats he calls, just as he summoned wolves from his castle tower for your departure and in response to that poor mother's cries, fled in disarray from my friend Arthur's small dogs, even though they would normally come to him.\" Van Helsing added, \"We face other issues, other dangers, and other fears ahead; and that creature hasn't finished using his control over the animal world just tonight. So, if he has indeed gone elsewhere, that is good! It has allowed us a tactical advantage, like calling 'check' in this high-stakes chess game where human souls are on the line. Now, let's go home. Dawn is near, and we have reason to be pleased with our first night's work. It may be that we have many more nights and days ahead, full of peril, but we must press on, and we will not shy away from any danger.” When we returned, the house was silent, except for a distressed person screaming in a distant ward and a quiet groaning sound coming from Renfield's room. The poor man was likely torturing himself with needless, painful thoughts, as people with mental illness sometimes do. I quietly entered our room on tiptoe and found Mina asleep, breathing so gently I had to lean down to hear her. She seems paler than usual. I hope tonight's activities haven't upset her. I am genuinely relieved that she will be kept out of our future endeavors and even our discussions. It's too much of a burden for a woman to bear. I didn't believe this at first, but I understand it better now. Therefore, I am glad this decision is finalized. There might be things that would terrify her to hear, yet concealing them could be worse than telling her, especially if she suspected we were hiding something. From this point forward, our work will be a secret from her, at least until we can tell her that everything is finished and the world is free from the monstrous creature. I imagine it will be difficult to start keeping secrets after our level of trust, but I must be determined. Tomorrow, I will remain silent about tonight's events and refuse to discuss anything that occurred. I will rest on the sofa to avoid disturbing her sleep.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As dawn began to brighten the sky in the east, we made our way out from the house. Dr. Van Helsing, after taking the key from the ring, carefully locked the front door and put the key safely in his pocket. Van Helsing commented that the night had gone remarkably well—all of us were unharmed, which had been a concern, and we now knew exactly how many boxes were missing. Most of all, he was relieved that our first and possibly most dangerous act had been completed without involving the dear Madam Mina. She remained undisturbed, spared from the distressing sights, sounds, and smells which could have haunted her forever. We also learned, he said, that although the Count could summon animals—like the rats and previously the wolves—they were still frightened off by smaller dogs, indicating his control over them was limited. Though the Count did not use his power to the fullest this night, which worked in our favor and let us make some progress in this serious struggle, Van Helsing reminded us there were more challenges ahead and that the Count would likely attempt to use his abilities again. He encouraged us to return home, satisfied with the night's results, but ready to face more risks if necessary. When we got back to the house it was mostly quiet—just a distant scream from a patient and some low sounds from Renfield's room, where he was likely tormented by his own thoughts. I entered our room quietly and found Mina asleep, breathing so softly I had to lean in to hear her. She appeared more pale than usual, and I worried that the events of the night might have unsettled her. I was very grateful that she would not have to be part of our future work; the burden would be too great for her, and I now realized that. From now on, our activities would be kept secret from her until it was all resolved and the threat was gone. This new secrecy would be difficult after sharing so much with her, but I must stay firm and keep silent about what happened tonight. To avoid disturbing her, I settled to rest on the sofa."

          "text_segment": "1 October.—It was towards noon when I was awakened by the Professor walking into my room. He was more jolly and cheerful than usual, and it is quite evident that last night’s work has helped to take some of the brooding weight off his mind. After going over the adventure of the night he suddenly said:—\n“Your patient interests me much. May it be that with you I visit him this morning? Or if that you are too occupy, I can go alone if it may be. It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy, and reason so sound.” I had some work to do which pressed, so I told him that if he would go alone I would be glad, as then I should not have to keep him waiting; so I called an attendant and gave him the necessary instructions. Before the Professor left the room I cautioned him against getting any false impression from my patient. “But,” he answered, “I want him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live things. He said to Madam Mina, as I see in your diary of yesterday, that he had once had such a belief. Why do you smile, friend John?”\n“Excuse me,” I said, “but the answer is here.” I laid my hand on the type-written matter. “When our sane and learned lunatic made that very statement of how he used to consume life, his mouth was actually nauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before Mrs. Harker entered the room.” Van Helsing smiled in turn. “Good!” he said. “Your memory is true, friend John. I should have remembered. And yet it is this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease such a fascinating study. Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out of the folly of this madman than I shall from the teaching of the most wise. Who knows?” I went on with my work, and before long was through that in hand. It seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was Van Helsing back in the study. “Do I interrupt?” he asked politely as he stood at the door.\n“Not at all,” I answered. “Come in. My work is finished, and I am free. I can go with you now, if you like.\n“It is needless; I have seen him!”\n“Well?”\n“I fear that he does not appraise me at much. Our interview was short. When I entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre, with his elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of sullen discontent. I spoke to him as cheerfully as I could, and with such a measure of respect as I could assume. He made no reply whatever. “Don’t you know me?” I asked. His answer was not reassuring: “I know you well enough; you are the old fool Van Helsing. I wish you would take yourself and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else. Damn all thick-headed Dutchmen!” Not a word more would he say, but sat in his implacable sullenness as indifferent to me as though I had not been in the room at all. Thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this so clever lunatic; so I shall go, if I may, and cheer myself with a few happy words with that sweet soul Madam Mina. Friend John, it does rejoice me unspeakable that she is no more to be pained, no more to be worried with our terrible things. Though we shall much miss her help, it is better so.”\n“I agree with you with all my heart,” I answered earnestly, for I did not want him to weaken in this matter. “Mrs. Harker is better out of it. Things are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and who have been in many tight places in our time; but it is no place for a woman, and if she had remained in touch with the affair, it would in time infallibly have wrecked her.”\nSo Van Helsing has gone to confer with Mrs. Harker and Harker; Quincey and Art are all out following up the clues as to the earth-boxes. I shall finish my round of work and we shall meet to-night.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "On October 1st, I awoke around noon to Professor Van Helsing entering my room. He seemed unusually happy and upbeat, clearly relieved by the events of the previous night. After discussing the adventure, he abruptly stated, “Your patient, Renfield, greatly intrigues me. Could I possibly visit him with you this morning? If you are too busy, I can go alone. It’s a novel experience for me to encounter a seemingly insane person who speaks philosophically and reasons so clearly.” As I had pressing work, I told him I would be grateful if he went by himself, so I wouldn't hold him up. I instructed an attendant accordingly. Before he left, I cautioned him not to form a mistaken opinion of my patient. He replied, “But I want him to discuss himself and his obsession with consuming living creatures. According to your diary from yesterday, he told Mrs. Mina Harker he once held this belief. Why the smile, my friend John?” I responded, “Excuse me, but the answer lies here,” placing my hand on the typed notes. “When our learned yet deranged patient made that claim about how he used to eat living things, his mouth was actually disgusting with the flies and spiders he had just consumed before Mrs. Harker entered.” Van Helsing smiled back, saying, “Excellent! Your memory serves you well, friend John. I should have recalled that. And yet, it is precisely this oddity of thought and memory that makes studying mental illness so captivating. Perhaps I will gain more insight from this madman’s irrationality than from the most profound scholars. Who can say?” I returned to my work and finished sooner than expected. It felt like a very brief time, but Van Helsing was already back in my study. “Am I interrupting?” he asked politely from the doorway. “Not at all,” I replied. “Come in. My work is done, and I am free. I can accompany you now if you wish.” “That’s unnecessary; I’ve already seen him!” “And?” “I fear he didn't think much of me. Our visit was short. When I entered his room, he was seated on a stool in the center, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees, looking utterly sullen and displeased. I spoke to him as cheerfully and respectfully as I could. He didn't reply at all. “Don’t you recognize me?” I asked. His answer was not encouraging: “I know you perfectly well; you’re that old fool Van Helsing. I wish you and your idiotic brain theories would go away. Damn all thick-headed Dutchmen!” He wouldn't say another word, remaining stubbornly sullen and acting as if I wasn't even there. Thus, my chance to learn much from this remarkably clever lunatic was missed for now. So, if you'll excuse me, I will go and lift my spirits with a pleasant conversation with that lovely woman, Mrs. Mina. Friend John, it brings me immeasurable joy that she will no longer suffer or be burdened by our terrible affairs. Although we will miss her assistance greatly, it is for the best.” I wholeheartedly agreed, answering sincerely, as I wanted him to stand firm on this point. “Mrs. Harker is better off out of it. Things are quite bad enough for us, men of the world who have faced many difficulties; it is no situation for a woman, and if she had remained involved, it would have inevitably ruined her over time.” So, Van Helsing has gone to speak with Mrs. Harker and Mr. Harker. Quincey and Art are both out pursuing leads regarding the earth-boxes. I will complete my remaining tasks, and we will gather tonight.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "October 1.—Around noon, the Professor entered my room and woke me. He seemed happier and livelier than usual, clearly relieved after our success the previous night. As we went over what had happened, he commented: “Your patient fascinates me. Would you mind if I visit him this morning with you? Or, if you’re busy, I can go alone. I’ve never seen a madman who reasons and talks philosophy so well.”\n\nSince I had urgent work to finish, I told him I’d appreciate it if he went on his own, so I arranged for an attendant to assist him. Before he left, I warned him not to take my patient’s words at face value. The Professor replied, “But I want him to talk about himself, especially his belief in eating live creatures. He told Mina yesterday, as your diary notes, that he used to have such beliefs. Why are you smiling, John?”\n\nI explained, indicating the typed notes, “When our apparently rational madman claimed he no longer did such things, his mouth was still full of the flies and spiders he’d just eaten before Mrs. Harker entered.” Van Helsing grinned. “Good! You remember well, John. I should have recalled that. Yet, this very oddity in thought and memory is what makes mental illness so intriguing. Maybe I’ll learn more from this madman’s folly than from the wisest teacher.”\n\nI resumed my tasks and soon finished. Time passed quickly, and before I realized, Van Helsing was back at the study door. He asked politely if he was interrupting. “Not at all,” I replied. “I’m finished now and free to go with you if you wish.”\n\nHe replied, “No need; I have already seen him!”\n\n“And?”\n\n“I’m afraid he doesn’t think much of me. The meeting was brief. He sat in the center of the room, looking deeply unhappy. I greeted him as cheerfully and respectfully as possible, but he didn’t reply. When I asked, ‘Don’t you know me?’ he retorted, ‘Of course. You’re that old fool Van Helsing. I wish you and your idiotic ideas would leave. Damn all stubborn Dutchmen!’ He said nothing more, sitting in grim silence and ignoring me as if I weren’t there. So, I don’t expect to learn much from this clever lunatic for now. I’ll go cheer myself with some pleasant conversation with dear Madam Mina. John, it makes me unspeakably happy that she no longer has to suffer from our dreadful affairs. Though we’ll miss her help, it’s better this way.”\n\n“I completely agree,” I replied sincerely, not wanting him to change his mind. “Mrs. Harker is better out of these matters. Things are bad enough for us experienced men, but they’re no place for a woman. If she stayed involved, it would certainly have destroyed her over time.”\n\nVan Helsing has gone to consult with Mrs. Harker and Harker, while Quincey and Arthur are following up on leads about the earth boxes. I’ll complete my rounds, and we’ll all meet tonight."

This morning I slept late after the fatigues of yesterday, and though Jonathan was late too, he was the earlier. He spoke to me before he went out, never more sweetly or tenderly, but he never mentioned a word of what had happened in the visit to the Count’s house. And yet he must have known how terribly anxious I was. Poor dear fellow! I suppose it must have distressed him even more than it did me. They all agreed that it was best that I should not be drawn further into this awful work, and I acquiesced. But to think that he keeps anything from me!

She hadn’t taken to visiting the churchyard till I came, and if she hadn’t come there in the day-time with me she wouldn’t have walked there in her sleep; and if she hadn’t gone there at night and asleep, that monster couldn’t have destroyed her as he did. Oh, why did I ever go to Whitby? There now, crying again! I wonder what has come over me to-day. I must hide it from Jonathan, for if he knew that I had been crying twice in one morning—I, who never cried on my own account, and whom he has never caused to shed a tear—the dear fellow would fret his heart out.

She didn’t visit the churchyard until I started going, and if she hadn’t come with me in daylight, she wouldn’t have gone there in her sleep; if she hadn’t done that, she wouldn’t have been attacked by that monster. Why did I ever go to Whitby? Now I’m crying again! I don’t know what’s wrong with me today. I must not let Jonathan see how upset I am; if he knew I’d already cried twice this morning—me, who never cries for myself, and who he’s never made cry—he’d worry himself sick. I must stay strong and hide my tears; perhaps this is something women just have to learn."

          "text_segment": "I can’t quite remember how I fell asleep last night. I remember hearing the sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds, like praying on a very tumultuous scale, from Mr. Renfield’s room, which is somewhere under this. And then there was silence over everything, silence so profound that it startled me, and I got up and looked out of the window. All was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moonlight seeming full of a silent mystery of their own. Not a thing seemed to be stirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate; so that a thin streak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slowness across the grass towards the house, seemed to have a sentience and a vitality of its own. I think that the digression of my thoughts must have done me good, for when I got back to bed I found a lethargy creeping over me. I lay a while, but could not quite sleep, so I got out and looked out of the window again. The mist was spreading, and was now close up to the house, so that I could see it lying thick against the wall, as though it were stealing up to the windows. The poor man was more loud than ever, and though I could not distinguish a word he said, I could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty on his part. Then there was the sound of a struggle, and I knew that the attendants were dealing with him. I was so frightened that I crept into bed, and pulled the clothes over my head, putting my fingers in my ears. I was not then a bit sleepy, at least so I thought; but I must have fallen asleep, for, except dreams, I do not remember anything until the morning, when Jonathan woke me. I think that it took me an effort and a little time to realise where I was, and that it was Jonathan who was bending over me. My dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical of the way that waking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams.\nI thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back. I was very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act; my feet, and my hands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at the usual pace. And so I slept uneasily and thought. Then it began to dawn upon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. I put back the clothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dim around. The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but turned down, came only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently grown thicker and poured into the room. Then it occurred to me that I had shut the window before I had come to bed. I would have got out to make certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my limbs and even my will. I lay still and endured; that was all. I closed my eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (It is wonderful what tricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently we can imagine.) The mist grew thicker and thicker and I could see now how it came in, for I could see it like smoke—or with the white energy of boiling water—pouring in, not through the window, but through the joinings of the door. It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the top of which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye. Things began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now whirling in the room, and through it all came the scriptural words “a pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night.” Was it indeed some such spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep? But the pillar was composed of both the day and the night-guiding, for the fire was in the red eye, which at the thought got a new fascination for me; till, as I looked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on me through the fog like two red eyes, such as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering when, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St. Mary’s Church. Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that Jonathan had seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist in the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for all became black darkness. The last conscious effort which imagination made was to show me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist. I must be careful of such dreams, for they would unseat one’s reason if there were too much of them. I would get Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribe something for me which would make me sleep, only that I fear to alarm them. Such a dream at the present time would become woven into their fears for me. To-night I shall strive hard to sleep naturally. If I do not, I shall to-morrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral; that cannot hurt me for once, and it will give me a good night’s sleep. Last night tired me more than if I had not slept at all.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I have trouble recalling exactly when I fell asleep last night. I remember hearing dogs barking suddenly and a lot of odd noises, like very intense praying, coming from Mr. Renfield’s room, which is located below mine. Then, an absolute stillness fell over everything, a silence so deep it startled me. I got up and looked out the window. It was completely dark and quiet. The deep shadows cast by the moonlight seemed to hold their own silent mystery. Nothing appeared to be moving; everything seemed as grim and motionless as death or fate. Consequently, a thin line of white mist, which advanced across the grass towards the house with almost imperceptible slowness, seemed strangely alive and purposeful. I believe this shift in my thoughts must have helped me, because when I returned to bed, I felt a drowsiness taking hold. I lay there for a while but couldn't quite fall asleep, so I got up again and looked out the window. The mist was expanding and was now right up against the house, thick against the wall, as if it were secretly approaching the windows. The poor man, Renfield, was making more noise than ever. Although I couldn't make out any specific words, I could somehow sense a passionate plea in his tone. Then I heard sounds of a struggle, and I knew the attendants were dealing with him. I was so scared that I crawled back into bed, pulled the covers over my head, and covered my ears with my fingers. I didn't feel sleepy at all then, or so I thought, but I must have drifted off. Except for dreams, I don't remember anything until the morning when Jonathan woke me. I think it took me a moment and some effort to realize where I was and that it was Jonathan leaning over me. My dream was very strange and seemed typical of how waking thoughts can merge with or continue into dreams.\n\nIn the dream, I thought I was sleeping and waiting for Jonathan to come back. I was very worried about him and felt unable to do anything; my feet, hands, and mind felt heavy, making it impossible to move or think at the normal pace. So, I slept restlessly and thought. Then it began to occur to me that the air felt heavy, damp, and cold. I pulled the covers away from my face and was surprised to find everything around me dim. The gaslight I had left on low for Jonathan appeared only as a tiny red spark through the fog, which had clearly thickened and entered the room. Then I remembered that I had closed the window before getting into bed. I would have gotten up to check, but a heavy sluggishness seemed to tie down my limbs and even my will. I just lay there and endured it; that was all I could do. I closed my eyes, but I could still see through my eyelids. (It's astonishing the tricks our dreams play on us and how easily we can imagine things.) The mist grew thicker and thicker, and now I could see how it was entering, looking like smoke—or the white energy of boiling water—pouring in, not through the window, but through the gaps around the door. It got denser and denser until it seemed to concentrate into a sort of column of cloud in the room. Through the top of this column, I could see the gaslight shining like a red eye. Thoughts started spinning in my brain just as the cloudy column was spinning in the room. Through it all came the biblical phrase, \"a pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night.\" Was this truly some kind of spiritual guidance reaching me in my sleep? But the pillar was made of both day and night guidance, as the fire was in the red eye, which became newly fascinating to me at that thought. As I watched, the fire split and seemed to shine on me through the fog like two red eyes, similar to what Lucy described in her brief moment of disorientation on the cliff when the setting sun hit the windows of St. Mary’s Church. Suddenly, the horrifying realization struck me that this was how Jonathan had seen those terrible women solidify from the swirling mist in the moonlight. In my dream, I must have fainted, because everything went black. The last conscious image my imagination created was a pale, ghostly white face bending over me out of the mist. I must be careful with such dreams; they could unhinge one's sanity if they happened too often. I would ask Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribe something to help me sleep, but I'm afraid of alarming them. Such a dream right now would only feed into their worries about me. Tonight, I will try hard to fall asleep naturally. If I can't, tomorrow night I will ask them for a dose of chloral; it won't harm me just once, and it will guarantee a good night's sleep. Last night left me more exhausted than if I hadn't slept at all.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I can't quite recall how I drifted off to sleep last night. I do remember the dogs suddenly barking and hearing strange noises, like someone frantically praying, coming from Mr. Renfield's room below. After that, everything became so eerily silent that it startled me. I got up to look out of the window and saw only darkness. The moon cast deep shadows outside, filling the scene with a mysterious quietness. Nothing seemed to move; everything looked deathly still, except for a thin white mist that crept slowly over the grass towards the house, almost as if it was alive. These distractions seemed to calm me, and when I returned to bed, I began to feel very sluggish. I lay awake for a while but couldn’t fall asleep, so I got up and looked outside again. The mist had spread, now hugging the house, almost like it was climbing up to the windows. Renfield was louder than before; I couldn’t make out his words, but his voice sounded desperate. Then I heard some commotion and assumed the staff were restraining him. Feeling frightened, I hid under my covers and plugged my ears. I thought I wasn't sleepy, but I must have dozed off, because after some dreams, I remember nothing until Jonathan woke me in the morning. It took me a little while to realize where I was and that it was Jonathan by my side. My dream was odd, as if my waking concerns flowed directly into it.\n\nIn my dream, I thought I was sleeping and waiting for Jonathan. I was deeply worried about him, but felt helpless, my mind and body heavy and sluggish. I drifted uneasily between thinking and sleeping. Then, it seemed as if the air had become thick, damp and cold. Pulling the covers off my face, I was surprised to see the room was hazy. The gaslight I’d left burning low glowed only as a tiny red spot through the growing fog. I remembered I’d closed the window before bed, but some oppressive weight kept me from getting up to check. I stayed put, enduring the sensation. Even with my eyes closed, I could ‘see’ the mist thickening, pouring into the room not through the window, but around the door, like smoke or boiling steam. It built up, finally forming a pillar of fog in the room, topped with the red glint of the gaslight. My thoughts swirled as did the fog, and I recalled the biblical words, “a pillar of cloud by day, and of fire by night.” I wondered if this was some spiritual sign. The pillar combined both cloud and fire, and as I watched, the eye-like red glow seemed to split into two, shining at me through the mist like Lucy had once described seeing when the sunset hit St. Mary’s Church windows. I was suddenly terrified, recognizing this as the vision Jonathan had of those dreadful women materializing from mist by moonlight. In the dream, I must have fainted, for I sank into darkness. The last thing my imagination conjured was a pale white face leaning out of the mist towards me. I worry that dreams like this could unsettle my mind if they happen too often. Perhaps I should ask Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward for something to help me sleep, though I hesitate to alarm them further. Such dreams might worsen their fears for me. Tonight, I will try hard to sleep naturally. If not, tomorrow I’ll ask for some chloral to help me get a good night’s rest. Last night left me more exhausted than if I hadn’t slept at all."

          "text_segment": "1 October, evening.—I found Thomas Snelling in his house at Bethnal Green, but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything. The very prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him had proved too much, and he had begun too early on his expected debauch. I learned, however, from his wife, who seemed a decent, poor soul, that he was only the assistant to Smollet, who of the two mates was the responsible person. So off I drove to Walworth, and found Mr. Joseph Smollet at home and in his shirtsleeves, taking a late tea out of a saucer. He is a decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly a good, reliable type of workman, and with a headpiece of his own. He remembered all about the incident of the boxes, and from a wonderful dog’s-eared notebook, which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about the seat of his trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick, half-obliterated pencil, he gave me the destinations of the boxes. There were, he said, six in the cartload which he took from Carfax and left at 197, Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and another six which he deposited at Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey. If then the Count meant to scatter these ghastly refuges of his over London, these places were chosen as the first of delivery, so that later he might distribute more fully. The systematic manner in which this was done made me think that he could not mean to confine himself to two sides of London. He was now fixed on the far east of the northern shore, on the east of the southern shore, and on the south. The north and west were surely never meant to be left out of his diabolical scheme—let alone the City itself and the very heart of fashionable London in the south-west and west. I went back to Smollet, and asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes had been taken from Carfax.\nHe replied:—\n“Well, guv’nor, you’ve treated me wery ’an’some”—I had given him half a sovereign—“an’ I’ll tell yer all I know. I heard a man by the name of Bloxam say four nights ago in the ’Are an’ ’Ounds, in Pincher’s Alley, as ’ow he an’ his mate ’ad ’ad a rare dusty job in a old ’ouse at Purfect. There ain’t a-many such jobs as this ’ere, an’ I’m thinkin’ that maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye summut.” I asked if he could tell me where to find him. I told him that if he could get me the address it would be worth another half-sovereign to him. So he gulped down the rest of his tea and stood up, saying that he was going to begin the search then and there. At the door he stopped, and said:—\n“Look ’ere, guv’nor, there ain’t no sense in me a-keepin’ you ’ere. I may find Sam soon, or I mayn’t; but anyhow he ain’t like to be in a way to tell ye much to-night. Sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze. If you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it, and put yer address on it, I’ll find out where Sam is to be found and post it ye to-night. But ye’d better be up arter ’im soon in the mornin’, or maybe ye won’t ketch ’im; for Sam gets off main early, never mind the booze the night afore.”\nThis was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny to buy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and to keep the change. When she came back, I addressed the envelope and stamped it, and when Smollet had again faithfully promised to post the address when found, I took my way to home. We’re on the track anyhow. I am tired to-night, and want sleep. Mina is fast asleep, and looks a little too pale; her eyes look as though she had been crying. Poor dear, I’ve no doubt it frets her to be kept in the dark, and it may make her doubly anxious about me and the others. But it is best as it is. It is better to be disappointed and worried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken. The doctors were quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful business. I must be firm, for on me this particular burden of silence must rest. I shall not ever enter on the subject with her under any circumstances. Indeed, it may not be a hard task, after all, for she herself has become reticent on the subject, and has not spoken of the Count or his doings ever since we told her of our decision.",

However, his wife, a seemingly respectable, poor woman, informed me that Snelling was merely an assistant to Smollet, who was the more dependable partner. Consequently, I traveled to Walworth and found Mr. Joseph Smollet at his residence, dressed casually in his shirtsleeves and drinking a late cup of tea from a saucer. He appeared to be a decent, intelligent man, clearly a capable and trustworthy laborer, possessing his own independent thoughts. He clearly remembered the box delivery and, consulting a remarkably worn notebook he retrieved from an obscure pocket in his trousers, which contained nearly illegible notes in thick pencil, he provided me with the boxes' drop-off locations. He stated that the load he transported from Carfax included six boxes delivered to 197 Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and another six left at Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey. If the Count's intention was to distribute his morbid hiding places throughout London, these spots were likely initial delivery points for subsequent redistribution. The systematic nature of this action suggested he didn't plan to confine himself to just two quadrants of the city. His current locations covered the far eastern part of the northern bank (Mile End), the eastern and southern parts of the southern bank (Bermondsey, implied by the area), and the south. It seemed improbable that the north and west areas would be excluded from his malevolent plan, let alone the City itself and the fashionable areas in the southwest and west. I then returned to Smollet and inquired if he knew about any other boxes having been moved from Carfax. He responded gratefully for the half-sovereign I had given him, assuring me he'd share everything he knew. He mentioned overhearing a man named Bloxam at the 'Hare and Hounds' pub in Pincher's Alley four nights prior. Bloxam had described a 'dusty job' involving an old house in Purfleet, noting its unusual nature. Smollet thought this 'Sam Bloxam' might have relevant information. I asked for Bloxam's whereabouts, offering another half-sovereign for the address. Smollet quickly finished his tea and stood up, declaring he would start searching immediately. At the door, he stopped and proposed a more practical plan: realizing Sam might be difficult to find or too drunk to talk that night, he suggested I provide a stamped, addressed envelope. He would find Sam's address and mail it to me that night, advising me to go after him early the next morning, as Sam tends to leave early regardless of late-night drinking. Finding this approach sensible, I sent one of his children with a penny to purchase an envelope and paper, allowing her to keep the change. Upon her return, I addressed and stamped the envelope. After Smollet reiterated his promise to mail the address once he located it, I headed home. Regardless, we are now following a lead. I feel exhausted this evening and need rest. Mina is sleeping soundly, appearing somewhat pale; her eyes suggest she may have been crying. My poor dear, it likely distresses her to be kept uninformed, which probably intensifies her worry about my well-being and that of the others. However, maintaining this secrecy is for the best. It's preferable for her to experience disappointment and concern now than to suffer a nervous collapse later. The doctors were entirely justified in insisting she be shielded from this terrible affair. I must remain resolute, as the responsibility for this silence falls upon me. I will never raise this topic with her under any circumstances. In fact, this task might not be difficult, as she herself has become less talkative about the matter and hasn't mentioned the Count or his activities since we informed her of our plan.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "October 1st, evening—When I arrived at Thomas Snelling's home in Bethnal Green, I found him too drunk to recall anything. The anticipation of beer had led him to start drinking early, so he wasn't any help. From his wife, who seemed an honest but poor woman, I learned that Thomas was just an assistant; the main person in charge was Smollet. So, I went to Walworth and found Mr. Joseph Smollet at home, in his shirtsleeves, enjoying a late cup of tea. He struck me as a capable, trustworthy worker with a good mind. He remembered the events concerning the boxes and, consulting a battered old notebook filled with barely legible notes, gave me their destinations. He said there were six boxes he delivered from Carfax to 197, Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and another six taken to Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey. If the Count was planning to spread his hiding places around London, these were the first locations, likely with more to come. The organized way this was done suggested he intended to cover more than just these areas—likely aiming to spread out across all of London, including the north, west, and even the City and fashionable districts.\n\nI asked Smollet if any other boxes had been removed from Carfax. He responded, saying that since I'd been generous with payment, he'd share everything he knew. He’d overheard a man named Bloxam in a pub talking about a hard and dirty job at an old house in Purfleet. Not many such jobs come up, so he thought Bloxam might have more information. I asked if he could get Bloxam’s address and offered more money if he did. Smollet finished his tea and immediately set out to find Bloxam, but warned me that even if he found him, Bloxam might not be in a fit state to talk tonight as he was also fond of drinking. Smollet suggested that if I provided him with a stamped, addressed envelope, he would mail the information as soon as he had it and advised me to act quickly in the morning, as Bloxam tended to rise early despite drinking the night before.\n\nI sent one of the children to buy paper and an envelope, prepared it, and Smollet promised to send word when he had the address. Then I returned home. At least we have a lead. I'm very tired and in need of rest. Mina is already asleep, though she looks pale and seems to have been crying, likely upset at being kept out of matters, which must make her doubly anxious for our safety. However, the doctors were right to keep her away from these terrible affairs, and it's my responsibility to maintain this silence, for her sake. I won't discuss it with her—she also seems reluctant to bring up the subject since we told her about our decision."

          "text_segment": "2 October, evening.—A long and trying and exciting day. By the first post I got my directed envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed, on which was written with a carpenter’s pencil in a sprawling hand:—\n“Sam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4, Poters Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth. Arsk for the depite.”\nI got the letter in bed, and rose without waking Mina. She looked heavy and sleepy and pale, and far from well. I determined not to wake her, but that, when I should return from this new search, I would arrange for her going back to Exeter. I think she would be happier in our own home, with her daily tasks to interest her, than in being here amongst us and in ignorance. I only saw Dr. Seward for a moment, and told him where I was off to, promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as I should have found out anything. I drove to Walworth and found, with some difficulty, Potter’s Court. Mr. Smollet’s spelling misled me, as I asked for Poter’s Court instead of Potter’s Court. However, when I had found the court, I had no difficulty in discovering Corcoran’s lodging-house. When I asked the man who came to the door for the “depite,” he shook his head, and said: “I dunno ’im. There ain’t no such a person ’ere; I never ’eard of ’im in all my bloomin’ days. Don’t believe there ain’t nobody of that kind livin’ ere or anywheres.” I took out Smollet’s letter, and as I read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the name of the court might guide me. “What are you?” I asked.\n“I’m the depity,” he answered. I saw at once that I was on the right track; phonetic spelling had again misled me. A half-crown tip put the deputy’s knowledge at my disposal, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam, who had slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at Corcoran’s, had left for his work at Poplar at five o’clock that morning. He could not tell me where the place of work was situated, but he had a vague idea that it was some kind of a “new-fangled ware’us”; and with this slender clue I had to start for Poplar. It was twelve o’clock before I got any satisfactory hint of such a building, and this I got at a coffee-shop, where some workmen were having their dinner. One of these suggested that there was being erected at Cross Angel Street a new “cold storage” building; and as this suited the condition of a “new-fangled ware’us,” I at once drove to it. An interview with a surly gatekeeper and a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with the coin of the realm, put me on the track of Bloxam; he was sent for on my suggesting that I was willing to pay his day’s wages to his foreman for the privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter. He was a smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing. When I had promised to pay for his information and given him an earnest, he told me that he had made two journeys between Carfax and a house in Piccadilly, and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes—“main heavy ones”—with a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose. I asked him if he could tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly, to which he replied:—\n“Well, guv’nor, I forgits the number, but it was only a few doors from a big white church or somethink of the kind, not long built. It was a dusty old ’ouse, too, though nothin’ to the dustiness of the ’ouse we tooked the bloomin’ boxes from.”\n“How did you get into the houses if they were both empty?”\n“There was the old party what engaged me a-waitin’ in the ’ouse at Purfleet. He ’elped me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray. Curse me, but he was the strongest chap I ever struck, an’ him a old feller, with a white moustache, one that thin you would think he couldn’t throw a shadder.”\nHow this phrase thrilled through me!\n“Why, ’e took up ’is end o’ the boxes like they was pounds of tea, and me a-puffin’ an’ a-blowin’ afore I could up-end mine anyhow—an’ I’m no chicken, neither.”\n“How did you get into the house in Piccadilly?” I asked.\n“He was there too. He must ’a’ started off and got there afore me, for when I rung of the bell he kem an’ opened the door ’isself an’ ’elped me to carry the boxes into the ’all.”\n“The whole nine?” I asked.\n“Yus; there was five in the first load an’ four in the second. It was main dry work, an’ I don’t so well remember ’ow I got ’ome.” I interrupted him:—\n“Were the boxes left in the hall?”\n“Yus; it was a big ’all, an’ there was nothin’ else in it.” I made one more attempt to further matters:—\n“You didn’t have any key?”\n“Never used no key nor nothink. The old gent, he opened the door ’isself an’ shut it again when I druv off. I don’t remember the last time—but that was the beer.”\n“And you can’t remember the number of the house?”\n“No, sir. But ye needn’t have no difficulty about that. It’s a ’igh ’un with a stone front with a bow on it, an’ ’igh steps up to the door. I know them steps, ’avin’ ’ad to carry the boxes up with three loafers what come round to earn a copper. The old gent give them shillin’s, an’ they seein’ they got so much, they wanted more; but ’e took one of them by the shoulder and was like to throw ’im down the steps, till the lot of them went away cussin’.” I thought that with this description I could find the house, so, having paid my friend for his information, I started off for Piccadilly. I had gained a new painful experience; the Count could, it was evident, handle the earth-boxes himself. If so, time was precious; for, now that he had achieved a certain amount of distribution, he could, by choosing his own time, complete the task unobserved. At Piccadilly Circus I discharged my cab, and walked westward; beyond the Junior Constitutional I came across the house described, and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs arranged by Dracula. The house looked as though it had been long untenanted. The windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters were up. All the framework was black with time, and from the iron the paint had mostly scaled away. It was evident that up to lately there had been a large notice-board in front of the balcony; it had, however, been roughly torn away, the uprights which had supported it still remaining. Behind the rails of the balcony I saw there were some loose boards, whose raw edges looked white. I would have given a good deal to have been able to see the notice-board intact, as it would, perhaps, have given some clue to the ownership of the house. I remembered my experience of the investigation and purchase of Carfax, and I could not but feel that if I could find the former owner there might be some means discovered of gaining access to the house.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Evening, October 2nd—A long, draining, and eventful day. My mail arrived with a plain envelope containing a soiled piece of paper. On it, scrawled in pencil, was written:\n“Sam Bloxam, at Korkrans, 4, Poters Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth. Ask for the depite.”\nI received the note while still in bed and got up quietly to avoid waking Mina. She seemed tired, pale, and unwell. I decided not to disturb her but planned that, upon my return from this search, I would arrange for her to go back to Exeter. I believe she’d be better off at home, occupied with her usual tasks, rather than here among us, kept in the dark. I briefly saw Dr. Seward, informed him of my destination, and promised to update the others as soon as I had news. I travelled to Walworth and, with some difficulty, located Potter’s Court. Mr. Smollet’s incorrect spelling initially spelling (Poter’s instead of Potter’s) confused my search. Once I found the court, locating Corcoran’s lodging-house was easy. When I questioned the man who answered the door, asking for the “depite,” he shook his head and said, “I don’t know him. No one like that lives here; I’ve never heard of him. I doubt such a person exists here or anywhere.” I pulled out Smollet’s letter and, as I re-read it, the spelling error for the court’s name gave me an idea. “What is your role here?” I asked. He replied, “I’m the deputy.” I immediately understood; phonetic spelling had once again caused the confusion. A half-crown tip secured the deputy’s cooperation, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam, after sleeping off his drinks from the previous night at Corcoran’s, had left for his job in Poplar at five that morning. The deputy didn’t know the specific location but vaguely thought it was some kind of “new-fangled warehouse.” With this limited information, I headed for Poplar. It was noon before I got a promising lead on such a building. This came from workmen having lunch in a coffee-shop. One mentioned a new “cold storage” facility being constructed at Cross Angel Street. As this matched the description of a “new-fangled warehouse,” I drove there immediately. Speaking to a grim gatekeeper and an even grimmer foreman, both placated with money, put me on Bloxam’s trail. I offered to pay his day’s wages to the foreman in exchange for asking him a few questions privately, and Bloxam was sent for. He was a sharp fellow despite his rough manner. After promising payment and giving him an initial sum, he told me he had made two trips between Carfax and a house in Piccadilly. He had transported nine large, extremely heavy boxes from Carfax to the Piccadilly house using a horse and cart he had hired. I asked if he knew the house number in Piccadilly. He answered, “Well, guv’nor, I forget the number, but it was just a few doors down from a big, fairly new white church or something similar. The house itself was old and dusty, but nothing compared to how dusty the place we got the boxes from was.” I questioned how he entered the houses if they were empty. He said, “The old fellow who hired me was waiting at the house in Purfleet. He helped me load the boxes onto the cart. Honestly, he was the strongest man I’ve ever met, and him an old chap, with a white moustache so thin you wouldn’t think he’d cast a shadow.” That description sent a shiver through me. “He lifted his end of the boxes like they weighed pounds of tea,” Bloxam continued, “while I was puffing and blowing trying to get mine upright, and I’m not a weakling either.” “How did you get into the house in Piccadilly?” I asked. “He was there too. He must have left and got there before me, because when I rang the bell, he came and opened the door himself and helped me carry the boxes into the hall.” “All nine?” I asked. “Yes; five on the first trip and four on the second. It was thirsty work, and I don’t quite recall getting home.” I interrupted, “Were the boxes left in the hall?” “Yes; it was a large hall, and there was nothing else in it.” I tried one more angle, “You didn’t use a key?” “Never used a key or anything. The old gentleman opened the door himself and closed it after I drove off. I don’t remember the last time—but that was the beer talking.” “And you still can’t remember the house number?” “No, sir. But you shouldn’t have trouble finding it. It’s a tall building with a stone front, a bay window, and high steps up to the door. I know those steps, having had to carry the boxes up with three lazy chaps who showed up looking for work. The old man gave them shillings, and seeing they got so much, they wanted more; but he grabbed one by the shoulder and looked like he’d throw him down the steps, until they all left muttering curses.” Convinced that this description would help me find the house, and having paid Bloxam for his information, I headed towards Piccadilly. I had learned something unsettling: the Count was clearly capable of moving the earth-filled boxes himself. If so, time was crucial; having distributed some boxes, he could now, by choosing his moments, complete the task unnoticed. At Piccadilly Circus, I dismissed my cab and walked west. Past the Junior Constitutional club, I found the house matching the description and was certain it was Dracula’s next planned location. The house appeared to have been vacant for a long time. The windows were thick with dust, and the shutters were closed. The woodwork was aged and black, and most of the paint had flaked off the ironwork. It was clear a large notice-board had recently been on the balcony, but it had been roughly pulled down, leaving the supporting uprights. Behind the balcony railing, I saw some loose boards with newly cut edges. I would have given a lot to have seen the notice-board intact, as it might have offered a clue to the house’s owner. Remembering my investigation and purchase of Carfax, I felt that if I could find the previous owner, there might be a way to gain entry to the house.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "October 2, evening—Today was exhausting but full of discoveries. This morning, I received in the post an envelope addressed to me, containing a filthy scrap of paper with a message scrawled in pencil: “Sam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4, Poters Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth. Arsk for the depite.” I found the letter while still in bed, deliberately not waking Mina, as she seemed unwell and needed rest. I resolved to arrange for her to return home to Exeter once I finished my errand, believing she would fare better there. Briefly speaking with Dr. Seward, I explained my intentions and promised to report back.\n\nI traveled to Walworth, having trouble finding Potter’s Court because of a spelling mistake—I was searching for “Poter’s Court” instead of “Potter’s Court.” Eventually, I found Corcoran’s lodging-house. When I asked the man who answered the door for the “depite,” he denied knowing anyone by that name. Realizing from the odd spelling that he might be the person I needed, I asked him directly. He admitted he was the deputy, and, after a small bribe, he shared that Mr. Bloxam, after sleeping off a drunken night, had left for work in Poplar early that morning at five. He didn’t know Bloxam’s exact workplace but guessed it was a “new-fangled warehouse.” With this vague information, I went to Poplar, spending several hours investigating until I learned at a coffee shop that a new cold storage facility was being built on Cross Angel Street, fitting the description.\n\nAt the building, after paying off a surly gatekeeper and foreman, I was able to speak with Bloxam, promising to pay him for his information. He described having made two trips between Carfax and a Piccadilly house, transporting nine very heavy boxes there by horse and cart. Bloxam couldn’t recall the house number, but said it was a few doors down from a newly built, large white church. It was a dusty old place, though not nearly as dusty as Carfax. I asked how they got in, as both houses were supposed to be empty. He recounted that an old man with a white moustache, surprisingly strong despite his frail appearance, helped him with the boxes at Purfleet and was present when Bloxam arrived to deliver to Piccadilly—meaning he must have traveled there faster than Bloxam.\n\nThe old man opened the doors himself at both sites and handled the crates with ease. At the Piccadilly house, the boxes were stacked in a large, empty hall. Bloxam said he never needed a key, as the elder always answered the door and closed it after him. He couldn’t remember the house number but provided a description: it was a tall stone-fronted house with high steps leading up, and there was a bow window. On delivery, three local men helped, but demanded more money and were chased off when the old man threatened one of them.\n\nWith this description, I believed I could identify the house. After paying Bloxam, I set off and soon spotted the house matching his account in Piccadilly, beyond the Junior Constitutional. It looked abandoned, with dusty, shuttered windows and weathered woodwork. A large signboard had recently been removed, leaving only the supports. Some new-looking boards were visible on the upstairs balcony. I regretted not being able to see the sign, as it might have revealed the owner’s identity. Remembering how we dealt with Carfax, I thought perhaps learning the previous owner’s identity might provide a way inside. The day taught me something worrying: Dracula could easily handle the heavy earth boxes, meaning he could relocate them at will, unobserved, now that they were distributed. I knew my time was short."

          "text_segment": "There was at present nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly side, and nothing could be done; so I went round to the back to see if anything could be gathered from this quarter. The mews were active, the Piccadilly houses being mostly in occupation. I asked one or two of the grooms and helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me anything about the empty house. One of them said that he heard it had lately been taken, but he couldn’t say from whom. He told me, however, that up to very lately there had been a notice-board of “For Sale” up, and that perhaps Mitchell, Sons, & Candy, the house agents, could tell me something, as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on the board. I did not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant know or guess too much, so, thanking him in the usual manner, I strolled away. It was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was closing in, so I did not lose any time. Having learned the address of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy from a directory at the Berkeley, I was soon at their office in Sackville Street.\nThe gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner, but uncommunicative in equal proportion. Having once told me that the Piccadilly house—which throughout our interview he called a “mansion”—was sold, he considered my business as concluded. When I asked who had purchased it, he opened his eyes a thought wider, and paused a few seconds before replying:—\n“It is sold, sir.”\n“Pardon me,” I said, with equal politeness, “but I have a special reason for wishing to know who purchased it.”\nAgain he paused longer, and raised his eyebrows still more. “It is sold, sir,” was again his laconic reply.\n“Surely,” I said, “you do not mind letting me know so much.”\n“But I do mind,” he answered. “The affairs of their clients are absolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy.” This was manifestly a prig of the first water, and there was no use arguing with him. I thought I had best meet him on his own ground, so I said:—\n“Your clients, sir, are happy in having so resolute a guardian of their confidence. I am myself a professional man.” Here I handed him my card. “In this instance I am not prompted by curiosity; I act on the part of Lord Godalming, who wishes to know something of the property which was, he understood, lately for sale.” These words put a different complexion on affairs. He said:—\n“I would like to oblige you if I could, Mr. Harker, and especially would I like to oblige his lordship. We once carried out a small matter of renting some chambers for him when he was the Honourable Arthur Holmwood. If you will let me have his lordship’s address I will consult the House on the subject, and will, in any case, communicate with his lordship by to-night’s post. It will be a pleasure if we can so far deviate from our rules as to give the required information to his lordship.”\nI wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy, so I thanked him, gave the address at Dr. Seward’s and came away. It was now dark, and I was tired and hungry. I got a cup of tea at the Aërated Bread Company and came down to Purfleet by the next train.\nI found all the others at home. Mina was looking tired and pale, but she made a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful, it wrung my heart to think that I had had to keep anything from her and so caused her inquietude. Thank God, this will be the last night of her looking on at our conferences, and feeling the sting of our not showing our confidence. It took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of keeping her out of our grim task. She seems somehow more reconciled; or else the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her, for when any accidental allusion is made she actually shudders. I am glad we made our resolution in time, as with such a feeling as this, our growing knowledge would be torture to her.\nI could not tell the others of the day’s discovery till we were alone; so after dinner—followed by a little music to save appearances even amongst ourselves—I took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed. The dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever, and clung to me as though she would detain me; but there was much to be talked of and I came away. Thank God, the ceasing of telling things has made no difference between us.\nWhen I came down again I found the others all gathered round the fire in the study. In the train I had written my diary so far, and simply read it off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own information; when I had finished Van Helsing said:—\n“This has been a great day’s work, friend Jonathan. Doubtless we are on the track of the missing boxes. If we find them all in that house, then our work is near the end. But if there be some missing, we must search until we find them. Then shall we make our final coup, and hunt the wretch to his real death.” We all sat silent awhile and all at once Mr. Morris spoke:—\n“Say! how are we going to get into that house?”\n“We got into the other,” answered Lord Godalming quickly.\n“But, Art, this is different. We broke house at Carfax, but we had night and a walled park to protect us. It will be a mighty different thing to commit burglary in Piccadilly, either by day or night. I confess I don’t see how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us a key of some sort; perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in the morning.” Lord Godalming’s brows contracted, and he stood up and walked about the room. By-and-by he stopped and said, turning from one to another of us:—\n“Quincey’s head is level. This burglary business is getting serious; we got off once all right; but we have now a rare job on hand—unless we can find the Count’s key basket.”\nAs nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be at least advisable to wait till Lord Godalming should hear from Mitchell’s, we decided not to take any active step before breakfast time. For a good while we sat and smoked, discussing the matter in its various lights and bearings; I took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to the moment. I am very sleepy and shall go to bed....\nJust a line. Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular. Her forehead is puckered up into little wrinkles, as though she thinks even in her sleep. She is still too pale, but does not look so haggard as she did this morning. To-morrow will, I hope, mend all this; she will be herself at home in Exeter. Oh, but I am sleepy!",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Having learned nothing from the front (Piccadilly) side of the house and unable to proceed there, I circled around to the back (the mews) hoping to gather some information from that area. The mews were quite busy, as most houses in Piccadilly were occupied. I asked a couple of the stable workers and helpers I encountered if they knew anything about the empty house. One of them mentioned hearing it had recently been taken, but didn't know the new occupant's identity. He did, however, tell me that a 'For Sale' sign had been up until very recently and suggested that Mitchell, Sons, & Candy, the estate agents, might be able to provide details, as he thought he remembered seeing their name on the sign. Not wanting to appear overly eager or reveal too much to my informant, I thanked him politely and walked away. As dusk was setting in and the autumn night was approaching, I didn't waste time. After finding the address of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy in a directory at the Berkeley, I was quickly at their office on Sackville Street. The gentleman who met with me was remarkably polite but equally unforthcoming. Once he confirmed the Piccadilly house, which he consistently referred to as a 'mansion,' had been sold, he seemed to consider our discussion concluded. When I inquired about the buyer, he opened his eyes slightly wider and paused for a few moments before simply stating, \"It is sold, sir.\" I replied with the same politeness, explaining that I had a specific reason for wanting to know who purchased it. He paused even longer this time and raised his eyebrows higher. \"It is sold, sir,\" he repeated curtly. I pressed him, saying, \"Surely, you don't mind letting me know just that much.\" He responded, \"But I do mind. The affairs of our clients are completely confidential with Mitchell, Sons, & Candy.\" This was clearly a very pretentious man, and further argument was pointless. I decided the best approach was to meet him on his own terms, so I said, \"Your clients are fortunate to have such a steadfast protector of their privacy. I myself am a professional.\" I then presented him with my card. \"In this instance, I am not driven by curiosity; I am acting on behalf of Lord Godalming, who wishes to know something about the property he understood was recently available for sale.\" These words changed the situation. He said, \"Mr. Harker, I would be pleased to assist you if possible, and particularly his lordship. We handled a minor rental matter for him previously when he was the Honourable Arthur Holmwood. If you provide his lordship's address, I will consult with the firm and will, in any case, contact his lordship by tonight's mail. It would be a pleasure if we can make an exception to our rules to provide the requested information to his lordship.\" I wanted to secure an ally, not create an adversary, so I thanked him, gave the address at Dr. Seward's, and left. It was now dark, and I was tired and hungry. I got some tea at the Aërated Bread Company and took the next train back to Purfleet. I found everyone else at home. Mina looked weary and pale, though she made a brave effort to seem bright and cheerful. It pained me to think that keeping things from her had caused her worry. Thank goodness, this will be the last night she has to observe our meetings and feel the sting of being excluded from our confidence. It took all my strength to maintain the difficult decision of keeping her out of our grim task. She seems somehow more accepting; or perhaps the very subject has become distasteful to her, because she visibly shudders whenever it's brought up accidentally. I am glad we made our decision in time, as with such feelings, our increasing knowledge would be unbearable for her. I couldn't inform the others of the day's findings until we were alone; so after dinner—which included a little music to maintain appearances, even amongst ourselves—I took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed. The dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever and clung to me as if she wanted to keep me there; but there was much to discuss, so I came away. Thank God, keeping things from her has not created distance between us. When I came back downstairs, I found the others gathered by the fire in the study. I had updated my diary on the train, so I simply read it aloud to them as the most effective way for them to catch up on my information. After I finished, Van Helsing said, \"This has been a very productive day, friend Jonathan. Undoubtedly, we are on the trail of the missing boxes. If we find them all in that house, then our work is nearly finished. But if some are missing, we must search until we locate them. Then we will make our final move and hunt the wretch to his true demise.\" We all sat in silence for a moment, and then Mr. Morris suddenly spoke: \"Tell me! How are we going to get into that house?\" \"We got into the other one,\" Lord Godalming replied quickly. \"But, Art, this is different,\" Morris countered. \"We broke into Carfax, but we had the cover of night and a walled estate for protection. Committing burglary in Piccadilly, day or night, will be much riskier. Frankly, I don't see how we'll get inside unless that agent fellow can provide us with a key of some sort; perhaps we will know when you receive his letter in the morning.\" Lord Godalming's brow furrowed, and he stood up and paced the room. After a while, he stopped and said, turning from one of us to another, \"Quincey's point is valid. This burglary business is getting serious; we got away with it alright once, but now we have a much more difficult task on hand—unless we can find the Count's key collection.\" Since nothing practical could be done before morning, and it was certainly wise to wait until Lord Godalming heard from Mitchell's, we decided against taking any active steps before breakfast time. We sat and smoked for a good while, discussing the matter from various angles; I took the opportunity to bring my diary completely up to date. I am very sleepy and will go to bed now... Just a final thought. Mina is sleeping soundly, her breathing steady. Her forehead is creased with tiny wrinkles, as if she's contemplating something even in her sleep. She is still too pale but doesn't look as exhausted as she did this morning. I hope tomorrow will set all this right; she will be back to her normal self at home in Exeter. Oh, but I am so sleepy!",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "At the moment, there was nothing more to be discovered from the Piccadilly side of things, so I decided to check around the back to see if I could learn anything from that direction. The area was bustling, with the houses on Piccadilly mostly inhabited. I spoke to a couple of stable workers nearby, asking if they knew anything about the vacant property. One mentioned he'd heard it had recently been bought, but didn't know who by. He did recall a 'For Sale' sign being up until not long ago, and thought the real estate firm Mitchell, Sons, & Candy, whose name he'd seen on the sign, might have details. I kept my interest discreet, thanked him, and walked away. Evening was approaching, so I didn't waste time. After finding the company's address in a directory at the Berkeley, I soon arrived at their office on Sackville Street.\n\nA very courteous but equally guarded man greeted me there. He referred to the Piccadilly property as a \"mansion\" and, after telling me it had been sold, clearly felt that concluded our business. When I pressed to know the buyer, he emphasized again, with slightly greater emphasis, that it was sold and divulged no more.\n\nPolitely persisting, I explained I represented Lord Godalming, who had an interest in the property. Upon hearing this, the agent became somewhat more cooperative. He recalled having rented chambers to Lord Godalming (then the Honourable Arthur Holmwood) in the past, and said if I provided the lord's address, he would consult with his colleagues and communicate directly by mail that night, possibly providing the information.\n\nI thanked him, gave Dr. Seward's address, and left. By this time it was dark and I was fatigued and hungry, so I had some tea at the Aërated Bread Company before taking the next train to Purfleet.\n\nAt home, I found everyone gathered. Mina, though clearly exhausted and pale, made a brave effort to seem cheerful, which pained me knowing I was withholding information that troubled her. Thankfully, this would be the last night she had to be excluded from our discussions. It took resolve to keep her apart from our grim work, but she seemed increasingly reconciled, or perhaps the very topic had become unpleasant for her, as she would shudder when it arose. I'm glad the decision was made before our investigations could cause her greater distress.\n\nI waited to share the day's developments until we were alone, so after dinner—and a little music to maintain normalcy—even among ourselves, I escorted Mina to her room. She clung to me affectionately before I left; nonetheless, I had important matters to discuss with the others downstairs. The honesty between Mina and me, despite my omissions, hadn't suffered.\n\nRejoining the group, I found them by the fire in the study. I had written up my diary entry during the train ride and read it aloud to bring everyone up to date. When I finished, Van Helsing commended the productivity of the day, noting we were likely closing in on the missing boxes. Success would mean our arduous work was nearly done, though if boxes were missing, further searching would be necessary. Only when they were found could they finally defeat Dracula.\n\nThe room fell silent until Mr. Morris asked how they would gain entry to the house. Lord Godalming observed they had broken into Carfax before, but Mr. Morris pointed out the risk was greater in Piccadilly, suggesting the agency might be able to help with a key, depending on what was learned from their letter. Lord Godalming acknowledged the seriousness of the task, noting it was becoming increasingly risky unless they found Dracula's keys.\n\nThere was little they could do that night, so they decided to wait for news from Mitchell's before acting the next morning. The group sat and discussed the situation before I updated my diary once more. Tiredness overcame me, and I decided to go to bed.\n\nBefore sleeping, I checked on Mina, who was resting quietly—still pale, but better than earlier. I hoped that by tomorrow she'd feel more herself at home in Exeter. I was truly exhausted."

          "text_segment": "Dr. Seward’s Diary.\n1 October.—I am puzzled afresh about Renfield. His moods change so rapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as they always mean something more than his own well-being, they form a more than interesting study. This morning, when I went to see him after his repulse of Van Helsing, his manner was that of a man commanding destiny. He was, in fact, commanding destiny—subjectively. He did not really care for any of the things of mere earth; he was in the clouds and looked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals. I thought I would improve the occasion and learn something, so I asked him:—\n“What about the flies these times?” He smiled on me in quite a superior sort of way—such a smile as would have become the face of Malvolio—as he answered me:—\n“The fly, my dear sir, has one striking feature; its wings are typical of the aërial powers of the psychic faculties. The ancients did well when they typified the soul as a butterfly!”\nI thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logically, so I said quickly:—\n“Oh, it is a soul you are after now, is it?” His madness foiled his reason, and a puzzled look spread over his face as, shaking his head with a decision which I had but seldom seen in him, he said:—\n“Oh, no, oh no! I want no souls. Life is all I want.” Here he brightened up; “I am pretty indifferent about it at present. Life is all right; I have all I want. You must get a new patient, doctor, if you wish to study zoöphagy!”\nThis puzzled me a little, so I drew him on:—\n“Then you command life; you are a god, I suppose?” He smiled with an ineffably benign superiority.\n“Oh no! Far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of the Deity. I am not even concerned in His especially spiritual doings. If I may state my intellectual position I am, so far as concerns things purely terrestrial, somewhat in the position which Enoch occupied spiritually!” This was a poser to me. I could not at the moment recall Enoch’s appositeness; so I had to ask a simple question, though I felt that by so doing I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic:—\n“And why with Enoch?”\n“Because he walked with God.” I could not see the analogy, but did not like to admit it; so I harked back to what he had denied:—\n“So you don’t care about life and you don’t want souls. Why not?” I put my question quickly and somewhat sternly, on purpose to disconcert him. The effort succeeded; for an instant he unconsciously relapsed into his old servile manner, bent low before me, and actually fawned upon me as he replied:—\n“I don’t want any souls, indeed, indeed! I don’t. I couldn’t use them if I had them; they would be no manner of use to me. I couldn’t eat them or——” He suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over his face, like a wind-sweep on the surface of the water. “And doctor, as to life, what is it after all? When you’ve got all you require, and you know that you will never want, that is all. I have friends—good friends—like you, Dr. Seward”; this was said with a leer of inexpressible cunning. “I know that I shall never lack the means of life!”\nI think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he saw some antagonism in me, for he at once fell back on the last refuge of such as he—a dogged silence. After a short time I saw that for the present it was useless to speak to him. He was sulky, and so I came away.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "October 1st.—I'm perplexed by Renfield once more. His moods fluctuate so swiftly that I struggle to follow them, and because they consistently signify more than just his personal state, they represent a highly intriguing area of study. This morning, after he had rebuffed Van Helsing, his attitude upon my visit was that of someone in control of destiny. He was, effectively, controlling destiny subjectively. Nothing purely earthly held any interest for him; he seemed in a elevated state, looking down upon the frailties and needs of us ordinary humans. I decided to use this opportunity to gain some insight, so I asked him: \"What's your current focus regarding the flies?\" He offered me a noticeably condescending smile—the kind that would suit a Malvolio—and replied: \"The fly, my dear sir, possesses a notable characteristic; its wings symbolize the ethereal capabilities of our psychic faculties. The ancients were wise to depict the soul as a butterfly!\" Intending to take his comparison to its logical extreme, I promptly said: \"Ah, so it's a soul you're pursuing now?\" His delusion overcame his reasoning, and a confused expression crossed his face as, shaking his head with a firmness I rarely saw, he declared: \"Oh, no, definitely not! I don't desire souls. Life is all I want.\" Here, he seemed to brighten; \"I'm rather content about it at the moment. Life is fine; I have everything I need. You'll need to find a new patient, doctor, if you're interested in studying zoophagy!\" This remark bewildered me slightly, so I pressed him further: \"Then you command life; are you a god, I presume?\" He smiled with an indescribably benevolent sense of superiority. \"Oh no! I would never presume to claim the attributes of the Divine. I'm not even involved in His especially spiritual actions. If I may explain my intellectual standing, as far as purely worldly matters are concerned, I am somewhat in the position spiritually that Enoch held!\" This was a riddle to me. I couldn't immediately recall the relevance of Enoch; so I had to ask a simple question, even though I felt I was diminishing myself in the eyes of the madman: \"And why is that like Enoch?\" \"Because he walked with God.\" I didn't grasp the connection but didn't want to admit it; so I returned to the point he had dismissed: \"So you don't care about life and you don't want souls. Why not?\" I posed the question quickly and rather sternly, specifically to unsettle him. The tactic worked; for an instant, he unconsciously reverted to his former subservient demeanor, bowed low before me, and practically groveled as he responded: \"I truly, truly don't want any souls! I don't. I couldn't utilize them if I possessed them; they'd be entirely useless to me. I couldn't eat them or——\" He abruptly stopped, and the familiar cunning look appeared on his face, like a gust of wind disturbing the water's surface. \"And doctor, ultimately, what is life? When you possess everything you require, and you are certain you will never be in need, that is sufficient. I have companions—good companions—like you, Dr. Seward\"; this was accompanied by a look of ineffable slyness. \"I am confident I will never lack the means of existence!\" I believe he perceived some opposition in me, despite the haze of his madness, because he instantly retreated to the typical refuge of such individuals—a stubborn silence. After a brief period, I recognized that attempting to speak to him further was futile for the time being. He was sullen, and so I departed.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Dr. Seward’s Diary. October 1st.—Once again, Renfield confuses me. His shifting moods make it hard for me to keep up, but since they hint at more than just his health, they are also deeply intriguing to study. Earlier today, after he rejected Van Helsing, Renfield acted as if he controlled his own fate. In his mind, he truly believed he did. Earthly things meant nothing to him; he seemed detached, almost looking down on human frailty. Wanting to take advantage of his talkative mood, I questioned him about his interest in flies. He gave me a smug, superior smile and said: “The fly’s wings are a prime example of psychic abilities. The ancients were right to symbolize the soul as a butterfly.” I pressed him further, asking if he was now seeking souls. His madness clouded his logic, and he looked confused, but then firmly insisted he wanted no souls, only life—and even that seemed unimportant to him. He claimed his needs were met and joked that if I wanted to study someone who eats living things, I would need a new patient. This confused me, so I challenged him: did he rule over life? Was he a god? Renfield replied, humbly, that he would never claim divine qualities—he wasn’t concerned with spiritual matters, only with things on earth, comparing his state to Enoch’s spiritual place in scripture. I asked why he mentioned Enoch, and he replied, \"Because he walked with God.\" Not fully grasping his point, I again pressed: did he not care for either life or souls? My sharp question shook him; for a moment he reverted to submissiveness and pleaded that he didn’t want souls—he had no use for them and couldn’t do anything with them. Then he paused and, eyes glinting with cunning, told me that life, once your needs are met, is sufficient, and hinted he would always have what he needed, slyly complimenting me as a friend. Sensing my suspicion, he retreated into silence. Realizing I could get nowhere with him for now, I left him to his sulk."

Besides, I am glad to have anything to help to pass the time. Harker is out, following up clues; and so are Lord Godalming and Quincey. Van Helsing sits in my study poring over the record prepared by the Harkers; he seems to think that by accurate knowledge of all details he will light upon some clue. He does not wish to be disturbed in the work, without cause. I would have taken him with me to see the patient, only I thought that after his last repulse he might not care to go again. There was also another reason: Renfield might not speak so freely before a third person as when he and I were alone.\nI found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool, a pose which is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part. When I came in, he said at once, as though the question had been waiting on his lips:—\n“What about souls?” It was evident then that my surmise had been correct. Unconscious cerebration was doing its work, even with the lunatic. I determined to have the matter out. “What about them yourself?” I asked. He did not reply for a moment but looked all round him, and up and down, as though he expected to find some inspiration for an answer.\n“I don’t want any souls!” he said in a feeble, apologetic way. The matter seemed preying on his mind, and so I determined to use it—to “be cruel only to be kind.” So I said:—\n“You like life, and you want life?”\n“Oh yes! but that is all right; you needn’t worry about that!”\n“But,” I asked, “how are we to get the life without getting the soul also?” This seemed to puzzle him, so I followed it up:—\n“A nice time you’ll have some time when you’re flying out there, with the souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing and twittering and miauing all round you. You’ve got their lives, you know, and you must put up with their souls!” Something seemed to affect his imagination, for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes, screwing them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is being soaped. There was something pathetic in it that touched me; it also gave me a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a child—only a child, though the features were worn, and the stubble on the jaws was white. It was evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance, and, knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign to himself, I thought I would enter into his mind as well as I could and go with him. The first step was to restore confidence, so I asked him, speaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears:—\n“Would you like some sugar to get your flies round again?” He seemed to wake up all at once, and shook his head. With a laugh he replied:—\n“Not much! flies are poor things, after all!” After a pause he added, “But I don’t want their souls buzzing round me, all the same.”\n“Or spiders?” I went on.\n“Blow spiders! What’s the use of spiders? There isn’t anything in them to eat or”—he stopped suddenly, as though reminded of a forbidden topic.\n“So, so!” I thought to myself, “this is the second time he has suddenly stopped at the word ‘drink’; what does it mean?” Renfield seemed himself aware of having made a lapse, for he hurried on, as though to distract my attention from it:—\n“I don’t take any stock at all in such matters. ‘Rats and mice and such small deer,’ as Shakespeare has it, ‘chicken-feed of the larder’ they might be called. I’m past all that sort of nonsense. You might as well ask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chop-sticks, as to try to interest me about the lesser carnivora, when I know of what is before me.”\n“I see,” I said. “You want big things that you can make your teeth meet in? How would you like to breakfast on elephant?”\n“What ridiculous nonsense you are talking!” He was getting too wide awake, so I thought I would press him hard. “I wonder,” I said reflectively, “what an elephant’s soul is like!”\nThe effect I desired was obtained, for he at once fell from his high-horse and became a child again.\n“I don’t want an elephant’s soul, or any soul at all!” he said. For a few moments he sat despondently. Suddenly he jumped to his feet, with his eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement. “To hell with you and your souls!” he shouted. “Why do you plague me about souls? Haven’t I got enough to worry, and pain, and distract me already, without thinking of souls!” He looked so hostile that I thought he was in for another homicidal fit, so I blew my whistle. The instant, however, that I did so he became calm, and said apologetically:—\n“Forgive me, Doctor; I forgot myself. You do not need any help. I am so worried in my mind that I am apt to be irritable. If you only knew the problem I have to face, and that I am working out, you would pity, and tolerate, and pardon me. Pray do not put me in a strait-waistcoat. I want to think and I cannot think freely when my body is confined. I am sure you will understand!” He had evidently self-control; so when the attendants came I told them not to mind, and they withdrew. Renfield watched them go; when the door was closed he said, with considerable dignity and sweetness:—\n“Dr. Seward, you have been very considerate towards me. Believe me that I am very, very grateful to you!” I thought it well to leave him in this mood, and so I came away. There is certainly something to ponder over in this man’s state. Several points seem to make what the American interviewer calls “a story,” if one could only get them in proper order. Here they are:—\nWill not mention “drinking.”\nFears the thought of being burdened with the “soul” of anything.\nHas no dread of wanting “life” in the future.\nDespises the meaner forms of life altogether, though he dreads being haunted by their souls.\nLogically all these things point one way! he has assurance of some kind that he will acquire some higher life. He dreads the consequence—the burden of a soul. Then it is a human life he looks to!\nAnd the assurance—?\nMerciful God! the Count has been to him, and there is some new scheme of terror afoot!\nLater.—I went after my round to Van Helsing and told him my suspicion. He grew very grave; and, after thinking the matter over for a while asked me to take him to Renfield. I did so. As we came to the door we heard the lunatic within singing gaily, as he used to do in the time which now seems so long ago. When we entered we saw with amazement that he had spread out his sugar as of old; the flies, lethargic with the autumn, were beginning to buzz into the room. We tried to make him talk of the subject of our previous conversation, but he would not attend. He went on with his singing, just as though we had not been present. He had got a scrap of paper and was folding it into a note-book. We had to come away as ignorant as we went in.\nHis is a curious case indeed; we must watch him to-night.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Later that day, Renfield requested my presence. Normally, I wouldn't visit without a specific reason, but currently, I'm so intrigued by him that I was happy to make the effort. Additionally, I'm glad for anything that helps pass the time. Harker, Lord Godalming, and Quincey are all out pursuing leads. Van Helsing is in my study, deeply engrossed in the records the Harkers compiled; he seems to believe that a thorough understanding of every detail will reveal some critical clue. He prefers not to be interrupted in his work unless it's necessary. I considered taking him with me to see the patient, but after Renfield's previous rejection, I thought Van Helsing might not want to go again. There was also another consideration: Renfield might not speak as freely in front of a third person as he does when it's just the two of us. I found him seated in the middle of the floor on his stool, a posture that usually suggests he's focusing mentally. The moment I entered, he asked, as if the question had been ready on his lips, 'What about souls?' This confirmed my suspicion. His subconscious mind was clearly processing the idea, even in his state. I decided to address the issue head-on. 'What do you think about them?' I asked. He paused for a moment, looking around and up and down, as if seeking inspiration for an answer. 'I don't want any souls!' he said in a weak, apologetic tone. The topic seemed to be troubling him, so I decided to use it – to be 'cruel to be kind.' I then asked, 'You like life, and you want life?' 'Oh yes!' he replied, 'but that's fine; you don't need to worry about that!' 'But,' I questioned, 'how can we acquire life without also acquiring the soul?' This appeared to confuse him, so I pressed further: 'Imagine the lovely time you'll have when you're flying around out there someday, with the souls of thousands of flies, spiders, birds, and cats buzzing, chirping, and meowing all around you. You've taken their lives, you know, and you'll have to put up with their souls!' This image seemed to impact his imagination, as he covered his ears and squeezed his eyes shut tightly, much like a small child does when getting their face soaped. There was something about it that was quite touching and pathetic. It also taught me something, making me see him as merely a child, despite his worn features and white stubble. It was clear he was experiencing significant mental distress, and knowing how he had previously interpreted seemingly unrelated things, I decided to try and enter his mindset and follow his train of thought as best as possible. The first step was to re-establish trust, so I asked him, speaking quite loudly so he might hear through his closed ears, 'Would you like some sugar to attract your flies again?' He seemed to snap back to attention and shook his head. With a laugh, he responded, 'Not really! Flies are pretty insignificant after all!' After a brief pause, he added, 'But I still don't want their souls buzzing around me.' 'Or spiders?' I continued. 'Forget spiders!' he exclaimed. 'What's the point of spiders? There's nothing in them to eat or' – he stopped abruptly, as if remembering something he shouldn't say. 'Aha!' I thought to myself, 'This is the second time he's suddenly stopped at the word \"drink\"; what does it signify?' Renfield seemed aware he had made a slip, because he quickly changed the subject, as if to divert my attention: 'I don't concern myself with trivial matters like that. \"Rats and mice and such small deer,\" as Shakespeare puts it, could be called \"larder scraps.\" I'm beyond that kind of nonsense. You might as well ask someone to eat molecules with chopsticks as try to interest me in smaller carnivores when I know what greater things are available.' 'I see,' I said. 'You're looking for substantial things you can really sink your teeth into? How about having an elephant for breakfast?' 'What utterly ridiculous nonsense you're talking!' He was becoming too lucid, so I decided to push him harder. 'I wonder,' I mused reflectively, 'what an elephant's soul is like!' This achieved the desired effect, causing him to immediately abandon his confident stance and revert back to being like a child. 'I don't want an elephant's soul, or any soul at all!' he stated. He sat dejectedly for a few moments. Suddenly, he leaped to his feet, eyes blazing, displaying all the signs of extreme mental agitation. 'Go to hell with you and your souls!' he screamed. 'Why are you tormenting me about souls? Don't I have enough worry, pain, and distraction already, without having to think about souls!' He looked so hostile that I feared he was about to become violent again, so I blew my whistle. However, the moment I did, he instantly calmed down and said apologetically, 'Forgive me, Doctor; I lost control. You don't require any assistance. My mind is so troubled that I'm prone to irritability. If only you understood the immense problem I'm grappling with and trying to solve, you would feel pity, show tolerance, and pardon me. Please don't put me in a straitjacket. I need to think, and I can't think clearly when my body is restricted. I'm sure you'll understand!' He clearly had some degree of self-control; so when the attendants arrived, I told them it wasn't necessary, and they left. Renfield watched them go; once the door was closed, he said, with considerable dignity and kindness, 'Dr. Seward, you have treated me with great consideration. Please believe how very, very grateful I am to you!' I decided it was best to leave him in that state of mind, so I departed. There is certainly much to contemplate regarding this man's condition. Several points seem to form what an American journalist would call 'a story,' if only they could be arranged correctly. Here they are: He refuses to mention 'drinking.' He dreads the idea of being burdened with the 'soul' of anything. He has no fear of needing 'life' in the future. He completely despises smaller forms of life, although he is afraid of being haunted by their souls. Logically, all these points lead in one direction! He has some form of assurance that he will gain a higher form of life. He fears the consequence – the burden of a soul. Therefore, it must be human life he is anticipating! And the source of this assurance…? Merciful God! The Count has been to him, and a new scheme of terror is being put into motion! Later. – After finishing my rounds, I went to Van Helsing and shared my suspicion with him. He grew very serious; and, after considering the matter for a while, asked me to take him to Renfield. I did so. As we approached the door, we heard the patient inside singing cheerfully, just as he used to during a time that now seems so long ago. When we entered, we were astonished to see that he had spread out his sugar as before; the flies, sluggish due to the autumn weather, were beginning to buzz into the room. We attempted to engage him in conversation about our previous discussion, but he paid no attention. He continued singing, completely ignoring our presence. He had found a scrap of paper and was folding it into a small notebook. We had to leave just as uninformed as when we arrived. His is truly a peculiar case; we must keep a close watch on him tonight.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Later that day, he requested my presence. Normally, I wouldn’t have gone without a compelling reason, but right now I’m so intrigued by him that I didn’t mind making the effort. Besides, I welcome any distraction to help pass the time. Harker is away, chasing down leads, as are Lord Godalming and Quincey. Van Helsing is in my study, deeply focused on the records the Harkers compiled; he seems to believe that a thorough understanding of every detail might reveal a clue. He prefers not to be interrupted unless necessary. I considered bringing him along to see the patient, but after his last negative experience, I thought he might not wish to come. Another reason was that Renfield might be less open with a third person present.\n\nWhen I arrived, Renfield was sitting on his stool in the middle of the floor, a position which usually indicates he’s mentally active. Upon seeing me, he immediately asked, as though he’d been waiting for the opportunity: \"What about souls?\" This confirmed my guess that the thought was occupying his mind, even subconsciously. I decided to address the issue directly. I asked, \"What about souls yourself?\" He didn’t answer right away; instead, he looked all around as though searching for an answer. \n\nHe finally said, weakly and apologetically, “I don’t want any souls!” The subject clearly troubled him, so I decided to use it to help him, even if it was a bit harsh. I said, \"You like life and want life, don’t you?\" To which he replied, “Oh yes! But you needn’t worry about that!” I then asked, “But how can we get life without also getting the soul?” This seemed to confuse him, so I continued: \"Imagine one day, when you’re out there, surrounded by the souls of all the flies, spiders, birds, and cats you’ve encountered – buzzing and making noise all around you. Since you’ve taken their lives, you’ll also have to accept their souls.\" Something about this idea seemed to bother him deeply, as he covered his ears and closed his eyes tightly, just like a child who’s having his face washed. The sight moved me because, despite his worn features and greying stubble, he suddenly seemed childlike. It was clear he was going through some mental turmoil, so I decided to try and understand his thoughts as best I could. I needed to build his trust again, so I asked loudly enough for him to hear me through his covered ears: \"Would you like some sugar to attract more flies?\" He perked up and shook his head, chuckling as he replied, \"Not really! Flies aren’t worth much after all!\" After a pause, he added, \"But I still don’t want their souls around me.\"\n\n\"What about spiders?\" I pressed. \"Forget spiders! What’s the point of spiders? There’s nothing in them to eat or—\" He stopped abruptly, as if he remembered he wasn’t supposed to talk about something. I thought to myself that this was the second time he’d stopped at the word \"drink\"; I wondered what it meant. Renfield seemed aware he’d let something slip, and quickly changed the subject: “I don’t care about such things at all. ‘Rats and mice and such small deer,’ as Shakespeare puts it, are nothing to me—just scraps of the pantry. I’m beyond all that. You might as well ask someone to eat molecules with chopsticks as to try to interest me in minor predators when I have bigger things in mind.”\n\n“I see,” I replied. “You want something big to really sink your teeth into? How would you like to have elephant for breakfast?”\n\n“That’s ridiculous!” he scoffed. Seeing that he was becoming too alert, I pushed him further: “I wonder what kind of soul an elephant might have!”\n\nMy tactic worked, as he instantly went from being combative back to acting like a child. \"I don’t want an elephant’s soul, or any soul!\" he said. He sat sadly for a moment, then suddenly jumped up, eyes blazing with excitement. He shouted, \"To hell with you and your souls! Why do you torment me about souls? Don’t I have enough to worry about already, without thinking of souls!\" He seemed so agitated that I thought he might become violent, so I blew my whistle. But as soon as I did, he calmed down and said apologetically, \"Forgive me, Doctor; I lost control. You don’t need any assistance. My mind is troubled and I can be irritable. If you only knew the dilemma I’m facing, you’d pity and forgive me. Please don’t put me in a straitjacket. I want to think, and I can’t think freely if I’m restrained. I’m sure you understand!\" Seeing he was now in control of himself, I told the attendants to leave. Renfield watched them go, and then, with dignity and genuine warmth said, \"Dr. Seward, you have treated me very kindly. I am truly, deeply grateful!\" Sensing this was a good moment, I left. There is much to consider about his condition. Several facts seem to form what an American reporter might call ‘a story,’ if they could be properly connected. Here they are:\n- He refuses to discuss ‘drinking.’\n- He’s anxious about being burdened with the ‘soul’ of anything.\n- He isn’t afraid of wanting ‘life’ in the future.\n- He completely disregards lower forms of life, though he fears being haunted by their souls.\nLogically, all of this suggests he has some assurance of gaining a higher form of life, but fears the responsibility—the weight of a soul. Does this mean he’s seeking a human life? And the assurance…?\nGood God! The Count must have visited him and there’s a new plot unfolding!\n\nLater—I went to Van Helsing after my rounds and told him my suspicions. He became very serious, and after thinking for a while, asked to see Renfield. When we reached the door, we heard the patient singing cheerfully, as he used to long ago. When we entered, to our amazement, he had his sugar spread out as before, and the sluggish autumn flies were starting to fill the room. We tried talking to him about our earlier conversation, but he ignored us, continuing to sing as if we weren’t there. He was folding a scrap of paper into a notebook. We left, none the wiser about his present condition.\n\nHis case is truly curious; we must keep a close watch on him tonight."

The original vendors are the executors of the late Mr. Archibald Winter-Suffield. The purchaser is a foreign nobleman, Count de Ville, who effected the purchase himself paying the purchase money in notes ‘over the counter,’ if your Lordship will pardon us using so vulgar an expression. Beyond this we know nothing whatever of him.\n“We are, my Lord,\n“Your Lordship’s humble servants,\n“Mitchell, Sons & Candy.”\nDr. Seward’s Diary.\n2 October.—I placed a man in the corridor last night, and told him to make an accurate note of any sound he might hear from Renfield’s room, and gave him instructions that if there should be anything strange he was to call me. After dinner, when we had all gathered round the fire in the study—Mrs. Harker having gone to bed—we discussed the attempts and discoveries of the day. Harker was the only one who had any result, and we are in great hopes that his clue may be an important one.\nBefore going to bed I went round to the patient’s room and looked in through the observation trap. He was sleeping soundly, and his heart rose and fell with regular respiration.\nThis morning the man on duty reported to me that a little after midnight he was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat loudly. I asked him if that was all; he replied that it was all he heard. There was something about his manner so suspicious that I asked him point blank if he had been asleep. He denied sleep, but admitted to having “dozed” for a while. It is too bad that men cannot be trusted unless they are watched.\nTo-day Harker is out following up his clue, and Art and Quincey are looking after horses. Godalming thinks that it will be well to have horses always in readiness, for when we get the information which we seek there will be no time to lose. We must sterilise all the imported earth between sunrise and sunset; we shall thus catch the Count at his weakest, and without a refuge to fly to. Van Helsing is off to the British Museum looking up some authorities on ancient medicine. The old physicians took account of things which their followers do not accept, and the Professor is searching for witch and demon cures which may be useful to us later.\nI sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to sanity in strait-waistcoats.",

Regarding Lord Godalming's inquiry, conveyed by Mr. Harker, they provide details about the sale of 347 Piccadilly. The property was sold by the executors of the late Mr. Archibald Winter-Suffield. The buyer was a foreign nobleman, Count de Ville, who personally completed the purchase and paid in cash \"over the counter,\" a common term they hope his Lordship will excuse. They have no further information about the Count. The letter concludes with a formal expression of being Lord Godalming's humble servants, signed Mitchell, Sons & Candy. Dr. Seward's Diary for October 2nd notes that he assigned a man to the corridor outside Renfield's room the previous night with instructions to record any sounds and alert him if anything unusual occurred. In the evening, after Mrs. Harker retired, they gathered in the study to discuss the day's efforts. Only Harker had found anything significant, giving them hope that his discovery is an important lead. Before bed, Seward checked on Renfield through the observation panel and saw he was sleeping peacefully with normal breathing. The guard reported in the morning that Renfield was restless shortly after midnight and prayed quite loudly. When Seward asked if that was the only thing he heard, the guard confirmed it but seemed hesitant. Seward directly asked if he had been asleep, which the guard denied, though he admitted to having briefly \"dozed.\" Seward expressed frustration that people cannot be trusted to stay vigilant without constant supervision. Today, Harker is following up on his lead, while Arthur and Quincey are preparing horses, as Godalming believes having horses ready is crucial for swift action once they gather the necessary information. Their plan is to sterilize all the imported earth between sunrise and sunset, targeting the Count when he is weakest and deprived of a safe haven. Van Helsing has gone to the British Museum to research old medical texts, specifically looking into ancient treatments for witchcraft and demonic issues, as old physicians considered aspects ignored by modern doctors, hoping these methods might be useful later. Seward sometimes feels they must all be insane and fears they will eventually regain their senses while confined in straitjackets.",

          "text_segment": "3 October.—Let me put down with exactness all that happened, as well as I can remember it, since last I made an entry. Not a detail that I can recall must be forgotten; in all calmness I must proceed.\nWhen I came to Renfield’s room I found him lying on the floor on his left side in a glittering pool of blood. When I went to move him, it became at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries; there seemed none of that unity of purpose between the parts of the body which marks even lethargic sanity. As the face was exposed I could see that it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten against the floor—indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood originated. The attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as we turned him over:—\n“I think, sir, his back is broken. See, both his right arm and leg and the whole side of his face are paralysed.” How such a thing could have happened puzzled the attendant beyond measure. He seemed quite bewildered, and his brows were gathered in as he said:—\n“I can’t understand the two things. He could mark his face like that by beating his own head on the floor. I saw a young woman do it once at the Eversfield Asylum before anyone could lay hands on her. And I suppose he might have broke his neck by falling out of bed, if he got in an awkward kink. But for the life of me I can’t imagine how the two things occurred. If his back was broke, he couldn’t beat his head; and if his face was like that before the fall out of bed, there would be marks of it.” I said to him:—\n“Go to Dr. Van Helsing, and ask him to kindly come here at once. I want him without an instant’s delay.” The man ran off, and within a few minutes the Professor, in his dressing gown and slippers, appeared. When he saw Renfield on the ground, he looked keenly at him a moment, and then turned to me. I think he recognised my thought in my eyes, for he said very quietly, manifestly for the ears of the attendant:—\n“Ah, a sad accident! He will need very careful watching, and much attention. I shall stay with you myself; but I shall first dress myself. If you will remain I shall in a few minutes join you.”\nThe patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see that he had suffered some terrible injury. Van Helsing returned with extraordinary celerity, bearing with him a surgical case. He had evidently been thinking and had his mind made up; for, almost before he looked at the patient, he whispered to me:—\n“Send the attendant away. We must be alone with him when he becomes conscious, after the operation.” So I said:—\n“I think that will do now, Simmons. We have done all that we can at present. You had better go your round, and Dr. Van Helsing will operate. Let me know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere.”\nThe man withdrew, and we went into a strict examination of the patient. The wounds of the face was superficial; the real injury was a depressed fracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area. The Professor thought a moment and said:—\n“We must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as far as can be; the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of his injury. The whole motor area seems affected. The suffusion of the brain will increase quickly, so we must trephine at once or it may be too late.” As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door. I went over and opened it and found in the corridor without, Arthur and Quincey in pajamas and slippers: the former spoke:—\n“I heard your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an accident. So I woke Quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep. Things are moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us these times. I’ve been thinking that to-morrow night will not see things as they have been. We’ll have to look back—and forward a little more than we have done. May we come in?” I nodded, and held the door open till they had entered; then I closed it again. When Quincey saw the attitude and state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on the floor, he said softly:—\n“My God! what has happened to him? Poor, poor devil!” I told him briefly, and added that we expected he would recover consciousness after the operation—for a short time, at all events. He went at once and sat down on the edge of the bed, with Godalming beside him; we all watched in patience.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "October 3rd. I must meticulously record everything that has transpired since my last entry, recalling every single detail without omission and proceeding with perfect composure. Upon entering Renfield’s room, I discovered him lying on the floor, immersed in a glistening puddle of blood, on his left side. When I attempted to move him, it was immediately evident that he had sustained dreadful injuries; his body parts seemed disconnected, lacking the coordination typical even of someone in a dazed state. His face was visible and terribly bruised, as if it had been violently slammed against the floor—this was indeed the source of the blood. The attendant who was kneeling by his side remarked as we carefully turned him over, 'Sir, I believe his back is broken. Observe, his entire right side, including his arm, leg, and half of his face, is paralyzed.' The attendant was utterly perplexed by how such injuries could have occurred. He appeared visibly confused, his brow furrowed, as he stated, 'I cannot reconcile these two injuries. He could certainly have caused the facial damage himself by banging his head on the floor; I once witnessed a young woman at the Eversfield Asylum do just that before anyone could restrain her. And perhaps he might have fractured his neck falling awkwardly from the bed. But for the life of me, I cannot comprehend how both things happened. If his back were broken, he couldn't have beaten his head like that; and if his face was in that condition before a fall from bed, there would be previous signs.' I instructed him, 'Go find Dr. Van Helsing and ask him to come here instantly. I need him immediately.' The man hurried off, and within minutes, the Professor arrived, still in his dressing gown and slippers. Seeing Renfield on the ground, he observed him intently for a moment before turning to me. It seemed he read my thoughts in my eyes, for he said very calmly, clearly for the attendant’s benefit, 'Ah, what a regrettable mishap! He will require very careful supervision and considerable care. I will remain here with you myself, but I must first get properly dressed. If you will wait, I will rejoin you shortly.' The patient’s breathing was now loud and ragged, indicating severe injury. Van Helsing returned remarkably quickly, bringing a surgical kit with him. He had clearly been contemplating the situation and had decided on a course of action; almost before examining the patient, he whispered to me, 'Dismiss the attendant. We need to be alone with him when he regains consciousness after the procedure.' So, I said, 'Simmons, I think we are finished for now. We have done everything possible for the moment. You should continue your rounds, and Dr. Van Helsing will perform the operation. Inform me instantly if anything unusual occurs anywhere.' The man left, and we conducted a thorough examination of the patient. The facial wounds were superficial; the main injury was a depressed skull fracture, extending upwards into the motor control area of the brain. The Professor pondered for a moment and said, 'We must alleviate the pressure and restore conditions to as near normal as possible; the rapid spread of swelling indicates the severity of his injury. The entire motor area appears affected. The brain swelling will increase rapidly, so we must trephine immediately or it may be too late.' As he spoke, there was a gentle knock at the door. I went and opened it, finding Arthur and Quincey outside in the corridor, dressed in pajamas and slippers. Arthur spoke first, 'I heard your man calling Dr. Van Helsing and mentioning an accident. So I woke Quincey—or rather called for him, as he wasn't asleep. Things are happening too fast and too strangely for any of us to sleep soundly these days. I’ve been thinking that tomorrow night will be different from how things have been. We’ll need to reflect on the past and look ahead more than we have. May we come in?' I nodded, holding the door open until they had entered, then closed it again. When Quincey saw the patient’s position and condition, and noticed the dreadful pool on the floor, he murmured softly, 'My God! What has happened to him? Poor, poor soul!' I gave him a brief explanation and added that we expected him to regain consciousness after the operation—at least for a short period. He immediately went and sat on the edge of the bed with Godalming beside him; we all waited patiently.",

I must not forget a single detail; I need to proceed with composure. When I entered Renfield’s room, I found him lying on his left side on the floor in a shimmering pool of blood. As I went to move him, it was immediately clear he had suffered grave injuries; there was a clear lack of coordination or purpose in his body’s movement, which even in a sluggish, sane person would remain. His face, now visible, was terribly bruised, as if it had been smashed against the ground—the blood pooled around him was coming from his facial wounds. The attendant, kneeling next to him, commented as we turned Renfield over: \"I think his back is broken, sir. Look, his right arm and leg are both paralyzed, as is the entire side of his face.\" The attendant was clearly perplexed by how such an accident could have happened. He looked confused and furrowed his brow, saying: \"I don’t understand. He could have injured his face by banging his head against the floor—I’ve seen a woman do that at the Eversfield Asylum before anyone could reach her. And maybe he broke his neck by falling out of bed awkwardly. But I can’t comprehend how both injuries could happen at once. If his back was broken first, he couldn’t have bashed his head; if his face looked like that before he fell, there would surely be marks from it.\" I told him: \"Go to Dr. Van Helsing and ask him to come here immediately. I need him without delay.\" The attendant ran off, and soon Professor Van Helsing appeared, dressed in a robe and slippers. When he saw Renfield on the floor, he examined him closely, then looked at me. I think he understood what I was thinking, so he quietly said—most likely for the attendant to hear: \"Such a terrible accident! He will need vigilant care and attention. I will stay with you, but let me get dressed first. If you stay with him, I’ll join you in a few minutes.\" Renfield was now breathing heavily and it was clear he had sustained severe trauma. Van Helsing soon returned, moving quickly and carrying his surgical kit. He seemed ready, thinking quickly, and barely glanced at Renfield before whispering to me: \"Send the attendant away. We must be alone with him when he wakes up after surgery.\" I addressed the attendant: \"That will be all for now, Simmons. We’ve done what we can. Please continue your rounds, and let me know at once if anything out of the ordinary occurs anywhere.\" The attendant left, and we began a thorough examination. Though the wounds on his face were not deep, the real damage was a depressed skull fracture extending into the motor area of the brain. The Professor paused and said: \"We must relieve the pressure and return things to as normal as possible; the speed of the swelling shows the terrible extent of the damage. The entire motor area appears affected. The pressure in the brain will rise rapidly, so we must perform trephining immediately or it may be too late.\" As he finished speaking, there was a gentle knock at the door. I opened it to find Arthur and Quincey in the hallway, both in pajamas and slippers. Arthur spoke: \"I heard your man call Dr. Van Helsing and mention an accident. So I woke Quincey—well, he wasn’t really asleep anyway. These days, things are moving too fast and strangely for any of us to sleep well. I’ve been thinking tomorrow night things will change; we’ll need to reflect more than we have. May we come in?\" I nodded and let them enter, then closed the door. Quincey, seeing Renfield’s condition and the blood on the floor, whispered: \"My God, what happened to him? Poor man!\" I briefly explained what happened and said we expected Renfield would regain consciousness for a short while after surgery. Quincey immediately sat on the edge of the bed with Godalming beside him, and the rest of us waited patiently."

I had a horrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsing’s face I gathered that he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come. I dreaded the words that Renfield might speak. I was positively afraid to think; but the conviction of what was coming was on me, as I have read of men who have heard the death-watch. The poor man’s breathing came in uncertain gasps. Each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyes and speak; but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath, and he would relapse into a more fixed insensibility. Inured as I was to sick beds and death, this suspense grew, and grew upon me. I could almost hear the beating of my own heart; and the blood surging through my temples sounded like blows from a hammer. The silence finally became agonising. I looked at my companions, one after another, and saw from their flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal torture. There was a nervous suspense over us all, as though overhead some dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect it.\nAt last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was sinking fast; he might die at any moment. I looked up at the Professor and caught his eyes fixed on mine. His face was sternly set as he spoke:—\n“There is no time to lose. His words may be worth many lives; I have been thinking so, as I stood here. It may be there is a soul at stake! We shall operate just above the ear.”\nWithout another word he made the operation. For a few moments the breathing continued to be stertorous. Then there came a breath so prolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest. Suddenly his eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare. This was continued for a few moments; then it softened into a glad surprise, and from the lips came a sigh of relief. He moved convulsively, and as he did so, said:—\n“I’ll be quiet, Doctor. Tell them to take off the strait-waistcoat. I have had a terrible dream, and it has left me so weak that I cannot move. What’s wrong with my face? it feels all swollen, and it smarts dreadfully.” He tried to turn his head; but even with the effort his eyes seemed to grow glassy again so I gently put it back. ",

My heart was sinking terribly, and I could tell from Van Helsing's expression that he felt some fear or concern about what was coming. I dreaded what Renfield might say. I was truly afraid to think, but the certainty of what was about to happen settled on me, much like how people who have heard the death-watch beetle describe feeling a premonition of death. The poor man's breathing was erratic and labored. Every moment, it seemed he might open his eyes and speak, but then a long, noisy breath would follow, and he would fall back into a deeper state of unconsciousness. Although I was accustomed to sickbeds and death, this period of suspense became increasingly intense. I could almost hear my own heart pounding, and the blood surging through my temples sounded like hammer blows. The silence eventually became agonizing. I looked at my companions, one after another, and saw by their flushed faces and damp foreheads that they were suffering the same torment. We were all under a nervous tension, as if some terrifying bell might suddenly ring loudly above us when we least expected it. Finally, it became clear that the patient was rapidly declining; he could die at any moment. I looked up at the Professor and met his gaze. His face was set sternly as he declared, \"There is no time to waste. His words could be worth many lives; I've been thinking about this while standing here. It may be that a soul is in peril! We will operate just above the ear.\" Without further delay, he performed the surgery. For a brief time, the breathing remained noisy. Then, he took a breath so deep it seemed it would tear his chest open. Suddenly, his eyes opened wide and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare. This lasted for a few moments; then it softened into a look of pleased surprise, and a sigh of relief came from his lips. He moved suddenly, and as he did so, he said, \"I'll be still, Doctor. Tell them to take off the straitjacket. I had a terrible dream, and it has left me so weak I cannot move. What's wrong with my face? It feels all swollen, and it stings terribly.\" He tried to turn his head, but the effort made his eyes appear to glaze over again, so I gently put it back.",

Renfield’s breathing was erratic, and though it sometimes looked as if he was about to regain consciousness, he would instead lapse deeper into unconsciousness. Despite being used to being around the sick and dying, the narrator found the tension nearly unbearable, aware of his own heart pounding and blood rushing in his head. The oppressive silence was torturous, and it was clear from his companions’ faces that everyone felt the same strain. It was as if they were all waiting for some terrible event to suddenly occur. Eventually, it became obvious that Renfield was declining rapidly and could die at any moment. The narrator met Van Helsing’s stern gaze as the professor announced that there was no time to waste and that Renfield’s words might be crucial, perhaps even a matter of saving a soul. He decided to operate just above Renfield’s ear. Van Helsing quickly performed the operation, and for a while Renfield’s breathing remained labored. Then, he drew such a long breath it seemed painful, and suddenly opened his eyes with a wild and helpless look that soon shifted to a look of surprised relief. With a sigh, Renfield moved slightly and said he would behave, asking for his restraints to be removed. He explained he'd had a terrible dream that left him extremely weak and asked about the pain and swelling in his face.

I dreamed”—he stopped and seemed fainting, I called quietly to Quincey—“The brandy—it is in my study—quick!” He flew and returned with a glass, the decanter of brandy and a carafe of water. We moistened the parched lips, and the patient quickly revived. It seemed, however, that his poor injured brain had been working in the interval, for, when he was quite conscious, he looked at me piercingly with an agonised confusion which I shall never forget, and said:—\n“I must not deceive myself; it was no dream, but all a grim reality.” Then his eyes roved round the room; as they caught sight of the two figures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on:—\n“If I were not sure already, I would know from them.” For an instant his eyes closed—not with pain or sleep but voluntarily, as though he were bringing all his faculties to bear; when he opened them he said, hurriedly, and with more energy than he had yet displayed:—\n“Quick, Doctor, quick. I am dying! I feel that I have but a few minutes; and then I must go back to death—or worse! Wet my lips with brandy again. I have something that I must say before I die; or before my poor crushed brain dies anyhow. Thank you! It was that night after you left me, when I implored you to let me go away. I couldn’t speak then, for I felt my tongue was tied; but I was as sane then, except in that way, as I am now. I was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left me; it seemed hours. Then there came a sudden peace to me. My brain seemed to become cool again, and I realised where I was. I heard the dogs bark behind our house, but not where He was!” As he spoke, Van Helsing’s eyes never blinked, but his hand came out and met mine and gripped it hard. He did not, however, betray himself; he nodded slightly and said: “Go on,” in a low voice. Renfield proceeded:—\n“He came up to the window in the mist, as I had seen him often before; but he was solid then—not a ghost, and his eyes were fierce like a man’s when angry. He was laughing with his red mouth; the sharp white teeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the belt of trees, to where the dogs were barking. I wouldn’t ask him to come in at first, though I knew he wanted to—just as he had wanted all along. Then he began promising me things—not in words but by doing them.” He was interrupted by a word from the Professor:—\n“How?”\n“By making them happen; just as he used to send in the flies when the sun was shining. Great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their wings; and big moths, in the night, with skull and cross-bones on their backs.” Van Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously:—\n“The Acherontia Aitetropos of the Sphinges—what you call the ‘Death’s-head Moth’?” The patient went on without stopping.\n“Then he began to whisper: ‘Rats, rats, rats! Hundreds, thousands, millions of them, and every one a life; and dogs to eat them, and cats too. All lives! all red blood, with years of life in it; and not merely buzzing flies!’ I laughed at him, for I wanted to see what he could do. Then the dogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in His house. He beckoned me to the window. I got up and looked out, and He raised his hands, and seemed to call out without using any words. A dark mass spread over the grass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire; and then He moved the mist to the right and left, and I could see that there were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red—like His, only smaller. He held up his hand, and they all stopped; and I thought he seemed to be saying: ‘All these lives will I give you, ay, and many more and greater, through countless ages, if you will fall down and worship me!’ And then a red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close over my eyes; and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself opening the sash and saying to Him: ‘Come in, Lord and Master!’ The rats were all gone, but He slid into the room through the sash, though it was only open an inch wide—just as the Moon herself has often come in through the tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size and splendour.”\nHis voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again, and he continued; but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in the interval for his story was further advanced. I was about to call him back to the point, but Van Helsing whispered to me: “Let him go on. Do not interrupt him; he cannot go back, and maybe could not proceed at all if once he lost the thread of his thought.” He proceeded:—\n“All day I waited to hear from him, but he did not send me anything, not even a blow-fly, and when the moon got up I was pretty angry with him. When he slid in through the window, though it was shut, and did not even knock, I got mad with him. He sneered at me, and his white face looked out of the mist with his red eyes gleaming, and he went on as though he owned the whole place, and I was no one. He didn’t even smell the same as he went by me. I couldn’t hold him. I thought that, somehow, Mrs. Harker had come into the room.”\nThe two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over, standing behind him so that he could not see them, but where they could hear better. They were both silent, but the Professor started and quivered; his face, however, grew grimmer and sterner still. Renfield went on without noticing:—\n“When Mrs. Harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasn’t the same; it was like tea after the teapot had been watered.” Here we all moved, but no one said a word; he went on:—\n“I didn’t know that she was here till she spoke; and she didn’t look the same. I don’t care for the pale people; I like them with lots of blood in them, and hers had all seemed to have run out. I didn’t think of it at the time; but when she went away I began to think, and it made me mad to know that He had been taking the life out of her.” I could feel that the rest quivered, as I did, but we remained otherwise still. “So when He came to-night I was ready for Him. I saw the mist stealing in, and I grabbed it tight. I had heard that madmen have unnatural strength; and as I knew I was a madman—at times anyhow—I resolved to use my power. Ay, and He felt it too, for He had to come out of the mist to struggle with me. I held tight; and I thought I was going to win, for I didn’t mean Him to take any more of her life, till I saw His eyes. They burned into me, and my strength became like water. He slipped through it, and when I tried to cling to Him, He raised me up and flung me down. There was a red cloud before me, and a noise like thunder, and the mist seemed to steal away under the door.” His voice was becoming fainter and his breath more stertorous. Van Helsing stood up instinctively.\n“We know the worst now,” he said. “He is here, and we know his purpose. It may not be too late. Let us be armed—the same as we were the other night, but lose no time; there is not an instant to spare.” There was no need to put our fear, nay our conviction, into words—we shared them in common. We all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that we had when we entered the Count’s house. The Professor had his ready, and as we met in the corridor he pointed to them significantly as he said:—\n“They never leave me; and they shall not till this unhappy business is over. Be wise also, my friends. It is no common enemy that we deal with. Alas! alas! that that dear Madam Mina should suffer!” He stopped; his voice was breaking, and I do not know if rage or terror predominated in my own heart.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Van Helsing then spoke calmly and seriously, asking, \"Please tell us about your dream, Mr. Renfield.\" Hearing Van Helsing's voice brightened Renfield's face despite his injuries. He responded, \"That's Dr. Van Helsing. It's so kind of you to be here. Could I have some water? My lips are dry, and I'll try to tell you. I dreamed—\" He paused, appearing faint. I quietly called to Quincey, \"The brandy—it's in my study—quickly!\" Quincey rushed off and returned with a glass, the brandy decanter, and a water carafe. We wet Renfield's dry lips, and he quickly recovered. However, it seemed his injured mind had been active during the pause, because when he was fully alert, he looked at me intensely with a look of tortured confusion I'll never forget. He said, \"I mustn't deceive myself; it wasn't a dream, but a terrible reality.\" His eyes scanned the room, and seeing the two men patiently sitting on the bed's edge, he continued, \"Even if I wasn't already sure, I would know from them.\" For a moment, he closed his eyes deliberately, not from pain or fatigue, as if gathering his thoughts. When he reopened them, he spoke rapidly with more energy than before: \"Hurry, Doctor, hurry. I'm dying! I feel I only have a few minutes left; then I must return to death—or worse! Wet my lips with brandy again. I have something I must say before I die, or before my poor, damaged brain gives out. Thank you! It happened that night after you left, when I begged you to let me go. I couldn't speak then, as my tongue felt paralyzed; but in every other way, I was as lucid as I am now. I was in terrible anguish for a long time after you left; it felt like hours. Then, a sudden calm came over me. My mind seemed to cool down, and I understood where I was. I heard the dogs barking behind our house, but not near where He was!\" As he spoke, Van Helsing watched intently, his hand reaching out to grip mine firmly. He didn't reveal his emotions, however, simply nodding slightly and murmuring, \"Go on.\" Renfield continued: \"He approached the window in the mist, as I'd seen him do many times before; but this time he was solid—not a phantom—and his eyes were fierce, like an angry man's. He was laughing with his red mouth; his sharp white teeth gleamed in the moonlight when he glanced back over the trees towards the barking dogs. I didn't invite him in at first, even though I knew he wanted to—just as he had always wanted. Then he started promising me things—not with words, but by making them happen.\" The Professor interrupted with a question: \"How?\" \"By causing them to appear; just like he used to send the flies in when the sun was out. Huge, fat ones with shimmering wings like steel and sapphire; and large moths at night, with skull and crossbones markings.\" Van Helsing nodded to him, whispering to me almost without thinking, \"The Acherontia Atropos of the Sphinges—what you call the 'Death's-head Moth'?\" The patient went on without pause. \"Then he began to whisper: 'Rats, rats, rats! Hundreds, thousands, millions of them, each one a life; and dogs to eat them, and cats too. All lives! All rich blood, with years of life in it; not just buzzing flies!' I laughed at him, wanting to see what he could do. Then the dogs howled, far off among the dark trees at His house. He motioned me towards the window. I got up and looked out, and He raised his hands, seeming to call out without speaking. A dark mass spread across the grass, moving like a sheet of fire; then He cleared the mist to the sides, and I could see thousands of rats with blazing red eyes—like His, but smaller. He held up his hand, and they all stopped; and I thought He seemed to be saying: 'All these lives I will give you, yes, and many more and greater, throughout endless ages, if you will bow down and worship me!' And then a red mist, the color of blood, seemed to cover my eyes; and before I realized what I was doing, I found myself opening the window sash and saying to Him: 'Come in, Lord and Master!' The rats were gone, but He glided into the room through the sash, even though it was only open an inch—just like the Moon herself has often come in through the smallest crack and stood before me in all her full size and glory.\" His voice weakened, so I again moistened his lips with brandy, and he continued; but it seemed his memory had advanced further during the pause, as his story was ahead. I was about to guide him back to the earlier point, but Van Helsing whispered to me: \"Let him speak. Don't interrupt; he can't go back, and might lose his train of thought completely if he stops.\" He proceeded: \"All day I waited to hear from him, but he sent nothing, not even a blow-fly, and by the time the moon rose, I was quite angry. When he slid in through the window, which was closed, and didn't even knock, I became furious with him. He sneered at me, his pale face emerging from the mist with gleaming red eyes, and he acted as if he owned everything and I was nobody. He didn't even smell the same as he passed me. I couldn't hold him. I thought, somehow, Mrs. Harker had entered the room.\" The two men sitting on the bed stood up and moved behind him, where he couldn't see them but could hear better. They were both silent, but the Professor was visibly startled and trembled; his face, however, became even harder and sterner. Renfield continued without noticing: \"When Mrs. Harker visited me this afternoon, she wasn't herself; it was like tea after the pot had been watered down.\" At this, we all reacted slightly, but remained silent. He went on: \"I didn't realize she was there until she spoke; and she didn't look right. I don't like pale people; I like them with lots of blood in them, and hers seemed to have all drained away. I didn't think about it at the time; but after she left, I started thinking, and it drove me mad to know that He had been stealing her life force.\" I could feel the others shudder, just as I did, but we otherwise stayed still. \"So when He came tonight, I was ready for Him. I saw the mist creeping in, and I grabbed hold of it tightly. I had heard that madmen possess unnatural strength; and since I knew I was a madman—at times, anyway—I decided to use my power. And He felt it, too, because He had to emerge from the mist to struggle with me. I held on tight; and I thought I was going to win, because I wouldn't let Him take any more of her life, until I saw His eyes. They burned into me, and my strength vanished. He slipped through my grasp, and when I tried to cling to Him, He lifted me up and threw me down. A red haze appeared before me, and a sound like thunder, and the mist seemed to escape under the door.\" His voice grew weaker, his breathing becoming heavy and ragged. Van Helsing instinctively stood up. \"We know the worst now,\" he said. \"He is here, and we know his goal. It might not be too late. Let's arm ourselves—just like we did the other night, but without delay; there's not a moment to lose.\" There was no need for us to voice our fear, or rather our certainty—we all felt it. We quickly went to our rooms and gathered the same items we had taken when we entered the Count's house. The Professor already had his ready, and as we met in the corridor, he pointed to them meaningfully, saying: \"They are always with me; and they will remain so until this dreadful business is finished. Be prepared, my friends. This is no ordinary enemy we face. Oh dear! Oh dear! That dear Madam Mina should have to suffer like this!\" He stopped, his voice breaking, and I couldn't tell if rage or fear was stronger in my own heart.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Van Helsing, in a serious and calm voice, asked Renfield to tell them about his dream. Upon hearing Van Helsing, Renfield’s expression brightened despite his injuries, and he recognized the Doctor, thanking him for coming. He asked for water because of his dry lips and attempted to recount his experience, but became weak and nearly fainted. I told Quincey to quickly fetch some brandy from my study, which he did, bringing both brandy and water. After wetting Renfield’s lips, he revived, but it seemed his damaged mind was racing. Once fully conscious, he looked at me desperately and said he couldn’t pretend it was only a dream; it was all terrifying reality. He glanced around and saw the two others sitting at the bedside, using their presence to confirm his story to himself. Briefly, he closed his eyes as if gathering strength, then spoke with newfound energy, urging us to listen quickly as he felt he was dying and had only moments to speak, so he asked for more brandy to wet his lips. He recalled the night after we had left, when he had begged to be set free—though unable to speak at the time, his mind had been clear. He described feeling despair for hours after we left, but then a sudden calm filled his mind, and he became aware of his surroundings. He heard dogs barking behind the house, though not where ‘He’ was. Van Helsing listened intently, squeezing my hand for support, silently encouraging Renfield to continue.\n\nRenfield said that ‘He’ (Dracula) came to his window in the mist, appearing more solid than before, with fierce, angry eyes and a red, laughing mouth. Dracula’s sharp teeth glinted in the moonlight as he looked back toward the barking dogs. Renfield resisted inviting him inside, still knowing Dracula wanted in, and Dracula began to tempt him—not with words, but through actions. Professor Van Helsing interrupted to ask how, and Renfield explained that Dracula made things happen, like sending flies and moths with unusual markings into his room. Van Helsing quietly identified the ‘Death’s-head Moth,’ but Renfield continued, describing how Dracula whispered promises of countless lives—rats, dogs, cats—each representing an opportunity for blood. Renfield mocked Dracula, wanting to see what he would do. Then, the dogs howled further away, and Dracula beckoned Renfield to the window. Renfield looked out, saw Dracula call forth a mass of rats with red, glowing eyes, and understood Dracula’s promise: unlimited life in exchange for loyalty. Overwhelmed, Renfield found himself opening the window and inviting Dracula in. The rats disappeared, and Dracula entered through a narrow opening, describing his entrance as effortless as moonlight.\n\nRenfield’s voice weakened, so we gave him more brandy. He continued, his memory now jumping ahead. I wanted to bring him back to his earlier point, but Van Helsing advised me to let him continue uninterrupted. Renfield went on, saying he waited all day for something from Dracula—no flies or anything else—but later, when the moon rose, he grew angry at Dracula. When Dracula entered that night without even knocking, Renfield was furious, describing Dracula’s ominous presence and unrecognizable smell. Renfield felt powerless to stop him and thought Mrs. Harker had entered the room. The two men at the bedside stood to listen more closely, while Van Helsing grew more serious. Unaware, Renfield explained that Mrs. Harker had seemed different that afternoon—like weak tea. None of us spoke, but the description unsettled us.\n\nRenfield realized only later that something had changed in Mrs. Harker, and he became enraged at Dracula for draining her life. When Dracula returned that night, Renfield resolved to use his madman’s strength to stop him, holding onto the invading mist. Dracula was forced to emerge fully, and they struggled, but Dracula’s eyes overpowered Renfield, leaving him weak. Dracula threw him down, and Renfield’s senses faded amid a rush of sound and clouded vision. As Renfield’s breathing worsened, Van Helsing stood and declared that they had learned the worst—Dracula was present, and his intentions were clear. Van Helsing urged the group to arm themselves immediately as before, no time to waste, and everyone silently prepared, united in fear and determination. Meeting in the hallway, Van Helsing displayed his weapons, warning them this was no ordinary adversary, expressing remorse for Mina’s suffering as his own voice wavered with emotion."

On the bed beside the window lay Jonathan Harker, his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor. Kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white-clad figure of his wife. By her side stood a tall, thin man, clad in black. His face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognised the Count—in every way, even to the scar on his forehead. With his left hand he held both Mrs. Harker’s hands, keeping them away with her arms at full tension; his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck, forcing her face down on his bosom. Her white nightdress was smeared with blood, and a thin stream trickled down the man’s bare breast which was shown by his torn-open dress. The attitude of the two had a terrible resemblance to a child forcing a kitten’s nose into a saucer of milk to compel it to drink. As we burst into the room, the Count turned his face, and the hellish look that I had heard described seemed to leap into it. His eyes flamed red with devilish passion; the great nostrils of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge; and the white sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood-dripping mouth, champed together like those of a wild beast. With a wrench, which threw his victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, he turned and sprang at us. But by this time the Professor had gained his feet, and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred Wafer. The Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outside the tomb, and cowered back. Further and further back he cowered, as we, lifting our crucifixes, advanced. The moonlight suddenly failed, as a great black cloud sailed across the sky; and when the gaslight sprang up under Quincey’s match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour. This, as we looked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its bursting open, had swung back to its old position. Van Helsing, Art, and I moved forward to Mrs. Harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and with it had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that it seems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day. For a few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray. Her face was ghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared her lips and cheeks and chin; from her throat trickled a thin stream of blood; her eyes were mad with terror. Then she put before her face her poor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the Count’s terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wail which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an endless grief. Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently over her body, whilst Art, after looking at her face for an instant despairingly, ran out of the room. Van Helsing whispered to me:—\n“Jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the Vampire can produce.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "My hair felt like it bristled on my neck, and my heart seemed to pause. The moonlight was so bright it illuminated the room enough to see clearly through the thick yellow blind. Jonathan Harker lay on the bed near the window, his face red and breathing heavily as though in a trance. Kneeling on the side of the bed closest to us, facing outwards, was his wife, dressed in white. Standing next to her was a tall, slender man clothed in black. His face was turned away, but the moment we saw him, we all recognized the Count – undeniably him, even the scar on his forehead was visible. With his left hand, he held both of Mrs. Harker’s hands extended, keeping her arms taut; his right hand gripped the back of her neck, forcing her face down against his chest. Her white nightgown was stained with blood, and a thin stream ran down the man’s bare chest, revealed by his torn clothing. The way the two were positioned bore a terrible resemblance to a child forcing a kitten's nose into a saucer of milk. As we burst into the room, the Count turned his face, and the horrifying look I had heard described seemed to leap into it. His eyes burned red with a devilish fury; the large nostrils of his pale, aquiline nose widened and trembled at the edges; and his sharp white teeth, behind the full lips of his blood-stained mouth, gnashed together like those of a wild animal. With a violent movement that hurled his victim back onto the bed as if thrown from a height, he turned and lunged at us. However, the Professor had managed to get on his feet and was holding towards him the envelope containing the Sacred Wafer. The Count stopped abruptly, just as poor Lucy had done outside her tomb, and recoiled. He cowered back further and further as we advanced, raising our crucifixes. The moonlight suddenly disappeared as a large black cloud drifted across the sky; and when Quincey struck a match and the gaslight came on, we saw nothing but a faint vapor. This vapor, as we watched, trailed under the door, which had swung back to its original position after being forced open. Van Helsing, Art, and I moved forward to Mrs. Harker, who by this time had gasped and let out a scream so wild, so piercing, so utterly despairing that I believe it will echo in my ears until I die. For a few seconds, she remained in her helpless and disheveled state. Her face was deathly pale, a pallor intensified by the blood smeared on her lips, cheeks, and chin; a thin stream of blood dripped from her throat; her eyes were wild with terror. Then she brought her poor, crushed hands before her face, hands whose whiteness was marked by the red print of the Count’s terrible grip, and from behind them came a low, mournful wail that made the awful scream seem like only the initial sound of endless grief. Van Helsing stepped forward and gently pulled the coverlet over her, while Art, after looking at her face in despair for a moment, ran out of the room. Van Helsing whispered to me, “Jonathan is in the kind of trance we know the Vampire can create.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "A chill ran down my spine, my hair standing on end and my heart seeming to stop. The moonlight was so strong that, even through the thick yellow blinds, the room was well lit. Jonathan Harker lay on the bed near the window, his face flushed and his breathing heavy, as if he were in a trance. His wife, dressed in white, knelt at the edge of the bed facing outward. Beside her stood a tall, thin man in black. Though his face was turned away, we all instantly recognized the Count, noted even by the scar on his forehead. He grasped Mrs. Harker's hands in his left, holding her arms taut and away, while his right hand clutched her neck, forcing her head down against his chest. Her nightdress was stained with blood, and a thin line of blood ran down the Count's exposed chest. The scene looked horribly like a child pushing a kitten's nose into milk, forcing it to drink. As we rushed in, the Count turned to face us, his expression transforming into one of evil as described before. His eyes glowed red with a fiendish passion, his nostrils flared and trembled, and his sharp white teeth snapped together like those of a wild animal. With a violent movement, he tossed Mrs. Harker back onto the bed and lunged at us. But the Professor, now standing, held out the envelope containing the Sacred Wafer. The Count halted abruptly, cowering away just as Lucy had outside her tomb. He recoiled further as we advanced with our crucifixes. Just then, a large dark cloud covered the moonlight, and as Quincey struck a match to light the gas, only a faint mist remained. This mist slipped under the door as it swung back to its place after being burst open. Van Helsing, Art, and I approached Mrs. Harker, who was now breathing and had emitted a scream so piercing and hopeless that I feel it still haunts me. For a few moments she lay helpless and disheveled, her face deathly pale except where blood smeared her lips, cheeks, and chin. Blood trickled from her throat, and terror filled her eyes. She shielded her face with her bruised hands, marked red by the Count's grip, and behind them let out a low, sorrowful wail—making her scream seem only an outburst of endless grief. Gently, Van Helsing covered her with the bedspread, while Art, after glancing at her despairingly, hurried from the room. Van Helsing whispered to me that Jonathan was in a stupor induced by the Vampire."

I raised the blind, and looked out of the window. There was much moonshine; and as I looked I could see Quincey Morris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great yew-tree. It puzzled me to think why he was doing this; but at the instant I heard Harker’s quick exclamation as he woke to partial consciousness, and turned to the bed. On his face, as there might well be, was a look of wild amazement. He seemed dazed for a few seconds, and then full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once, and he started up. His wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned to him with her arms stretched out, as though to embrace him; instantly, however, she drew them in again, and putting her elbows together, held her hands before her face, and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook.\n“In God’s name what does this mean?” Harker cried out. “Dr. Seward, Dr. Van Helsing, what is it? What has happened? What is wrong? Mina, dear, what is it? What does that blood mean? My God, my God! has it come to this!” and, raising himself to his knees, he beat his hands wildly together. “Good God help us! help her! oh, help her!” With a quick movement he jumped from bed, and began to pull on his clothes,—all the man in him awake at the need for instant exertion. “What has happened? Tell me all about it!” he cried without pausing. “Dr. Van Helsing, you love Mina, I know. Oh, do something to save her. It cannot have gone too far yet. Guard her while I look for him!” His wife, through her terror and horror and distress, saw some sure danger to him: instantly forgetting her own grief, she seized hold of him and cried out:—\n“No! no! Jonathan, you must not leave me. I have suffered enough to-night, God knows, without the dread of his harming you. You must stay with me. Stay with these friends who will watch over you!” Her expression became frantic as she spoke; and, he yielding to her, she pulled him down sitting on the bed side, and clung to him fiercely.\nVan Helsing and I tried to calm them both. The Professor held up his little golden crucifix, and said with wonderful calmness:—\n“Do not fear, my dear. We are here; and whilst this is close to you no foul thing can approach. You are safe for to-night; and we must be calm and take counsel together.” She shuddered and was silent, holding down her head on her husband’s breast.

I lifted the window blind and looked outside. The moon was bright; and as I observed, I saw Quincey Morris run quickly across the lawn and hide in the shade of a large yew tree. It puzzled me why he was doing this; but at that moment, I heard Harker's sudden cry as he awoke partially, and I turned to the bed. On his face, as might be expected, was a look of wild surprise. He seemed disoriented for a few seconds, and then full awareness seemed to strike him suddenly, causing him to sit up. His wife was stirred by the rapid movement and turned towards him with outstretched arms, as if to embrace him; immediately, however, she pulled them back in, placing her elbows together, holding her hands before her face, and trembling so violently that the bed beneath her shook. “In God’s name, what is the meaning of this?” Harker exclaimed. “Dr. Seward, Dr. Van Helsing, what is happening? What is wrong? Mina, darling, what is it? What does that blood signify? My God, my God! Has it come to this!” and, rising to his knees, he frantically clasped his hands together. “May God help us! help her! oh, help her!” With a swift movement, he leaped from the bed and began putting on his clothes—all the strength within him roused by the necessity for immediate action. “What has occurred? Tell me everything!” he demanded without stopping. “Dr. Van Helsing, I know you love Mina. Oh, please do something to save her. It cannot have advanced too far yet. Protect her while I search for him!” His wife, despite her terror, horror, and suffering, perceived a definite danger to him: instantly forgetting her own pain, she grabbed him and cried out:— “No! no! Jonathan, you must not leave me. I have suffered enough tonight, God knows, without the fear of him harming you. You must stay with me. Remain with these friends who will watch over you!” Her face became frantic as she spoke; and, with him giving in, she pulled him down to sit on the side of the bed, clinging to him fiercely. Van Helsing and I attempted to calm them both. The Professor held up his small golden crucifix and said with remarkable tranquility:— “Do not be afraid, my dear. We are here; and as long as this is near you, no evil thing can approach. You are safe for tonight; and we must be calm and plan together.” She shivered and became silent, resting her head on her husband’s chest.

The moon was bright, and I saw Quincey Morris dash across the lawn to conceal himself in the shadow of a large yew tree. I was confused as to why he did this; but just then, I heard Harker make a startled sound as he regained partial consciousness, prompting me to turn back toward the bed. His face showed utter bewilderment. For a few moments, he was confused, but then he became completely awake and suddenly sat up. Mina, stirred by his abrupt movement, reached toward him as if to hug him, then quickly recoiled, covering her face with her hands, trembling so much that the bed shook.\n\n\"For God's sake, what does this mean?\" Harker cried out. \"Dr. Seward, Dr. Van Helsing, what's happening?

I would not hear it of you; and I shall not hear it from you. May God judge me by my deserts, and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour, if by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us!” He put out his arms and folded her to his breast; and for a while she lay there sobbing. He looked at us over her bowed head, with eyes that blinked damply above his quivering nostrils; his mouth was set as steel. After a while her sobs became less frequent and more faint, and then he said to me, speaking with a studied calmness which I felt tried his nervous power to the utmost:—\n“And now, Dr. Seward, tell me all about it. Too well I know the broad fact; tell me all that has been.” I told him exactly what had happened, and he listened with seeming impassiveness; but his nostrils twitched and his eyes blazed as I told how the ruthless hands of the Count had held his wife in that terrible and horrid position, with her mouth to the open wound in his breast. It interested me, even at that moment, to see, that, whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over the bowed head, the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled hair. Just as I had finished, Quincey and Godalming knocked at the door. They entered in obedience to our summons. Van Helsing looked at me questioningly. I understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of their coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband and wife from each other and from themselves; so on nodding acquiescence to him he asked them what they had seen or done. To which Lord Godalming answered:—\n“I could not see him anywhere in the passage, or in any of our rooms. I looked in the study but, though he had been there, he had gone. He had, however——” He stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping figure on the bed. Van Helsing said gravely:—\n“Go on, friend Arthur. We want here no more concealments. Our hope now is in knowing all. Tell freely!” So Art went on:—\n“He had been there, and though it could only have been for a few seconds, he made rare hay of the place. All the manuscript had been burned, and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes; the cylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and the wax had helped the flames.” Here I interrupted. “Thank God there is the other copy in the safe!” His face lit for a moment, but fell again as he went on: “I ran downstairs then, but could see no sign of him. I looked into Renfield’s room; but there was no trace there except——!” Again he paused. “Go on,” said Harker hoarsely; so he bowed his head and moistening his lips with his tongue, added: “except that the poor fellow is dead.” Mrs. Harker raised her head, looking from one to the other of us she said solemnly:—\n“God’s will be done!” I could not but feel that Art was keeping back something; but, as I took it that it was with a purpose, I said nothing. Van Helsing turned to Morris and asked:—\n“And you, friend Quincey, have you any to tell?”\n“A little,” he answered. “It may be much eventually, but at present I can’t say. I thought it well to know if possible where the Count would go when he left the house. I did not see him; but I saw a bat rise from Renfield’s window, and flap westward. I expected to see him in some shape go back to Carfax; but he evidently sought some other lair. He will not be back to-night; for the sky is reddening in the east, and the dawn is close. We must work to-morrow!”\nHe said the latter words through his shut teeth.",

I must never touch him or kiss him again. Oh, how terrible that I have become his worst enemy, the person he has the most reason to fear.\" Jonathan responded firmly to this, \"Nonsense, Mina. I am ashamed to hear you use that word. I would never apply it to you, and I forbid you to apply it to yourself. May God judge me by my actions and punish me with suffering even worse than this if anything I ever do or intend comes between us!\" He extended his arms and held her close to his chest; she lay there weeping for some time. He looked over her bent head at the rest of us, his eyes moist and blinking above his trembling nostrils, his jaw set like steel. After a while, her sobs became less frequent and softer, and then he spoke to me with a carefully controlled calmness that I could tell strained his composure to the absolute limit: \"And now, Dr. Seward, tell me everything. I know the main fact all too well; tell me all that has transpired.\" I recounted exactly what had happened, and he listened with an appearance of indifference, but his nostrils twitched and his eyes blazed as I described how the Count's cruel hands had forced his wife into that dreadful and awful position, her mouth pressed against the open wound in his chest. It struck me, even at that moment, to see how, while his face distorted with pale, rigid emotion over her bowed head, his hands gently and lovingly stroked her dishevelled hair. Just as I finished, Quincey and Godalming knocked and entered at our call. Van Helsing looked at me questioningly. I understood him to be asking if we should use their arrival as an opportunity to try and distract the unhappy husband and wife from each other and from their own thoughts. I nodded in agreement, so he asked them what they had seen or done. Lord Godalming replied, \"I couldn't see him anywhere in the passage or in any of our rooms. I checked the study, but although he had been there, he was gone. He had, however—\" He stopped abruptly, looking at the poor, slumped figure on the bed. Van Helsing said gravely, \"Please continue, dear Arthur. We need no more secrets here. Our hope now lies in knowing everything. Speak openly!\" So Art went on, \"He had been there, and though it could only have been for a few seconds, he created significant chaos in the place. All the manuscript had been burned, and blue flames flickered among the white ashes; your phonograph cylinders were also thrown into the fire, and the wax helped fuel the flames.\" I interrupted here. \"Thank God there is the other copy in the safe!\" His face briefly brightened but fell again as he continued, \"I then ran downstairs but saw no sign of him. I looked into Renfield's room; but there was no trace there except—!\" Again, he paused. \"Go on,\" Harker said hoarsely; so Arthur lowered his head, moistened his lips with his tongue, and added, \"except that the poor fellow is dead.\" Mrs. Harker raised her head, looking from one of us to another, and said solemnly, \"God's will be done!\" I couldn't help feeling that Arthur was omitting something, but assuming it was deliberate, I said nothing. Van Helsing turned to Morris and asked, \"And you, friend Quincey, do you have anything to report?\" \"A little,\" he answered. \"It might turn out to be important, but at the moment, I can't say for sure. I thought it would be useful to try and find out where the Count would go after leaving the house. I didn't see him myself, but I saw a bat emerge from Renfield's window and fly westward. I expected him to transform and return to Carfax, but he clearly sought a different refuge. He won't be back tonight, as the eastern sky is reddening, and dawn is close. We must resume our work tomorrow!\" He spoke these last words through clenched teeth.",

I refuse to listen to such talk from you. May God judge me fairly and punish me even more severely than I am now if I ever let anything come between us by my own actions or will!\" He embraced her, and she cried in his arms for a time. Looking at us over her head, his eyes were full of tears and his nostrils trembled, though his mouth was set hard. Gradually, her weeping lessened. Then, steadying himself, he said to me: \"Now, Dr. Seward, tell me everything about what has happened. I know the basics, but I want the full story.\" I recounted the events, and he listened apparently unmoved, though his nostrils flared and his eyes flashed when I described how the Count forced his wife to drink from the wound in his chest. Even then, I noticed how, despite his face contorting with emotion, his hands gently stroked her hair. As I finished, there was a knock; Quincey and Godalming entered at our request. Van Helsing looked at me, silently asking if we should use their presence to distract the sorrowful couple, and I nodded. He then asked what they had discovered. Lord Godalming answered: \"I couldn't find him anywhere in the halls or rooms. I checked the study; he had been there, but left. However—\" He stopped, glancing at the grieving figure on the bed. Van Helsing prompted him: \"Continue, Arthur. We must have no secrets now. Hope lies in knowing everything. Speak freely!\" Arthur continued: \"He was there only a short time but made havoc. All the manuscripts have been burned; blue flames flickered in the ashes, and your phonograph cylinders were thrown into the fire, their wax feeding the flames.\" I interjected, relieved: \"Thank God the other copy is in the safe!\" Arthur looked briefly hopeful, then said, \"I ran downstairs but saw no sign of him. I checked Renfield’s room, and...\" He hesitated. Harker urged him to continue, so he added, \"the poor fellow is dead.\" Mrs. Harker looked at all of us and said solemnly, \"God’s will be done!\" I sensed Arthur was withholding something, but presumed it was intentional and said nothing. Van Helsing then turned to Quincey: \"And you, Quincey, do you have anything to report?\" \"A little,\" Quincey replied. \"It could be important later, but I can't say yet. I tried to see where the Count would go after leaving. I didn't see him, but I watched a bat fly from Renfield’s window and head west. I thought he might return to Carfax, but it seems he chose a different refuge. He won’t return tonight, as dawn is near. We'll have to act tomorrow!\" he finished, voice tense."

God knows that I do not want that you be pained; but it is need that we know all. For now more than ever has all work to be done quick and sharp, and in deadly earnest. The day is close to us that must end all, if it may be so; and now is the chance that we may live and learn.”\nThe poor, dear lady shivered, and I could see the tension of her nerves as she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower and lower still on his breast. Then she raised her head proudly, and held out one hand to Van Helsing who took it in his, and, after stooping and kissing it reverently, held it fast. The other hand was locked in that of her husband, who held his other arm thrown round her protectingly. After a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts, she began:—\n“I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but for a long time it did not act. I seemed to become more wakeful, and myriads of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind—all of them connected with death, and vampires; with blood, and pain, and trouble.” Her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said lovingly: “Do not fret, dear. You must be brave and strong, and help me through the horrible task. If you only knew what an effort it is to me to tell of this fearful thing at all, you would understand how much I need your help. Well, I saw I must try to help the medicine to its work with my will, if it was to do me any good, so I resolutely set myself to sleep. Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for I remember no more. Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for he lay by my side when next I remember. There was in the room the same thin white mist that I had before noticed. But I forget now if you know of this; you will find it in my diary which I shall show you later. I felt the same vague terror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence. I turned to wake Jonathan, but found that he slept so soundly that it seemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught, and not I. I tried, but I could not wake him. This caused me a great fear, and I looked around terrified. Then indeed, my heart sank within me: beside the bed, as if he had stepped out of the mist—or rather as if the mist had turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared—stood a tall, thin man, all in black. I knew him at once from the description of the others. The waxen face; the high aquiline nose, on which the light fell in a thin white line; the parted red lips, with the sharp white teeth showing between; and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in the sunset on the windows of St. Mary’s Church at Whitby. I knew, too, the red scar on his forehead where Jonathan had struck him. For an instant my heart stood still, and I would have screamed out, only that I was paralysed. In the pause he spoke in a sort of keen, cutting whisper, pointing as he spoke to Jonathan:—\n“‘Silence! If you make a sound I shall take him and dash his brains out before your very eyes.’ I was appalled and was too bewildered to do or say anything. With a mocking smile, he placed one hand upon my shoulder and, holding me tight, bared my throat with the other, saying as he did so, ‘First, a little refreshment to reward my exertions. You may as well be quiet; it is not the first time, or the second, that your veins have appeased my thirst!’ I was bewildered, and, strangely enough, I did not want to hinder him. I suppose it is a part of the horrible curse that such is, when his touch is on his victim. And oh, my God, my God, pity me! He placed his reeking lips upon my throat!” Her husband groaned again. She clasped his hand harder, and looked at him pityingly, as if he were the injured one, and went on:—\n“I felt my strength fading away, and I was in a half swoon. How long this horrible thing lasted I know not; but it seemed that a long time must have passed before he took his foul, awful, sneering mouth away. I saw it drip with the fresh blood!” The remembrance seemed for a while to overpower her, and she drooped and would have sunk down but for her husband’s sustaining arm. With a great effort she recovered herself and went on:—\n“Then he spoke to me mockingly, ‘And so you, like the others, would play your brains against mine. You would help these men to hunt me and frustrate me in my designs! You know now, and they know in part already, and will know in full before long, what it is to cross my path. They should have kept their energies for use closer to home. Whilst they played wits against me—against me who commanded nations, and intrigued for them, and fought for them, hundreds of years before they were born—I was countermining them. And you, their best beloved one, are now to me, flesh of my flesh; blood of my blood; kin of my kin; my bountiful wine-press for a while; and shall be later on my companion and my helper. You shall be avenged in turn; for not one of them but shall minister to your needs. But as yet you are to be punished for what you have done. You have aided in thwarting me; now you shall come to my call. When my brain says “Come!” to you, you shall cross land or sea to do my bidding; and to that end this!’ With that he pulled open his shirt, and with his long sharp nails opened a vein in his breast. When the blood began to spurt out, he took my hands in one of his, holding them tight, and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth to the wound, so that I must either suffocate or swallow some of the—— Oh my God! my God! what have I done? What have I done to deserve such a fate, I who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my days. God pity me! Look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril; and in mercy pity those to whom she is dear!”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "For what seemed like a couple of silent minutes, I thought I could hear our hearts pounding. Then Van Helsing spoke, gently placing his hand on Mrs. Harker's head:\n\"Now, Madam Mina—my poor, dear, dear Madam Mina—please tell us precisely what occurred. God knows I don't wish to cause you pain, but it is essential that we know everything. For now, more than ever, our work must be swift, decisive, and utterly serious. The day is drawing near that must bring this to an end, if it is to be so; and now is our opportunity to survive and learn.\"\nThe poor lady shivered visibly, and I could see the tension in her nerves as she held her husband closer and lowered her head further and further onto his chest. Then she lifted her head with dignity, offering a hand to Van Helsing, who clasped it in his, bent down, respectfully kissed it, and held it firmly. Her other hand remained intertwined with her husband's, who kept his arm wrapped protectively around her. After a pause during which she was clearly collecting her thoughts, she began:\n\"I took the sleeping medicine you had so kindly given me, but it didn't work for a long time. I seemed to become more alert, and countless dreadful thoughts began to invade my mind—all connected to death, and vampires; to blood, and suffering, and hardship.\" Her husband groaned unintentionally as she turned to him and said lovingly: \"Don't worry, dear. You must be brave and strong, and help me through this terrible ordeal. If only you knew what a struggle it is for me even to speak of this dreadful thing, you would understand how much I need your support. Well, I saw I had to try to will myself to sleep to help the medicine work, if it was going to do me any good, so I determinedly tried to fall asleep. As expected, sleep must have arrived quickly, for I remember nothing more. Jonathan coming in hadn't woken me, as he was next to me when I next became aware. The same thin white mist I had noticed before was in the room. But I'm unsure now if you are aware of this; you will find it in my diary which I shall show you later. I felt the same undefined dread I had felt before and the same feeling of a presence being near. I attempted to wake Jonathan, but found that he was in such a deep sleep that it appeared as though he had taken the sedative, not I. I tried, but I couldn't wake him. This greatly frightened me, and I looked around in terror. Then, indeed, I was utterly dismayed: next to the bed, as though he had emerged from the mist—or rather, as if the mist had turned into his figure, for it had vanished completely—was standing a tall, lanky man, all in black. I recognized him immediately based on the others' accounts. The pale, waxy face; the prominent hooked nose, highlighted by the light; the separated red lips, revealing sharp white teeth between them; and the crimson eyes I had seemed to witness in the sunset on the windows of St. Mary's Church at Whitby. I knew, too, the red mark on his forehead where Jonathan had injured him. For a moment my heart paused, and I would have screamed, but I was frozen. In that moment he uttered in a sharp, piercing whisper, gesturing towards Jonathan as he spoke:\n'Silence! If you utter a noise, I shall seize him and smash his head in front of you.' I was horrified and too confused to react in any way. With a sneering grin, he put a hand on my shoulder and, gripping me firmly, exposed my throat with his free hand, remarking as he did this, 'Firstly, a small drink to compensate my efforts. You might as well remain silent; it is not the first time, or the second, that your blood has satisfied my craving!' I was bewildered, and, oddly enough, I felt no desire to resist him. I assume this is part of the terrible curse that affects his victims when he touches them. And oh, God, God, have mercy on me! He placed his foul-smelling lips upon my throat!\" Her husband groaned once more. She squeezed his hand tighter and gazed at him with compassion, as though he was the one who had suffered, and continued:\n\"I felt my energy draining, and I was in a semi-conscious state. I do not know how long this dreadful event continued, but it felt like a considerable time had gone by before he removed his disgusting, terrifying, contemptuous mouth. I saw fresh blood dripping from it!\" The memory seemed to overwhelm her for a moment, and she sagged and would have fallen if not for her husband's supporting arm. With significant effort, she regained her composure and went on:\n\"Then he spoke to me mockingly, 'And so you, like the others, would try to match your intellect against mine. You would assist these individuals in pursuing me and disrupting my plans! You understand now, and they already partially understand and will soon fully grasp, the consequences of opposing me. They should have focused their efforts on matters nearer to them. While they tried to outsmart me—against me who ruled nations, engaged in complex schemes for them, and fought their battles centuries before their birth—I was secretly undermining them. And you, their most cherished person, now belong to me, part of my being; connected to me; a rich source of nourishment for a time; and will later become my partner and assistant. You will in turn be avenged, for every one of them shall cater to your requirements. But for now, you must be penalized for your actions. You have helped hinder me; now you will respond when I summon you. When I command you, you shall travel over land or sea to follow my orders; and this is how I ensure it!' With that, he tore open his shirt, and used his long, sharp fingernails to cut open a vein in his chest. As the blood started to flow forcefully, he clutched my hands tightly in one of his, and with his free hand, gripped my neck and forced my mouth onto the injury, leaving me with no choice but to either choke or ingest some of the—oh God! God! what horror! What did I do to earn such a destiny, I who have strived to live humbly and virtuously my entire life. God have mercy on me! Look upon a wretched soul facing danger worse than death; and in your mercy, pity those who care for her!\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "For a couple of minutes, everyone was silent, and it seemed as though I could hear the beating of our hearts. Then Van Helsing gently placed his hand on Mrs. Harker’s head and said, “Now, Madam Mina—dear Madam Mina—please tell us exactly what happened. I hate to cause you pain, but we must know everything. Our work must now be urgent and earnest, for the decisive day is near upon us; this is our moment to act and learn.”\n\nMrs. Harker shivered, her nerves visibly strained, as she held her husband tightly and bowed her head on his chest. But then, gathering herself, she raised her head with dignity and gave her hand to Van Helsing, who kissed it respectfully and held it, while her other hand clung to her husband’s. After a pause to collect her thoughts, she started her story:\n\n“I took the sleeping draught you kindly gave me, but it didn’t work for a long time. Instead, I became more awake, and disturbing thoughts of death, vampires, blood, pain, and turmoil crowded my mind.” Her husband groaned as she turned to comfort him: “Don’t worry, dear. Be strong for me during this ordeal. If you knew how hard it is for me to speak of this horror, you would see how much I need your support. I realized I must help the medicine work, so I forced myself to try to sleep. I must have eventually succeeded, for I remember nothing more until Jonathan was beside me in bed, meaning his arrival did not wake me. The same thin, white mist I’d noticed before filled the room. I’m not sure I told you about this, but you can find it in my diary. The same vague terror and sense of a presence returned. I tried to wake Jonathan but found him deeply asleep, as if he’d taken the sleeping draught instead of me. I couldn’t wake him, which frightened me greatly. Looking around, I saw a tall, thin man in black by the bed—as though he stepped out of the mist, or the mist had formed into his body, for it vanished completely. I recognized him from the others’ descriptions: waxy face, sharp nose, red lips with white teeth showing, and those red eyes I once saw reflecting in St. Mary’s Church at Whitby. I even noticed the red scar on his forehead from where Jonathan struck him. For a moment, I was frozen in terror and couldn’t scream. He spoke in a sharp whisper, pointing to Jonathan: ‘Silence! If you make a sound, I’ll kill him right before your eyes.’\n\nI was horrified and unable to react. With a mocking smile, he seized my shoulder, gripped me tightly, and exposed my throat with his other hand, saying, 'First, a little reward for my efforts. Be quiet; your blood has quenched my thirst before!' I was helpless, perhaps due to his cursed power over his victims. Oh God, pity me! He pressed his foul lips to my throat.”\n\nHer husband groaned, and she squeezed his hand, looking at him with pity as if he were the one hurt, then continued:\n\n“I felt my strength leaving and began to faint. I don’t know how long the ordeal lasted, but it felt like a long time before he finally stopped. I saw fresh blood dripping from his mouth!” Overcome by the memory, she nearly collapsed, but her husband supported her. Gathering herself, she went on:\n\n“He then mocked me: ‘So, you would try to outwit me like the others and help these men against me! You now know—just as they partly know, and soon will know fully—what happens to those who stand in my way. They should have focused their efforts closer to home, for while they tried to defeat me, I was planning against them. You, their dearest, now belong to me: flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood, my great source of sustenance for now, but later my companion and helper. You’ll have revenge too, as all of them will serve your needs. But first, you must be punished for opposing me. Now, when I call to you, you must come to me—from anywhere. For that, this!’ He tore his shirt, used his sharp nails to open a vein in his chest, grabbed my hands, and with the other pressed my mouth to the wound, forcing me to drink—or suffocate. Oh God! What have I done to deserve such a fate? I have always tried to live righteously. God, have mercy on me and on those I love!”"

It is now six o’clock, and we are to meet in the study in half an hour and take something to eat; for Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward are agreed that if we do not eat we cannot work our best. Our best will be, God knows, required to-day. I must keep writing at every chance, for I dare not stop to think. All, big and little, must go down; perhaps at the end the little things may teach us most. The teaching, big or little, could not have landed Mina or me anywhere worse than we are to-day. However, we must trust and hope. Poor Mina told me just now, with the tears running down her dear cheeks, that it is in trouble and trial that our faith is tested—that we must keep on trusting; and that God will aid us up to the end. The end! oh my God! what end?... To work! To work!\nWhen Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward had come back from seeing poor Renfield, we went gravely into what was to be done. First, Dr. Seward told us that when he and Dr. Van Helsing had gone down to the room below they had found Renfield lying on the floor, all in a heap. His face was all bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were broken.\nDr. Seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he had heard anything. He said that he had been sitting down—he confessed to half dozing—when he heard loud voices in the room, and then Renfield had called out loudly several times, “God! God! God!” after that there was a sound of falling, and when he entered the room he found him lying on the floor, face down, just as the doctors had seen him. Van Helsing asked if he had heard “voices” or “a voice,” and he said he could not say; that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two, but as there was no one in the room it could have been only one. He could swear to it, if required, that the word “God” was spoken by the patient. Dr. Seward said to us, when we were alone, that he did not wish to go into the matter; the question of an inquest had to be considered, and it would never do to put forward the truth, as no one would believe it. As it was, he thought that on the attendant’s evidence he could give a certificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed.

It's now six o'clock, and we're scheduled to gather in the study in thirty minutes to eat. Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward agree that we must nourish ourselves to perform at our best, and we will definitely need to be at our best today, as God knows. I have to write whenever I get a chance, because I cannot afford to stop and think. I must record everything, no matter how insignificant; perhaps the minor details will ultimately teach us the most. Such lessons, great or small, could not possibly have brought Mina or me to a worse state than we are in now. However, we must hold onto faith and hope. Poor Mina just told me, with tears streaming down her beloved face, that hardship and trials are tests of our faith, and that we must continue to trust that God will support us until the end. The end! Oh, dear God! What end could it be?... I must focus on the task at hand! We must act! After Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward returned from attending to poor Renfield, we held a serious discussion about our next steps. Dr. Seward first reported that when he and Dr. Van Helsing went downstairs, they found Renfield collapsed in a heap on the floor. His face was severely bruised and crushed, and his neck bones were broken. Dr. Seward then questioned the attendant who was on duty in the corridor, asking if he had heard anything. The attendant admitted he had been sitting down, even nodding off slightly, when he heard loud voices from the room. Then, Renfield had shouted out loudly several times, \"God! God! God!\" Following that, there was a sound of something falling, and when he entered the room, he found Renfield lying face down on the floor, exactly as the doctors had discovered him. Van Helsing asked if he heard \"voices\" (plural) or \"a voice\" (singular). The attendant said he couldn't be certain; initially, it seemed like two voices, but since no one else was in the room, it could only have been one. He was willing to swear, if necessary, that the patient spoke the word \"God.\" Later, when we were alone, Dr. Seward informed us that he did not want to delve deeper into the matter. The possibility of an inquest had to be considered, and presenting the actual truth would be impossible as no one would believe it. Given the attendant's testimony, he believed he could issue a death certificate citing an accidental fall from bed as the cause.

We’re going to need all our strength today, only God knows how much. I have to write down everything I can, big and small, since I can’t let myself dwell on my thoughts. Sometimes, the little details prove the most revealing. No lesson—great or minor—could have left Mina or me worse off than we are right now. Still, we must keep faith and hope for the best. Mina, in tears, just told me that times of hardship test our faith and that we must keep believing, trusting that God will help us until the very end. But what will that end be? God only knows. Time to get to work! \n\nAfter Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward returned from checking on poor Renfield, we somberly discussed what should be done. Dr. Seward explained that when they had gone to the room below, they found Renfield collapsed on the floor. His face was badly bruised, his bones in the neck were broken.\n\nDr. Seward questioned the attendant on duty nearby. The man admitted he was partially dozing when he heard loud voices from the room, and then Renfield shouting repeatedly, “God! God! God!” After a noise like a fall, the attendant entered to find Renfield lying face down, as the doctors had seen. Van Helsing asked whether the attendant heard several voices or just one; the man thought it may have sounded like two at first, but with only Renfield present, it had to be one. He was sure Renfield had cried out “God.” When we were alone, Dr. Seward said he didn’t want to discuss it openly; considering the need for a formal inquiry, the true story would be too unbelievable for others. Instead, with the attendant’s testimony, Dr. Seward could classify Renfield’s death as an accident from falling out of bed. If the coroner asked for more, there would be a formal inquest, but the result would likely be the same."

She herself agreed as to its wisdom, and it was pitiful to see her so brave and yet so sorrowful, and in such a depth of despair. “There must be no concealment,” she said, “Alas! we have had too much already. And besides there is nothing in all the world that can give me more pain than I have already endured—than I suffer now! Whatever may happen, it must be of new hope or of new courage to me!” Van Helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke, and said, suddenly but quietly:—\n“But dear Madam Mina, are you not afraid; not for yourself, but for others from yourself, after what has happened?” Her face grew set in its lines, but her eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as she answered:—\n“Ah no! for my mind is made up!”\n“To what?” he asked gently, whilst we were all very still; for each in our own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant. Her answer came with direct simplicity, as though she were simply stating a fact:—\n“Because if I find in myself—and I shall watch keenly for it—a sign of harm to any that I love, I shall die!”\n“You would not kill yourself?” he asked, hoarsely.\n“I would; if there were no friend who loved me, who would save me such a pain, and so desperate an effort!” She looked at him meaningly as she spoke. He was sitting down; but now he rose and came close to her and put his hand on her head as he said solemnly:\n“My child, there is such an one if it were for your good. For myself I could hold it in my account with God to find such an euthanasia for you, even at this moment if it were best. Nay, were it safe! But my child——” For a moment he seemed choked, and a great sob rose in his throat; he gulped it down and went on:—\n“There are here some who would stand between you and death. You must not die. You must not die by any hand; but least of all by your own. Until the other, who has fouled your sweet life, is true dead you must not die; for if he is still with the quick Un-Dead, your death would make you even as he is. No, you must live! You must struggle and strive to live, though death would seem a boon unspeakable. You must fight Death himself, though he come to you in pain or in joy; by the day, or the night; in safety or in peril! On your living soul I charge you that you do not die—nay, nor think of death—till this great evil be past.” The poor dear grew white as death, and shock and shivered, as I have seen a quicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide. We were all silent; we could do nothing. At length she grew more calm and turning to him said, sweetly, but oh! so sorrowfully, as she held out her hand:—\n“I promise you, my dear friend, that if God will let me live, I shall strive to do so; till, if it may be in His good time, this horror may have passed away from me.” She was so good and brave that we all felt that our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her, and we began to discuss what we were to do. I told her that she was to have all the papers in the safe, and all the papers or diaries and phonographs we might hereafter use; and was to keep the record as she had done before. She was pleased with the prospect of anything to do—if “pleased” could be used in connection with so grim an interest.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "When we began discussing our next course of action, the immediate consensus was that Mina needed to be fully informed about everything; absolutely nothing, no matter how painful, should be hidden from her. She herself agreed this was the wisest approach, and it was heartbreaking to see her simultaneously so courageous, so sad, and so utterly without hope. She declared, “There must be no secrets. Tragically, we have already had far too many. Besides, nothing in the entire world could cause me more suffering than I have already gone through—than I am experiencing now! Whatever happens next, it can only bring me new hope or renewed strength!” Van Helsing watched her intently as she spoke, then asked suddenly but softly, “But dear Madam Mina, are you not afraid; not for your own sake, but for others because of what you are becoming, after everything that has transpired?” Her expression became rigid, but her eyes shone with the dedication of a martyr as she replied, “Oh no! My decision is final!” “Concerning what?” he inquired gently, while the rest of us remained completely still; for each of us had a vague sense of her meaning. Her answer came with simple directness, as if she were merely stating a fact: “Because if I detect within myself—and I will monitor this intensely—any sign of danger to someone I care for, I will end my life!” “You would not kill yourself?” he asked in a strained voice. “I would; unless a friend who loved me would spare me such suffering and such a desperate act!” She looked at him meaningfully as she spoke. He had been sitting, but now he stood, moved close to her, and placed his hand on her head, saying solemnly, “My child, such a person exists if it were for your benefit. For my part, I could account it before God to help you find such a peaceful end, even at this very moment if it were truly the best option. Indeed, if it were safe! But my child—” For a moment, he seemed unable to speak, and a great sob welled up; he suppressed it and continued, “There are individuals here who would protect you from death. You must not die. You must not die by anyone’s hand; and least of all by your own. Until the creature who has corrupted your precious life is truly dead, you must not die; because if he still lives as one of the Quick Un-Dead, your death would transform you into his likeness. No, you must live! You must fight and strive to remain alive, even though death might seem like an unspeakable blessing. You must battle Death itself, whether it approaches in pain or joy; by day or night; in security or danger! On your living soul, I command you not to die—indeed, not even to contemplate death—until this terrible evil is overcome.” The poor dear woman turned deathly pale, trembling and shivering like a quicksand reacting to the incoming tide. We were all silent, unable to do anything. Eventually, she grew calmer and, turning to him, said sweetly, yet with profound sadness, as she extended her hand, “I promise you, my dear friend, that if God permits me to live, I will strive to do so; until, if it is His will and in His good time, this horror may depart from me.” She was so inherently good and courageous that we all felt our resolve strengthened to work and endure for her sake, and we resumed our discussion about our next steps. I informed her that she would be given all the documents in the safe, along with any future papers, diaries, and phonograph recordings we might use; and she was to continue maintaining the records as she had done previously. She seemed pleased to have something to do—if “pleased” is an appropriate word to use regarding such a grim and serious responsibility.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As we discussed our next steps, we quickly agreed that Mina should be included in everything, and nothing—no matter how painful—would be hidden from her. She agreed this was wise, though it was heart-wrenching to see her face the situation with such courage despite her deep sadness and despair. Mina insisted, \"There must be no secrets. We've had too many already. And nothing in the world could hurt me more than what I've already suffered or am suffering now. Whatever happens, it might bring new hope or renewed courage.\" Van Helsing looked at her thoughtfully and then asked gently if she was afraid—not for herself, but for the danger she might pose to others. Mina answered resolutely that her mind was made up. When he asked what she meant, she said she would watch herself closely, and if she saw any sign that she was a threat to those she loved, she would end her own life. Van Helsing asked, shocked, if she would truly kill herself. She replied she would, if there were no friend to spare her such pain and effort, implying she might hope someone would help her if needed. Van Helsing, emotional, assured Mina that someone among them would save her from such suffering if necessary, but pleaded with her not to die—especially not by her own hand—until their enemy was destroyed. He explained that dying too soon would make her vulnerable to becoming like their foe. Mina, pale and shaken, eventually calmed down and promised Van Helsing she would fight to live, for as long as it took, until the evil threatening her was gone. Her brave promise renewed everyone's spirits to work for her sake. Finally, I explained she would be in charge of all our documents, diaries, and phonograph records as before, a responsibility that seemed to comfort her even in these grim circumstances."

          "text_segment": "As usual Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyone else, and was prepared with an exact ordering of our work.\n“It is perhaps well,” he said, “that at our meeting after our visit to Carfax we decided not to do anything with the earth-boxes that lay there. Had we done so, the Count must have guessed our purpose, and would doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an effort with regard to the others; but now he does not know our intentions. Nay, more, in all probability, he does not know that such a power exists to us as can sterilise his lairs, so that he cannot use them as of old. We are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as to their disposition that, when we have examined the house in Piccadilly, we may track the very last of them. To-day, then, is ours; and in it rests our hope. The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning guards us in its course. Until it sets to-night, that monster must retain whatever form he now has. He is confined within the limitations of his earthly envelope. He cannot melt into thin air nor disappear through cracks or chinks or crannies. If he go through a doorway, he must open the door like a mortal. And so we have this day to hunt out all his lairs and sterilise them. So we shall, if we have not yet catch him and destroy him, drive him to bay in some place where the catching and the destroying shall be, in time, sure.” Here I started up for I could not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds so preciously laden with Mina’s life and happiness were flying from us, since whilst we talked action was impossible. But Van Helsing held up his hand warningly. “Nay, friend Jonathan,” he said, “in this, the quickest way home is the longest way, so your proverb say. We shall all act and act with desperate quick, when the time has come. But think, in all probable the key of the situation is in that house in Piccadilly. The Count may have many houses which he has bought. Of them he will have deeds of purchase, keys and other things. He will have paper that he write on; he will have his book of cheques. There are many belongings that he must have somewhere; why not in this place so central, so quiet, where he come and go by the front or the back at all hour, when in the very vast of the traffic there is none to notice. We shall go there and search that house; and when we learn what it holds, then we do what our friend Arthur call, in his phrases of hunt ‘stop the earths’ and so we run down our old fox—so? is it not?”\n“Then let us come at once,” I cried, “we are wasting the precious, precious time!” The Professor did not move, but simply said:—\n“And how are we to get into that house in Piccadilly?”\n“Any way!” I cried. “We shall break in if need be.”\n“And your police; where will they be, and what will they say?”\nI was staggered; but I knew that if he wished to delay he had a good reason for it. So I said, as quietly as I could:—\n“Don’t wait more than need be; you know, I am sure, what torture I am in.”\n“Ah, my child, that I do; and indeed there is no wish of me to add to your anguish. But just think, what can we do, until all the world be at movement. Then will come our time. I have thought and thought, and it seems to me that the simplest way is the best of all. Now we wish to get into the house, but we have no key; is it not so?” I nodded.\n“Now suppose that you were, in truth, the owner of that house, and could not still get in; and think there was to you no conscience of the housebreaker, what would you do?”\n“I should get a respectable locksmith, and set him to work to pick the lock for me.”\n“And your police, they would interfere, would they not?”\n“Oh, no! not if they knew the man was properly employed.”\n“Then,” he looked at me as keenly as he spoke, “all that is in doubt is the conscience of the employer, and the belief of your policemen as to whether or no that employer has a good conscience or a bad one. Your police must indeed be zealous men and clever—oh, so clever!—in reading the heart, that they trouble themselves in such matter. No, no, my friend Jonathan, you go take the lock off a hundred empty house in this your London, or of any city in the world; and if you do it as such things are rightly done, and at the time such things are rightly done, no one will interfere. I have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine house in London, and when he went for months of summer to Switzerland and lock up his house, some burglar came and broke window at back and got in. Then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk out and in through the door, before the very eyes of the police. Then he have an auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big notice; and when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods of that other man who own them. Then he go to a builder, and he sell him that house, making an agreement that he pull it down and take all away within a certain time. And your police and other authority help him all they can. And when that owner come back from his holiday in Switzerland he find only an empty hole where his house had been. This was all done en règle; and in our work we shall be en règle too. We shall not go so early that the policemen who have then little to think of, shall deem it strange; but we shall go after ten o’clock, when there are many about, and such things would be done were we indeed owners of the house.”\nI could not but see how right he was and the terrible despair of Mina’s face became relaxed a thought; there was hope in such good counsel. Van Helsing went on:—\n“When once within that house we may find more clues; at any rate some of us can remain there whilst the rest find the other places where there be more earth-boxes—at Bermondsey and Mile End.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "As was his custom, Van Helsing had anticipated everyone else and was ready with a precise sequence for their task. He remarked, \"It is perhaps fortunate that we chose not to interfere with the earth-boxes found at Carfax during our previous meeting. Had we done so, the Count surely would have suspected our intentions and undoubtedly taken steps beforehand to thwart any such attempt on the other boxes; but now he is unaware of our plans. Indeed, it is highly likely that he doesn't realize we possess the ability to render his lairs sterile, making them unusable as they once were. We have now advanced our knowledge of their locations to such an extent that, after we have examined the house in Piccadilly, we should be able to track down the very last of them. Therefore, today belongs to us; and our hope rests upon it. The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning now protects us during its journey. Until it sets tonight, that creature must remain in whatever form he currently occupies. He is confined within the limitations of his earthly body. He cannot simply vanish into thin air or disappear through tiny cracks or openings. If he passes through a doorway, he must open the door like a normal person. And so, we have this entire day to seek out all his hiding places and sterilize them. By doing this, even if we haven't caught and destroyed him yet, we will drive him into a corner in a location where his capture and destruction will, in time, be guaranteed.\" At this, I sprang up, unable to control myself at the thought of the minutes and seconds, so crucial to Mina’s life and happiness, flying by, as discussion prevented action. But Van Helsing raised a hand in caution. \"No, my friend Jonathan,\" he said, \"in this situation, the quickest route home is the longest, as your proverb says. We will all act, and act with desperate speed, when the moment arrives. But consider, it is highly probable that the key to the situation lies in that house in Piccadilly. The Count may own many houses he has purchased. For these, he will possess the purchase deeds, keys, and other related items. He will have paper he writes on; he will have his checkbook. There are many belongings he must keep somewhere; why not in this place, so central, so quiet, where he can come and go unnoticed by the front or back at any hour, even amidst the vast city traffic? We will go there and search that house; and when we discover what it contains, then we will do as our friend Arthur calls it in hunting terms, 'stop the earths,' and in this way, we will run down our old fox – is that not right?\" \"Then let us go immediately!\" I cried, \"we are wasting invaluable, precious time!\" The Professor did not move, but simply stated, \"And how are we to gain entry into that house in Piccadilly?\" \"Any way at all!\" I exclaimed. \"We will break in if we must.\" \"And your police; where will they be, and what will they say?\" I was stunned; but I knew that if he intended to delay, he had a good reason for it. So I said, as calmly as I could, \"Please don't wait longer than is necessary; you surely know the torment I am in.\" \"Ah, my dear friend, I know that well,\" he said, \"and indeed, I have no wish to add to your suffering. But just think, what effective action can we take until the entire city is active? That will be our opportunity. I have thought and thought about this, and it seems to me that the simplest method is the best. Currently, we wish to get into the house, but we lack a key; is that not so?\" I nodded. \"Now imagine that you were, in truth, the owner of that house, and still could not enter; and suppose you had no qualms about acting like a housebreaker, what would you do?\" \"I would hire a reputable locksmith and instruct him to pick the lock for me.\" \"And your police, they would intervene, wouldn't they?\" \"Oh, no! Not if they knew the man was properly employed for the task.\" \"Then,\" he said, looking at me intently as he spoke, \"all that is uncertain is the employer's conscience and the belief of your policemen as to whether that employer's intentions are good or bad. Your police must be remarkably diligent and clever – oh, so clever! – at judging people's hearts if they concern themselves with such matters. No, no, my friend Jonathan, you could go and remove the lock from a hundred unoccupied houses in your London, or any city in the world; and if you do it correctly, and at the appropriate time for such things, no one will interfere. I have read of a gentleman who owned a very fine house in London, and when he went for summer months to Switzerland and locked up his house, some burglar came and broke a window at the back to get in. Then he went and opened the front shutters and walked in and out through the door, right before the eyes of the police. Then he held an auction in that house, advertised it, and put up large notices; and when the day arrived, he sold off all the belongings of the actual owner through a major auctioneer. Then he went to a builder and sold him that house, with an agreement that the builder would pull it down and remove everything within a certain timeframe. And your police and other authorities assisted him in every way they could. And when the owner returned from his holiday in Switzerland, he found only an empty space where his house had been. This was all done legitimately ('en règle'); and our work will also be done legitimately. We will not go so early that the policemen, who would then have little else to occupy their minds, might find it odd; instead, we will go after ten o’clock, when there are many people about, and such actions would be common if we were indeed the owners of the house.\" I could not help but see how correct he was, and the terrible despair on Mina's face relaxed slightly; there was hope in such sound advice. Van Helsing continued, \"Once inside that house, we may find more clues; at any rate, some of us can remain there while the others search for the additional locations where there are more earth-boxes – at Bermondsey and Mile End.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As usual, Van Helsing was ahead of everyone and had carefully planned out our tasks. He said, “It’s probably for the best that after we visited Carfax, we agreed not to interfere with the boxes of earth there. If we had, Count Dracula might have figured out what we were doing and tried to stop us with the other boxes; but as it stands, he’s unaware of our intentions. In fact, he likely doesn’t even know that we have the ability to render his hiding places useless to him. Now that we know more about where these places are, once we examine the house in Piccadilly, we can potentially find the last ones. Today is our opportunity, and we must pin our hopes on it. The daylight, which began as a symbol of our sorrow, now protects us, and as long as the sun is up, the Count cannot change his form—he is limited to his physical body. He can’t just vanish or slip through cracks; if he wants to leave a room, he has to open the door like anyone else. So, we have today to locate and purify all his hiding places. If we can’t catch and destroy him now, we can drive him into a corner where he’ll eventually be caught.” At this point, I became agitated, knowing that every moment wasted put Mina more at risk, but Van Helsing motioned for me to wait. “No, Jonathan,” he said, “sometimes the quickest course is actually the slowest. Rest assured, when the time comes, we’ll act swiftly. But understand: the key may be in the Piccadilly house. Dracula may own many houses, and he’ll have documents, keys, perhaps even a checkbook—he’ll have belongings somewhere, and why not in such a convenient, discreet place as Piccadilly? We’ll search it, and if we find what we’re looking for, we’ll do as Arthur says—‘stop the earths’—and run our quarry to ground.”\n\n“I want to go now,” I insisted, furious at the delay, but Van Helsing was unmoved.\n\n“And how will we get in?” he asked.\n\n“Any way we have to—even breaking in!” I replied.\n\n“And what about the police? What will they do?”\n\nThis made me pause, and I realized Van Helsing must have had a reason for wanting to wait. “Just don’t delay longer than necessary,” I pleaded. “You know what I’m going through.”\n\n“I do, and it’s not my intention to add to your pain. But think, what can we do until the city comes alive? Then it will be our time. The simplest plan is usually the best: we want to get into the house, but don’t have a key.” I nodded in agreement.\n\n“Suppose you were the rightful owner and locked out. With no qualms about breaking in, what would you do?”\n\n“I’d hire a locksmith to open the door for me.”\n\n“And would the police object?”\n\n“They wouldn’t, so long as it was legitimate.”\n\n“Exactly,” Van Helsing said. “So the only issue is whether the locksmith and the police believe you’re the rightful owner. But as long as you behave properly, no one will interfere. There’s even been a case where someone broke into a house, sold its contents, and demolished it—all in broad daylight, without anyone stopping him. We will act just as properly. We’ll go to Piccadilly after ten, when activity in London is at its peak and nothing will look suspicious. Then we’ll search the house and follow every clue, while others check for more boxes at Bermondsey and Mile End.”"

          "text_segment": "Lord Godalming stood up. “I can be of some use here,” he said. “I shall wire to my people to have horses and carriages where they will be most convenient.”\n“Look here, old fellow,” said Morris, “it is a capital idea to have all ready in case we want to go horsebacking; but don’t you think that one of your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in a byway of Walworth or Mile End would attract too much attention for our purposes? It seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east; and even leave them somewhere near the neighbourhood we are going to.”\n“Friend Quincey is right!” said the Professor. “His head is what you call in plane with the horizon. It is a difficult thing that we go to do, and we do not want no peoples to watch us if so it may.”\nMina took a growing interest in everything and I was rejoiced to see that the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for a time the terrible experience of the night. She was very, very pale—almost ghastly, and so thin that her lips were drawn away, showing her teeth in somewhat of prominence. I did not mention this last, lest it should give her needless pain; but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of what had occurred with poor Lucy when the Count had sucked her blood. As yet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper; but the time as yet was short, and there was time for fear.\nWhen we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of the disposition of our forces, there were new sources of doubt. It was finally agreed that before starting for Piccadilly we should destroy the Count’s lair close at hand. In case he should find it out too soon, we should thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction; and his presence in his purely material shape, and at his weakest, might give us some new clue.\nAs to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by the Professor that, after our visit to Carfax, we should all enter the house in Piccadilly; that the two doctors and I should remain there, whilst Lord Godalming and Quincey found the lairs at Walworth and Mile End and destroyed them. It was possible, if not likely, the Professor urged, that the Count might appear in Piccadilly during the day, and that if so we might be able to cope with him then and there. At any rate, we might be able to follow him in force. To this plan I strenuously objected, and so far as my going was concerned, for I said that I intended to stay and protect Mina, I thought that my mind was made up on the subject; but Mina would not listen to my objection. She said that there might be some law matter in which I could be useful; that amongst the Count’s papers might be some clue which I could understand out of my experience in Transylvania; and that, as it was, all the strength we could muster was required to cope with the Count’s extraordinary power. I had to give in, for Mina’s resolution was fixed; she said that it was the last hope for her that we should all work together. “As for me,” she said, “I have no fear. Things have been as bad as they can be; and whatever may happen must have in it some element of hope or comfort. Go, my husband! God can, if He wishes it, guard me as well alone as with any one present.” So I started up crying out: “Then in God’s name let us come at once, for we are losing time. The Count may come to Piccadilly earlier than we think.”\n",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Lord Godalming volunteered his help, suggesting he could arrange for horses and carriages to be available conveniently. Morris, however, pointed out that using elaborate, identifiable carriages, especially in areas like Walworth or Mile End, might attract unwanted attention. He proposed they use hired cabs when travelling south or east, leaving them some distance from their destination. The Professor agreed with Quincey Morris's practical advice, emphasizing the need for discretion given the dangerous nature of their undertaking. Mina seemed increasingly engaged in the discussion, and I was relieved to see that the gravity of their mission was helping her momentarily forget the traumatic events of the previous night. She was extremely pale, almost deathly, and so thin that her lips were stretched back, slightly exposing her teeth. I refrained from mentioning this last detail to avoid causing her distress, but the thought of what had happened to poor Lucy when the Count drank her blood sent chills down my spine. As of yet, her teeth showed no sign of becoming sharper, but the short time that had passed still left room for fear. When we discussed the plan of action and how to divide our efforts, new uncertainties arose. It was finally decided that before heading to Piccadilly, they should first destroy the Count's nearby hideout. This would ensure they remained ahead of him in their work of destruction if he discovered their activities too soon, and encountering him in his physical form, when he might be weakest, could potentially provide a new clue. Regarding the division of the group, the Professor suggested that after visiting Carfax, they should all go to the house in Piccadilly. He proposed that the two doctors and I stay there, while Lord Godalming and Quincey located and destroyed the lairs in Walworth and Mile End. The Professor argued that the Count might appear in Piccadilly during the day, offering a chance to confront him or at least follow him together. I strongly opposed this plan, particularly my own participation, stating my intention to remain and protect Mina, believing my decision was final. However, Mina would not accept my refusal. She argued that I might be useful in a legal capacity, that my experience in Transylvania could help interpret any clues found among the Count’s papers, and that they needed every available person to counter the Count's immense power. I had to give in because Mina was resolute; she felt that their only hope lay in everyone working together. 'As for me,' she declared, 'I have no fear. Things couldn't get any worse, and whatever happens now must contain some element of hope or comfort. Go, my husband! If it is His will, God can protect me just as well alone as with someone here.' So I cried out, urging them to act immediately in God's name, as they were losing valuable time and the Count might arrive in Piccadilly sooner than expected.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Lord Godalming got up and said he could be helpful by arranging for horses and carriages to be ready where needed. Morris replied that while it was a good idea to have transport ready in case they needed to ride, using one of Lord Godalming’s fancy, recognizable carriages in certain parts of London would draw too much attention. He suggested they use cabs instead and leave them near their destination. The Professor agreed with Morris, noting it was best not to attract notice because their task was delicate. Meanwhile, Mina was visibly pale and gaunt but became more engaged in what was happening, and the distraction seemed to ease her recent trauma. Still, her physical state reminded the narrator of what happened to Lucy after Dracula attacked her, though there was no sign yet of her teeth changing. As they planned their actions, they decided to first destroy Dracula’s nearby lair before heading to Piccadilly, hoping to get ahead of him and perhaps gain useful clues if they caught him at his weakest. The Professor suggested splitting up: after Carfax, the doctors and the narrator would search Piccadilly, while Lord Godalming and Morris would tackle the lairs at Walworth and Mile End. The Professor thought Dracula might show up in Piccadilly during the day, and they might be able to confront him. The narrator resisted leaving Mina, hoping to stay and protect her, but Mina insisted he should go, arguing his legal knowledge and experience with Dracula’s paperwork could be valuable. She was determined and hoped they would succeed by working together. Mina reminded him that God could protect her, whether she was alone or not. So, the narrator agreed, and they hurried out, realizing they might not have much time before Dracula arrived in Piccadilly."

          "text_segment": "“Not so!” said Van Helsing, holding up his hand.\n“But why?” I asked.\n“Do you forget,” he said, with actually a smile, “that last night he banqueted heavily, and will sleep late?”\nDid I forget! shall I ever—can I ever! Can any of us ever forget that terrible scene! Mina struggled hard to keep her brave countenance; but the pain overmastered her and she put her hands before her face, and shuddered whilst she moaned. Van Helsing had not intended to recall her frightful experience. He had simply lost sight of her and her part in the affair in his intellectual effort. When it struck him what he said, he was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her. “Oh, Madam Mina,” he said, “dear, dear Madam Mina, alas! that I of all who so reverence you should have said anything so forgetful. These stupid old lips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so; but you will forget it, will you not?” He bent low beside her as he spoke; she took his hand, and looking at him through her tears, said hoarsely:—\n“No, I shall not forget, for it is well that I remember; and with it I have so much in memory of you that is sweet, that I take it all together. Now, you must all be going soon. Breakfast is ready, and we must all eat that we may be strong.”\nBreakfast was a strange meal to us all. We tried to be cheerful and encourage each other, and Mina was the brightest and most cheerful of us. When it was over, Van Helsing stood up and said:—\n“Now, my dear friends, we go forth to our terrible enterprise. Are we all armed, as we were on that night when first we visited our enemy’s lair; armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack?” We all assured him. “Then it is well. Now, Madam Mina, you are in any case quite safe here until the sunset; and before then we shall return—if—— We shall return! But before we go let me see you armed against personal attack. I have myself, since you came down, prepared your chamber by the placing of things of which we know, so that He may not enter. Now let me guard yourself. On your forehead I touch this piece of Sacred Wafer in the name of the Father, the Son, and——”\nThere was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear. As he had placed the Wafer on Mina’s forehead, it had seared it—had burned into the flesh as though it had been a piece of white-hot metal. My poor darling’s brain had told her the significance of the fact as quickly as her nerves received the pain of it; and the two so overwhelmed her that her overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream. But the words to her thought came quickly; the echo of the scream had not ceased to ring on the air when there came the reaction, and she sank on her knees on the floor in an agony of abasement. Pulling her beautiful hair over her face, as the leper of old his mantle, she wailed out:—\n“Unclean! Unclean! Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh! I must bear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the Judgment Day.” They all paused. I had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helpless grief, and putting my arms around held her tight. For a few minutes our sorrowful hearts beat together, whilst the friends around us turned away their eyes that ran tears silently. Then Van Helsing turned and said gravely; so gravely that I could not help feeling that he was in some way inspired, and was stating things outside himself:—\n“It may be that you may have to bear that mark till God himself see fit, as He most surely shall, on the Judgment Day, to redress all wrongs of the earth and of His children that He has placed thereon. And oh, Madam Mina, my dear, my dear, may we who love you be there to see, when that red scar, the sign of God’s knowledge of what has been, shall pass away, and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know. For so surely as we live, that scar shall pass away when God sees right to lift the burden that is hard upon us. Till then we bear our Cross, as His Son did in obedience to His Will. It may be that we are chosen instruments of His good pleasure, and that we ascend to His bidding as that other through stripes and shame; through tears and blood; through doubts and fears, and all that makes the difference between God and man.”\nThere was hope in his words, and comfort; and they made for resignation. Mina and I both felt so, and simultaneously we each took one of the old man’s hands and bent over and kissed it. Then without a word we all knelt down together, and, all holding hands, swore to be true to each other. We men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the head of her whom, each in his own way, we loved; and we prayed for help and guidance in the terrible task which lay before us.\nIt was then time to start.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Van Helsing immediately contradicted this, holding up his hand to stop me. I questioned his reasoning. With a rare smile, he asked if I had forgotten that Dracula had eaten a large meal the previous night and would consequently be sleeping late. How could I possibly forget? Would I ever be able to put that dreadful experience behind me? Would any of us? Mina fought to maintain her composure, but the intensity of the pain overcame her, causing her to cover her face, shudder, and moan. Van Helsing hadn't meant to trigger her painful memory; in his focus on the strategic aspect, he had momentarily overlooked her and her involvement in the event. Upon realizing the impact of his words, he was horrified by his insensitivity and sought to comfort her. \"Oh, Madam Mina,\" he said tenderly, \"my dear, dear Madam Mina, how terrible that I, who hold you in such high esteem, could say something so thoughtless. These foolish old lips and this foolish old mind don't deserve your kindness, but you will try to forget it, won't you?\" He knelt beside her as he spoke. She took his hand, and, looking at him through her tears, replied weakly, \"No, I must remember, for it is important to do so; and woven into that memory are so many sweet recollections of you that I accept it all. Now, you must all prepare to leave soon. Breakfast is ready, and we must eat to build our strength.\" Breakfast was a strange and difficult meal for all of us. We attempted to be cheerful and offer support to one another, with Mina appearing the most bright and optimistic among us. After the meal, Van Helsing stood and addressed us. \"Now, my dear friends,\" he began, \"we set out on our dangerous undertaking. Are we all equipped, just as we were that night we first entered our adversary's domain? Are we prepared for both spiritual and physical attacks?\" We all confirmed that we were. \"Then it is well,\" he replied. \"Now, Madam Mina, you are entirely safe here until the sun sets, and we will be back before then—if— We will return! But before we depart, allow me to ensure your personal protection. Since you came down, I have already prepared your room by placing the necessary protective items, preventing Him from entering. Now, let me safeguard you yourself. I will touch this piece of Sacred Wafer to your forehead in the name of the Father, the Son, and—\" A terrifying scream, one that nearly froze our hearts, pierced the air. As he touched the Wafer to Mina’s forehead, it had burned her, searing her flesh as if it were a piece of glowing hot metal. My poor love’s mind instantly grasped the meaning of this occurrence, just as her nerves registered the agony. The dual shock overwhelmed her sensitive nature, giving rise to that horrifying shriek. Yet, her thoughts quickly formed. The echo of the scream had barely faded when she collapsed to her knees on the floor, overcome by profound shame and despair. Drawing her beautiful hair over her face, much like a leper in ancient times might cover himself with a cloak, she cried out in anguish: \"Unclean! Unclean! Even God himself recoils from my contaminated flesh! I must bear this shameful mark on my forehead until the final Judgment.\" Everyone present fell silent. I had immediately rushed to her side, consumed by helpless sorrow, embracing her tightly. For a few moments, our hearts beat together in shared grief, while our companions around us turned away, shedding silent tears. Then Van Helsing turned and spoke with immense seriousness, a gravity that made me feel he was somehow divinely inspired, articulating truths beyond his own understanding. \"It may be that you are destined to carry that mark until God himself deems fit, as He most assuredly will on the Judgment Day, to rectify all the injustices of the world and of His children upon it. And oh, Madam Mina, my dear, my dear, may those of us who love you be present to witness the moment when that red scar, the testament of God’s awareness of what has transpired, shall fade away, leaving your forehead as pure as the heart we know you possess. For as surely as we are alive, that scar will disappear when God sees fit to lift the heavy burden upon us. Until then, we bear our Cross, just as His Son did in obedience to His Will. Perhaps we are chosen instruments of His divine plan, and we ascend to fulfill His commands through trials and humiliation; through tears and bloodshed; through doubts and fears, and all that distinguishes humanity from God.\" His words offered hope and solace, fostering a sense of acceptance. Mina and I both felt this deeply, and together, we each took one of the old man's hands, bent down, and kissed it. Then, without a word, we all knelt together, held hands, and pledged our loyalty to one another. We men committed ourselves to alleviating the sorrow of the one whom we all loved in our own way, and we prayed for assistance and direction in the daunting task that lay before us. It was then time to commence our journey.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"No, that's not so!\" Van Helsing exclaimed, raising his hand. \n\"But why?\" I questioned him.\nHe smiled as he responded, \"Have you forgotten that last night he feasted heavily and will now sleep late?\"\nHow could I forget! How could any of us forget that dreadful event? Mina did her best to appear strong, but the memory's pain overpowered her. She hid her face in her hands, shuddering and moaning. Van Helsing hadn't meant to remind her of that horrifying ordeal—he had simply been caught up in his thoughts and overlooked her feelings. Realizing his mistake, he was dismayed and hastened to comfort her. \"Oh, dear Madam Mina, how I regret saying such an inconsiderate thing! My foolish old mind and tongue have betrayed me, but you'll forgive me, won't you?\" He drew close as he spoke. Through her tears, Mina gripped his hand and replied in a rough voice, \"No, I can never forget, and perhaps I shouldn't—but among all my memories, so many are sweet because of you. Let's move on. Breakfast is ready; we need to eat and gather strength.\"\nThe meal felt strange for all of us. We tried to support one another and act cheerful, while Mina herself was the most upbeat. When breakfast ended, Van Helsing stood and addressed us: \"Now, friends, we must face our dreadful task. Are we all armed as when we first confronted our enemy—ready for both spiritual and physical dangers?\" We assured him we were prepared. \"Good. Madam Mina, you are safe here until sunset, and we shall return before then—if we can. But first, let me see that you are protected. I have already secured your room with safeguards to keep him out, and now let me personally protect you.\" He touched a Sacred Wafer to her forehead, invoking the Father and the Son...\nSuddenly Mina let out a scream so chilling that it struck us all. As Van Helsing placed the Wafer, it burned her skin as if it were red-hot metal. She instantly understood the horror of what that meant, and the shock and pain together were too much—for a moment she cried out in despair. As the scream faded, she collapsed to her knees, pulling her hair down like a shroud, and cried out, \"Unclean! Unclean! Even God turns from me! I will carry this mark of disgrace until Judgment Day.\"\nEveryone was stunned. I rushed to her, holding her as both of us were overcome by grief. Our friends turned away, silently weeping. Then Van Helsing spoke with a grave voice, as if divinely inspired:\n\"Perhaps you must bear this mark until God chooses to make all things right. But, dear Mina, may those who love you be present to see the day when that scar—God’s sign of what has happened—will fade, leaving your forehead as innocent as your soul. I believe that day will come, when God relieves us of this heavy burden. Until then, we must endure our suffering as His Son did. Perhaps we are meant to serve His purpose, just as another endured pain and shame, worry and hardship—everything that separates the divine from humanity.\"\nHis words gave us comfort and acceptance of our fate. Mina and I instinctively took his hands and kissed them. Then silently, we all knelt, held hands, and swore to stand by each other. We men pledged to relieve Mina’s sorrow and prayed for strength and guidance in the daunting challenge ahead.\nWith that, it was time for us to depart."

I suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meant many; just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth, so the holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks.\nWe entered Carfax without trouble and found all things the same as on the first occasion. It was hard to believe that amongst so prosaic surroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for such fear as already we knew. Had not our minds been made up, and had there not been terrible memories to spur us on, we could hardly have proceeded with our task. We found no papers, or any sign of use in the house; and in the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen them last. Dr. Van Helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before them:—\n“And now, my friends, we have a duty here to do. We must sterilise this earth, so sacred of holy memories, that he has brought from a far distant land for such fell use. He has chosen this earth because it has been holy. Thus we defeat him with his own weapon, for we make it more holy still. It was sanctified to such use of man, now we sanctify it to God.” As he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a wrench, and very soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open. The earth smelled musty and close; but we did not somehow seem to mind, for our attention was concentrated on the Professor. Taking from his box a piece of the Sacred Wafer he laid it reverently on the earth, and then shutting down the lid began to screw it home, we aiding him as he worked.\nOne by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes, and left them as we had found them to all appearance; but in each was a portion of the Host.\nWhen we closed the door behind us, the Professor said solemnly:—\n“So much is already done. If it may be that with all the others we can be so successful, then the sunset of this evening may shine on Madam Mina’s forehead all white as ivory and with no stain!”\nAs we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch our train we could see the front of the asylum. I looked eagerly, and in the window of my own room saw Mina. I waved my hand to her, and nodded to tell that our work there was successfully accomplished. She nodded in reply to show that she understood. The last I saw, she was waving her hand in farewell. It was with a heavy heart that we sought the station and just caught the train, which was steaming in as we reached the platform.\nI have written this in the train.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I said goodbye to Mina, a moment neither of us will forget our whole lives. Then we began our journey. I've decided that if it turns out Mina has to become a vampire eventually, I will not abandon her to that terrifying unknown existence alone. This, I believe, is why historically one vampire often led to many; just as their grotesque bodies needed specific, holy soil for rest, so too did the purest bonds of love serve as recruiters for their horrifying ranks. We easily entered Carfax and found everything just as it was before. It was difficult to accept that in such mundane surroundings of neglect, dust, and decay, the kind of fear we already knew could exist. Had we not been absolutely determined and spurred on by terrible memories, we would likely not have been able to continue our mission. We didn't find any papers or signs that the house had been used, and the large boxes in the old chapel looked exactly as when we last saw them. Dr. Van Helsing addressed us solemnly as we stood before them, saying, 'Now, my friends, we have a task to perform here. We must purify this earth, so sacred with holy memories, that he transported from a distant place for such evil ends. He chose this earth because it was holy. Thus, we defeat him with his own method, by making it even more holy. It was consecrated for human use; now we consecrate it for God.' As he spoke, he took a screwdriver and wrench from his bag, and soon the top of one case was opened. The earth had a close, musty smell, but we didn't really notice because we were focused on the Professor. Taking a piece of the Sacred Wafer from his container, he placed it reverently on the earth. Then, closing the lid, he began screwing it back on, with us helping him. We treated each of the large boxes in the same way, one after another, leaving them outwardly appearing just as we had found them, but with a piece of the Host inside each. As we closed the door behind us, the Professor stated solemnly, 'So much has now been accomplished. If we can be this successful with all the other matters, then perhaps the sunset this evening will shine on Madam Mina's forehead, completely white like ivory and without any stain!' As we walked across the lawn towards the station to catch our train, we could see the front of the asylum. I looked intently and saw Mina in the window of my old room. I waved to her and nodded to signal that we had completed our work there successfully. She nodded in return to show she understood. The last thing I saw was her waving goodbye. With a heavy heart, we hurried to the station and just managed to catch the train, which was pulling in as we reached the platform. I am writing this account now on the train.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I bid Mina goodbye—a farewell we will both remember forever—and we departed. I am resolved: if it’s destined that Mina must become a vampire, I will not let her face that dreadful fate alone. Perhaps this is why, in ancient times, one vampire led to many; just as their corrupted forms could only rest in consecrated soil, so love itself became a way others were drawn into their ranks. We entered Carfax easily and found everything unchanged from our last visit. In such ordinary surroundings, full of dust and decay, it was hard to believe there was any real danger, but our resolve and grim memories kept us focused. There were no documents or signs the house had been used; in the chapel, the large boxes were exactly where they’d been. Dr. Van Helsing spoke gravely to us as we stood by them: \"Now we must fulfill our duty. We need to purify this earth—earth that once held sacred memories and which he has misused. Dracula chose it for its holiness, so now we’ll make it holier still, reclaiming it for God instead of evil.\" He pulled out tools and soon opened one of the boxes. Though the earth inside smelled dank, we paid it little heed, watching as Van Helsing placed a piece of the Sacred Wafer on the soil inside. He then closed and sealed the box, with our help. We did the same for each box, leaving everything otherwise undisturbed, but ensuring each contained a part of the Host. When we finished and shut the door, Van Helsing assured us that if we could repeat this with the rest of the boxes, Mina might be saved, and her forehead might remain pure and unstained by sunset. As we walked toward the station, I glanced up at my room’s window in the asylum and saw Mina. I waved to show her our task was a success; she nodded and waved farewell. Heavy-hearted, we hurried and barely caught our train. I am writing this as we travel."

You had better not come with us in case there should be any difficulty; for under the circumstances it wouldn’t seem so bad for us to break into an empty house. But you are a solicitor and the Incorporated Law Society might tell you that you should have known better.” I demurred as to my not sharing any danger even of odium, but he went on: “Besides, it will attract less attention if there are not too many of us. My title will make it all right with the locksmith, and with any policeman that may come along. You had better go with Jack and the Professor and stay in the Green Park, somewhere in sight of the house; and when you see the door opened and the smith has gone away, do you all come across. We shall be on the lookout for you, and shall let you in.”\n“The advice is good!” said Van Helsing, so we said no more. Godalming and Morris hurried off in a cab, we following in another. At the corner of Arlington Street our contingent got out and strolled into the Green Park. My heart beat as I saw the house on which so much of our hope was centred, looming up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongst its more lively and spruce-looking neighbours. We sat down on a bench within good view, and began to smoke cigars so as to attract as little attention as possible. The minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as we waited for the coming of the others.\nAt length we saw a four-wheeler drive up. Out of it, in leisurely fashion, got Lord Godalming and Morris; and down from the box descended a thick-set working man with his rush-woven basket of tools. Morris paid the cabman, who touched his hat and drove away. Together the two ascended the steps, and Lord Godalming pointed out what he wanted done. The workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikes of the rail, saying something to a policeman who just then sauntered along. The policeman nodded acquiescence, and the man kneeling down placed his bag beside him. After searching through it, he took out a selection of tools which he produced to lay beside him in orderly fashion. Then he stood up, looked into the keyhole, blew into it, and turning to his employers, made some remark. Lord Godalming smiled, and the man lifted a good-sized bunch of keys; selecting one of them, he began to probe the lock, as if feeling his way with it. After fumbling about for a bit he tried a second, and then a third. All at once the door opened under a slight push from him, and he and the two others entered the hall. We sat still; my own cigar burnt furiously, but Van Helsing’s went cold altogether. We waited patiently as we saw the workman come out and bring in his bag. Then he held the door partly open, steadying it with his knees, whilst he fitted a key to the lock. This he finally handed to Lord Godalming, who took out his purse and gave him something. The man touched his hat, took his bag, put on his coat and departed; not a soul took the slightest notice of the whole transaction.\nWhen the man had fairly gone, we three crossed the street and knocked at the door. It was immediately opened by Quincey Morris, beside whom stood Lord Godalming lighting a cigar.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The time was 12:30 PM in Piccadilly. Just before reaching Fenchurch Street, Lord Godalming informed me that he and Quincey would locate a locksmith. He advised that I shouldn't join them, explaining that while it wouldn't look too bad for them to force entry into an unoccupied building, my status as a solicitor meant the Incorporated Law Society might criticize me for not acting more responsibly. I initially protested about not sharing the risk or potential social disapproval, but he persisted: 'Besides, it will be less conspicuous with fewer of us. My title will ensure cooperation from the locksmith and any police officer who might appear. You should accompany Jack and the Professor and wait in Green Park, somewhere with a view of the house. When you see the door open and the locksmith depart, you should all come over. We will be watching for you and will let you in.' Van Helsing agreed, stating the advice was sound, so we didn't discuss it further. Godalming and Morris quickly left in one carriage, and we followed in another. At the intersection with Arlington Street, our group exited and casually walked into Green Park. My heart pounded as I observed the house, the focus of so much of our hope, standing bleak and silent in its empty state among the surrounding buildings that looked more lively and well-maintained. We found a bench from which we had a clear view and began smoking cigars to avoid drawing attention. The minutes dragged by slowly as we anticipated the arrival of the others. Eventually, we spotted a four-wheeled cab pull up. Lord Godalming and Morris emerged unhurriedly, followed by a stocky working man carrying a basket of tools woven from rushes. Morris paid the driver, who tipped his hat and departed. The two men ascended the steps, and Lord Godalming indicated the task he needed performed. The workman leisurely removed his coat and hung it on one of the railing spikes, exchanging a few words with a policeman who happened to be strolling past. The officer nodded in approval, and the man knelt, placing his tool bag beside him. After rummaging through it, he carefully took out a selection of tools, arranging them neatly beside him. Then he stood, peered into the keyhole, blew into it, and made a comment to his employers. Lord Godalming smiled, and the man produced a significant bunch of keys; selecting one, he began probing the lock, as if feeling the mechanism. After some initial attempts, he tried a second key, then a third. Suddenly, the door swung open with a gentle push from him, and he and the other two entered the entrance hall. We remained still; my cigar burned intensely, while Van Helsing's went out completely. We waited patiently as the workman reappeared to retrieve his bag. He then held the door slightly open, using his knees to steady it, while fitting a key to the lock from the inside. He then handed this key to Lord Godalming, who took out his wallet and compensated him. The man touched his hat, collected his bag, put on his coat, and left. Not a single passerby paid any notice to the entire event. Once the man was clearly gone, the three of us crossed the street and knocked. Quincey Morris immediately opened the door; Lord Godalming stood beside him, lighting a cigar.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Piccadilly, 12:30 p.m.—Shortly before we arrived at Fenchurch Street, Lord Godalming turned to me and said: \"Quincey and I will look for a locksmith. It’s better if you don’t come with us, as there could be trouble. Given the situation, it would look less suspicious for us to break into an empty house, but, as a solicitor, you’re held to a higher standard by the Law Society.\" I objected, not wanting to avoid any possible danger or disapproval, but he insisted: \"Also, fewer people will draw less attention. My title will reassure the locksmith and any policemen as well. You, Jack, and the Professor should stay in Green Park where you can see the house. When the door is open and the locksmith leaves, come over; we’ll let you in.\" Van Helsing agreed that this was wise, so that settled the matter. Godalming and Morris hurried off in a cab while we followed in another. When we reached Arlington Street, our group got out and walked into Green Park. I felt my heart pounding as I looked at the silent, deserted house, our hopes resting on it, especially as it contrasted with the livelier homes nearby. We settled on a bench in clear view of the building and began to smoke cigars to appear inconspicuous. Time passed slowly as we waited for the others.\n\nEventually, a four-wheeled cab arrived, and Godalming and Morris stepped out calmly, followed by a burly workman carrying a basket of tools. Morris paid the cabman, who left after tipping his hat. The pair walked up the steps where Godalming explained what was needed. The locksmith unhurriedly took off his coat and hung it on the rail, exchanged a few words with a strolling policeman, who nodded, and, kneeling down, pulled out his tools and arranged them methodically. After checking the keyhole and chatting with his employers—at which Godalming smiled—the locksmith selected a key from a large bunch and tried it in the lock. After several attempts with different keys, he managed to open the door with a gentle push, and the three went inside. We remained where we were; my cigar burned quickly, while Van Helsing’s went out completely. We watched as the workman returned, collected his tools, and then braced the door with his knee while fitting a key to the lock. Finally, he gave the key to Lord Godalming, who paid him. The workman then took his belongings and left without attracting any attention.\n\nOnce he was gone, the three of us crossed the street and knocked on the door.

It did indeed smell vilely—like the old chapel at Carfax—and with our previous experience it was plain to us that the Count had been using the place pretty freely. We moved to explore the house, all keeping together in case of attack; for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy to deal with, and as yet we did not know whether the Count might not be in the house. In the dining-room, which lay at the back of the hall, we found eight boxes of earth. Eight boxes only out of the nine, which we sought! Our work was not over, and would never be until we should have found the missing box. First we opened the shutters of the window which looked out across a narrow stone-flagged yard at the blank face of a stable, pointed to look like the front of a miniature house. There were no windows in it, so we were not afraid of being over-looked. We did not lose any time in examining the chests. With the tools which we had brought with us we opened them, one by one, and treated them as we had treated those others in the old chapel. It was evident to us that the Count was not at present in the house, and we proceeded to search for any of his effects.\nAfter a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to attic, we came to the conclusion that the dining-room contained any effects which might belong to the Count; and so we proceeded to minutely examine them. They lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great dining-room table. There were title deeds of the Piccadilly house in a great bundle; deeds of the purchase of the houses at Mile End and Bermondsey; note-paper, envelopes, and pens and ink. All were covered up in thin wrapping paper to keep them from the dust. There were also a clothes brush, a brush and comb, and a jug and basin—the latter containing dirty water which was reddened as if with blood. Last of all was a little heap of keys of all sorts and sizes, probably those belonging to the other houses. When we had examined this last find, Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the houses in the East and the South, took with them the keys in a great bunch, and set out to destroy the boxes in these places. The rest of us are, with what patience we can, waiting their return—or the coming of the Count.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Upon entering the house, one of us commented on the terrible smell, which was indeed repulsive and brought to mind the foul odor at the old chapel in Carfax. Given our previous encounters, it was obvious that the Count had been using the place extensively. We proceeded to explore the house together, staying as a group in case of an attack, since we knew we were dealing with a powerful and cunning adversary and were unsure if the Count was currently inside. In the dining room, located at the rear of the hall, we discovered eight earth-filled boxes. Only eight out of the nine we were searching for! Our task was unfinished and would remain so until the missing box was located. We first opened the shutters of the window which overlooked a narrow, stone-paved yard and the plain face of a stable designed to look like a tiny house facade. It had no windows, so we weren't concerned about being overlooked. We wasted no time examining the chests. Using the tools we had brought, we opened them one by one and dealt with them as we had the ones at the old chapel. It was clear to us that the Count was not presently in the house, so we began searching for any of his possessions. After a quick inspection of the other rooms, from the basement to the attic, we concluded that any belongings belonging to the Count were likely in the dining room; therefore, we began a thorough examination of the items there. They were arranged on the large dining room table in a somewhat disorganized but accessible manner. Among them were a large bundle of title deeds for the Piccadilly house, documents concerning the purchase of properties in Mile End and Bermondsey, and stationery including notepaper, envelopes, pens, and ink. All were covered with thin wrapping paper to protect them from dust. There were also a clothes brush, a brush and comb, and a jug and basin—the latter containing dirty water that was reddish, as if stained with blood. Lastly, there was a small pile of keys of various types and sizes, likely belonging to the other houses. After we had finished examining these final discoveries, Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris, who had meticulously noted the addresses of the houses in the East and South, took the large bunch of keys with them and set off to destroy the boxes in those locations.

The stench was indeed awful—much like the old chapel at Carfax—and from what we’d already experienced, it was clear the Count had spent a lot of time here. We proceeded to investigate the house, staying close together in case of danger; we knew our adversary was both cunning and formidable, and we couldn’t be sure he wasn’t inside. In the dining-room at the back of the main hall, we discovered eight boxes of earth—only eight out of the nine we were searching for! Our task was still unfinished; we had to track down the missing box. We started by opening the shutters of a window overlooking a narrow stone-covered yard, facing a windowless stable constructed to resemble a small house; since there were no windows, we felt secure from prying eyes. We wasted no time opening the boxes, using the tools we’d brought to treat them as we had the others at Carfax chapel. It was clear the Count wasn’t in the house at that moment, so we began looking for his belongings. After quickly checking every room from top to bottom, we realized the dining-room probably held anything of his left behind, so we thoroughly examined its contents. They were arranged in neat, apparent disorder on the large table: there were property deeds for the Piccadilly house, papers for the houses at Mile End and Bermondsey, writing materials—all neatly wrapped to avoid dust. We also found a clothes brush, another brush and comb, and a jug and basin, the water in it stained red as though with blood. Finally, we discovered a small pile of keys of varying types and sizes, likely for the other houses. Once we’d examined everything, Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris carefully noted the different addresses in the East and South, gathered up the keys, and left to destroy the boxes at those locations.

          "text_segment": "3 October.—The time seemed terribly long whilst we were waiting for the coming of Godalming and Quincey Morris. The Professor tried to keep our minds active by using them all the time. I could see his beneficent purpose, by the side glances which he threw from time to time at Harker. The poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to see. Last night he was a frank, happy-looking man, with strong, youthful face, full of energy, and with dark brown hair. To-day he is a drawn, haggard old man, whose white hair matches well with the hollow burning eyes and grief-written lines of his face. His energy is still intact; in fact, he is like a living flame. This may yet be his salvation, for, if all go well, it will tide him over the despairing period; he will then, in a kind of way, wake again to the realities of life. Poor fellow, I thought my own trouble was bad enough, but his——! The Professor knows this well enough, and is doing his best to keep his mind active. What he has been saying was, under the circumstances, of absorbing interest. So well as I can remember, here it is:—\n“I have studied, over and over again since they came into my hands, all the papers relating to this monster; and the more I have studied, the greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out. All through there are signs of his advance; not only of his power, but of his knowledge of it. As I learned from the researches of my friend Arminus of Buda-Pesth, he was in life a most wonderful man. Soldier, statesman, and alchemist—which latter was the highest development of the science-knowledge of his time. He had a mighty brain, a learning beyond compare, and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse. He dared even to attend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledge of his time that he did not essay. Well, in him the brain powers survived the physical death; though it would seem that memory was not all complete. In some faculties of mind he has been, and is, only a child; but he is growing, and some things that were childish at the first are now of man’s stature. He is experimenting, and doing it well; and if it had not been that we have crossed his path he would be yet—he may be yet if we fail—the father or furtherer of a new order of beings, whose road must lead through Death, not Life.”\nHarker groaned and said, “And this is all arrayed against my darling! But how is he experimenting? The knowledge may help us to defeat him!”\n“He has all along, since his coming, been trying his power, slowly but surely; that big child-brain of his is working. Well for us, it is, as yet, a child-brain; for had he dared, at the first, to attempt certain things he would long ago have been beyond our power. However, he means to succeed, and a man who has centuries before him can afford to wait and to go slow. Festina lente may well be his motto.”\n“I fail to understand,” said Harker wearily. “Oh, do be more plain to me! Perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain.”\nThe Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke:—\n“Ah, my child, I will be plain. Do you not see how, of late, this monster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally. How he has been making use of the zoöphagous patient to effect his entry into friend John’s home; for your Vampire, though in all afterwards he can come when and how he will, must at the first make entry only when asked thereto by an inmate. But these are not his most important experiments. Do we not see how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others. He knew not then but that must be so. But all the time that so great child-brain of his was growing, and he began to consider whether he might not himself move the box. So he began to help; and then, when he found that this be all-right, he try to move them all alone. And so he progress, and he scatter these graves of him; and none but he know where they are hidden. He may have intend to bury them deep in the ground. So that he only use them in the night, or at such time as he can change his form, they do him equal well; and none may know these are his hiding-place! But, my child, do not despair; this knowledge come to him just too late! Already all of his lairs but one be sterilise as for him; and before the sunset this shall be so. Then he have no place where he can move and hide. I delayed this morning that so we might be sure. Is there not more at stake for us than for him? Then why we not be even more careful than him? By my clock it is one hour and already, if all be well, friend Arthur and Quincey are on their way to us. To-day is our day, and we must go sure, if slow, and lose no chance. See! there are five of us when those absent ones return.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "October 3rd.—The wait for Godalming and Quincey Morris felt incredibly long. The Professor tried to keep our minds engaged by occupying us constantly. I could see his benevolent intent from the side glances he occasionally cast at Harker. The poor man is overcome by a despair that is dreadful to witness. Last night, he was a cheerful, healthy-looking man with a strong, youthful face full of energy and dark brown hair. Today, he is a gaunt, haggard old man whose white hair matches the hollow, burning eyes and lines etched by grief on his face. Yet, his energy is undiminished; in fact, he is like a living flame. This vitality might still be his salvation, for if things go well, it will help him through this period of hopelessness, and he will, in a way, reawaken to the realities of life. Poor fellow, I thought my own troubles were bad enough, but his...! The Professor understands this well and is doing his best to keep his mind occupied. What he was saying was, given the circumstances, of compelling interest. As best as I can recall, here it is:\n\n\"I have studied, again and again since they came into my possession, all the documents related to this creature; and the more I have studied, the greater seems the need to utterly destroy him. Throughout, there are indications of his progress; not just his power, but his understanding of it. As I learned from the research of my friend Arminius of Buda-Pesth, he was in life a most extraordinary man. A soldier, statesman, and alchemist—the latter being the highest form of scientific knowledge of his time. He possessed a vast intellect, unparalleled learning, and a heart that knew no fear and no mercy. He even dared to attend the Scholomance, and there was no field of knowledge from his era that he did not attempt to master. Well, in him, the powers of the mind survived physical death; although it appears memory was not entirely complete. In some mental capacities, he has been, and remains, only a child; but he is developing, and some things that were infantile at first are now fully grown. He is experimenting, and doing so effectively; and if we had not interfered, he would still be—he may yet be if we fail—the originator or promoter of a new species of beings whose existence must be rooted in Death, not Life.\"\n\nHarker groaned and said, \"And all of this is arrayed against my beloved! But how is he experimenting? That knowledge might help us defeat him!\"\n\n\"He has been, since his arrival, testing his abilities, slowly but surely; that immense child-brain of his is active. It is fortunate for us that it is, as yet, a child-brain; for had he dared, at the beginning, to attempt certain actions, he would long ago have been beyond our reach. However, he intends to succeed, and a man with centuries ahead of him can afford to wait and proceed cautiously. 'Festina lente' could easily be his motto.\"\n\n\"I fail to grasp it,\" Harker said wearily. \"Oh, please be clearer for me! Perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my intellect.\"\n\nThe Professor laid his hand gently on his shoulder as he spoke:\n\n\"Ah, my child, I will be plain. Do you not see how, recently, this creature has been gaining knowledge through experiments? How he has been utilizing the zoöphagous patient to gain entry into friend John’s house? For your Vampire, though afterwards he can enter when and how he wishes, must initially enter only when invited by a resident. But these are not his most significant experiments. Do we not see how initially all these numerous boxes were moved by others? He did not know then but that this had to be the case. But all the while that immense child-brain of his was growing, and he began to consider whether he might not move the box himself. So he began to help; and then, when he found that this was possible, he tried moving them entirely alone. And thus he progressed, and he scattered these burial places of his; and only he knows where they are concealed. He may have intended to bury them deep underground. As long as he only utilizes them at night, or at such times as he can alter his form, they serve him equally well; and no one may discover these are his hiding-places! But, my child, do not lose hope; this realization came to him just too late! Already all of his dwelling-places but one have been rendered sterile as for him; and before the sun sets this shall be the case. Then he will have no location where he can move freely and conceal himself. I delayed this morning so that we might be absolutely certain. Are the stakes not higher for us than for him? Then why should we not be even more vigilant than him? By my watch, it is one hour past, and already, if all is well, friend Arthur and Quincey are on their way to join us. Today is our opportunity, and we must proceed confidently, even if slowly, and miss no opportunity. Look! there will be five of us when those who are away return.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "October 3.—The wait for Godalming and Quincey Morris felt unbearably long. The Professor tried to keep us occupied, clearly intending to distract us, as I noticed from the glances he gave Harker. Poor Harker looked utterly broken, a striking change from last night when he had appeared youthful and energetic, with dark hair. Today, he looks aged, with white hair and a face deeply marked by grief, though his spirit remains. This energy may help him survive his despair until he can once more face reality. My own troubles seem small compared to his. The Professor is aware of Harker's state and does his best to engage his mind, presenting some truly insightful observations. As best I recall, he said:\n\n“I have repeatedly studied all documents about this monster, and the more I delve into them, the clearer it becomes that we must completely destroy him. There is evidence everywhere of his increasing powers and awareness of them. According to my friend Arminus of Buda-Pesth, in life the Count was extraordinary—a soldier, statesman, and alchemist, excelling in the sciences of his era. He was fearless and unrepentant, even attending the Scholomance to learn forbidden knowledges. His intellect survived his body’s death, though his memory is not perfect. In some ways he’s like a child, but he’s learning and maturing. He is experimenting, and if we hadn’t opposed him, he might be on his way to founding a new breed of beings who travel through Death rather than Life.”\n\nHarker groaned, “All this is set against my dear wife! But what experiments is he trying? That insight could help us stop him!”\n\nThe Professor replied, “Since his arrival, he has been steadily testing his abilities. Thankfully his mind is still in some ways childlike; if he’d tried certain things earlier, he might now be beyond our reach. But with centuries to perfect his plans, he can afford patience—‘make haste slowly’ may be his motto.”\n\n“I don’t follow you,” said Harker, exhausted. “Please explain more plainly—I can hardly think from grief.”\n\nTenderly, the Professor explained, “See how this monster has been learning through trial and error. For example, he used the zoöphagous patient to get into your friend John’s house, since a vampire must first be invited in by someone living there. But there are more important matters. Initially, others moved his boxes for him; he may not have known he could do so himself. As his mind grew, he began trying it himself, and eventually managed it alone. By doing so, he scattered his hiding places where only he knows their locations, possibly burying them so he can use them at night or in other forms. But don’t despair—he learned this skill too late. All but one of his lairs are now rendered useless to him, and by sunset that last one will be as well. That’s why I waited this morning, to ensure we are thorough. Our stakes are higher than his, so we must be even more careful. It’s now one o’clock, and if all has gone well, Arthur and Quincey are on their way. Once they join us, we’ll be five, and today is the day we must act—carefully but without delay.”"

That he went south has a meaning for us. He is as yet only suspicious; and he went from Carfax first to the place where he would suspect interference least. You must have been at Bermondsey only a short time before him. That he is not here already shows that he went to Mile End next. This took him some time; for he would then have to be carried over the river in some way. Believe me, my friends, we shall not have long to wait now.

In all our hunting parties and adventures in different parts of the world, Quincey Morris had always been the one to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I had been accustomed to obey him implicitly. Now, the old habit seemed to be renewed instinctively. With a swift glance around the room, he at once laid out our plan of attack, and, without speaking a word, with a gesture, placed us each in position. Van Helsing, Harker, and I were just behind the door, so that when it was opened the Professor could guard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door. Godalming behind and Quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to move in front of the window. We waited in a suspense that made the seconds pass with nightmare slowness. The slow, careful steps came along the hall; the Count was evidently prepared for some surprise—at least he feared it.\nSuddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room, winning a way past us before any of us could raise a hand to stay him. There was something so panther-like in the movement—something so unhuman, that it seemed to sober us all from the shock of his coming. The first to act was Harker, who, with a quick movement, threw himself before the door leading into the room in the front of the house. As the Count saw us, a horrible sort of snarl passed over his face, showing the eye-teeth long and pointed; but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare of lion-like disdain. His expression again changed as, with a single impulse, we all advanced upon him. It was a pity that we had not some better organised plan of attack, for even at the moment I wondered what we were to do. I did not myself know whether our lethal weapons would avail us anything. Harker evidently meant to try the matter, for he had ready his great Kukri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him. The blow was a powerful one; only the diabolical quickness of the Count’s leap back saved him. A second less and the trenchant blade had shorne through his heart. As it was, the point just cut the cloth of his coat, making a wide gap whence a bundle of bank-notes and a stream of gold fell out. The expression of the Count’s face was so hellish, that for a moment I feared for Harker, though I saw him throw the terrible knife aloft again for another stroke. Instinctively I moved forward with a protective impulse, holding the Crucifix and Wafer in my left hand. I felt a mighty power fly along my arm; and it was without surprise that I saw the monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneously by each one of us. It would be impossible to describe the expression of hate and baffled malignity—of anger and hellish rage—which came over the Count’s face. His waxen hue became greenish-yellow by the contrast of his burning eyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on the pallid skin like a palpitating wound. The next instant, with a sinuous dive he swept under Harker’s arm, ere his blow could fall, and, grasping a handful of the money from the floor, dashed across the room, threw himself at the window. Amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass, he tumbled into the flagged area below. Through the sound of the shivering glass I could hear the “ting” of the gold, as some of the sovereigns fell on the flagging.\nWe ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground. He, rushing up the steps, crossed the flagged yard, and pushed open the stable door. There he turned and spoke to us:—\n“You think to baffle me, you—with your pale faces all in a row, like sheep in a butcher’s. You shall be sorry yet, each one of you! You think you have left me without a place to rest; but I have more. My revenge is just begun! I spread it over centuries, and time is on my side. Your girls that you all love are mine already; and through them you and others shall yet be mine—my creatures, to do my bidding and to be my jackals when I want to feed. Bah!” With a contemptuous sneer, he passed quickly through the door, and we heard the rusty bolt creak as he fastened it behind him. A door beyond opened and shut.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Even at that tense moment, I couldn't help but admire the display of strong leadership. In all our adventures and hunts across the globe, Quincey Morris had consistently been the one to strategize our actions, and Arthur and I had always followed his lead without question. This established pattern seemed to reassert itself naturally. With a quick sweep of the room, he instantly devised our offensive plan, and without a word, guided each of us into position with a simple hand signal. Van Helsing, Harker, and I were positioned right behind the entrance door. This way, when it was opened, the Professor could secure it while Harker and I positioned ourselves between the person entering and the door. Godalming took a spot behind, and Quincey in front, both just out of view, ready to move in front of the window. We waited in a state of nervous anticipation that made the seconds crawl by with agonizing slowness, like a nightmare. The slow, deliberate footsteps approached down the corridor; the Count was clearly anticipating a trap, or at least he was cautious of one. Suddenly, with a single, powerful leap, he sprang into the room, managing to slip past us before any of us could react to stop him. There was something so feline and utterly inhuman about his movement that it seemed to shock us all into a moment of clarity after the initial surprise. Harker was the first to recover, swiftly positioning himself in front of the door leading to the adjacent front room. As the Count spotted us, his face twisted into a dreadful snarl, revealing his long, sharp fangs. But this malicious grin quickly dissolved into a cold, lion-like expression of disdain. His look shifted again as, driven by a shared impulse, we all moved towards him. It was unfortunate that our attack wasn't better coordinated, as even then I found myself wondering what exactly we were supposed to do. I wasn't sure if our chosen weapons would even affect him. Harker, however, clearly intended to find out, holding his large Kukri knife ready and launching a fierce, sudden strike. The blow was powerful; only the Count's unnervingly quick backward leap saved him. A split second slower, and the sharp blade would have severed his heart. As it happened, the tip merely sliced the fabric of his coat, creating a wide tear from which a packet of banknotes and a stream of gold coins tumbled out. The Count's expression became so utterly demonic that for a moment I feared for Harker, even as I saw him raise the formidable knife again for another attempt. Driven by instinct, I stepped forward protectively, holding the Crucifix and Wafer in my left hand. I felt a surge of immense power travel up my arm, and I wasn't surprised to see the monster recoil in fear from a similar, simultaneous action taken by each of us. It would be impossible to describe the look of pure hatred, frustrated evil, intense anger, and hellish fury that contorted the Count's face. His waxy skin turned a sickly greenish-yellow against the intense glow of his eyes, and the red scar on his forehead pulsed on his pale skin like a fresh wound. The next instant, with a fluid, snake-like motion, he ducked under Harker's arm before the second blow could land, grabbed a handful of the fallen money from the floor, dashed across the room, and threw himself at the window. Amidst the shattering and glinting of falling glass, he tumbled out into the paved area below. Through the sound of the breaking glass, I could hear the distinct 'ting' of gold as some of the sovereign coins hit the stone paving. We rushed to the window and saw him spring up from the ground unharmed. He then sprinted up the steps, across the paved yard, and shoved open the stable door. There, he paused, turned, and spoke to us: 'You believe you can thwart me, you lot – standing there with your pale faces all in a line, like sheep waiting for the butcher. You will regret this, every single one of you! You think you've left me nowhere to rest; but I have more places. My vengeance has only just begun! I will spread it across centuries, and time is my ally. The girls you all cherish are already mine; and through them, you and others will become mine – my obedient creatures, to do my will and to act as my scavengers when I need to feed. Bah!' With a sneer of utter contempt, he quickly went through the door, and we heard the rusty bolt groan as he secured it from within. Another door beyond opened and then closed.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Even in such a tense situation, I couldn’t help but admire how a strong leader naturally took charge. Throughout all our past adventures, Quincey Morris had always been the one to set our strategy, and Arthur and I instinctively fell into our old roles of following his lead. Now, with just a look around, he quickly formed our plan and silently guided us into position. Van Helsing, Harker, and I stood just behind the door, ready so that the Professor could guard it while Harker and I intercepted anyone coming in. Godalming and Quincey waited just out of sight to the front and back, prepared to block the window. We waited, tense and anxious, as each second dragged by. Slow, deliberate steps echoed in the hallway; it was clear the Count was expecting trouble.\n\nSuddenly, with incredible speed, the Count leapt into the room and darted past us before we could react. His movement was animalistic, almost panther-like, which snapped us all to a startled alertness. Harker was the first to respond, jumping to block the door to the front of the house. When the Count saw us, his face twisted into a terrible snarl, showing his long pointed teeth, before quickly shifting to a cold, disdainful stare. As we all advanced on him together, I half-regretted that our attack wasn’t better planned. I didn’t even know if our weapons would be effective. Harker, though, was determined and swung his large Kukri knife at the Count with force. Only the Count’s supernatural speed saved him; the knife barely missed, instead slitting his coat and spilling banknotes and gold onto the floor. The Count’s look was so sinister that I worried for Harker, seeing him prepare for another strike. Without thinking, I stepped forward to protect him, holding my Crucifix and Wafer out. I felt a powerful force surge through me, and wasn’t surprised when the monster recoiled, as did all of us acting in unison. The hate and rage on the Count’s face were indescribable—his pale skin turned greenish-yellow against his burning eyes, the red scar on his forehead standing out like an open wound. In a flash, he slipped beneath Harker’s arm before another blow could land, grabbed some of the money from the floor, and hurled himself through the window. Amid the shattering glass, I heard the clink of coins as they spilled.\n\nWe rushed to see him land safely below, dash across the yard, and enter the stables. There, he turned to us and spoke:\n\n“You believe you can defeat me, standing there like pale sheep. But you will all regret this! You may think you’ve taken away all my hiding places, but I have more. My revenge has only just started! It will last for centuries, and time is in my favor. The women you love are already mine; through them, I’ll claim you and many more, turning you into my servants, to do my bidding and help me feed. Bah!” With a sneer, he left, slamming the door and bolting it tight behind him. Then another door opened and closed beyond."

We had to recognise that our game was up; with heavy hearts we agreed with the Professor when he said:—\n“Let us go back to Madam Mina—poor, poor dear Madam Mina. All we can do just now is done; and we can there, at least, protect her. But we need not despair. There is but one more earth-box, and we must try to find it; when that is done all may yet be well.” I could see that he spoke as bravely as he could to comfort Harker. The poor fellow was quite broken down; now and again he gave a low groan which he could not suppress—he was thinking of his wife.\nWith sad hearts we came back to my house, where we found Mrs. Harker waiting us, with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to her bravery and unselfishness. When she saw our faces, her own became as pale as death: for a second or two her eyes were closed as if she were in secret prayer; and then she said cheerfully:—\n“I can never thank you all enough. Oh, my poor darling!” As she spoke, she took her husband’s grey head in her hands and kissed it—“Lay your poor head here and rest it. All will yet be well, dear! God will protect us if He so will it in His good intent.” The poor fellow groaned. There was no place for words in his sublime misery.\nWe had a sort of perfunctory supper together, and I think it cheered us all up somewhat. It was, perhaps, the mere animal heat of food to hungry people—for none of us had eaten anything since breakfast—or the sense of companionship may have helped us; but anyhow we were all less miserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope. True to our promise, we told Mrs. Harker everything which had passed; and although she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to threaten her husband, and red at others when his devotion to her was manifested, she listened bravely and with calmness. When we came to the part where Harker had rushed at the Count so recklessly, she clung to her husband’s arm, and held it tight as though her clinging could protect him from any harm that might come. She said nothing, however, till the narration was all done, and matters had been brought right up to the present time. Then without letting go her husband’s hand she stood up amongst us and spoke.",

But we mustn't despair; only one earth-box remains, and if we can find it, things may still turn out well.\" I could see he was trying his best to offer comfort to Harker, who was utterly broken. Every so often, the poor man would let out a low, irrepressible groan, consumed by thoughts of his wife. We returned sadly to my house, where Mrs. Harker was waiting. She put on a cheerful front, which spoke volumes about her bravery and lack of self-concern. However, the moment she saw our faces, she turned deathly pale. For a couple of seconds, her eyes closed as if in silent prayer, before she spoke cheerfully, \"I can never thank you all enough. Oh, my poor darling!\" She then took her husband's grey head in her hands, kissed it, and said, \"Lay your poor head here and rest. Everything will be alright, dear! God will watch over us if that is His plan.\" The poor fellow groaned again, his profound suffering leaving him unable to speak. We had a somewhat obligatory supper together, and I think it did help to improve our spirits a little. Perhaps it was just the simple warmth of food for hungry people – none of us had eaten since breakfast – or maybe the comfort of shared company, but whatever the reason, we felt less miserable and viewed the coming day with some degree of hope. Keeping our promise, we told Mrs. Harker everything that had happened. She listened bravely and calmly, though she turned stark white when discussing moments of danger to her husband and blushed when his deep love for her was mentioned.

Harker could only groan in his anguish, beyond the comfort of words.\n\nWe shared a rather routine supper, which seemed to lift our spirits a little—perhaps just because we’d all been hungry since breakfast, or maybe the companionship helped as well.

As she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet, almost tearing his hand from hers as he spoke:—\n“May God give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy that earthly life of him which we are aiming at. If beyond it I could send his soul for ever and ever to burning hell I would do it!”\n“Oh, hush! oh, hush! in the name of the good God. Don’t say such things, Jonathan, my husband; or you will crush me with fear and horror. Just think, my dear—I have been thinking all this long, long day of it—that ... perhaps ... some day ... I, too, may need such pity; and that some other like you—and with equal cause for anger—may deny it to me! Oh, my husband! my husband, indeed I would have spared you such a thought had there been another way; but I pray that God may not have treasured your wild words, except as the heart-broken wail of a very loving and sorely stricken man. Oh, God, let these poor white hairs go in evidence of what he has suffered, who all his life has done no wrong, and on whom so many sorrows have come.”\nWe men were all in tears now. There was no resisting them, and we wept openly. She wept, too, to see that her sweeter counsels had prevailed. Her husband flung himself on his knees beside her, and putting his arms round her, hid his face in the folds of her dress. Van Helsing beckoned to us and we stole out of the room, leaving the two loving hearts alone with their God.",

Don’t say such things, Jonathan, my husband; you are overwhelming me with fear and horror. My dear, just think—I’ve been thinking about this all through this long day—that perhaps someday, I, too, might need such pity; and that someone else like you—and with equal cause for anger—might deny it to me! Oh, my husband! My husband, I truly wish I could have spared you such a thought had there been another way; but I pray that God does not hold your wild words against you, seeing them only as the heartbroken cry of a very loving and deeply suffering man. Oh, God, let my poor white hair stand as proof of what he has suffered, a man who has lived his entire life without doing wrong, yet on whom so many sorrows have fallen.” All of us men were now in tears. We couldn't help it and wept openly. She also shed tears, seeing that her gentler words had been effective.

If I could, I would send his soul to eternal damnation!”\n\nShe replied, “Please, don’t say that, Jonathan, my husband; such words fill me with dread. Consider, my love—I have been contemplating all day—that it’s possible someday I, too, may need compassion; and someone with reason to be angry might refuse it to me! Oh, my husband! I wish I could spare you from even thinking this, but I pray that God hears your outburst only as the desperate lament of a loving man deeply hurt. May God see these grey hairs as testimony to all you have suffered—a good man beset by so many sorrows.”\n\nAll of us men were moved to tears and we cried openly. She also wept, seeing that her gentler words had touched him. Her husband dropped to his knees beside her, wrapped his arms around her, and hid his face in her skirt.

There was over me a yearning for sleep, in some sort of blind belief that to wake would be to find things changed, and that any change must now be for the better. Before we parted, we discussed what our next step was to be, but we could arrive at no result. All we knew was that one earth-box remained, and that the Count alone knew where it was. If he chooses to lie hidden, he may baffle us for years; and in the meantime!—the thought is too horrible, I dare not think of it even now.

Surely God will not permit the world to be the poorer by the loss of such a creature. This is hope to me. We are all drifting reefwards now, and faith is our only anchor. Thank God! Mina is sleeping, and sleeping without dreams. I fear what her dreams might be like, with such terrible memories to ground them in. She has not been so calm, within my seeing, since the sunset.

Thank God! Mina is asleep, and sleeping peacefully without dreams. I dread to imagine what her dreams might be like, given the terrible experiences she has endured. I haven't seen her look so calm since sunset. For a while then, a sense of peace settled on her face, like the tranquility of spring after harsh winds.

Mina gazed at him fixedly for a few minutes, during which my own heart beat like a trip hammer, for I felt that some crisis was at hand. Gradually her eyes closed, and she sat, stock still; only by the gentle heaving of her bosom could one know that she was alive. The Professor made a few more passes and then stopped, and I could see that his forehead was covered with great beads of perspiration. Mina opened her eyes; but she did not seem the same woman. There was a far-away look in her eyes, and her voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me. Raising his hand to impose silence, the Professor motioned to me to bring the others in. They came on tip-toe, closing the door behind them, and stood at the foot of the bed, looking on. Mina appeared not to see them. The stillness was broken by Van Helsing’s voice speaking in a low level tone which would not break the current of her thoughts:—\n“Where are you?” The answer came in a neutral way:—\n“I do not know. Sleep has no place it can call its own.” For several minutes there was silence. Mina sat rigid, and the Professor stood staring at her fixedly; the rest of us hardly dared to breathe. The room was growing lighter; without taking his eyes from Mina’s face, Dr. Van Helsing motioned me to pull up the blind. I did so, and the day seemed just upon us. A red streak shot up, and a rosy light seemed to diffuse itself through the room. On the instant the Professor spoke again:—\n“Where are you now?” The answer came dreamily, but with intention; it were as though she were interpreting something. I have heard her use the same tone when reading her shorthand notes.\n“I do not know. It is all strange to me!”\n“What do you see?”\n“I can see nothing; it is all dark.”\n“What do you hear?” I could detect the strain in the Professor’s patient voice.\n“The lapping of water. It is gurgling by, and little waves leap. I can hear them on the outside.”\n“Then you are on a ship?” We all looked at each other, trying to glean something each from the other. We were afraid to think. The answer came quick:—\n“Oh, yes!”\n“What else do you hear?”\n“The sound of men stamping overhead as they run about. There is the creaking of a chain, and the loud tinkle as the check of the capstan falls into the rachet.”\n“What are you doing?”\n“I am still—oh, so still. It is like death!” The voice faded away into a deep breath as of one sleeping, and the open eyes closed again.",

For a few minutes, Mina stared back at him steadily. During this time, my heart pounded like a hammer, sensing that a critical moment was upon us. Gradually, her eyes closed, and she became completely still. Her gentle breathing was the only indication that she was alive. After making a few more passes, the Professor stopped. I could see his forehead was covered in large drops of sweat. Mina opened her eyes, but she seemed changed. Her gaze was distant, and her voice had a sad, dreamy quality that was new to me. Raising his hand to signal for quiet, the Professor motioned for me to bring the others in. They entered silently, closing the door behind them, and stood at the foot of the bed, watching. Mina appeared not to notice them. The silence was broken by Van Helsing's voice, speaking in a low, steady tone designed not to disrupt her thoughts: \"Where are you?\" Her answer was neutral: \"I don't know. Sleep has no single dwelling place.\" Silence followed for several minutes. Mina remained rigid, and the Professor stared fixedly at her. The rest of us hardly dared to breathe. The room was growing brighter. Without taking his eyes off Mina's face, Dr. Van Helsing gestured for me to open the blind. I did so, and it seemed full daylight was almost here. A red line appeared on the horizon, and a soft, rosy light seemed to spread through the room. Instantly, the Professor spoke again: \"Where are you now?\" The answer came dreamily but purposefully, as if she were interpreting something – a tone I had heard her use when reading her shorthand notes. \"I don't know. It's all strange to me!\" \"What do you see?\" \"I can't see anything; it's completely dark.\" \"What do you hear?\" I could detect the strain in the Professor's patient voice. \"Water lapping. It's gurgling alongside, and little waves are jumping. I can hear them outside.\" \"Then you are on a ship?\" We all looked at each other, trying to find meaning. We were afraid to even think. Her answer came quickly: \"Oh, yes!\" \"What else do you hear?\" \"The sound of men stomping overhead as they move around. There's the squeaking of a chain, and the loud metal clink as the capstan's pawl drops into the ratchet.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"I am still—oh, so still. It's like death!\" Her voice trailed off into a deep sigh, like someone sleeping, and her open eyes closed once more.",

Mina stared back intently for several minutes, during which I felt my heart pounding anxiously, sensing something important was about to happen. Gradually, her eyes closed and she became motionless, except for the gentle rise and fall of her chest that showed she was still breathing. The Professor made a few more hand movements, then stopped, visibly sweating. When Mina opened her eyes, she seemed changed; her gaze was distant and her voice held a new, sad dreaminess. The Professor raised his hand to signal silence and gestured for me to bring in the others, who entered quietly and stood at the end of the bed, closing the door behind them. Mina didn’t appear to notice their presence. Then, Van Helsing spoke softly, keeping the mood undisturbed: “Where are you?” She replied in an indifferent tone, “I do not know. Sleep has no home.” Silence followed for several minutes. Mina remained stiff, and the Professor watched her closely while the rest of us hardly dared to breathe. As the room brightened with the approaching dawn, Van Helsing motioned me to open the blinds. I did, letting in the new day’s rosy light. Immediately, the Professor asked again, “Where are you now?” She responded dreamily, as if translating something, using a tone I recognized from her shorthand dictations: “I do not know. It is all unfamiliar to me!” “What do you see?” he asked. “I see nothing; it’s all darkness.” “What do you hear?” His voice was gently insistent. “The sound of water lapping. It gurgles by, and small waves jump—I hear them outside.” “Then you are on a ship?” We all exchanged nervous glances. She answered quickly, “Oh, yes!” “What else do you hear?” “Men running overhead, chains creaking, the loud click as the capstan’s catch falls into place.” “What are you doing?” “I am still—so very still. It feels like death!” Her voice trailed away and her eyes closed as if she had fallen deeply asleep."

She lay like a sleeping child for a few moments, and then, with a long sigh, awoke and stared in wonder to see us all around her. “Have I been talking in my sleep?” was all she said. She seemed, however, to know the situation without telling, though she was eager to know what she had told. The Professor repeated the conversation, and she said:—\n“Then there is not a moment to lose: it may not be yet too late!” Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming started for the door but the Professor’s calm voice called them back:—\n“Stay, my friends. That ship, wherever it was, was weighing anchor whilst she spoke. There are many ships weighing anchor at the moment in your so great Port of London. Which of them is it that you seek? God be thanked that we have once again a clue, though whither it may lead us we know not. We have been blind somewhat; blind after the manner of men, since when we can look back we see what we might have seen looking forward if we had been able to see what we might have seen! Alas, but that sentence is a puddle; is it not? We can know now what was in the Count’s mind, when he seize that money, though Jonathan’s so fierce knife put him in the danger that even he dread. He meant escape. Hear me, ESCAPE! He saw that with but one earth-box left, and a pack of men following like dogs after a fox, this London was no place for him. He have take his last earth-box on board a ship, and he leave the land. He think to escape, but no! we follow him. Tally Ho! as friend Arthur would say when he put on his red frock! Our old fox is wily; oh! so wily, and we must follow with wile. I, too, am wily and I think his mind in a little while. In meantime we may rest and in peace, for there are waters between us which he do not want to pass, and which he could not if he would—unless the ship were to touch the land, and then only at full or slack tide. See, and the sun is just rose, and all day to sunset is to us. Let us take bath, and dress, and have breakfast which we all need, and which we can eat comfortably since he be not in the same land with us.” Mina looked at him appealingly as she asked:—\n“But why need we seek him further, when he is gone away from us?” He took her hand and patted it as he replied:—\n“Ask me nothings as yet. When we have breakfast, then I answer all questions.” He would say no more, and we separated to dress.\nAfter breakfast Mina repeated her question. He looked at her gravely for a minute and then said sorrowfully:—\n“Because my dear, dear Madam Mina, now more than ever must we find him even if we have to follow him to the jaws of Hell!” She grew paler as she asked faintly:—\n“Why?”\n“Because,” he answered solemnly, “he can live for centuries, and you are but mortal woman. Time is now to be dreaded—since once he put that mark upon your throat.”\nI was just in time to catch her as she fell forward in a faint.",

Dr. Van Helsing gently placed his hands on Mina's shoulders and eased her head back onto her pillow. For a few moments, she lay as if in deep sleep. Then, with a long sigh, she opened her eyes, looking around at us with surprise. Her first words were, 'Have I been talking in my sleep?' Although she seemed to grasp the general situation without being told, she was eager to know precisely what information she had revealed. After the Professor recounted their conversation, she exclaimed, 'Then we mustn't waste a second; it might still be possible!' Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming immediately moved towards the door, but the Professor's calm voice stopped them. 'Wait, my friends,' he said. 'That ship, wherever it was, was already sailing away as she spoke. Your great Port of London is teeming with ships setting sail right now. Which specific one are you looking for? We should be thankful that we have a clue, even if we don't yet know where it will lead. We have been somewhat blind, blind in the way men often are, seeing clearly in hindsight what we should have seen looking ahead, if only we had been able! Ah, but that explanation is a tangled mess, isn't it? We now understand what was in the Count's mind when he took that money, even though Jonathan's fierce attack put him in a danger that even he feared. He intended to escape. Listen to me, ESCAPE! He realized that with only one box of earth left and a group of men pursuing him like hounds after a fox, London was no longer safe for him. He has taken his final earth-box onto a ship and left the land behind. He thinks he is escaping, but no! We will follow him. Tally Ho! as our friend Arthur might say when he's dressed for the hunt! Our old fox is cunning; extremely cunning, and we must pursue him with equal cleverness. I, too, am cunning, and I believe I will understand his plan soon. In the meantime, we can rest peacefully, as there is water between us that he won't want to cross, and indeed could not if he wished—unless the ship lands, and even then, only at high or low tide. Look, the sun has just risen, and we have the entire day until sunset ahead of us. Let us bathe, get dressed, and eat the breakfast we all need and can enjoy comfortably now that he is not on the same land as we are.' Mina looked at him pleadingly as she asked, 'But why do we need to chase him further, now that he has gone away from us?' He took her hand, patting it gently as he replied, 'Do not ask me anything yet. After we have breakfast, I will answer all your questions.' He refused to say more, and we separated to get ready. After breakfast, Mina repeated her question. He looked at her seriously for a minute before answering sorrowfully, 'Because, my very dear Madam Mina, now more than ever we must find him, even if we have to follow him to the very gates of Hell!' She turned even paler as she asked faintly, 'Why?' 'Because,' he answered solemnly, 'he can live for centuries, while you are merely a mortal woman. Time itself is now something to be feared—ever since he placed that mark upon your throat.' I managed to catch her just as she swayed and fell forward in a faint.",

For a few moments, she appeared as innocent as a sleeping child, then awoke with a sigh, surprised to see everyone around her. She asked if she had spoken while asleep, seeming to understand the situation, though she was anxious to learn what she had revealed. The Professor recounted the conversation, and Mina immediately insisted that there was no time to lose, hoping it might not be too late. Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming rushed to leave, but Van Helsing calmly stopped them, explaining that while Mina spoke of a ship ready to leave port, there were many ships in London at that moment, making it unclear which one to pursue. He expressed relief at having a new lead, even though its outcome was uncertain. Reflecting, he admitted that in hindsight they could have understood the Count’s intentions sooner, realizing now that the Count planned his escape after Jonathan’s attack, especially with only one box of earth left and pursuers close behind. Van Helsing explained that the Count had boarded a ship with his last box, intending to flee, but they must give chase, matching the Count’s cunning with their own. For now, he said they could rest, as the vampire would not try to cross the water during the day. They agreed to wash, dress, and eat breakfast calmly since Dracula was no longer in England. Mina, worried, asked why they needed to pursue him further if he had gone. Van Helsing told her to wait until after breakfast for answers. Later, with a heavy heart, he explained that they must pursue Dracula even to the ends of the earth because, as an immortal, he could remain a threat for centuries, while Mina was only human and at risk from the mark he had left on her neck. At this, Mina fainted, and Jonathan managed to catch her."

Our enemy has departed; he has returned to his Castle in Transylvania. I am completely certain of this, as if it were written in fiery letters on the wall. He must have made preparations for this in some way, and that last box of earth was ready to be shipped somewhere. This is why he took the money; this is why he rushed at the end, so we wouldn't catch him before sunset. His last chance might have been hiding in Lucy's tomb, possibly believing she, being as he thought similar to him, would keep it accessible to him. But there was not enough time. When that failed, he went directly for his last option – his final fallback. He is exceedingly clever! He knew his efforts here were over, and so he decided to go back home. He found a ship traveling the route he originally came by and boarded it. We are leaving now to discover which ship it is and where it is headed.

Even my own terrible experiences in Castle Dracula seem like a long-forgotten dream. Here in the crisp autumn air in the bright sunlight——\nAlas! how can I disbelieve!

Knowing that the Count is no longer in the country has eased her mind, and that reassurance gives her strength. As for me, now that the terrifying threat is not immediately before us, it almost feels unreal—even my experiences at Castle Dracula now seem distant, like a faded dream. Here, in the crisp autumn weather and under the bright sun—\n\nBut how can I not believe? Just then, as I was thinking, I noticed the red scar on Mina’s pale forehead. As long as that mark remains, I can’t truly doubt. And even after it fades, its memory will always remind me of the truth. Mina and I are uneasy when idle, so we have gone over our diaries repeatedly. Somehow, with each review the reality feels even more significant, but the pain and fear lessen. There appears to be a sense of guiding purpose through it all, which is reassuring. Mina says perhaps we are meant to serve a greater good. Maybe she’s right! I will try to think as she does. We haven’t spoken about what lies ahead—it seems better to wait until the Professor and the others return with the results of their investigations. The day is passing more quickly than I thought possible; it’s already three o’clock."

Present: Professor Van Helsing, Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, Mr. Quincey Morris, Jonathan Harker, Mina Harker.\nDr. Van Helsing described what steps were taken during the day to discover on what boat and whither bound Count Dracula made his escape:—\n“As I knew that he wanted to get back to Transylvania, I felt sure that he must go by the Danube mouth; or by somewhere in the Black Sea, since by that way he come. It was a dreary blank that was before us. Omne ignotum pro magnifico; and so with heavy hearts we start to find what ships leave for the Black Sea last night. He was in sailing ship, since Madam Mina tell of sails being set. These not so important as to go in your list of the shipping in the Times, and so we go, by suggestion of Lord Godalming, to your Lloyd’s, where are note of all ships that sail, however so small. There we find that only one Black-Sea-bound ship go out with the tide. She is the Czarina Catherine, and she sail from Doolittle’s Wharf for Varna, and thence on to other parts and up the Danube. ‘Soh!’ said I, ‘this is the ship whereon is the Count.’ So off we go to Doolittle’s Wharf, and there we find a man in an office of wood so small that the man look bigger than the office. From him we inquire of the goings of the Czarina Catherine. He swear much, and he red face and loud of voice, but he good fellow all the same; and when Quincey give him something from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up, and put it in a so small bag which he have hid deep in his clothing, he still better fellow and humble servant to us. He come with us, and ask many men who are rough and hot; these be better fellows too when they have been no more thirsty. They say much of blood and bloom, and of others which I comprehend not, though I guess what they mean; but nevertheless they tell us all things which we want to know.\n“They make known to us among them, how last afternoon at about five o’clock comes a man so hurry. A tall man, thin and pale, with high nose and teeth so white, and eyes that seem to be burning. That he be all in black, except that he have a hat of straw which suit not him or the time. That he scatter his money in making quick inquiry as to what ship sails for the Black Sea and for where. Some took him to the office and then to the ship, where he will not go aboard but halt at shore end of gang-plank, and ask that the captain come to him. The captain come, when told that he will be pay well; and though he swear much at the first he agree to term. Then the thin man go and some one tell him where horse and cart can be hired. He go there and soon he come again, himself driving cart on which a great box; this he himself lift down, though it take several to put it on truck for the ship. He give much talk to captain as to how and where his box is to be place; but the captain like it not and swear at him in many tongues, and tell him that if he like he can come and see where it shall be. But he say ‘no’; that he come not yet, for that he have much to do. Whereupon the captain tell him that he had better be quick—with blood—for that his ship will leave the place—of blood—before the turn of the tide—with blood. Then the thin man smile and say that of course he must go when he think fit; but he will be surprise if he go quite so soon. The captain swear again, polyglot, and the thin man make him bow, and thank him, and say that he will so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the sailing. Final the captain, more red than ever, and in more tongues tell him that he doesn’t want no Frenchmen—with bloom upon them and also with blood—in his ship—with blood on her also. And so, after asking where there might be close at hand a ship where he might purchase ship forms, he departed.\n“No one knew where he went ‘or bloomin’ well cared,’ as they said, for they had something else to think of—well with blood again; for it soon became apparent to all that the Czarina Catherine would not sail as was expected. A thin mist began to creep up from the river, and it grew, and grew; till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her. The captain swore polyglot—very polyglot—polyglot with bloom and blood; but he could do nothing. The water rose and rose; and he began to fear that he would lose the tide altogether. He was in no friendly mood, when just at full tide, the thin man came up the gang-plank again and asked to see where his box had been stowed. Then the captain replied that he wished that he and his box—old and with much bloom and blood—were in hell. But the thin man did not be offend, and went down with the mate and saw where it was place, and came up and stood awhile on deck in fog. He must have come off by himself, for none notice him. Indeed they thought not of him; for soon the fog begin to melt away, and all was clear again. My friends of the thirst and the language that was of bloom and blood laughed, as they told how the captain’s swears exceeded even his usual polyglot, and was more than ever full of picturesque, when on questioning other mariners who were on movement up and down on the river that hour, he found that few of them had seen any of fog at all, except where it lay round the wharf. However, the ship went out on the ebb tide; and was doubtless by morning far down the river mouth. She was by then, when they told us, well out to sea.\n“And so, my dear Madam Mina, it is that we have to rest for a time, for our enemy is on the sea, with the fog at his command, on his way to the Danube mouth. To sail a ship takes time, go she never so quick; and when we start we go on land more quick, and we meet him there. Our best hope is to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset; for then he can make no struggle, and we may deal with him as we should. There are days for us, in which we can make ready our plan. We know all about where he go; for we have seen the owner of the ship, who have shown us invoices and all papers that can be. The box we seek is to be landed in Varna, and to be given to an agent, one Ristics who will there present his credentials; and so our merchant friend will have done his part. When he ask if there be any wrong, for that so, he can telegraph and have inquiry made at Varna, we say ‘no’; for what is to be done is not for police or of the customs. It must be done by us alone and in our own way.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Mina Harker recorded in her journal at 5 p.m. on October 5th, noting the attendees of their report meeting: Professor Van Helsing, Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, Mr. Quincey Morris, Jonathan Harker, and herself. Dr. Van Helsing reported on their day's efforts to determine which ship Count Dracula escaped on and its destination. He explained that knowing Dracula wanted to return to Transylvania, he was sure the Count would travel via the Danube river mouth or another Black Sea port, his original route of arrival. Facing a daunting and uncertain search, they began looking for ships that had sailed for the Black Sea the previous night. Since Mina had mentioned seeing sails being raised, they knew it was a sailing ship. These aren't typically listed prominently, so, following Lord Godalming's suggestion, they went to Lloyd's, which keeps records of all sailing vessels, no matter how small. There, they discovered that only one Black Sea bound ship had sailed with the tide. It was the *Czarina Catherine*, departing from Doolittle's Wharf for Varna, and then continuing to other places, including up the Danube. Van Helsing declared, \"That's the ship the Count is on!\" They immediately went to Doolittle's Wharf and found a man in a tiny wooden office. They asked him about the *Czarina Catherine*'s departure. He was initially rough, red-faced, and swore a lot, but was cooperative. When Quincey Morris gave him some crackling money, which he quickly hid in a small pouch, he became even more helpful and eager to serve them. He went with them and questioned several rough, sweaty men. These men were also more willing to talk after getting something to drink. They used a lot of crude language about \"blood\" and \"bloom\" and other things Van Helsing didn't fully grasp but could guess the meaning of. Nevertheless, they told them everything they needed to know. They learned that the previous afternoon, around five o'clock, a man arrived in a great hurry. He was tall, thin, and pale, with a high nose, very white teeth, and seemingly burning eyes. He was dressed in black but wore an unsuitable straw hat. He spent money freely, urgently asking which ship was sailing for the Black Sea and its destination. Some workers directed him to the office and then towards the ship. He stopped at the shore end of the gangplank, refusing to board immediately, and demanded to speak to the captain. The captain came when told he would be paid well. Despite initial loud swearing, he agreed to the terms. The thin man then left, and someone told him where he could hire a horse and cart. He returned soon after, driving the cart himself, which carried a large box. He lifted the box down himself, although it took several men to load it onto a truck for the ship. He gave the captain many instructions about how and where the box should be placed, but the captain didn't like this and swore at him in many languages, telling him he could come see to it himself if he wished. But the man said no, he couldn't come aboard yet because he had much else to do. The captain then rudely told him to hurry up, as the ship would leave before the tide turned. The thin man smiled and said he would naturally leave when he thought appropriate, but he doubted the ship would depart quite so soon. The captain swore again in multiple languages. The thin man bowed, thanked him, and said he would impose on his kindness by boarding before the sailing. Finally, the captain, redder than ever and swearing in even more tongues, declared he didn't want any \"Frenchmen\" with their \"bloom\" and \"blood\" on his ship, which also had \"blood.\" After asking if there was a nearby place to buy ship manifests, he left. According to the workers, no one knew where he went or \"bloomin' well cared,\" as they said, because they soon had something else to worry about. It quickly became clear that the *Czarina Catherine* wouldn't sail as expected. A thin mist began to rise from the river and grew thicker and thicker until a dense fog enveloped the ship and everything around it. The captain swore profusely in many languages, incorporating crude terms, but there was nothing he could do. The water level kept rising, and he began to fear he would miss the tide altogether. He was in a terrible mood when, exactly at full tide, the thin man came up the gangplank again and asked to see where his box had been stored. The captain angrily replied that he wished both the man and his box, described with crude terms again, were in hell. But the thin man wasn't offended and went below with the mate to see where it was placed, then came back up and stood on deck in the fog for a while. He must have left on his own, as no one noticed him. In fact, they didn't think about him at all, because the fog soon began to clear, and everything was visible again. His thirsty companions who used coarse language laughed as they recounted how the captain's swearing surpassed even his usual multi-lingual outbursts and was exceptionally colorful when, upon questioning other sailors on the river at that hour, he found that very few of them had seen any fog at all, except for the patch around the wharf. Nevertheless, the ship sailed out on the ebb tide and was doubtless far down the river mouth by morning. By the time they told them the story, she was already well out at sea. \"And so, my dear Mrs. Harker,\" Van Helsing concluded, \"we must pause for a while, for our enemy is on the sea, seemingly controlling the fog, heading for the Danube delta. Sailing takes time, no matter how fast the ship. When we begin our pursuit, we will travel faster by land and meet him there. Our best chance is to find him while he is in his box between sunrise and sunset, as he is helpless then, and we can deal with him properly. We have a few days to prepare our plan. We know precisely where he is going, as we have spoken to the ship's owner, who provided us with invoices and all relevant documents. The box we are looking for is to be unloaded in Varna and given to an agent named Ristics, who will present his credentials there. So, our contact in the shipping business has completed his part. When he asked if something was wrong that required telegraphing Varna for an inquiry, we told him 'no,' because this task is not for the police or customs. We must handle it ourselves, in our own way.\"",

Professor Van Helsing detailed our efforts during the day to learn which ship Count Dracula had escaped on and where he was headed. He reasoned Dracula would return to Transylvania, using the Danube or Black Sea, as that was his route here. Our task seemed daunting and uncertain. With heavy hearts, we investigated which ships had left for the Black Sea the previous night. Since Mina had seen Dracula board a sailing vessel, we focused on those, which weren’t listed in the major shipping news. By Lord Godalming’s suggestion, we consulted Lloyd’s register and discovered only one ship, the Czarina Catherine, had departed for the Black Sea from Doolittle’s Wharf, bound for Varna and then up the Danube. We concluded this was Dracula’s ship.\n\nWe went to Doolittle’s Wharf and found a small office where a bustling, loud man helped us after being given a tip by Quincey. He inquired among the rough dockmen, who became more helpful after being paid, and told us what happened. The previous evening, around five o’clock, a pale, thin man in black (except for a straw hat) arrived, urgently asking about ships leaving for the Black Sea. He scattered money about, quickly got shown to the office and the ship, but refused to go onboard initially. He insisted on talking to the captain, convinced him to agree to his terms, and left to fetch a large box via horse and cart. He lifted the box onto the ship himself with effort, gave specific instructions about its storage, but refused to board the ship right away, claiming to have business elsewhere. The captain grew impatient but the man promised to return before departure. After buying shipping documents, the man left.\n\nNobody cared where the man went as other matters distracted them: a thick fog suddenly surrounded the ship, though no other vessels noticed such fog. When the tide turned, the same thin man returned, checked on his box, and then departed without being seen leaving. As the fog lifted, the captain cursed even more, having lost time, but eventually the ship left with the ebbing tide and by morning, it was well out to sea.\n\nVan Helsing concluded that they must wait awhile, as their adversary was now en route to the Danube, controlling the fog, traveling by sea. Traveling over land, they would be faster, hoping to intercept Dracula while he is confined in his box during daylight. They now knew his destination—Varna—thanks to the ship’s papers and the owner’s confirmation: the box would be delivered to an agent named Ristics. The ship’s owner offered to telegraph Varna if something seemed wrong, but the group declined, since the matter was for them to handle personally, not for the authorities."

I dread Jonathan leaving me, and I know that he would surely go if the others went. He answered in growing passion, at first quietly. As he went on, however, he grew more angry and more forceful, till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least some of that personal dominance which made him so long a master amongst men:—\n“Yes, it is necessary—necessary—necessary! For your sake in the first, and then for the sake of humanity. This monster has done much harm already, in the narrow scope where he find himself, and in the short time when as yet he was only as a body groping his so small measure in darkness and not knowing. All this have I told these others; you, my dear Madam Mina, will learn it in the phonograph of my friend John, or in that of your husband. I have told them how the measure of leaving his own barren land—barren of peoples—and coming to a new land where life of man teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn, was the work of centuries. Were another of the Un-Dead, like him, to try to do what he has done, perhaps not all the centuries of the world that have been, or that will be, could aid him. With this one, all the forces of nature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together in some wondrous way. The very place, where he have been alive, Un-Dead for all these centuries, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical world. There are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither. There have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out waters of strange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify. Doubtless, there is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of occult forces which work for physical life in strange way; and in himself were from the first some great qualities. In a hard and warlike time he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve, more subtle brain, more braver heart, than any man. In him some vital principle have in strange way found their utmost; and as his body keep strong and grow and thrive, so his brain grow too. All this without that diabolic aid which is surely to him; for it have to yield to the powers that come from, and are, symbolic of good. And now this is what he is to us. He have infect you—oh, forgive me, my dear, that I must say such; but it is for good of you that I speak. He infect you in such wise, that even if he do no more, you have only to live—to live in your own old, sweet way; and so in time, death, which is of man’s common lot and with God’s sanction, shall make you like to him. This must not be! We have sworn together that it must not. Thus are we ministers of God’s own wish: that the world, and men for whom His Son die, will not be given over to monsters, whose very existence would defame Him. He have allowed us to redeem one soul already, and we go out as the old knights of the Cross to redeem more. Like them we shall travel towards the sunrise; and like them, if we fall, we fall in good cause.” He paused and I said:—\n“But will not the Count take his rebuff wisely? Since he has been driven from England, will he not avoid it, as a tiger does the village from which he has been hunted?”\n“Aha!” he said, “your simile of the tiger good, for me, and I shall adopt him. Your man-eater, as they of India call the tiger who has once tasted blood of the human, care no more for the other prey, but prowl unceasing till he get him. This that we hunt from our village is a tiger, too, a man-eater, and he never cease to prowl. Nay, in himself he is not one to retire and stay afar. In his life, his living life, he go over the Turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground; he be beaten back, but did he stay? No! He come again, and again, and again. Look at his persistence and endurance. With the child-brain that was to him he have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city. What does he do? He find out the place of all the world most of promise for him. Then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task. He find in patience just how is his strength, and what are his powers. He study new tongues. He learn new social life; new environment of old ways, the politic, the law, the finance, the science, the habit of a new land and a new people who have come to be since he was. His glimpse that he have had, whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire. Nay, it help him to grow as to his brain; for it all prove to him how right he was at the first in his surmises. He have done this alone; all alone! from a ruin tomb in a forgotten land. What more may he not do when the greater world of thought is open to him. He that can smile at death, as we know him; who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off whole peoples. Oh, if such an one was to come from God, and not the Devil, what a force for good might he not be in this old world of ours. But we are pledged to set the world free. Our toil must be in silence, and our efforts all in secret; for in this enlightened age, when men believe not even what they see, the doubting of wise men would be his greatest strength. It would be at once his sheath and his armour, and his weapons to destroy us, his enemies, who are willing to peril even our own souls for the safety of one we love—for the good of mankind, and for the honour and glory of God.”\nAfter a general discussion it was determined that for to-night nothing be definitely settled; that we should all sleep on the facts, and try to think out the proper conclusions. To-morrow, at breakfast, we are to meet again, and, after making our conclusions known to one another, we shall decide on some definite cause of action.\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nI feel a wonderful peace and rest to-night. It is as if some haunting presence were removed from me. Perhaps ...\nMy surmise was not finished, could not be; for I caught sight in the mirror of the red mark upon my forehead; and I knew that I was still unclean.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "After Dr. Van Helsing finished speaking, I inquired if he was absolutely sure the Count was still aboard the ship. He replied, \"We have the best confirmation possible: your own account from the hypnotic state this morning.\" I asked him again if it was truly essential that they hunt the Count, because I desperately dreaded Jonathan leaving me, and I knew he would certainly go if the others did. His response began calmly but quickly intensified with growing passion. As he continued, his anger and forcefulness increased until, by the end, we could clearly see at least a part of that personal authority that had established him as a long-time leader among men:\n\n\"Yes, it is essential—essential—essential! Primarily for your well-being, and then for the welfare of all humanity. This creature has already inflicted significant damage within the limited sphere where he has existed and during the brief period when he was still just a physical form exploring his small capacity in darkness without full awareness. I have explained all this to the others; you, my dear Madam Mina, will hear it on the phonograph recordings by my friend John, or perhaps your husband. I have told them how the act of leaving his own desolate homeland—lacking people—and coming to a new place teeming with human life, where people are as numerous as stalks of corn, was the culmination of centuries of effort. If another member of the Un-Dead, like him, were to attempt what he has accomplished, perhaps all the centuries that have passed, or are yet to come, could not help them. With this specific being, all the profound, hidden, and powerful forces of nature must have collaborated in some extraordinary manner. The very location where he has existed, Un-Dead for all these centuries, is filled with the strange properties of the geological and chemical worlds. There are deep chasms and crevices reaching places no one knows. There have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still release waters with peculiar qualities, and gases that can kill or invigorate. Undoubtedly, there is something magnetic or electric within some of these combinations of hidden forces that sustain physical life in unusual ways; and he himself possessed remarkable qualities from the start. In a harsh and violent era, he was celebrated for having a stronger will, a more cunning mind, a braver heart, than anyone else. In him, certain fundamental life principles have, in a strange way, reached their peak potential; and just as his body remained robust and grew and flourished, so too did his intellect develop. All this occurred without the diabolical assistance which is surely his now; for it must yield to the powers originating from, and symbolizing, good. And now, this is what he means to us. He has tainted you—oh, forgive me, my dear, for having to say such a thing; but I speak for your own good. He has contaminated you in such a way that even if he does nothing further, you merely have to live—to live in your accustomed, gentle manner; and then, in time, death, which is the common fate of humanity and sanctioned by God, will make you just like him. This absolutely cannot happen! We have jointly sworn that it will not. Thus, we are carrying out God’s own desire: that the world, and the people for whom His Son died, shall not be handed over to monsters whose very existence would dishonor Him. He has already permitted us to rescue one soul, and we are setting out like the knights of old to redeem more. Like them, we will journey towards the sunrise; and like them, if we fall, we fall for a noble cause.” He paused, and I then spoke:\n\n“But will not the Count respond sensibly to this setback? Since he has been driven out of England, won’t he avoid it, just as a tiger avoids the village from which it has been hunted?”\n\n“Aha!” he exclaimed, “your comparison to the tiger is excellent, from my perspective, and I will use it. Your man-eater, as they call the tiger in India that has once tasted human blood, no longer cares for other prey, but hunts relentlessly until it gets its fill. The being we have driven from our village is also a tiger, a man-eater, and he will never stop prowling. No, by his very nature, he is not one to retreat and stay away. In his lifetime, his living life, he crossed the Turkish border and attacked his enemy on their own territory; he was pushed back, but did he stay away? No! He returned, and again, and again. Look at his persistence and resilience. With the primitive intellect he possessed initially, he conceived the idea of coming to a great city long ago. What did he do? He identified the place in the world with the most potential for him. Then, he deliberately committed himself to preparing for the task. With patience, he ascertained his true strength and abilities. He mastered new languages. He studied new social customs; the new forms of old ways, politics, law, finance, science, the habits of a new country and a new population that has emerged since his time. The brief exposure he had has only intensified his hunger and sharpened his resolve. Indeed, it helped his mind grow; for it all confirmed to him how correct his initial intuitions were. He achieved this entirely alone; all by himself! from a ruined tomb in a forgotten land. What more might he accomplish now that the wider world of knowledge is open to him? He who can disregard death as we know it; who can flourish amidst diseases that wipe out entire populations. Oh, if such a being were to come from God, and not the Devil, what a power for good he might be in this old world of ours. But we are committed to freeing the world. Our work must be done in silence, and our efforts must be kept secret; for in this enlightened age, when people disbelieve even what they see, the skepticism of wise men would be his greatest advantage. It would serve simultaneously as his shield and his armor, and as his weapons to destroy us, his adversaries, who are willing to risk even our own souls for the safety of someone we love—for the benefit of humanity, and for the honor and glory of God.”\n\nAfter a lengthy discussion, it was decided that nothing would be finalized tonight; that we should all reflect on the facts and try to determine the appropriate course of action. Tomorrow, at breakfast, we are to reconvene, and, after sharing our conclusions with each other, we will agree on a specific plan.\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nI feel a wonderful sense of calm and repose tonight. It is as if some disturbing presence has been lifted from me. Perhaps...\n\nMy speculation remained unfinished, could not be completed; for I caught sight in the mirror of the red mark on my forehead; and I knew that I was still defiled.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "After Dr. Van Helsing finished speaking, I asked if he was sure the Count had stayed aboard the ship. He assured me, referencing the evidence I gave while under hypnosis earlier that day. I then questioned whether it was absolutely necessary to pursue the Count—I feared Jonathan leaving me, and I knew he would go if the others did. Van Helsing, with growing emotion, insisted that it was necessary, both for my sake and for the sake of humanity. He explained that the Count had already caused much harm despite being restricted to a limited area and relatively short time. He reminded me that he'd already told the others about the Count's centuries-long plan to leave his barren homeland and come to a bustling new land full of people, a feat no other vampire could likely accomplish. He described how strange natural and supernatural forces, as well as the Count’s personal qualities—strength, intelligence, courage—helped him grow to his current power. The professor stressed that if nothing was done, I myself risked eventually becoming like the Count, something he could not allow. He said the group was united in their resolve to fight for good and save more souls, comparing their quest to that of knights of old. I asked if, now that he’d been driven from England, the Count wouldn’t just stay away, like a tiger avoids a village that drove it out. Van Helsing replied using my tiger analogy, explaining that a man-eating tiger, once it’s tasted blood, keeps hunting; likewise, the Count would not rest or avoid us, but keep hunting. He pointed out the Count’s persistence, adaptation, and intelligence in preparing himself for life among the people of a great city, learning languages and customs to blend in, all without help. If only he served good instead of evil, Van Helsing said, he would be a powerful force for good in the world. But as it is, the group is determined to work in secret to stop him, since public disbelief would only shield the Count. Afterwards, the group agreed to sleep on their decision and discuss it again in the morning at breakfast. Later that night, I felt an unusual sense of peace, as if something evil had left me—but catching sight of the red mark on my forehead in the mirror reminded me I was still tainted."

When we met at early breakfast there was more general cheerfulness than any of us had ever expected to experience again.\nIt is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature. Let any obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way—even by death—and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment. More than once as we sat around the table, my eyes opened in wonder whether the whole of the past days had not been a dream. It was only when I caught sight of the red blotch on Mrs. Harker’s forehead that I was brought back to reality. Even now, when I am gravely revolving the matter, it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all our trouble is still existent. Even Mrs. Harker seems to lose sight of her trouble for whole spells; it is only now and again, when something recalls it to her mind, that she thinks of her terrible scar. We are to meet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course of action. I see only one immediate difficulty, I know it by instinct rather than reason: we shall all have to speak frankly; and yet I fear that in some mysterious way poor Mrs. Harker’s tongue is tied. I know that she forms conclusions of her own, and from all that has been I can guess how brilliant and how true they must be; but she will not, or cannot, give them utterance. I have mentioned this to Van Helsing, and he and I are to talk it over when we are alone. I suppose it is some of that horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work. The Count had his own purposes when he gave her what Van Helsing called “the Vampire’s baptism of blood.” Well, there may be a poison that distils itself out of good things; in an age when the existence of ptomaines is a mystery we should not wonder at anything! One thing I know: that if my instinct be true regarding poor Mrs. Harker’s silences, then there is a terrible difficulty—an unknown danger—in the work before us. The same power that compels her silence may compel her speech. I dare not think further; for so I should in my thoughts dishonour a noble woman!\nVan Helsing is coming to my study a little before the others. I shall try to open the subject with him.\nLater.—When the Professor came in, we talked over the state of things. I could see that he had something on his mind which he wanted to say, but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject. After beating about the bush a little, he said suddenly:—\n“Friend John, there is something that you and I must talk of alone, just at the first at any rate. Later, we may have to take the others into our confidence”; then he stopped, so I waited; he went on:—\n“Madam Mina, our poor, dear Madam Mina is changing.” A cold shiver ran through me to find my worst fears thus endorsed. Van Helsing continued:—\n“With the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must this time be warned before things go too far. Our task is now in reality more difficult than ever, and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance. I can see the characteristics of the vampire coming in her face. It is now but very, very slight; but it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice without to prejudge. Her teeth are some sharper, and at times her eyes are more hard. But these are not all, there is to her the silence now often; as so it was with Miss Lucy. She did not speak, even when she wrote that which she wished to be known later. Now my fear is this. If it be that she can, by our hypnotic trance, tell what the Count see and hear, is it not more true that he who have hypnotise her first, and who have drink of her very blood and make her drink of his, should, if he will, compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know?” I nodded acquiescence; he went on:—\n“Then, what we must do is to prevent this; we must keep her ignorant of our intent, and so she cannot tell what she know not. This is a painful task! Oh, so painful that it heart-break me to think of; but it must be. When to-day we meet, I must tell her that for reason which we will not to speak she must not more be of our council, but be simply guarded by us.” He wiped his forehead, which had broken out in profuse perspiration at the thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poor soul already so tortured. I knew that it would be some sort of comfort to him if I told him that I also had come to the same conclusion; for at any rate it would take away the pain of doubt. I told him, and the effect was as I expected.\nIt is now close to the time of our general gathering. Van Helsing has gone away to prepare for the meeting, and his painful part of it. I really believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "October 5th. We all rose early, and it seemed sleep had greatly benefited everyone. When we gathered for early breakfast, there was a sense of general cheerfulness, more so than any of us had expected to feel again. It truly is remarkable how resilient human nature is. When any obstacle, no matter how significant, is removed—even through death—we tend to quickly revert to fundamental principles of hope and enjoyment. More than once as we sat around the table, my eyes widened in disbelief, wondering if the previous days had all been a dream. It was only when I noticed the reddish mark on Mrs. Harker's forehead that I was anchored back to reality. Even now, as I seriously ponder the situation, it's almost impossible to fully comprehend that the source of all our troubles still exists. Even Mrs. Harker herself seems to forget her distress for extended periods; it's only occasionally, when something jogs her memory, that she recalls her terrible scar. We are scheduled to meet here in my study in half an hour to decide on our plan of action. I perceive only one immediate challenge, which I sense intuitively rather than logically: we will all need to speak candidly, and yet I fear that poor Mrs. Harker is somehow mysteriously prevented from speaking freely. I know she forms her own conclusions, and based on everything that has occurred, I can imagine how insightful and accurate they must be; but she will not, or cannot, voice them. I have mentioned this to Van Helsing, and he and I are to discuss it when we are alone. I suspect it is some effect of that dreadful substance that entered her veins beginning to take hold. The Count had his own reasons when he subjected her to what Van Helsing called \"the Vampire’s baptism of blood.\" Well, perhaps a poison can derive itself from seemingly good things; in an era where the existence of ptomaines is still a mystery, we shouldn't dismiss anything! One thing I know for certain is that if my intuition about poor Mrs. Harker's silence is correct, then there is a terrible challenge—an unknown danger—in the work before us. The same force that compels her silence might be able to compel her to speak. I dare not think further on this, as doing so in my thoughts would feel like dishonouring a noble woman! Van Helsing is coming to my study a little before the others. I will try to initiate the topic with him. Later. When the Professor arrived, we discussed the current state of affairs. I could see that he had something on his mind that he wanted to say but felt some hesitation in bringing up the subject. After some preliminary conversation, he said abruptly: \"Friend John, there is something that you and I must discuss privately, at least initially. Later, we may need to bring the others into our confidence\"; he then stopped, so I waited; he continued: \"Madam Mina, our poor, dear Madam Mina is changing.\" A cold tremor ran through me to find my worst fears thus confirmed. Van Helsing proceeded: \"With the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must this time be forewarned before things escalate too far. Our task is now truly more difficult than ever, and this new complication makes every hour of the utmost importance. I can see the emerging characteristics of the vampire in her face. It is presently very, very subtle; but it is visible if one has the eyes to notice without prejudice. Her teeth are somewhat sharper, and at times her eyes appear harder. But these are not the only signs; there is also the frequent silence, just as it was with Miss Lucy. She did not speak, even when she wrote down things she wished to be known later. Now my fear is this: If it is possible for her, through our hypnotic trance, to perceive what the Count sees and hears, is it not even more certain that he who first hypnotized her, and who drank of her very blood and made her drink of his, could, if he so desired, compel her mind to reveal to him that which she knows?\" I nodded in agreement; he went on: \"Then, what we must do is to prevent this; we must keep her unaware of our intentions, and thus she cannot reveal what she does not know. This is a painful duty! Oh, so painful that it breaks my heart to even contemplate; but it must be done. When we meet today, I must tell her that for reasons we will not explain, she can no longer be part of our council but will simply be protected by us.\" He wiped his forehead, which was covered in profuse perspiration at the thought of the pain he might have to inflict upon the poor soul who was already so tormented. I knew it would be a form of comfort to him if I told him that I had also reached the same conclusion; for at the very least, it would remove the pain of doubt. I told him, and the effect was as I had anticipated. It is now nearly the time for our general gathering. Van Helsing has departed to prepare for the meeting, and his difficult role in it. I truly believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Dr. Seward’s Diary, October 5th.—We all got up early today, and I believe the rest was beneficial for everyone. At breakfast, we were all in higher spirits than we thought possible after recent events. It's remarkable how quickly people can recover; the removal of any obstacle—even death—seems to return us to our natural optimism and enjoyment of life. More than once, I caught myself wondering if the recent hardships had only been a bad dream, but seeing the red mark on Mrs. Harker’s forehead reminded me that our troubles are real and ongoing. Even Mrs. Harker herself seems able to forget her suffering for periods at a time, only recalling it when something reminds her of her scar. We plan to meet in my study in half an hour to determine our next steps. One concern weighs on me—I sense, perhaps more by intuition than logic, that Mrs. Harker is unable to speak freely. She no doubt has her own insights, likely insightful and accurate, but she's unable or unwilling to express them. I mentioned this to Van Helsing, and we plan to discuss it privately. I suspect some lingering poison from the vampire’s \"baptism of blood\" is affecting her, as Van Helsing described. There could be a toxin at work—science is still discovering such things! If my instinct about Mrs. Harker’s silence is correct, it could mean a serious threat to our plans. Perhaps the same force that prevents her from speaking could also force her to reveal secrets. The thought is troubling, and I fear to entertain it any further, lest I judge her unfairly. Van Helsing agreed to meet with me before the others arrive so we can talk in private.\n\nLater.—When Van Helsing arrived, we discussed the current situation. He appeared reluctant to address something on his mind, but suddenly said we needed to discuss something privately, at least at first. He continued: \"Madam Mina, our unfortunate friend, is changing.\" Hearing my own fears confirmed chilled me. Van Helsing warned that, based on Miss Lucy's fate, we must be proactive to avoid tragedy. The task ahead is even more challenging, made urgent by this new threat. He pointed out subtle signs of vampirism in Mina: her teeth have become sharper, her eyes harder, and she has grown uncommunicative, just as Lucy did before. Van Helsing fears that if Mina can, when hypnotized, see what the Count sees, it may be even more likely that the Count, having exchanged blood with her, could compel her to reveal our secrets. I agreed. Van Helsing concluded we must protect Mina by keeping her ignorant of our plans, so she cannot reveal them—even unknowingly. This is a painful decision, one that distresses us deeply, but is necessary. During today’s meeting, Van Helsing intends to tell Mina why she can no longer be fully involved in our deliberations, but must instead be protected by us. I told him I had come to the same conclusion, which seemed to comfort him somewhat. Now, the time for our group meeting approaches; Van Helsing has gone to prepare mentally and spiritually for what is to come."

Already the certainty that the Count is out of the country has given her comfort; and comfort is strength to her. For my own part, now that his horrible danger is not face to face with us, it seems almost impossible to believe in it. Even my own terrible experiences in Castle Dracula seem like a long-forgotten dream. Here in the crisp autumn air in the bright sunlight——\nAlas! how can I disbelieve! In the midst of my thought my eye fell on the red scar on my poor darling’s white forehead. Whilst that lasts, there can be no disbelief. And afterwards the very memory of it will keep faith crystal clear. Mina and I fear to be idle, so we have been over all the diaries again and again. Somehow, although the reality seems greater each time, the pain and the fear seem less. There is something of a guiding purpose manifest throughout, which is comforting. Mina says that perhaps we are the instruments of ultimate good. It may be! I shall try to think as she does. We have never spoken to each other yet of the future. It is better to wait till we see the Professor and the others after their investigations.\nThe day is running by more quickly than I ever thought a day could run for me again. It is now three o’clock.\nMina Harker’s Journal.\n5 October, 5 p. m.—Our meeting for report. Present: Professor Van Helsing, Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, Mr. Quincey Morris, Jonathan Harker, Mina Harker.\nDr. Van Helsing described what steps were taken during the day to discover on what boat and whither bound Count Dracula made his escape:—\n“As I knew that he wanted to get back to Transylvania, I felt sure that he must go by the Danube mouth; or by somewhere in the Black Sea, since by that way he come. It was a dreary blank that was before us. Omne ignotum pro magnifico; and so with heavy hearts we start to find what ships leave for the Black Sea last night. He was in sailing ship, since Madam Mina tell of sails being set. These not so important as to go in your list of the shipping in the Times, and so we go, by suggestion of Lord Godalming, to your Lloyd’s, where are note of all ships that sail, however so small. There we find that only one Black-Sea-bound ship go out with the tide. She is the Czarina Catherine, and she sail from Doolittle’s Wharf for Varna, and thence on to other parts and up the Danube. ‘Soh!’ said I, ‘this is the ship whereon is the Count.’ So off we go to Doolittle’s Wharf, and there we find a man in an office of wood so small that the man look bigger than the office. From him we inquire of the goings of the Czarina Catherine. He swear much, and he red face and loud of voice, but he good fellow all the same; and when Quincey give him something from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up, and put it in a so small bag which he have hid deep in his clothing, he still better fellow and humble servant to us. He come with us, and ask many men who are rough and hot; these be better fellows too when they have been no more thirsty. They say much of blood and bloom, and of others which I comprehend not, though I guess what they mean; but nevertheless they tell us all things which we want to know.\n“They make known to us among them, how last afternoon at about five o’clock comes a man so hurry. A tall man, thin and pale, with high nose and teeth so white, and eyes that seem to be burning. That he be all in black, except that he have a hat of straw which suit not him or the time. That he scatter his money in making quick inquiry as to what ship sails for the Black Sea and for where. Some took him to the office and then to the ship, where he will not go aboard but halt at shore end of gang-plank, and ask that the captain come to him. The captain come, when told that he will be pay well; and though he swear much at the first he agree to term. Then the thin man go and some one tell him where horse and cart can be hired. He go there and soon he come again, himself driving cart on which a great box; this he himself lift down, though it take several to put it on truck for the ship. He give much talk to captain as to how and where his box is to be place; but the captain like it not and swear at him in many tongues, and tell him that if he like he can come and see where it shall be. But he say ‘no’; that he come not yet, for that he have much to do. Whereupon the captain tell him that he had better be quick—with blood—for that his ship will leave the place—of blood—before the turn of the tide—with blood. Then the thin man smile and say that of course he must go when he think fit; but he will be surprise if he go quite so soon. The captain swear again, polyglot, and the thin man make him bow, and thank him, and say that he will so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the sailing. Final the captain, more red than ever, and in more tongues tell him that he doesn’t want no Frenchmen—with bloom upon them and also with blood—in his ship—with blood on her also. And so, after asking where there might be close at hand a ship where he might purchase ship forms, he departed.\n“No one knew where he went ‘or bloomin’ well cared,’ as they said, for they had something else to think of—well with blood again; for it soon became apparent to all that the Czarina Catherine would not sail as was expected. A thin mist began to creep up from the river, and it grew, and grew; till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her. The captain swore polyglot—very polyglot—polyglot with bloom and blood; but he could do nothing. The water rose and rose; and he began to fear that he would lose the tide altogether. He was in no friendly mood, when just at full tide, the thin man came up the gang-plank again and asked to see where his box had been stowed. Then the captain replied that he wished that he and his box—old and with much bloom and blood—were in hell. But the thin man did not be offend, and went down with the mate and saw where it was place, and came up and stood awhile on deck in fog. He must have come off by himself, for none notice him. Indeed they thought not of him; for soon the fog begin to melt away, and all was clear again. My friends of the thirst and the language that was of bloom and blood laughed, as they told how the captain’s swears exceeded even his usual polyglot, and was more than ever full of picturesque, when on questioning other mariners who were on movement up and down on the river that hour, he found that few of them had seen any of fog at all, except where it lay round the wharf. However, the ship went out on the ebb tide; and was doubtless by morning far down the river mouth. She was by then, when they told us, well out to sea.\n“And so, my dear Madam Mina, it is that we have to rest for a time, for our enemy is on the sea, with the fog at his command, on his way to the Danube mouth. To sail a ship takes time, go she never so quick; and when we start we go on land more quick, and we meet him there. Our best hope is to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset; for then he can make no struggle, and we may deal with him as we should. There are days for us, in which we can make ready our plan. We know all about where he go; for we have seen the owner of the ship, who have shown us invoices and all papers that can be. The box we seek is to be landed in Varna, and to be given to an agent, one Ristics who will there present his credentials; and so our merchant friend will have done his part. When he ask if there be any wrong, for that so, he can telegraph and have inquiry made at Varna, we say ‘no’; for what is to be done is not for police or of the customs. It must be done by us alone and in our own way.”\nWhen Dr. Van Helsing had done speaking, I asked him if he were certain that the Count had remained on board the ship. He replied: “We have the best proof of that: your own evidence, when in the hypnotic trance this morning.” I asked him again if it were really necessary that they should pursue the Count, for oh! I dread Jonathan leaving me, and I know that he would surely go if the others went. He answered in growing passion, at first quietly. As he went on, however, he grew more angry and more forceful, till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least some of that personal dominance which made him so long a master amongst men:—\n“Yes, it is necessary—necessary—necessary! For your sake in the first, and then for the sake of humanity. This monster has done much harm already, in the narrow scope where he find himself, and in the short time when as yet he was only as a body groping his so small measure in darkness and not knowing. All this have I told these others; you, my dear Madam Mina, will learn it in the phonograph of my friend John, or in that of your husband. I have told them how the measure of leaving his own barren land—barren of peoples—and coming to a new land where life of man teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn, was the work of centuries. Were another of the Un-Dead, like him, to try to do what he has done, perhaps not all the centuries of the world that have been, or that will be, could aid him. With this one, all the forces of nature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together in some wondrous way. The very place, where he have been alive, Un-Dead for all these centuries, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical world. There are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither. There have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out waters of strange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify. Doubtless, there is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of occult forces which work for physical life in strange way; and in himself were from the first some great qualities. In a hard and warlike time he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve, more subtle brain, more braver heart, than any man. In him some vital principle have in strange way found their utmost; and as his body keep strong and grow and thrive, so his brain grow too. All this without that diabolic aid which is surely to him; for it have to yield to the powers that come from, and are, symbolic of good. And now this is what he is to us. He have infect you—oh, forgive me, my dear, that I must say such; but it is for good of you that I speak. He infect you in such wise, that even if he do no more, you have only to live—to live in your own old, sweet way; and so in time, death, which is of man’s common lot and with God’s sanction, shall make you like to him. This must not be! We have sworn together that it must not. Thus are we ministers of God’s own wish: that the world, and men for whom His Son die, will not be given over to monsters, whose very existence would defame Him. He have allowed us to redeem one soul already, and we go out as the old knights of the Cross to redeem more. Like them we shall travel towards the sunrise; and like them, if we fall, we fall in good cause.” He paused and I said:—\n“But will not the Count take his rebuff wisely? Since he has been driven from England, will he not avoid it, as a tiger does the village from which he has been hunted?”\n“Aha!” he said, “your simile of the tiger good, for me, and I shall adopt him. Your man-eater, as they of India call the tiger who has once tasted blood of the human, care no more for the other prey, but prowl unceasing till he get him. This that we hunt from our village is a tiger, too, a man-eater, and he never cease to prowl. Nay, in himself he is not one to retire and stay afar. In his life, his living life, he go over the Turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground; he be beaten back, but did he stay? No! He come again, and again, and again. Look at his persistence and endurance. With the child-brain that was to him he have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city. What does he do? He find out the place of all the world most of promise for him. Then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task. He find in patience just how is his strength, and what are his powers. He study new tongues. He learn new social life; new environment of old ways, the politic, the law, the finance, the science, the habit of a new land and a new people who have come to be since he was. His glimpse that he have had, whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire. Nay, it help him to grow as to his brain; for it all prove to him how right he was at the first in his surmises. He have done this alone; all alone! from a ruin tomb in a forgotten land. What more may he not do when the greater world of thought is open to him. He that can smile at death, as we know him; who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off whole peoples. Oh, if such an one was to come from God, and not the Devil, what a force for good might he not be in this old world of ours. But we are pledged to set the world free. Our toil must be in silence, and our efforts all in secret; for in this enlightened age, when men believe not even what they see, the doubting of wise men would be his greatest strength. It would be at once his sheath and his armour, and his weapons to destroy us, his enemies, who are willing to peril even our own souls for the safety of one we love—for the good of mankind, and for the honour and glory of God.”\nAfter a general discussion it was determined that for to-night nothing be definitely settled; that we should all sleep on the facts, and try to think out the proper conclusions. To-morrow, at breakfast, we are to meet again, and, after making our conclusions known to one another, we shall decide on some definite cause of action.\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nI feel a wonderful peace and rest to-night. It is as if some haunting presence were removed from me. Perhaps ...\nMy surmise was not finished, could not be; for I caught sight in the mirror of the red mark upon my forehead; and I knew that I was still unclean.\nDr. Seward’s Diary.\n5 October.—We all rose early, and I think that sleep did much for each and all of us. When we met at early breakfast there was more general cheerfulness than any of us had ever expected to experience again.\nIt is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature. Let any obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way—even by death—and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment. More than once as we sat around the table, my eyes opened in wonder whether the whole of the past days had not been a dream. It was only when I caught sight of the red blotch on Mrs. Harker’s forehead that I was brought back to reality. Even now, when I am gravely revolving the matter, it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all our trouble is still existent. Even Mrs. Harker seems to lose sight of her trouble for whole spells; it is only now and again, when something recalls it to her mind, that she thinks of her terrible scar. We are to meet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course of action. I see only one immediate difficulty, I know it by instinct rather than reason: we shall all have to speak frankly; and yet I fear that in some mysterious way poor Mrs. Harker’s tongue is tied. I know that she forms conclusions of her own, and from all that has been I can guess how brilliant and how true they must be; but she will not, or cannot, give them utterance. I have mentioned this to Van Helsing, and he and I are to talk it over when we are alone. I suppose it is some of that horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work. The Count had his own purposes when he gave her what Van Helsing called “the Vampire’s baptism of blood.” Well, there may be a poison that distils itself out of good things; in an age when the existence of ptomaines is a mystery we should not wonder at anything! One thing I know: that if my instinct be true regarding poor Mrs. Harker’s silences, then there is a terrible difficulty—an unknown danger—in the work before us. The same power that compels her silence may compel her speech. I dare not think further; for so I should in my thoughts dishonour a noble woman!\nVan Helsing is coming to my study a little before the others. I shall try to open the subject with him.\nLater.—When the Professor came in, we talked over the state of things. I could see that he had something on his mind which he wanted to say, but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject. After beating about the bush a little, he said suddenly:—\n“Friend John, there is something that you and I must talk of alone, just at the first at any rate. Later, we may have to take the others into our confidence”; then he stopped, so I waited; he went on:—\n“Madam Mina, our poor, dear Madam Mina is changing.” A cold shiver ran through me to find my worst fears thus endorsed. Van Helsing continued:—\n“With the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must this time be warned before things go too far. Our task is now in reality more difficult than ever, and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance. I can see the characteristics of the vampire coming in her face. It is now but very, very slight; but it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice without to prejudge. Her teeth are some sharper, and at times her eyes are more hard. But these are not all, there is to her the silence now often; as so it was with Miss Lucy. She did not speak, even when she wrote that which she wished to be known later. Now my fear is this. If it be that she can, by our hypnotic trance, tell what the Count see and hear, is it not more true that he who have hypnotise her first, and who have drink of her very blood and make her drink of his, should, if he will, compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know?” I nodded acquiescence; he went on:—\n“Then, what we must do is to prevent this; we must keep her ignorant of our intent, and so she cannot tell what she know not. This is a painful task! Oh, so painful that it heart-break me to think of; but it must be. When to-day we meet, I must tell her that for reason which we will not to speak she must not more be of our council, but be simply guarded by us.” He wiped his forehead, which had broken out in profuse perspiration at the thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poor soul already so tortured. I knew that it would be some sort of comfort to him if I told him that I also had come to the same conclusion; for at any rate it would take away the pain of doubt. I told him, and the effect was as I expected.\nIt is now close to the time of our general gathering. Van Helsing has gone away to prepare for the meeting, and his painful part of it. I really believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone.\nLater.—At the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief was experienced by both Van Helsing and myself. Mrs. Harker had sent a message by her husband to say that she would not join us at present, as she thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movements without her presence to embarrass us. The Professor and I looked at each other for an instant, and somehow we both seemed relieved. For my own part, I thought that if Mrs. Harker realised the danger herself, it was much pain as well as much danger averted. Under the circumstances we agreed, by a questioning look and answer, with finger on lip, to preserve silence in our suspicions, until we should have been able to confer alone again. We went at once into our Plan of Campaign. Van Helsing roughly put the facts before us first:—\n“The Czarina Catherine left the Thames yesterday morning. It will take her at the quickest speed she has ever made at least three weeks to reach Varna; but we can travel overland to the same place in three days. Now, if we allow for two days less for the ship’s voyage, owing to such weather influences as we know that the Count can bring to bear; and if we allow a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us, then we have a margin of nearly two weeks. Thus, in order to be quite safe, we must leave here on 17th at latest. Then we shall at any rate be in Varna a day before the ship arrives, and able to make such preparations as may be necessary. Of course we shall all go armed—armed against evil things, spiritual as well as physical.” Here Quincey Morris added:—\n“I understand that the Count comes from a wolf country, and it may be that he shall get there before us. I propose that we add Winchesters to our armament. I have a kind of belief in a Winchester when there is any trouble of that sort around. Do you remember, Art, when we had the pack after us at Tobolsk? What wouldn’t we have given then for a repeater apiece!”\n“Good!” said Van Helsing, “Winchesters it shall be. Quincey’s head is level at all times, but most so when there is to hunt, metaphor be more dishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man. In the meantime we can do nothing here; and as I think that Varna is not familiar to any of us, why not go there more soon? It is as long to wait here as there. To-night and to-morrow we can get ready, and then, if all be well, we four can set out on our journey.”\n“We four?” said Harker interrogatively, looking from one to another of us.\n“Of course!” answered the Professor quickly, “you must remain to take care of your so sweet wife!” Harker was silent for awhile and then said in a hollow voice:—\n“Let us talk of that part of it in the morning. I want to consult with Mina.” I thought that now was the time for Van Helsing to warn him not to disclose our plans to her; but he took no notice. I looked at him significantly and coughed. For answer he put his finger on his lips and turned away.\nJonathan Harker’s Journal.\n5 October, afternoon.—For some time after our meeting this morning I could not think. The new phases of things leave my mind in a state of wonder which allows no room for active thought. Mina’s determination not to take any part in the discussion set me thinking; and as I could not argue the matter with her, I could only guess. I am as far as ever from a solution now. The way the others received it, too, puzzled me; the last time we talked of the subject we agreed that there was to be no more concealment of anything amongst us. Mina is sleeping now, calmly and sweetly like a little child. Her lips are curved and her face beams with happiness. Thank God, there are such moments still for her.\nLater.—How strange it all is. I sat watching Mina’s happy sleep, and came as near to being happy myself as I suppose I shall ever be. As the evening drew on, and the earth took its shadows from the sun sinking lower, the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me. All at once Mina opened her eyes, and looking at me tenderly, said:—\n“Jonathan, I want you to promise me something on your word of honour. A promise made to me, but made holily in God’s hearing, and not to be broken though I should go down on my knees and implore you with bitter tears. Quick, you must make it to me at once.”\n“Mina,” I said, “a promise like that, I cannot make at once. I may have no right to make it.”\n“But, dear one,” she said, with such spiritual intensity that her eyes were like pole stars, “it is I who wish it; and it is not for myself. You can ask Dr. Van Helsing if I am not right; if he disagrees you may do as you will. Nay, more, if you all agree, later, you are absolved from the promise.”\n“I promise!” I said, and for a moment she looked supremely happy; though to me all happiness for her was denied by the red scar on her forehead. She said:—\n“Promise me that you will not tell me anything of the plans formed for the campaign against the Count. Not by word, or inference, or implication; not at any time whilst this remains to me!” and she solemnly pointed to the scar. I saw that she was in earnest, and said solemnly:—\n“I promise!” and as I said it I felt that from that instant a door had been shut between us.\nLater, midnight.—Mina has been bright and cheerful all the evening. So much so that all the rest seemed to take courage, as if infected somewhat with her gaiety; as a result even I myself felt as if the pall of gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted. We all retired early. Mina is now sleeping like a little child; it is a wonderful thing that her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her terrible trouble. Thank God for it, for then at least she can forget her care. Perhaps her example may affect me as her gaiety did to-night. I shall try it. Oh! for a dreamless sleep.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "From Jonathan Harker's Journal, October 4th: After reading Van Helsing's phonograph message to Mina, my poor wife seemed much brighter. The certainty that Count Dracula is no longer in England has brought her comfort, which in turn gives her strength. For my part, with the immediate, horrific threat gone, it feels almost unbelievable it ever happened. Even the terrifying experiences I had at Castle Dracula now seem like a distant, forgotten dream, especially here in the crisp autumn air and bright sunshine. Alas, how can I doubt? As I was thinking this, my eyes fell upon the red scar on my poor darling's white forehead. As long as that mark is there, I cannot possibly doubt. And even when it's gone, its memory will keep my faith perfectly clear. Mina and I are afraid to be idle, so we've been going over all the diaries repeatedly. Strangely, while the reality of the situation feels more significant each time, the pain and fear seem to lessen. There appears to be some guiding purpose running through everything, which is comforting. Mina believes perhaps we are instruments meant for ultimate good. It could be! I will try to adopt her perspective. We haven't discussed the future with each other yet. It seems best to wait until we meet with the Professor and the others after they finish their investigations. This day is passing more quickly than I ever thought a day could for me again. It's already three o'clock.\n\nMina Harker's Journal, October 5th, 5 p.m.: We held a meeting to report on our findings. Those present were Professor Van Helsing, Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, Mr. Quincey Morris, Jonathan Harker, and myself, Mina Harker.\n\nDr. Van Helsing explained the steps they took today to figure out which boat Count Dracula escaped on and where it was headed:\n\n\"Since I knew he wanted to return to Transylvania,\" Van Helsing began, \"I was certain he would travel via the mouth of the Danube or somewhere else on the Black Sea, as that's how he arrived. It was a discouraging blank start for us. 'Omne ignotum pro magnifico' (Everything unknown is taken for something grand); so with heavy hearts, we began looking for ships that sailed for the Black Sea last night. He was on a sailing ship, as Madam Mina mentioned sails being set. These smaller ships often aren't listed prominently like the big ones in the Times' shipping report, so, following Lord Godalming's suggestion, we went to your Lloyd's, where records of all sailing vessels, no matter how small, are kept. There we found that only one ship bound for the Black Sea left with the tide. She is named the Czarina Catherine, sailing from Doolittle's Wharf towards Varna, and from there continuing to other places and up the Danube. 'Aha!' I said, 'This must be the ship carrying the Count.' So we immediately went to Doolittle's Wharf. There we found a man in a tiny wooden office, so small that the man looked larger than his workspace. We asked him about the Czarina Catherine's departure. He swore a lot, was red-faced, and loud, but he was a decent fellow nonetheless. And when Quincey discreetly gave him some crackling paper from his pocket, which the man quickly rolled up and hid in a small bag deep within his clothes, he became an even better fellow and was eager to help us. He came with us and questioned many rough, sweaty men working there; these men also became more cooperative once their thirst was quenched. They used many terms involving 'blood' and 'bloom' and other words I didn't understand, though I could guess their meaning; but despite that, they told us everything we needed to know.\n\n\"They collectively informed us how, yesterday afternoon around five o'clock, a man arrived in a great hurry. He was tall, thin, and pale, with a high nose, very white teeth, and eyes that seemed to burn. He wore all black, except for a straw hat that didn't suit him or the season. He scattered money around while quickly asking about ships sailing for the Black Sea and their destinations. Some people took him to the office and then towards the ship, but he didn't go aboard. Instead, he stopped at the shore end of the gang-plank and asked for the captain to come to him. The captain came when told he would be paid well; and although he swore profusely at first, he agreed to the terms. Then the thin man left, and someone directed him to a place where he could hire a horse and cart. He went there and soon returned, driving the cart himself, carrying a large box. He lifted this box down himself, though it took several others to lift it onto the ship's truck. He spoke extensively with the captain about how and where his box should be placed, but the captain didn't like it and swore at him in many languages, telling him he could come aboard and see where it was put if he wished. But he said 'no', that he wouldn't come just yet as he had much to do. Whereupon the captain told him he'd better hurry—'with blood'—because his ship would leave the 'place—of blood'—before the tide turned—'with blood'. Then the thin man smiled and said that of course, the ship would leave when the captain thought fit, but he would be surprised if it departed quite so soon. The captain swore again, in many languages, and the thin man bowed, thanked him, and said he would 'intrude' on his kindness by coming aboard before sailing. Finally, the captain, redder than ever and using even more languages, told him he didn't want any 'Frenchmen—with bloom upon them and also with blood—in his ship—with blood on her also'. And so, after asking where he might buy ship forms nearby, he left.\n\n\"No one knew where he went or 'bloomin' well cared,' as they put it, because they soon had other things to worry about—'well with blood again.' For it quickly became clear to everyone that the Czarina Catherine wouldn't sail as planned. A thin mist began to creep up from the river, and it grew and grew until a dense fog enveloped the ship and everything around her. The captain swore in multiple languages—very polyglot, polyglot with bloom and blood—but he could do nothing. The water level rose, and he began to fear he would miss the high tide entirely. He was in a very bad mood when, just at full tide, the thin man came back up the gang-plank and asked to see where his box had been stored. The captain replied that he wished both the man and his box—'old and with much bloom and blood'—were in hell. But the thin man wasn't offended. He went down with the mate, saw where it was placed, came back up, and stood on deck for a while in the fog. He must have gotten off by himself, as no one noticed him leave. Indeed, they weren't thinking about him, because soon after, the fog began to disappear, and everything was clear again. My thirsty friends with their colorful language laughed as they recounted how the captain's swearing surpassed even his usual multi-lingual outbursts, becoming even more vivid when he questioned other sailors on the river that hour and found that few of them had seen any fog at all, except right around the wharf. Nevertheless, the ship sailed out on the ebb tide and was undoubtedly far down the river mouth by morning. By the time they told us this, she was well out at sea.\n\n\"And so, my dear Madam Mina,\" Van Helsing concluded, \"we must pause for now, for our enemy is at sea, with the fog at his command, heading towards the Danube mouth. Sailing takes time, no matter how fast the ship; but when we start, we can travel overland much faster and intercept him there. Our best hope is to find him when he is in his box between sunrise and sunset, for then he is helpless, and we can deal with him as we should. We have several days to prepare our plan. We know exactly where he is going, as we have seen the ship's owner, who showed us the invoices and all the necessary documents. The box we seek is to be unloaded in Varna and handed over to an agent named Ristics, who will present his credentials there. So our merchant friend will have completed his part. When he asked if anything was wrong, suggesting he could telegraph Varna and have inquiries made, we said 'no,' because what needs to be done is not a matter for the police or customs. It must be handled by us alone, in our own way.\"\n\nAfter Dr. Van Helsing finished speaking, I asked him if he was absolutely certain that the Count had stayed on board the ship. He replied, \"We have the best proof: your own testimony from your hypnotic trance this morning.\" I asked him again if it was truly necessary to pursue the Count, for I dread Jonathan leaving me, knowing he would certainly go if the others did. He answered with increasing intensity, starting quietly but growing more angry and forceful as he spoke, until we could clearly see at least some of that personal dominance that had made him a leader among men for so long:\n\n\"Yes, it is necessary—absolutely necessary! First for your sake, and then for the sake of all humanity. This monster has already caused immense harm within the limited sphere where he operated and during the short time he was here, when he was still like a body groping blindly in darkness, not fully knowing his own small power. I have told the others all this; you, my dear Madam Mina, will hear it on my friend John's phonograph or your husband's. I have explained to them how the enormous task of leaving his own barren land—empty of people—and coming to a new country teeming with life, like a multitude of standing corn, was the result of centuries of work. If another of the Un-Dead, like him, were to attempt what he has done, perhaps all the centuries that have passed or ever will pass wouldn't help him. With this one, all the deep, strong, hidden forces of nature must have combined in some miraculous way. The very place where he has lived as Un-Dead for centuries is full of strange geological and chemical phenomena. There are deep caverns and fissures leading nobody knows where. There have been volcanoes, some still emitting waters with bizarre properties and gases that can kill or revitalize. Doubtless, there is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of occult forces that strange ways nourish physical life; and he himself possessed great qualities from the beginning. In a difficult, warlike era, he was renowned for having more courage, a more cunning mind, and a braver heart than anyone else. In him, some vital principle found its ultimate expression in a strange way; and as his body remained strong and grew, his brain grew too. All this happened without needing that diabolic assistance, which surely belongs to him; for it must ultimately yield to the powers that come from and symbolize good. And now this is what he means to us. He has infected you—oh, forgive me, my dear, for having to say such a thing; but I speak for your own good. He infected you in such a way that even if he does nothing more, you only have to live—to live in your own familiar, sweet way; and so in time, death, which is the common lot of man and sanctioned by God, will make you like him. This must not happen! We have sworn together that it will not. Thus we serve God's own will: that the world, and the men for whom His Son died, will not be surrendered to monsters whose very existence would dishonor Him. He has already allowed us to save one soul, and we go forth like the knights of the Cross in old times to save more. Like them, we shall travel towards the sunrise; and like them, if we fall, we fall in a righteous cause.\" He paused, and I said:\n\n\"But won't the Count wisely accept this setback? Since he's been driven from England, won't he avoid it, like a tiger avoids the village from which he's been hunted?\"\n\n\"Aha!\" he exclaimed, \"your comparison to the tiger is excellent for me, and I will use it. Your man-eater, as they call the tiger in India that has tasted human blood, cares no more for other prey but prowls incessantly until he gets it. This creature we are hunting from our village is also a tiger, a man-eater, and he will never stop prowling. No, by his very nature, he is not one to retreat and stay away. In his living life, he crossed the Turkish frontier and attacked his enemy on their own territory; he was beaten back, but did he stay away? No! He came back, again and again. Look at his persistence and endurance. With the undeveloped mind he had long ago, he conceived the idea of coming to a great city. What did he do? He found the most promising place in the entire world for his purposes. Then he deliberately and patiently set about preparing for the task. He discovered his strengths and powers through careful patience. He studied new languages. He learned about new social life, the new environment of old ways, politics, law, finance, science, the customs of a new land and people who have come into being since his time. The brief glimpse he had here only sharpened his appetite and intensified his desire. No, it even helped his brain grow, because it proved to him how absolutely right his initial hunches were. He accomplished all this alone, entirely alone! Starting from a ruined tomb in a forgotten land. What more might he not do now that the wider world of thought is open to him? He is someone who can smile at death, as we understand it; who can flourish amidst diseases that wipe out entire populations. Oh, if such a being were to come from God, not the Devil, what a force for good he might be in this old world of ours! But we are committed to setting the world free. Our work must be silent, and our efforts entirely secret, for in this enlightened age, when men doubt even what they see, the skepticism of wise men would be his greatest strength. It would serve as both his shield and his armor, and his weapons to destroy us, his enemies, who are willing to risk even our own souls for the safety of someone we love—for the good of humanity, and for the honor and glory of God.\"\n\nFollowing a general discussion, it was decided that nothing definite would be settled for tonight; we should all consider the facts and try to arrive at the proper conclusions. Tomorrow morning, at breakfast, we will meet again, share our conclusions with one another, and then decide on a specific course of action.\n\n.......................\n\nI feel a wonderful sense of peace and rest tonight. It's as if some lingering presence has been removed from me. Perhaps...\n\nMy thought was interrupted; I couldn't finish it. I caught sight of the red mark on my forehead in the mirror and knew I was still tainted.\n\nDr. Seward's Diary, October 5th: We all woke up early, and I believe sleep greatly benefited each of us. When we met for an early breakfast, there was more general cheerfulness than any of us had expected to experience again.\n\nIt's truly amazing how much resilience human nature possesses. Remove any obstacle, no matter what, by any means—even death—and we quickly revert to our fundamental principles of hope and enjoyment. More than once as we sat around the table, my eyes widened in wonder, questioning if the entire past few days hadn't been a dream. It was only when I saw the red mark on Mrs. Harker's forehead that I was pulled back to reality. Even now, as I seriously ponder the matter, it seems almost impossible to grasp that the source of all our troubles still exists. Even Mrs. Harker seems to lose sight of her ordeal for periods; it's only occasionally, when something reminds her, that she thinks of her terrible scar. We are scheduled to meet in my study in half an hour to decide on our course of action. I see only one immediate problem, which I sense instinctively rather than rationally: we must all speak honestly, yet I fear that in some mysterious way, poor Mrs. Harker's ability to speak freely is hindered. I know she forms her own conclusions, and from everything that has happened, I can guess how insightful and accurate they must be; but she is unwilling, or unable, to express them. I've mentioned this to Van Helsing, and he and I are going to discuss it when we are alone. I assume this is some effect of that dreadful 'poison' that entered her veins starting to work. The Count had his own reasons when he gave her what Van Helsing called 'the Vampire's baptism of blood.' Well, perhaps a poison can even be derived from good things; in an age when the very existence of ptomaines is still debated, we shouldn't be surprised by anything! One thing I know for sure: if my intuition about poor Mrs. Harker's silence is correct, then there is a terrible difficulty—an unknown danger—in the task ahead. The same power that forces her silence might also force her to speak (to the Count). I dare not think further, for doing so would dishonor a noble woman in my thoughts!\n\nVan Helsing is coming to my study a little before the others. I will try to introduce the topic with him.\n\nLater: When the Professor arrived, we discussed the situation. I could see he had something on his mind he wanted to say but felt hesitant to bring it up. After some beating around the bush, he suddenly said, \"Friend John, there is something you and I must discuss alone, at least at first. Later, we may have to share it with the others.\" Then he stopped, so I waited; he continued:\n\n\"Madam Mina, our poor, dear Madam Mina is changing.\" A cold shiver went through me, confirming my worst fears. Van Helsing went on: \"Given the sad experience with Miss Lucy, we must be forewarned this time before things go too far. Our task is now actually more difficult than ever, and this new problem makes every hour critically important. I can see the signs of the vampire starting to appear in her face. It is very, very subtle now, but it can be seen if one looks carefully without prejudice. Her teeth are a little sharper, and sometimes her eyes are harder. But these aren't the only signs; she is often silent now, just as Miss Lucy was. Lucy didn't speak, even when she wrote down what she wanted known later. Now, my fear is this: If she can, through our hypnotic trance, reveal what the Count sees and hears, isn't it more likely that he who first hypnotized her, and who drank her blood and made her drink his, could, if he wished, compel her mind to reveal to him what she knows?\" I nodded in agreement; he continued:\n\n\"Then, what we must do is prevent this. We must keep her unaware of our intentions, so she cannot reveal what she doesn't know. This is a painful task! Oh, so painful that it breaks my heart to think of; but it must be done. When we meet today, I must tell her that for reasons we cannot disclose, she must no longer be part of our discussions but simply be protected by us.\" He wiped his forehead, which was covered in sweat at the thought of the pain he might have to inflict on the poor soul who was already so tormented. I knew it would bring him some comfort if I told him I had reached the same conclusion; at least it would remove the pain of doubt. I told him, and the effect was exactly as I expected.\n\nIt is now almost time for our general meeting. Van Helsing has left to prepare for the meeting and his difficult role in it. I truly believe he wants time to pray alone.\n\nLater: At the very beginning of our meeting, both Van Helsing and I felt a great personal relief. Mrs. Harker had sent a message through her husband saying she would not join us for now, as she thought it better that we be free to discuss our plans without her presence causing any constraint. The Professor and I exchanged a look for an instant, and somehow, we both felt relieved. For my part, I thought that if Mrs. Harker herself recognized the danger, it averted a great deal of both pain and danger. Under the circumstances, we agreed, with a questioning look and a silent answer (finger on lip), to keep our suspicions quiet until we could speak alone again. We immediately launched into planning our campaign. Van Helsing first briefly presented the facts:\n\n\"The Czarina Catherine left the Thames yesterday morning. At the fastest speed she can manage, it will take her at least three weeks to reach Varna; but we can travel overland to the same place in three days. Now, if we subtract two days from the ship's voyage time, allowing for such weather influences as we know the Count can exert; and if we allow a full day and night for any delays we might encounter, then we have a margin of nearly two weeks. Thus, to be completely safe, we must leave here by the 17th at the very latest. Then we will definitely be in Varna a day before the ship arrives and able to make any necessary preparations. Of course, we will all go armed—armed against evil things, both spiritual and physical.\" Here Quincey Morris added:\n\n\"I understand the Count comes from a region with many wolves, and it's possible he might get there overland faster than the ship. I suggest we add Winchesters to our weapons. I have a certain faith in a Winchester when facing trouble of that kind. Do you remember, Art, when we were chased by the wolf pack at Tobolsk? What wouldn't we have given for a repeater each then!\"\n\n\"Excellent!\" said Van Helsing, \"Winchesters it shall be. Quincey's judgment is always sound, but especially so when it comes to hunting. The metaphor dishonors science less than wolves endanger man. In the meantime, there is nothing we can do here; and since I believe Varna is unfamiliar to all of us, why not go there sooner? Waiting here is as long as waiting there. Tonight and tomorrow we can get ready, and then, if all goes well, we four can begin our journey.\"\n\n\"We four?\" Harker asked, looking questioningly from one of us to another.\n\n\"Of course!\" the Professor answered quickly, \"you must remain to take care of your dear wife!\" Harker was silent for a moment and then said in a strained voice, \"Let us discuss that part of it in the morning. I want to consult with Mina.\" I thought this was the moment for Van Helsing to warn him not to reveal our plans to her; but he showed no sign. I looked at him meaningfully and coughed. In response, he put his finger to his lips and turned away.\n\nJonathan Harker's Journal, October 5th, afternoon: For some time after our meeting this morning, I was unable to think. The new developments have left my mind in a state of shock that prevents any active thought. Mina's decision not to participate in the discussion made me think; and since I couldn't argue with her about it, I could only speculate. I am still as far as ever from understanding it. The way the others accepted it also confused me; the last time we discussed the subject, we agreed there would be no more secrets among us. Mina is sleeping now, peacefully and sweetly like a small child. Her lips are curved, and her face is radiant with happiness. Thank God that she can still have such moments.\n\nLater: How strange it all is. I sat watching Mina sleep happily and felt as close to being happy myself as I suppose I ever will be. As evening approached and the earth cast shadows from the setting sun, the silence in the room felt more and more solemn to me. Suddenly, Mina opened her eyes and, looking at me with great tenderness, said, \"Jonathan, I want you to make me a promise on your word of honor. A promise made to me, but made sacredly before God, and not to be broken, even if I were to fall on my knees and beg you with bitter tears. Quickly, you must make it to me at once.\"\n\n\"Mina,\" I said, \"a promise like that, I cannot make immediately. I may not have the right to make it.\"\n\n\"But, my dear one,\" she said, with such spiritual intensity that her eyes seemed like guiding stars, \"it is I who wish it; and it is not for my own sake. You can ask Dr. Van Helsing if I am right; if he disagrees, you are free to do as you will. Furthermore, if you all agree later, you are released from the promise.\" \n\n\"I promise!\" I said, and for a moment, she looked perfectly happy; though to me, all her happiness was overshadowed by the red scar on her forehead. She said:\n\n\"Promise me that you will not tell me anything about the plans made for the campaign against the Count. Not by word, or hint, or suggestion; never, as long as this mark remains upon me!\" and she solemnly pointed to the scar. I saw that she was serious and said solemnly, \"I promise!\" and as I said it, I felt that from that instant, a barrier had been erected between us.\n\nLater, midnight: Mina has been bright and cheerful throughout the evening. So much so that everyone else seemed to gain courage, as if catching some of her gaiety; as a result, even I felt as though the cloud of gloom weighing us down had lifted somewhat. We all went to bed early. Mina is now sleeping like a small child; it is a wonderful thing that she can still sleep amidst her terrible troubles. Thank God for that, for then at least she can forget her worries. Perhaps her example of sleep will affect me as her cheerfulness did tonight. I will try it. Oh, for a sleep without dreams.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Jonathan Harker writes that when he played Van Helsing's message for Mina, she felt much better, especially because knowing Dracula was no longer in England brought her relief and strength. Jonathan himself finds it hard to truly believe in their ordeal now that the immediate threat is gone—even recalling his time in Castle Dracula feels unreal. However, the sight of the mark on Mina’s forehead reminds him that their danger was real and ongoing. He and Mina keep busy by re-reading their diaries, noticing that while the situation seems more real with each reading, each time their pain and fear lessen, perhaps due to the sense of purpose guiding their actions. Mina suggests they might be serving some greater good. They’ve not discussed the future, but prefer to wait until they meet with the others.\n\nThe next day, Mina records a meeting with the group to hear Van Helsing's report. Van Helsing details how they tracked Dracula's escape: since Dracula would likely return to Transylvania via the Black Sea, they researched ships at Lloyd’s and identified only the Czarina Catherine headed for Varna. They questioned dockworkers, learning that the previous afternoon a strange, hurried foreigner in black (presumably Dracula) arranged to ship a large box and paid for its transport. There was confusion with the captain about the box, and strange fog gathered only at the ship’s location, delaying its departure. Eventually the ship sailed with the box and likely Dracula aboard, destined for Varna. Van Helsing concludes they now have some time to prepare, as they can reach Varna overland before the ship does. Their best hope is to intercept Dracula while he is helpless.\n\nMina anxiously asks if it is necessary for Jonathan to join the pursuit, fearing for his safety. Van Helsing passionately insists it is essential—for Mina’s sake and for all humanity. He explains that Dracula is an extraordinary evil, who has already done much harm and threatens to infect Mina, possibly turning her into someone like him if they do nothing. He says that only they, and not the authorities, can act against him. Mina wonders if Dracula will simply retreat after being defeated. Van Helsing instead describes Dracula as relentless like a man-eating tiger, unlikely to give up, because all his cunning and patience have been committed to preying on humans. Their task, Van Helsing says, is monumental but vital—they must act secretly, lest disbelief by others protect Dracula.\n\nThat evening, Mina feels a sense of peace, as if some heavy burden has lifted, but when she sees the mark on her forehead, she realizes she’s still touched by Dracula's influence.\n\nDr. Seward writes that the next morning, everyone feels better, as if the removal of danger lets them return to hope. Even Mina and Jonathan can sometimes act almost as if nothing had happened, though the mark on Mina’s forehead always brings them back to reality. Seward fears Mina is now afflicted by some vampiric influence, just as Lucy was, and confides this to Van Helsing. They agree that if Dracula can hypnotize Mina to see what he sees, perhaps he could also access her knowledge; so, to protect their plans, Mina must be kept ignorant of details, though it pains them deeply.\n\nTo their relief, Mina herself declines to take part in decisions, freeing them to strategize. Van Helsing lays out the plan: the Czarina Catherine will take some weeks to reach Varna, while they can arrive much sooner by rail, so they should leave by the 17th to arrive beforehand. They decide to arm themselves, including with weapons suitable for wolves. For now, Jonathan will stay with Mina. Later, Jonathan notes that Mina sleeps peacefully, but when she wakes she demands a promise—he must agree never to tell her anything of their plans against Dracula while she carries the scar. Jonathan promises, seeing a painful distance form between them. Mina's cheerful resilience heartens the whole group, and Jonathan resolves to follow her example and try to rest peacefully despite their circumstances."

I thought that it was another occasion for hypnotism, and without question went for the Professor. He had evidently expected some such call, for I found him dressed in his room. His door was ajar, so that he could hear the opening of the door of our room. He came at once; as he passed into the room, he asked Mina if the others might come, too.\n“No,” she said quite simply, “it will not be necessary. You can tell them just as well. I must go with you on your journey.”\nDr. Van Helsing was as startled as I was. After a moment’s pause he asked:—\n“But why?”\n“You must take me with you. I am safer with you, and you shall be safer, too.”\n“But why, dear Madam Mina? You know that your safety is our solemnest duty. We go into danger, to which you are, or may be, more liable than any of us from—from circumstances—things that have been.” He paused, embarrassed.\nAs she replied, she raised her finger and pointed to her forehead:—\n“I know. That is why I must go. I can tell you now, whilst the sun is coming up; I may not be able again. I know that when the Count wills me I must go. I know that if he tells me to come in secret, I must come by wile; by any device to hoodwink—even Jonathan.” God saw the look that she turned on me as she spoke, and if there be indeed a Recording Angel that look is noted to her everlasting honour. I could only clasp her hand. I could not speak; my emotion was too great for even the relief of tears. She went on:—\n“You men are brave and strong. You are strong in your numbers, for you can defy that which would break down the human endurance of one who had to guard alone. Besides, I may be of service, since you can hypnotise me and so learn that which even I myself do not know.” Dr. Van Helsing said very gravely:—\n“Madam Mina, you are, as always, most wise. You shall with us come; and together we shall do that which we go forth to achieve.” When he had spoken, Mina’s long spell of silence made me look at her. She had fallen back on her pillow asleep; she did not even wake when I had pulled up the blind and let in the sunlight which flooded the room. Van Helsing motioned to me to come with him quietly. We went to his room, and within a minute Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris were with us also. He told them what Mina had said, and went on:—\n“In the morning we shall leave for Varna. We have now to deal with a new factor: Madam Mina. Oh, but her soul is true. It is to her an agony to tell us so much as she has done; but it is most right, and we are warned in time. There must be no chance lost, and in Varna we must be ready to act the instant when that ship arrives.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "October 6th, morning – Another unexpected event occurred. Mina woke me up early, at the same hour as yesterday, and asked me to fetch Dr. Van Helsing. Believing she wanted another session of hypnotism, I immediately went to find the Professor. He seemed to anticipate such a summons, as I discovered him already dressed in his room. He had left his door slightly open so he could hear our door opening. He arrived promptly. As he entered the room, he asked Mina if the others could join them. \"No,\" she replied simply, \"it won't be necessary. You can inform them later. I must accompany you on your trip.\" Dr. Van Helsing was as taken aback as I was. After a brief silence, he inquired, \"But why?\" \"You have to bring me with you. I will be safer in your company, and you will be safer too.\" \"But why, dear Madam Mina? You understand that protecting you is our most solemn obligation. We are heading into danger where you are, or could be, more vulnerable than any of us due to – due to circumstances – things that have happened.\" He hesitated, looking uncomfortable. In her response, she lifted her finger and pointed to her forehead, saying, \"I know. That is precisely why I must go. I can tell you this now, while the sun is rising; I might not be able to later. I know that when the Count exerts his will over me, I am compelled to go. I know that if he instructs me to come in secret, I must do so cunningly, using any trick to deceive – even Jonathan.\" God witnessed the expression she directed at me as she spoke, and if there is indeed an Angel recording deeds, that look is surely noted for her eternal credit. I could only grasp her hand. I was unable to speak; my emotions were too intense for even tears to relieve. She continued, \"You men are brave and robust. You are strong in your collective numbers, allowing you to withstand something that would shatter the human endurance of someone having to guard alone. Furthermore, I might be helpful, since you can hypnotize me and thus discover things I myself am not aware of.\" Dr. Van Helsing responded very seriously, \"Madam Mina, you are, as always, exceedingly wise. You shall come with us; and together we will accomplish what we have set out to do.\" After he finished speaking, Mina's prolonged silence prompted me to look at her. She had fallen back onto her pillow, asleep; she didn't even stir when I raised the blind and let in the sunlight that filled the room. Van Helsing motioned for me to follow him quietly. We went to his room, and within a minute, Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris joined us. He relayed Mina's words to them and continued, \"Tomorrow morning we will depart for Varna. We must now account for a new element: Madam Mina. Ah, but her spirit is true. It causes her agony to reveal as much as she has; but it is absolutely right, and we have been forewarned in time. No opportunity must be missed, and in Varna, we must be prepared to act the instant that ship arrives.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "October 6, morning—There was another unexpected event. Mina woke me up early, just as she had the day before, and asked me to fetch Dr. Van Helsing.

Van Helsing seemed to have anticipated being summoned, as he was already dressed and his door slightly open so he could hear what was happening.

I need to accompany you on your journey.\" Both Van Helsing and I were taken aback. After pausing briefly, Van Helsing asked why she wanted to come along. Mina insisted, saying, \"You must take me with you. I’m safer with you, and you’ll be safer, too.\" Van Helsing reminded her that her safety was their priority and pointed out that the dangers they faced were especially threatening for her due to recent events. Lifting her hand to her forehead, Mina answered, \"I know. That’s exactly why I must go. While the sun is rising I can explain, but after, I may not be able to. Now I know that if the Count commands me, I’m compelled to obey. If he secretly orders me, I will do whatever is necessary to fool even Jonathan.\" She gave me such a look of love and courage that I could only hold her hand, too moved to speak or even weep. Mina continued, saying the men had strength in numbers and courage, able to face things that would overwhelm one person, and she might be helpful, since they could hypnotize her to discover things even she was unaware of. Van Helsing responded seriously, agreeing with her wisdom and saying she should go with them to accomplish their goal. After he spoke, I noticed Mina had fallen asleep on her pillow and didn’t wake even when I let sunlight into the room. Van Helsing quietly signaled for me to leave, and we went to his room, where Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris soon joined us. He relayed what Mina had said and explained, \"Tomorrow morning, we will depart for Varna. Now we must consider a new factor: Madam Mina. Her soul is pure, and though telling us this caused her pain, it was necessary and timely. We cannot waste a single opportunity, and in Varna we need to be ready to act as soon as the ship arrives.\""

And to superstition must we trust at the first; it was man’s faith in the early, and it have its root in faith still. Then, when we get the opportunity that we seek, when none are near to see, we shall open the box, and—and all will be well.”\n“I shall not wait for any opportunity,” said Morris. “When I see the box I shall open it and destroy the monster, though there were a thousand men looking on, and if I am to be wiped out for it the next moment!” I grasped his hand instinctively and found it as firm as a piece of steel. I think he understood my look; I hope he did.\n“Good boy,” said Dr. Van Helsing. “Brave boy. Quincey is all man. God bless him for it. My child, believe me none of us shall lag behind or pause from any fear. I do but say what we may do—what we must do. But, indeed, indeed we cannot say what we shall do. There are so many things which may happen, and their ways and their ends are so various that until the moment we may not say. We shall all be armed, in all ways; and when the time for the end has come, our effort shall not be lack. Now let us to-day put all our affairs in order. Let all things which touch on others dear to us, and who on us depend, be complete; for none of us can tell what, or when, or how, the end may be. As for me, my own affairs are regulate; and as I have nothing else to do, I shall go make arrangements for the travel. I shall have all tickets and so forth for our journey.”\nThere was nothing further to be said, and we parted. I shall now settle up all my affairs of earth, and be ready for whatever may come....\nLater.—It is all done; my will is made, and all complete. Mina if she survive is my sole heir. If it should not be so, then the others who have been so good to us shall have remainder.\nIt is now drawing towards the sunset; Mina’s uneasiness calls my attention to it. I am sure that there is something on her mind which the time of exact sunset will reveal. These occasions are becoming harrowing times for us all, for each sunrise and sunset opens up some new danger—some new pain, which, however, may in God’s will be means to a good end. I write all these things in the diary since my darling must not hear them now; but if it may be that she can see them again, they shall be ready.\nShe is calling to me.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Mr. Morris concisely asked what their precise course of action would be. The Professor paused before responding. He explained that their first step would be to board the ship, identify the specific box, and then secure a branch of wild rose upon it. He noted they would fasten it there because, according to superstition, its presence would prevent anything from emerging. He stressed that they must rely on superstition initially, as it originated from early human faith and still retained that foundation. Then, when they found the opportunity without witnesses, they would open the box, and the matter would be resolved. Morris interjected, stating he wouldn't wait for an opportune moment. He declared his intention to open the box and destroy the creature as soon as he saw it, even if a thousand people were watching and he faced immediate death for it. I instinctively gripped his hand and felt his unyielding firmness, like steel. I believe he understood my look; I hope he did. Dr. Van Helsing commended him, saying, \"Good boy. Brave boy. Quincey is entirely a man. May God bless him for it.\" He then reassured them, \"My child, rest assured none of us will fall behind or hesitate out of fear. I am only suggesting what we might or must do. But truly, we cannot be certain what we will do. So many possibilities exist, and their paths and conclusions are so varied, that we cannot predict the outcome until it happens.\" He added that they would all be thoroughly armed and prepared, and when the final moment arrived, they would not be lacking in their efforts. He instructed them to arrange all their personal affairs that day, ensuring everything concerning their loved ones and dependents was settled, as none of them could know what, when, or how the end would come. As for himself, his own matters were in order, and having nothing else to do, he would proceed to make the travel arrangements, including obtaining all necessary tickets and documents for their journey. There was nothing further to discuss, and they parted ways. I will now finalize all my worldly matters and be ready for whatever fate brings.... A later entry: It is all done; my will is made and complete. If she survives, Mina is my sole heir. If not, the remainder will go to the others who have been so good to us. It is now approaching sunset; Mina's restlessness draws my attention to it. I am certain she is anticipating something that the exact time of sunset will reveal. These moments are becoming agonizing for all of us, as each sunrise and sunset seems to uncover some new danger or pain, which, however, may be a means to a good end in God's will. I record all these thoughts in my diary because my darling must not hear them now, but if it should be possible for her to see them again, they will be here for her. She is calling to me now.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Mr. Morris asked, in a brief manner, what exactly they should do. The Professor took a moment before answering: at their first chance, they would board the ship, find the box they sought, and secure a branch of wild rose upon it. According to superstition, nothing inside could escape with the wild rose present; they would have to rely on these old beliefs, since faith once began as such and still contains truth. When the opportunity arose with no witnesses around, they would open the box and, hopefully, everything would turn out well.\n\nMorris declared he would not wait for a safer moment—if he saw the box, he would open it and destroy the creature, no matter how many watched or if it cost him his life. I instinctively shook his firm hand, sharing a silent understanding.\n\nVan Helsing praised Morris’s bravery, assuring everyone no one would hesitate out of fear. He emphasized that while they could plan for several possibilities, the uncertainties ahead made it impossible to predict their exact actions. All would be ready for whatever might happen, with preparations made thoroughly. Van Helsing said he himself was ready, and would now arrange travel details, including tickets.\n\nWith nothing more to discuss, we separated so everyone could settle their personal matters and prepare for what might come.\n\nLater, I finished organizing my affairs and made my will; Mina is my sole heir, and if not her, then those friends who have supported us. As sunset approaches, Mina’s anxiety catches my attention. I sense she knows something linked to the precise moment of sunset. Each sunrise and sunset increases our anxiety because new dangers or sorrows may arise, though perhaps God will turn them for good. I record all this in my diary, as Mina shouldn’t hear it for now, but perhaps she will one day. She is calling me."

          "text_segment": "11 October, Evening.—Jonathan Harker has asked me to note this, as he says he is hardly equal to the task, and he wants an exact record kept.\nI think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see Mrs. Harker a little before the time of sunset. We have of late come to understand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom; when her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduing or restraining her, or inciting her to action. This mood or condition begins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and lasts till either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds are still aglow with the rays streaming above the horizon. At first there is a sort of negative condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolute freedom quickly follows; when, however, the freedom ceases the change-back or relapse comes quickly, preceded only by a spell of warning silence.\nTo-night, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and bore all the signs of an internal struggle. I put it down myself to her making a violent effort at the earliest instant she could do so. A very few minutes, however, gave her complete control of herself; then, motioning her husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was half reclining, she made the rest of us bring chairs up close. Taking her husband’s hand in hers began:—\n“We are all here together in freedom, for perhaps the last time! I know, dear; I know that you will always be with me to the end.” This was to her husband whose hand had, as we could see, tightened upon hers. “In the morning we go out upon our task, and God alone knows what may be in store for any of us. You are going to be so good to me as to take me with you. I know that all that brave earnest men can do for a poor weak woman, whose soul perhaps is lost—no, no, not yet, but is at any rate at stake—you will do. But you must remember that I am not as you are. There is a poison in my blood, in my soul, which may destroy me; which must destroy me, unless some relief comes to us. Oh, my friends, you know as well as I do, that my soul is at stake; and though I know there is one way out for me, you must not and I must not take it!” She looked appealingly to us all in turn, beginning and ending with her husband.\n“What is that way?” asked Van Helsing in a hoarse voice. “What is that way, which we must not—may not—take?”\n“That I may die now, either by my own hand or that of another, before the greater evil is entirely wrought. I know, and you know, that were I once dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit, even as you did my poor Lucy’s. Were death, or the fear of death, the only thing that stood in the way I would not shrink to die here, now, amidst the friends who love me. But death is not all. I cannot believe that to die in such a case, when there is hope before us and a bitter task to be done, is God’s will. Therefore, I, on my part, give up here the certainty of eternal rest, and go out into the dark where may be the blackest things that the world or the nether world holds!” We were all silent, for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude. The faces of the others were set and Harker’s grew ashen grey; perhaps he guessed better than any of us what was coming. She continued:—\n“This is what I can give into the hotch-pot.” I could not but note the quaint legal phrase which she used in such a place, and with all seriousness. “What will each of you give? Your lives I know,” she went on quickly, “that is easy for brave men. Your lives are God’s, and you can give them back to Him; but what will you give to me?” She looked again questioningly, but this time avoided her husband’s face. Quincey seemed to understand; he nodded, and her face lit up. “Then I shall tell you plainly what I want, for there must be no doubtful matter in this connection between us now. You must promise me, one and all—even you, my beloved husband—that, should the time come, you will kill me.”\n“What is that time?” The voice was Quincey’s, but it was low and strained.\n“When you shall be convinced that I am so changed that it is better that I die than I may live. When I am thus dead in the flesh, then you will, without a moment’s delay, drive a stake through me and cut off my head; or do whatever else may be wanting to give me rest!”\nQuincey was the first to rise after the pause. He knelt down before her and taking her hand in his said solemnly:—\n“I’m only a rough fellow, who hasn’t, perhaps, lived as a man should to win such a distinction, but I swear to you by all that I hold sacred and dear that, should the time ever come, I shall not flinch from the duty that you have set us. And I promise you, too, that I shall make all certain, for if I am only doubtful I shall take it that the time has come!”\n“My true friend!” was all she could say amid her fast-falling tears, as, bending over, she kissed his hand.\n“I swear the same, my dear Madam Mina!” said Van Helsing.\n“And I!” said Lord Godalming, each of them in turn kneeling to her to take the oath. I followed, myself. Then her husband turned to her wan-eyed and with a greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness of his hair, and asked:—\n“And must I, too, make such a promise, oh, my wife?”\n“You too, my dearest,” she said, with infinite yearning of pity in her voice and eyes. “You must not shrink. You are nearest and dearest and all the world to me; our souls are knit into one, for all life and all time. Think, dear, that there have been times when brave men have killed their wives and their womenkind, to keep them from falling into the hands of the enemy. Their hands did not falter any the more because those that they loved implored them to slay them. It is men’s duty towards those whom they love, in such times of sore trial! And oh, my dear, if it is to be that I must meet death at any hand, let it be at the hand of him that loves me best. Dr. Van Helsing, I have not forgotten your mercy in poor Lucy’s case to him who loved”—she stopped with a flying blush, and changed her phrase—“to him who had best right to give her peace. If that time shall come again, I look to you to make it a happy memory of my husband’s life that it was his loving hand which set me free from the awful thrall upon me.”\n“Again I swear!” came the Professor’s resonant voice.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "On the evening of October 11th, I, Seward, was asked by Jonathan Harker to make a record of the events, as he felt unable to do so himself. We were all summoned to see Mrs. Harker shortly before sunset. By now, we understood that the times around sunrise and sunset were periods when she seemed uniquely free from the influence controlling her, moments when her true self could emerge unrestrained or compelled. This state typically began roughly half an hour before the actual event and lasted until the sun was high or the sky still glowed with its light. It started with a feeling of something being loosened, followed by complete freedom. When this freedom ended, the shift back or relapse was sudden, preceded only by a silent warning spell. When we gathered tonight, she initially appeared somewhat constrained, showing signs of a significant inner conflict. I believed this was her forcing the effort to gain control as early as possible. However, within minutes, she was fully in command of herself. She gestured for her husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she lay partially reclined, and asked the rest of us to pull our chairs close. Holding her husband's hand, she began by saying that this might be their last time together in this state of freedom. Looking at Jonathan, whose grip on her hand tightened, she assured him she knew he would be with her always. She stated that the next morning they would embark on their task, and only God knew what awaited any of them. She asked to be allowed to accompany them, acknowledging that these brave, earnest men would do everything possible for a fragile woman whose soul might be lost—or at least, was certainly in peril. However, she reminded us she was different; a \"poison\" was within her blood and soul that could destroy her, unless they found a remedy. She pleaded with us, saying we knew her soul was at stake, and while she knew of a way out for herself, neither she nor we must take it. Van Helsing, his voice hoarse, immediately asked what this forbidden way was. She revealed it was for her to die now, either by her own hand or another's, before the full evil could manifest. She explained that if she were dead, her immortal spirit could be set free, just as Lucy's had been. She insisted that if only death, or the fear of it, were the obstacle, she would not hesitate to die now among her friends. But death wasn't everything; she couldn't believe that dying now, when there was hope and a crucial task ahead, was God's will. Therefore, she declared, she was giving up the certainty of eternal rest in the present moment to venture into the darkness, which might hold the vilest things on Earth or in the netherworld. We all remained silent, sensing this was merely the introduction. The others' faces were grim, and Harker's turned ashen gray, perhaps sensing more deeply what was coming. She continued, using the unexpectedly formal phrase \"hotch-pot\" with complete seriousness, to ask what each of us would contribute to this shared effort. She quickly added that she knew we would offer our lives, which was easy for brave men whose lives belonged to God to give back to Him. But then she asked what we would give *to her*. She looked around, avoiding her husband's gaze this time. Quincey seemed to grasp her meaning and nodded, causing her face to brighten. \"Then I shall tell you clearly what I want,\" she stated, \"because there can be no ambiguity between us now.\" She demanded that every one of us—including her beloved husband—promise that when the time came, we would kill her. Quincey, his voice low and strained, asked what time that would be. She replied, \"When you are convinced that I am so fundamentally changed that death is preferable to continued life.\" She instructed that when she was thus physically dead, we must immediately drive a stake through her heart and cut off her head, or perform whatever other action was necessary to grant her peace. After a pause, Quincey was the first to act. He knelt before her, took her hand, and solemnly vowed that though he was a rough fellow who perhaps hadn't lived a life deserving of such a solemn duty, he swore by all he held sacred that should the time ever come, he would not shrink from the task she had assigned them. He also promised to make sure of it, stating that if he were merely in doubt, he would take it as a sign that the time had arrived. Amidst her rapidly falling tears, she could only manage, \"My true friend!\" as she bent and kissed his hand. Van Helsing then declared, \"I swear the same, my dear Madam Mina!\" Lord Godalming followed, each kneeling in turn to take the oath, and I did the same. Finally, her husband turned to her, his eyes pale and a greenish pallor tinting the whiteness of his hair, and asked if he too must make such a promise. \"You too, my dearest,\" she said, her voice and eyes filled with infinite, pitiful yearning. \"You must not hesitate.\" She reminded him that he was her closest, dearest, and her entire world, their souls intertwined for all life and time. She urged him to consider that brave men throughout history had killed their wives and loved ones to prevent them from falling into enemy hands, and their hands had not faltered even when their loved ones begged them to do it. She insisted this was a man's duty towards those they loved in times of extreme trial. And oh, she added, if she had to meet death by someone's hand, let it be the hand of the one who loved her most. She referenced Van Helsing's mercy in Lucy's case towards the one who loved—she stopped with a sudden blush and rephrased—towards the one who had the best right to give her peace. She looked to Van Helsing, asking that if that time should come again, he help ensure it would be a cherished memory in her husband's life that it was his loving hand which freed her from the terrible hold upon her. The Professor's resonant voice echoed, \"Again I swear!\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "October 11, Evening—Jonathan Harker asked me to write this down, as he feels unable to and wants an accurate record. Lately, we’ve all become aware that Mrs. Harker has special moments of freedom around sunrise and sunset. During these times, her true self seems to return without outside forces influencing her. This state usually starts about half an hour before sunrise or sunset, and continues either until the sun is fully up or the clouds are still glowing from the light. Initially, it feels as if something holding her back is released, followed by complete freedom, but once it ends, she quickly returns to her previous state, usually after a short, solemn silence.\n\nTonight, when we saw her, she seemed tense and was clearly struggling inside. I thought she was fighting hard to become herself again as soon as it was possible. After a few minutes, she regained control, gestured for her husband to sit next to her, and called the rest of us close. Holding her husband’s hand, she began, “We are together, free, maybe for the last time. My dear, I know you will stay by me to the end.” She looked at her husband, who responded by holding her hand tighter. “Tomorrow, we face our task, and only God knows what will happen. You are kind enough to let me come along. I know you all will do everything you can for me, a weak woman who fears her soul is lost—but not yet, though it is in danger. But remember, I’m not like you. There’s something dark inside me that will destroy me unless we find salvation. You know my soul is at risk; though I know there is a way out, we cannot choose it.” She looked to each of us, starting and ending with her husband.\n\nVan Helsing asked, “What is that way we cannot choose?”\n\nShe replied, “That I die now, by my own or another’s hand, before the evil can be completed. If I died, you could free my soul, as you did for Lucy. If death was all, I would not hesitate to die here among my friends. But it’s not simply about death. If there’s hope and a difficult task ahead, I cannot believe dying now is God’s will. So I give up the certainty of peace for the unknown, facing whatever darkness may come.” We all stayed silent, knowing more was to come. The others’ faces were set, and Harker went pale; perhaps he understood best what was coming next. She continued: “Here is my contribution.” I noticed her use of a legal term, even in this serious moment. “What will each of you give? Your lives, I know, for you are brave men—but what will you give for me?” She looked at us again, avoiding her husband’s gaze. Quincey nodded, and she seemed encouraged. “I must be direct. All of you, including my husband, must promise that if the time comes, you will kill me.”\n\nQuincey, his voice strained, asked, “When is that time?”\n\n“When you’re convinced I’ve changed so much that it would be better for me to die than keep living. When I am truly dead, without delay, you must stake me and cut off my head—or do whatever is needed to give me peace.”\n\nAfter a pause, Quincey knelt before her, took her hand, and said solemnly, “I’m not a refined man, but I swear by all I hold dear that if that time comes, I won’t hesitate to do what you ask. And I’ll make sure of it, even if I have doubts.” She could only thank him through tears and kissed his hand.\n\n“I swear the same, Madam Mina,” said Van Helsing, followed by Lord Godalming, each also kneeling and swearing the oath. I did so too. Then Jonathan, pale and shaken, asked, “Must I make such a promise, too, my wife?”\n\nWith deep love and pity, she replied, “Yes, my dearest. Do not hesitate. You are closest to me; our souls are joined for all time. Remember, sometimes, men have had to kill the women they loved to keep them from the enemy. They did not fail, even when their loved ones begged for mercy. This is what a man must do for those he loves in such hard times. And if I must die, let it be by your hand, who loves me most. Dr. Van Helsing, I remember your kindness to poor Lucy’s lover—you let him do what was needed for her. If the time comes again, I hope my husband will have that same memory: that it was his loving hand that set me free from this terrible fate.”\n\n“I swear it again!” Van Helsing answered boldly."

At such a time I myself might be—nay! if the time ever comes, shall be—leagued with your enemy against you.”\n“One more request;” she became very solemn as she said this, “it is not vital and necessary like the other, but I want you to do one thing for me, if you will.” We all acquiesced, but no one spoke; there was no need to speak:—\n“I want you to read the Burial Service.” She was interrupted by a deep groan from her husband; taking his hand in hers, she held it over her heart, and continued: “You must read it over me some day. Whatever may be the issue of all this fearful state of things, it will be a sweet thought to all or some of us. You, my dearest, will I hope read it, for then it will be in your voice in my memory for ever—come what may!”\n“But oh, my dear one,” he pleaded, “death is afar off from you.”\n“Nay,” she said, holding up a warning hand. “I am deeper in death at this moment than if the weight of an earthly grave lay heavy upon me!”\n“Oh, my wife, must I read it?” he said, before he began.\n“It would comfort me, my husband!” was all she said; and he began to read when she had got the book ready.\n“How can I—how could any one—tell of that strange scene, its solemnity, its gloom, its sadness, its horror; and, withal, its sweetness. Even a sceptic, who can see nothing but a travesty of bitter truth in anything holy or emotional, would have been melted to the heart had he seen that little group of loving and devoted friends kneeling round that stricken and sorrowing lady; or heard the tender passion of her husband’s voice, as in tones so broken with emotion that often he had to pause, he read the simple and beautiful service from the Burial of the Dead. I—I cannot go on—words—and—v-voice—f-fail m-me!”\nShe was right in her instinct. Strange as it all was, bizarre as it may hereafter seem even to us who felt its potent influence at the time, it comforted us much; and the silence, which showed Mrs. Harker’s coming relapse from her freedom of soul, did not seem so full of despair to any of us as we had dreaded.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "With a visible smile of relief, Mrs. Harker leaned back and let out a sigh, then offered a critical piece of advice she stressed they must remember: if the crucial moment arrived, which could happen suddenly and without warning, they absolutely had to seize the chance immediately. She warned that at such a time, she herself might be—or rather, if it happened, *would* be—aligned with their adversary against them. She then made another request, adding that while it wasn't as vital as the previous warning, she hoped they would fulfill it for her if they could. Everyone agreed silently, understanding there was no need for spoken confirmation. Her request was: 'I want you to read the Burial Service.' Her husband let out a deep groan, interrupting her. She took his hand, placing it over her heart, and continued, stating, 'You must perform it for me someday. Regardless of how this terrible situation turns out, it will be a comforting thought for us all, or at least some of us. I especially hope you, my dearest, will read it, so your voice stays in my memory forever, no matter what happens!' Her husband pleaded, 'But oh, my love, death is far from you.' She raised a hand to caution him, saying, 'No. I am currently deeper in a state of death than if the weight of an actual grave were upon me!' 'Oh, my wife, must I truly read it?' he asked before starting. 'It would bring me peace, my husband!' was her simple reply; and as soon as she had the book ready, he began reading. The narrator struggles to articulate the peculiar nature of that scene—its gravity, its darkness, its sorrow, its terror, yet also its tender quality. They suggest that even a cynic, who sees only a distorted version of grim reality in anything sacred or emotional, would have been deeply moved upon witnessing that small gathering of loving, dedicated friends kneeling around the afflicted, grieving woman, or hearing the heartfelt emotion in her husband’s voice, which was so choked with feeling he frequently had to pause while reading the simple yet profound service for the Burial of the Dead. 'I—I cannot continue,' the narrator states, 'My words—and—my v-voice—f-fail me!' Her intuition proved correct. Despite how strange it all was, and perhaps how bizarre it might seem later even to them who felt its powerful effect then, it offered significant solace. The silence that followed, indicating Mrs. Harker’s impending loss of her spiritual freedom, did not feel as utterly despairing to anyone as they had initially feared.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Mrs. Harker actually smiled with relief, leaned back, and gave a crucial warning: things could happen very fast and without warning, and if they do, everyone must be ready to act immediately. She warned that when the time comes, she herself might—no, would—find herself allied with their enemy against her friends. She then made another request, less urgent but still important to her: she asked the group, and especially her husband, to promise to read the Burial Service over her someday, no matter what happened. It would comfort her deeply to know her husband’s voice would live in her memory, no matter the outcome. Jonathan Harker, distressed, protested that death was far from her, but she insisted she felt closer to death now than if she lay in the grave. He asked if he truly had to read the service, and she replied it would bring her comfort, so he began after she prepared the book. The moment was so strange and solemn—full of gloom, sadness, horror, but also sweetness—that it defied description; even someone who was usually skeptical or cynical could not have watched the scene without being deeply moved. Jonathan had to stop often, overcome by emotion, as he read the simple, beautiful Burial of the Dead service to his beloved wife while their friends gathered around in support. In the end, as odd as it all was, it brought them comfort, and the silence that followed did not feel as hopeless as they had expected, even as Mrs. Harker’s sense of peace faded."

We travelled night and day, arriving here at about five o’clock. Lord Godalming went to the Consulate to see if any telegram had arrived for him, whilst the rest of us came on to this hotel—“the Odessus.” The journey may have had incidents; I was, however, too eager to get on, to care for them. Until the Czarina Catherine comes into port there will be no interest for me in anything in the wide world. Thank God! Mina is well, and looks to be getting stronger; her colour is coming back. She sleeps a great deal; throughout the journey she slept nearly all the time. Before sunrise and sunset, however, she is very wakeful and alert; and it has become a habit for Van Helsing to hypnotise her at such times. At first, some effort was needed, and he had to make many passes; but now, she seems to yield at once, as if by habit, and scarcely any action is needed. He seems to have power at these particular moments to simply will, and her thoughts obey him. He always asks her what she can see and hear. She answers to the first:—\n“Nothing; all is dark.” And to the second:—\n“I can hear the waves lapping against the ship, and the water rushing by. Canvas and cordage strain and masts and yards creak. The wind is high—I can hear it in the shrouds, and the bow throws back the foam.” It is evident that the Czarina Catherine is still at sea, hastening on her way to Varna. Lord Godalming has just returned. He had four telegrams, one each day since we started, and all to the same effect: that the Czarina Catherine had not been reported to Lloyd’s from anywhere. He had arranged before leaving London that his agent should send him every day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported. He was to have a message even if she were not reported, so that he might be sure that there was a watch being kept at the other end of the wire.\nWe had dinner and went to bed early. To-morrow we are to see the Vice-Consul, and to arrange, if we can, about getting on board the ship as soon as she arrives. Van Helsing says that our chance will be to get on the boat between sunrise and sunset. The Count, even if he takes the form of a bat, cannot cross the running water of his own volition, and so cannot leave the ship. As he dare not change to man’s form without suspicion—which he evidently wishes to avoid—he must remain in the box. If, then, we can come on board after sunrise, he is at our mercy; for we can open the box and make sure of him, as we did of poor Lucy, before he wakes. What mercy he shall get from us will not count for much. We think that we shall not have much trouble with officials or the seamen. Thank God! this is the country where bribery can do anything, and we are well supplied with money. We have only to make sure that the ship cannot come into port between sunset and sunrise without our being warned, and we shall be safe. Judge Moneybag will settle this case, I think!\n16 October.—Mina’s report still the same: lapping waves and rushing water, darkness and favouring winds. We are evidently in good time, and when we hear of the Czarina Catherine we shall be ready. As she must pass the Dardanelles we are sure to have some report.\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n17 October.—Everything is pretty well fixed now, I think, to welcome the Count on his return from his tour. Godalming told the shippers that he fancied that the box sent aboard might contain something stolen from a friend of his, and got a half consent that he might open it at his own risk. The owner gave him a paper telling the Captain to give him every facility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship, and also a similar authorisation to his agent at Varna. We have seen the agent, who was much impressed with Godalming’s kindly manner to him, and we are all satisfied that whatever he can do to aid our wishes will be done. We have already arranged what to do in case we get the box open. If the Count is there, Van Helsing and Seward will cut off his head at once and drive a stake through his heart. Morris and Godalming and I shall prevent interference, even if we have to use the arms which we shall have ready. The Professor says that if we can so treat the Count’s body, it will soon after fall into dust. In such case there would be no evidence against us, in case any suspicion of murder were aroused. But even if it were not, we should stand or fall by our act, and perhaps some day this very script may be evidence to come between some of us and a rope. For myself, I should take the chance only too thankfully if it were to come. We mean to leave no stone unturned to carry out our intent. We have arranged with certain officials that the instant the Czarina Catherine is seen, we are to be informed by a special messenger.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "October 15, Varna. We departed Charing Cross on the morning of the 12th, reached Paris that night, and boarded the reserved seats on the Orient Express. We traveled nonstop, arriving here around 5 PM. Lord Godalming went to the Consulate to check for messages, while the rest of us proceeded to this hotel, \"the Odessus.\" I wasn't concerned with any events during the journey, being solely focused on reaching our destination quickly. My sole interest in the world is the arrival of the \"Czarina Catherine.\" Thankfully, Mina is well and seems to be regaining her strength, with her colour returning. She sleeps extensively, having done so for most of the trip. However, just before dawn and dusk, she becomes quite active and alert. Van Helsing has made a routine of hypnotizing her at these specific times. Initially, it required some effort and repeated motions, but now she seems to enter the hypnotic state immediately, almost out of habit, with minimal prompting needed. At these moments, he appears to possess the ability to simply exert his will, and her thoughts comply. He consistently asks her what she perceives. To the question of sight, she replies, \"Nothing; it's all dark.\" Regarding sound, she says, \"I can hear the waves gently hitting the ship and the water rushing by. The canvas and ropes are tense, and the masts and spars are creaking. The wind is strong—I can hear it in the rigging, and the front of the ship is pushing back the sea spray.\" This suggests the \"Czarina Catherine\" is still at sea, making its way towards Varna. Lord Godalming just returned. He received four telegrams, one for each day since we began, all conveying the same information: the \"Czarina Catherine\" had not been reported anywhere to Lloyd's. Before leaving London, he had arranged for his agent to send a daily telegram confirming whether the ship had been reported. He requested a message even if it hadn't been reported, to ensure continuous monitoring was in place back home. We had dinner and retired early. Tomorrow, we plan to meet with the Vice-Consul to make arrangements, if possible, to board the ship as soon as it arrives. Van Helsing believes our best opportunity to board is between sunrise and sunset. The Count, even in bat form, cannot cross running water independently and is therefore confined to the ship. Since he wishes to avoid drawing attention by changing back to human form prematurely, he must remain inside his box. If we can board after sunrise, he will be vulnerable; we can open the box and eliminate him, just as we did with poor Lucy, before he awakens. We don't intend to show him much mercy. We anticipate little difficulty with officials or the crew. Fortunately, this is a place where money influences outcomes, and we have ample funds. We just need to guarantee that we are notified if the ship attempts to enter port between sunset and sunrise, and we should be safe. I suspect money will resolve any issues here! October 16. Mina's report remains unchanged: sounds of waves and rushing water, darkness, and favourable winds. It seems we have arrived at the right time, and we will be prepared when we hear about the \"Czarina Catherine.\" Since the ship must pass through the Dardanelles, we are confident of receiving notification. October 17. I believe everything is now largely arranged to welcome the Count upon his return journey. Godalming informed the shipping company that he suspected the box sent aboard might contain items stolen from an acquaintance and obtained a partial agreement to open it at his own risk. The owner provided him with a letter for the Captain, instructing him to facilitate Godalming's activities on board, along with a similar authorization for his agent in Varna. We have met with the agent, who was clearly impressed by Godalming's courteous demeanor, and we are confident that he will do everything within his power to assist us. We have already decided on our course of action if we manage to open the box. If the Count is inside, Van Helsing and Seward will immediately decapitate him and drive a stake through his heart. Morris, Godalming, and I will ensure no one interferes, using our ready weapons if necessary. The Professor states that if we can treat the Count's body in this manner, it will quickly turn to dust. This would eliminate any evidence against us should there be suspicions of murder. Regardless, we are prepared to face the consequences of our actions, and perhaps this very journal will one day serve as evidence that saves one of us from the gallows. Personally, I would readily accept that risk if it meant succeeding. We are committed to exploring every possibility to achieve our goal. We have made arrangements with certain officials to be notified by a special messenger the moment the \"Czarina Catherine\" is sighted.",

We departed Charing Cross on the morning of the 12th, reached Paris that night, and then caught the Orient Express with reserved seats. We traveled without pause and arrived here around five o’clock. Lord Godalming headed to the Consulate to check for telegrams, while the rest of us came to the Odessus Hotel. The trip may have been eventful, but I was too intent on our mission to notice or care. For me, nothing matters until the arrival of the Czarina Catherine. Thankfully, Mina’s health is improving—she’s looking better, her color is returning, and she’s sleeping frequently, barely waking during the journey. However, around sunrise and sunset she becomes very alert, and Van Helsing habitually hypnotizes her then. Initially, it required effort, but now she slips under quickly as if used to the procedure, responding immediately to his will. When prompted about what she experiences, Mina always replies that all is dark, and that she hears the sea: waves lapping, the rush of water, straining sails, creaking masts, and the wind blowing, indicating the Czarina Catherine is still at sea towards Varna. Godalming returned with four telegrams—one per day since we left—each confirming the ship hadn’t been spotted anywhere. He had arranged in advance to receive these notifications daily, regardless of news, ensuring constant updates. We dined and retired early. Tomorrow, we’ll meet the Vice-Consul and try to arrange boarding the ship upon its arrival. Van Helsing believes we must board between sunrise and sunset, as the Count, even as a bat, can’t cross running water by himself and thus can’t leave the ship. Since turning back into human form would draw attention, he must stay hidden in his box. If we get aboard after sunrise, he’ll be vulnerable in the box, and we can act against him as we did with Lucy, before he awakens. We expect little trouble from officials; bribery is effective here and we have ample funds. We simply need to ensure that the ship can’t dock between sunset and sunrise without our notice. Money will solve this problem. \n\nOctober 16th: Mina’s trance reports remain the same—darkness, waves, rushing water, and favorable winds—implying we are ahead of the Czarina Catherine and will be ready when she’s reported, expecting notice as the ship passes the Dardanelles. \n\nOctober 17th: Arrangements are nearly complete to confront the Count when he arrives. Godalming convinced the shippers the box might hold something stolen, gaining tentative approval to examine it at his own risk. The owner provided written authorization for the captain and the Varna agent to allow any action onboard. We’ve met the agent, who is eager to assist. Our plan is set: if we find the box and the Count inside, Van Helsing and Seward will immediately destroy him by decapitation and staking his heart, while Morris, Godalming, and I prevent interference, prepared to use weapons if necessary. The Professor says if we do this, the Count will turn to dust, leaving no evidence of murder, but even if not, we accept the consequences; perhaps this very journal will serve as testimony someday. For my part, I’d gladly take the risk. We’re determined to do whatever it takes, and we’ve arranged for immediate notice from officials when the Czarina Catherine is spotted."

Daily telegrams to Godalming, but only the same story: “Not yet reported.” Mina’s morning and evening hypnotic answer is unvaried: lapping waves, rushing water, and creaking masts.\nTelegram, October 24th.\nRufus Smith, Lloyd’s, London, to Lord Godalming, care of H. B. M.\nVice-Consul, Varna.\n“Czarina Catherine reported this morning from Dardanelles.”\nDr. Seward’s Diary.\n25 October.—How I miss my phonograph! To write diary with a pen is irksome to me; but Van Helsing says I must. We were all wild with excitement yesterday when Godalming got his telegram from Lloyd’s. I know now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard. Mrs. Harker, alone of our party, did not show any signs of emotion. After all, it is not strange that she did not; for we took special care not to let her know anything about it, and we all tried not to show any excitement when we were in her presence. In old days she would, I am sure, have noticed, no matter how we might have tried to conceal it; but in this way she is greatly changed during the past three weeks. The lethargy grows upon her, and though she seems strong and well, and is getting back some of her colour, Van Helsing and I are not satisfied. We talk of her often; we have not, however, said a word to the others. It would break poor Harker’s heart—certainly his nerve—if he knew that we had even a suspicion on the subject. Van Helsing examines, he tells me, her teeth very carefully, whilst she is in the hypnotic condition, for he says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is no active danger of a change in her. If this change should come, it would be necessary to take steps!... We both know what those steps would have to be, though we do not mention our thoughts to each other. We should neither of us shrink from the task—awful though it be to contemplate. “Euthanasia” is an excellent and a comforting word! I am grateful to whoever invented it.\nIt is only about 24 hours’ sail from the Dardanelles to here, at the rate the Czarina Catherine has come from London. She should therefore arrive some time in the morning; but as she cannot possibly get in before then, we are all about to retire early. We shall get up at one o’clock, so as to be ready.\n25 October, Noon.—No news yet of the ship’s arrival. Mrs. Harker’s hypnotic report this morning was the same as usual, so it is possible that we may get news at any moment. We men are all in a fever of excitement, except Harker, who is calm; his hands are cold as ice, and an hour ago I found him whetting the edge of the great Ghoorka knife which he now always carries with him. It will be a bad lookout for the Count if the edge of that “Kukri” ever touches his throat, driven by that stern, ice-cold hand!\nVan Helsing and I were a little alarmed about Mrs. Harker to-day. About noon she got into a sort of lethargy which we did not like; although we kept silence to the others, we were neither of us happy about it. She had been restless all the morning, so that we were at first glad to know that she was sleeping. When, however, her husband mentioned casually that she was sleeping so soundly that he could not wake her, we went to her room to see for ourselves. She was breathing naturally and looked so well and peaceful that we agreed that the sleep was better for her than anything else. Poor girl, she has so much to forget that it is no wonder that sleep, if it brings oblivion to her, does her good.\nLater.—Our opinion was justified, for when after a refreshing sleep of some hours she woke up, she seemed brighter and better than she had been for days. At sunset she made the usual hypnotic report. Wherever he may be in the Black Sea, the Count is hurrying to his destination. To his doom, I trust!\n26 October.—Another day and no tidings of the Czarina Catherine. She ought to be here by now. That she is still journeying somewhere is apparent, for Mrs. Harker’s hypnotic report at sunrise was still the same. It is possible that the vessel may be lying by, at times, for fog; some of the steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fog both to north and south of the port. We must continue our watching, as the ship may now be signalled any moment.\n27 October, Noon.—Most strange; no news yet of the ship we wait for. Mrs. Harker reported last night and this morning as usual: “lapping waves and rushing water,” though she added that “the waves were very faint.” The telegrams from London have been the same: “no further report.” Van Helsing is terribly anxious, and told me just now that he fears the Count is escaping us. He added significantly:—\n“I did not like that lethargy of Madam Mina’s. Souls and memories can do strange things during trance.” I was about to ask him more, but Harker just then came in, and he held up a warning hand. We must try to-night at sunset to make her speak more fully when in her hypnotic state.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "October 24th marked a full week of anticipation. Despite daily telegrams sent to Godalming, the response remained the same: \"Not yet reported.\" Mina's state under morning and evening hypnosis offered a consistent description: gentle waves, flowing water, and the sound of creaking masts.\nA telegram from Lloyd’s in London to Lord Godalming in Varna, dated October 24th, stated:\n“The ship Czarina Catherine has been reported from the Dardanelles this morning.”\nDr. Seward’s Diary Entry, October 25th:\nI truly miss using my phonograph! Writing this diary with a pen feels cumbersome, but Van Helsing insists I must. The news yesterday, when Godalming received the telegram from Lloyd’s, sent us all into a frenzy of excitement. I now understand the feeling men experience in battle upon hearing the call to fight. Of our group, only Mrs. Harker showed no outward sign of emotion. This isn't surprising, as we were careful to keep the information from her and controlled our own reactions in her presence. In the past, I am certain she would have noticed our efforts to hide something, no matter how hard we tried; however, she has changed significantly in this regard over the last three weeks. A growing lethargy seems to affect her, and despite appearing physically strong and regaining some colour, Van Helsing and I are concerned. We discuss her condition frequently but have not mentioned our worries to the others. Revealing our suspicions on this matter would undoubtedly devastate poor Harker, shattering his composure. Van Helsing informs me that he meticulously examines her teeth while she is under hypnosis. He believes that as long as they haven't begun to sharpen, there is no immediate threat of transformation. Should this change occur, decisive action would be required!... We both understand what those necessary steps would entail, though we refrain from articulating these thoughts to one another. Neither of us would flinch from the task, as dreadful as it is to contemplate. The word “Euthanasia” is truly excellent and comforting! I am thankful to whoever coined it.\nGiven the speed the Czarina Catherine travelled from London, it should take only about 24 hours to sail from the Dardanelles to our location. Therefore, its arrival is expected sometime in the morning. As it cannot possibly reach port before then, we are all planning to retire early. We will wake up at one o'clock to be ready.\nOctober 25th, Noon:\nStill no news of the ship’s arrival. Mrs. Harker’s hypnotic account this morning was unchanged from previous ones, suggesting that we could receive news at any moment. We men are all quite tense with anticipation, except for Harker, who remains outwardly calm. His hands are incredibly cold, and about an hour ago, I observed him sharpening the large Gurkha knife he now constantly carries. It will be a grim prospect for the Count if that 'Kukri's' blade is ever driven into his throat by Harker's determined, icy hand!\nToday, Van Helsing and I felt some concern regarding Mrs. Harker. Around midday, she fell into a state of listlessness that we found unsettling. Although we didn't voice our worries to the others, neither of us was comfortable. She had been restless earlier in the morning, so her sleeping initially seemed welcome. However, when her husband casually mentioned that her sleep was so deep he couldn't wake her, we went to her room to check. She was breathing normally and appeared so restful and serene that we concluded sleep was the best thing for her. The poor girl has so much she needs to forget; it’s understandable that sleep, if it brings her oblivion, would be beneficial.\nLater:\nOur earlier assessment proved correct, as she woke up after several hours of refreshing sleep looking brighter and more improved than she had in days. At sunset, she provided her usual hypnotic report. Wherever the Count might be in the Black Sea, he is clearly accelerating towards his destination. Towards his destruction, I hope!\nOctober 26th:\nAnother day has passed with no word of the Czarina Catherine. She should have arrived by now. Her continued journey is evident from Mrs. Harker’s hypnotic report at sunrise, which remained the same. It's possible the vessel is experiencing delays due to fog; some steamers that arrived last evening reported patches of fog both north and south of the harbour. We must keep vigil, as the ship could be sighted at any moment now.\nOctober 27th, Noon:\nThis is most peculiar; there is still no news of the ship we are awaiting. Mrs. Harker’s reports last night and this morning were consistent with the usual description of “lapping waves and rushing water,” although she did mention that “the waves were very faint.” The telegrams from London have also been unchanged: “no further report.” Van Helsing is extremely worried and just told me he fears the Count is getting away from us. He added pointedly:\n“I was troubled by Madam Mina’s lethargy. Souls and memories are capable of strange things during a trance state.” I was about to ask him more, but Harker entered the room just then, and Van Helsing raised a hand as a warning signal. We must try to encourage her to provide more detail during her hypnotic state at sunset tonight.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "October 24—We've spent a week waiting with no news. Every day we send telegrams to Godalming but always get the same reply: “Not yet reported.” Each morning and evening, Mina's hypnotic trances reveal only the sound of waves, the rush of water, and creaking masts.\n\nTelegram, October 24: Rufus Smith from Lloyd's in London to Lord Godalming at the Vice-Consul's office in Varna states, \"Czarina Catherine was reported this morning from the Dardanelles.\"\n\nDr. Seward's Diary: October 25—I miss my phonograph; writing by hand is tedious, but Van Helsing insists I do it. Yesterday, excitement erupted when Godalming received the telegram from Lloyd’s. Now I know how men feel at the call to battle. Only Mrs. Harker remained calm—and that's because we made sure she knew nothing about the news, hiding our excitement in her presence. In the past, she would have noticed our mood no matter how we concealed it, but she's changed in the last three weeks. Her lethargy is increasing. She appears healthy and is regaining some color, but Van Helsing and I remain uneasy. We often talk about her, but haven't shared our concerns with the others, especially Harker, as it would break his spirit. Van Helsing closely examines her teeth while she's hypnotized, believing that as long as they don’t sharpen, she's not at immediate risk of changing. If that happens, we'll have to act. We both know what must be done, even if we don’t say it out loud. \"Euthanasia\" feels like both a dreadful and consoling term. I’m grateful to whoever created it.\n\nAt the current pace, it’s only a day’s sail from the Dardanelles, so the Czarina Catherine should arrive by morning. Since it won't come before then, we plan to retire early so we’re up by one o'clock, ready.\n\nOctober 25, Noon—Still no word of the ship’s arrival. Mina’s report under hypnosis was unchanged this morning, so we might hear news at any time. The men are all nervous, except Harker, who remains composed—though his hands are icy, and I saw him sharpening his Ghoorka knife. If the Count ever falls into Harker’s hands, it will not go well for him!\n\nVan Helsing and I grew concerned for Mina around noon—she fell into a deep lethargic sleep. She had been restless in the morning, so at first we thought the sleep would help. When Harker mentioned she was sleeping so deeply that he couldn’t rouse her, Van Helsing and I checked in and found her breathing normally and looking peaceful—it seemed beneficial. She needs rest to help her escape her troubles, if only in sleep.\n\nLater—Fortunately, after several hours of rest she awoke much better and brighter than she had been in days. At sunset, her hypnotic report was the same. Wherever Dracula is in the Black Sea, he is hastening to his end, I hope!\n\nOctober 26—Still no word of the Czarina Catherine, which should have arrived by now. Mina’s morning hypnotic report was as before. Possibly the ship is delayed by fog, as some steamers reported patches of fog near the port. We remain vigilant—news could come at any moment.\n\nOctober 27, Noon—Very strange; still no word of the ship. Mina’s hypnotic descriptions remain “lapping waves and rushing water,” though last night she added the waves were fainter. Telegrams from London say, “no further report.” Van Helsing is anxious, fearing Count Dracula is slipping away. He warned me that Mina’s lethargy during hypnosis was unsettling—strange things can occur in trance. I wanted to ask more, but Harker entered, and Van Helsing signaled for silence. Tonight at sunset, we’ll try to get Mina to say more during hypnosis."

Vice Consul, Varna.\n“Czarina Catherine reported entering Galatz at one o’clock to-day.”\nDr. Seward’s Diary.\n28 October.—When the telegram came announcing the arrival in Galatz I do not think it was such a shock to any of us as might have been expected. True, we did not know whence, or how, or when, the bolt would come; but I think we all expected that something strange would happen. The delay of arrival at Varna made us individually satisfied that things would not be just as we had expected; we only waited to learn where the change would occur. None the less, however, was it a surprise. I suppose that nature works on such a hopeful basis that we believe against ourselves that things will be as they ought to be, not as we should know that they will be. Transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels, even if it be a will-o’-the-wisp to man. It was an odd experience and we all took it differently. Van Helsing raised his hand over his head for a moment, as though in remonstrance with the Almighty; but he said not a word, and in a few seconds stood up with his face sternly set. Lord Godalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily. I was myself half stunned and looked in wonder at one after another. Quincey Morris tightened his belt with that quick movement which I knew so well; in our old wandering days it meant “action.” Mrs. Harker grew ghastly white, so that the scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but she folded her hands meekly and looked up in prayer. Harker smiled—actually smiled—the dark, bitter smile of one who is without hope; but at the same time his action belied his words, for his hands instinctively sought the hilt of the great Kukri knife and rested there. “When does the next train start for Galatz?” said Van Helsing to us generally.\n“At 6:30 to-morrow morning!” We all started, for the answer came from Mrs. Harker.\n“How on earth do you know?” said Art.\n“You forget—or perhaps you do not know, though Jonathan does and so does Dr. Van Helsing—that I am the train fiend. At home in Exeter I always used to make up the time-tables, so as to be helpful to my husband. I found it so useful sometimes, that I always make a study of the time-tables now. I knew that if anything were to take us to Castle Dracula we should go by Galatz, or at any rate through Bucharest, so I learned the times very carefully. Unhappily there are not many to learn, as the only train to-morrow leaves as I say.”\n“Wonderful woman!” murmured the Professor.\n“Can’t we get a special?” asked Lord Godalming. Van Helsing shook his head: “I fear not. This land is very different from yours or mine; even if we did have a special, it would probably not arrive as soon as our regular train. Moreover, we have something to prepare. We must think. Now let us organize. You, friend Arthur, go to the train and get the tickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning. Do you, friend Jonathan, go to the agent of the ship and get from him letters to the agent in Galatz, with authority to make search the ship just as it was here. Morris Quincey, you see the Vice-Consul, and get his aid with his fellow in Galatz and all he can do to make our way smooth, so that no times be lost when over the Danube. John will stay with Madam Mina and me, and we shall consult. For so if time be long you may be delayed; and it will not matter when the sun set, since I am here with Madam to make report.”\n“And I,” said Mrs. Harker brightly, and more like her old self than she had been for many a long day, “shall try to be of use in all ways, and shall think and write for you as I used to do. Something is shifting from me in some strange way, and I feel freer than I have been of late!” The three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed to realise the significance of her words; but Van Helsing and I, turning to each other, met each a grave and troubled glance. We said nothing at the time, however.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "October 28th – A telegram was received. It was from Rufus Smith in London, addressed to Lord Godalming, who was staying with the British Vice Consul in Varna. The message reported that the ship 'Czarina Catherine' was said to have arrived in Galatz earlier that day, at one o'clock.\n\nDr. Seward's Diary.\n\nOctober 28th – When the telegram arrived announcing the ship's arrival in Galatz, I don't believe it startled us as much as it might have. Although we didn't know the exact nature, timing, or origin of the impending danger, I think we all anticipated something unusual would occur. The delay in the ship reaching Varna had already convinced us individually that events wouldn't unfold exactly as planned; we were simply waiting to discover where the change would manifest. Nevertheless, it was still a shock. I suppose it's human nature to hold onto hope, even against our better judgment, believing things will turn out as they should, not as our experience suggests they will. Such idealism might guide angels, even if it deceives humans. It was a strange moment, and each of us reacted differently. Van Helsing momentarily raised his hand above his head, seemingly in protest to the heavens, but spoke no word. Within seconds, he stood up, his face set in grim determination. Lord Godalming turned very pale and breathed heavily. I felt half-stupefied myself, staring in wonder at each person in turn. Quincey Morris gave a quick tug to his belt, a familiar gesture from our adventurous past that always signaled readiness for 'action'. Mrs. Harker became deathly white, her forehead scar appearing to intensify, yet she calmly clasped her hands and looked upwards in prayer. Harker smiled—yes, actually smiled—a dark, bitter smile like someone who has lost all hope, but his actions contradicted this, as his hands instinctively went to the handle of his large Kukri knife and rested there. Van Helsing then addressed the group, asking, \"When is the next train for Galatz?\"\n\nTo our surprise, the answer came from Mrs. Harker: \"At 6:30 tomorrow morning!\" We all started, taken aback.\n\nArt asked, \"How on earth do you know?\"\n\nShe replied, \"You forget – or perhaps you don't know, though Jonathan and Dr. Van Helsing do – that I'm a bit of a train enthusiast. When I was at home in Exeter, I always made a habit of studying the train timetables to help my husband. I found it so useful sometimes that I continue to study timetables now. I knew that if we needed to travel towards Castle Dracula, we would likely go via Galatz, or at least through Bucharest, so I memorized the schedules carefully. Unfortunately, there aren't many options; the only train tomorrow departs at the time I mentioned.\"\n\n\"Remarkable woman!\" the Professor murmured.\n\n\"Can't we get a special train?\" Lord Godalming inquired. Van Helsing shook his head. \"I doubt it. This country is quite unlike yours or mine; even if we could arrange a special, it likely wouldn't arrive any sooner than our scheduled train. Furthermore, we need time to prepare and strategize. Now, let's organize. Arthur, my friend, you go to the station, purchase the tickets, and ensure everything is arranged for our departure in the morning. Jonathan, you go to the ship's agent and obtain letters for the agent in Galatz, granting us permission to search the ship there, just as it was examined here. Morris Quincey, you will see the Vice-Consul and enlist his aid, both with his colleague in Galatz and with anything else he can do to facilitate our journey, so no time is wasted crossing the Danube. John will remain here with Madam Mina and myself, and we will strategize. This way, even if you are delayed, it won't matter when the sun sets, as I will be here with Madam to make a report.\"\n\nMrs. Harker spoke up cheerfully, sounding more like her usual self than she had in a long time. \"And I,\" she said, \"shall try to be helpful in every way, and will think and write for you, just as I used to. Something is shifting within me in a strange manner, and I feel freer than I have recently!\" The three younger men looked happier at that moment, as they seemed to grasp the significance of her words. However, Van Helsing and I exchanged glances and met each other's serious and troubled expressions. We did not say anything further at that time.",

We all suspected something unexpected would happen, especially since the ship didn’t arrive at Varna like we anticipated. Still, we were surprised. Human nature is such that we hope things will work out as they should, even when we suspect otherwise. This hope, though sometimes misleading, keeps us going. We each reacted differently. Van Helsing silently raised his hand as if protesting to heaven, then composed himself. Lord Godalming turned very pale and breathed quickly. I felt dazed, looking around at everyone. Quincey Morris tightened his belt, a sign he was ready for action. Mrs. Harker went so white that the scar on her forehead stood out, but she folded her hands and prayed. Harker actually smiled, though it was a grim, hopeless smile; despite that, he instinctively reached for his kukri knife. Van Helsing then asked when the next train to Galatz left. The surprising answer came from Mrs. Harker: “At 6:30 tomorrow morning!”\n\nArt asked how she knew, and she explained she had always studied train timetables and was prepared for this possibility by learning the local schedules. The Professor praised her. Lord Godalming wondered if they could hire a special train, but Van Helsing doubted it would arrive any sooner than the regular one, and besides, they needed to prepare. He then organized everyone’s tasks: Arthur would arrange tickets and make sure they were ready to go; Jonathan would get ship documentation for Galatz; Quincey would consult the Vice-Consul to ensure help in Galatz and speedy travel; and Dr. Seward would stay with Van Helsing and Mina to consult. It didn’t matter if the sun set, as Van Helsing would be with Mina to report. Mrs. Harker, feeling more herself, offered to help however she could, especially by thinking and writing as before. This announcement seemed to lift everyone’s spirits, except Van Helsing and Seward, who shared a concerned look but said nothing."

Do you know why I asked her to get the manuscript?”\n“No!” said I, “unless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me alone.”\n“You are in part right, friend John, but only in part. I want to tell you something. And oh, my friend, I am taking a great—a terrible—risk; but I believe it is right. In the moment when Madam Mina said those words that arrest both our understanding, an inspiration came to me. In the trance of three days ago the Count sent her his spirit to read her mind; or more like he took her to see him in his earth-box in the ship with water rushing, just as it go free at rise and set of sun. He learn then that we are here; for she have more to tell in her open life with eyes to see and ears to hear than he, shut, as he is, in his coffin-box. Now he make his most effort to escape us. At present he want her not.\n“He is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call; but he cut her off—take her, as he can do, out of his own power, that so she come not to him. Ah! there I have hope that our man-brains that have been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of God, will come higher than his child-brain that lie in his tomb for centuries, that grow not yet to our stature, and that do only work selfish and therefore small. Here comes Madam Mina; not a word to her of her trance! She know it not; and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when we want all her hope, all her courage; when most we want all her great brain which is trained like man’s brain, but is of sweet woman and have a special power which the Count give her, and which he may not take away altogether—though he think not so. Hush! let me speak, and you shall learn. Oh, John, my friend, we are in awful straits. I fear, as I never feared before. We can only trust the good God. Silence! here she comes!”",

It's a kind of hope that makes me uneasy, because it might turn out to be false.'\n'Precisely. Do you understand why I asked her to fetch the manuscript?'\n'No,' I replied, 'unless it was to give us an opportunity to speak privately.'\n'You are partially right, my friend John, but only in part. I need to tell you something. And oh, my friend, I am undertaking a significant—a terrible—risk; but I believe it is necessary. The moment Madam Mina spoke those words that captured both our attention, an idea came to me. During her trance three days ago, the Count either projected his spirit to read her mind, or more likely, he enabled her to see him in his coffin aboard the ship as it moved through the water, just as he is released from his confinement at sunrise and sunset. That's how he learned we were here; because in her waking life, with eyes to see and ears to hear, she has access to more information than he does, shut away in his coffin. He is now making his utmost effort to escape us. At this moment, he does not need her.\n'With his vast knowledge, he is confident she will come when he calls; but he has cut her off—removed her, as he is capable of doing, from his immediate influence—so she won't accidentally come to him now. Ah! This is where my hope lies: that our human minds, developed over centuries and still blessed with God's grace, will prove superior to his ancient 'child-brain' that has lain in his tomb for ages, that has not matured to our level, and that acts only out of selfishness and is therefore limited. Here comes Madam Mina; don't say a word to her about her trance! She doesn't know about it, and telling her would overwhelm her and cause despair just when we desperately need her hope, her courage; when we most need her great intellect, which is trained like a man's but is uniquely female and possesses a special power the Count gave her, which he may not be able to fully take away—even if he thinks otherwise. Quiet! Let me finish explaining, and you will understand. Oh, John, my friend, we are in a dreadful situation. I am afraid, as I have never been afraid before. We can only put our trust in God.

I can only hope it’s something good, though I worry it might be misleading.”\n\n“Exactly. Do you know why I really asked her to get the manuscript?”\n\n“No,” I replied, “unless you just wanted a chance to speak to me privately.”\n\n“That’s partly right, John, but not the whole reason. There’s something important I need to share with you. And, my friend, it’s a great—perhaps dangerous—risk, but I feel it’s the right thing to do. When Madam Mina spoke those fateful words, I was struck with an idea. During her trance three days ago, the Count somehow sent his spirit to probe her thoughts; perhaps he even drew her spirit to him, showing her his whereabouts in his earth-filled box aboard the ship as the tides ebbed and flowed at dawn and dusk. That’s how he learned of our presence here; she can perceive and share much more in her waking state than he can while confined to his coffin. Now, he’s doing everything he can to slip away from us. Right now, he doesn’t want her near him.\n\n“He relies on his ancient knowledge, believing that she will answer if he calls; yet, with his abilities, he’s trying to disconnect her from him so that she doesn’t reach out to him. This gives me hope: perhaps our human intellect—which has grown for generations and retains God’s grace—can surpass his childish mind, trapped and unchanged for centuries, only capable of narrow, selfish action. Here comes Madam Mina now; don’t mention her trance! She’s unaware of it, and telling her would crush her spirit, just when we most need her hope and courage, and her sharp mind—trained like a man’s, yet with the gentle strength and unique power the Count inadvertently granted her, which he may never fully reclaim. Hush! Let me speak now, and you’ll understand. Oh John, my friend, we are in terrible danger. I am more frightened than ever. Our only hope is in God. Quiet! She’s coming!”"

As she came in, she handed a number of sheets of typewriting to Van Helsing. He looked over them gravely, his face brightening up as he read. Then holding the pages between his finger and thumb he said:—\n“Friend John, to you with so much of experience already—and you, too, dear Madam Mina, that are young—here is a lesson: do not fear ever to think. A half-thought has been buzzing often in my brain, but I fear to let him loose his wings. Here now, with more knowledge, I go back to where that half-thought come from and I find that he be no half-thought at all; that be a whole thought, though so young that he is not yet strong to use his little wings. Nay, like the “Ugly Duck” of my friend Hans Andersen, he be no duck-thought at all, but a big swan-thought that sail nobly on big wings, when the time come for him to try them. See I read here what Jonathan have written:—\n“That other of his race who, in a later age, again and again, brought his forces over The Great River into Turkey Land; who, when he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph.”\n“What does this tell us? Not much? no! The Count’s child-thought see nothing; therefore he speak so free. Your man-thought see nothing; my man-thought see nothing, till just now. No! But there comes another word from some one who speak without thought because she, too, know not what it mean—what it might mean. Just as there are elements which rest, yet when in nature’s course they move on their way and they touch—then pouf! and there comes a flash of light, heaven wide, that blind and kill and destroy some; but that show up all earth below for leagues and leagues. Is it not so? Well, I shall explain. To begin, have you ever study the philosophy of crime? ‘Yes’ and ‘No.’ You, John, yes; for it is a study of insanity. You, no, Madam Mina; for crime touch you not—not but once. Still, your mind works true, and argues not a particulari ad universale. There is this peculiarity in criminals. It is so constant, in all countries and at all times, that even police, who know not much from philosophy, come to know it empirically, that it is. That is to be empiric. The criminal always work at one crime—that is the true criminal who seems predestinate to crime, and who will of none other. This criminal has not full man-brain. He is clever and cunning and resourceful; but he be not of man-stature as to brain. He be of child-brain in much. Now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crime also; he, too, have child-brain, and it is of the child to do what he have done. The little bird, the little fish, the little animal learn not by principle, but empirically; and when he learn to do, then there is to him the ground to start from to do more. ‘Dos pou sto,’ said Archimedes. ‘Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!’ To do once, is the fulcrum whereby child-brain become man-brain; and until he have the purpose to do more, he continue to do the same again every time, just as he have done before! Oh, my dear, I see that your eyes are opened, and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues,” for Mrs. Harker began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled. He went on:—\n“Now you shall speak. Tell us two dry men of science what you see with those so bright eyes.” He took her hand and held it whilst she spoke. His finger and thumb closed on her pulse, as I thought instinctively and unconsciously, as she spoke:—\n“The Count is a criminal and of criminal type. Nordau and Lombroso would so classify him, and quâ criminal he is of imperfectly formed mind. Thus, in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit. His past is a clue, and the one page of it that we know—and that from his own lips—tells that once before, when in what Mr. Morris would call a ‘tight place,’ he went back to his own country from the land he had tried to invade, and thence, without losing purpose, prepared himself for a new effort. He came again better equipped for his work; and won. So he came to London to invade a new land. He was beaten, and when all hope of success was lost, and his existence in danger, he fled back over the sea to his home; just as formerly he had fled back over the Danube from Turkey Land.”\n“Good, good! oh, you so clever lady!” said Van Helsing, enthusiastically, as he stooped and kissed her hand. A moment later he said to me, as calmly as though we had been having a sick-room consultation:—\n“Seventy-two only; and in all this excitement. I have hope.” Turning to her again, he said with keen expectation:—\n“But go on. Go on! there is more to tell if you will. Be not afraid; John and I know. I do in any case, and shall tell you if you are right. Speak, without fear!”\n“I will try to; but you will forgive me if I seem egotistical.”\n“Nay! fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you that we think.”\n“Then, as he is criminal he is selfish; and as his intellect is small and his action is based on selfishness, he confines himself to one purpose. That purpose is remorseless. As he fled back over the Danube, leaving his forces to be cut to pieces, so now he is intent on being safe, careless of all. So his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat from the terrible power which he acquired over me on that dreadful night. I felt it! Oh, I felt it! Thank God, for His great mercy! My soul is freer than it has been since that awful hour; and all that haunts me is a fear lest in some trance or dream he may have used my knowledge for his ends.” The Professor stood up:—\n“He has so used your mind; and by it he has left us here in Varna, whilst the ship that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up to Galatz, where, doubtless, he had made preparation for escaping from us. But his child-mind only saw so far; and it may be that, as ever is in God’s Providence, the very thing that the evil-doer most reckoned on for his selfish good, turns out to be his chiefest harm. The hunter is taken in his own snare, as the great Psalmist says. For now that he think he is free from every trace of us all, and that he has escaped us with so many hours to him, then his selfish child-brain will whisper him to sleep. He think, too, that as he cut himself off from knowing your mind, there can be no knowledge of him to you; there is where he fail! That terrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you free to go to him in spirit, as you have as yet done in your times of freedom, when the sun rise and set. At such times you go by my volition and not by his; and this power to good of you and others, as you have won from your suffering at his hands. This is now all the more precious that he know it not, and to guard himself have even cut himself off from his knowledge of our where. We, however, are not selfish, and we believe that God is with us through all this blackness, and these many dark hours. We shall follow him; and we shall not flinch; even if we peril ourselves that we become like him. Friend John, this has been a great hour; and it have done much to advance us on our way. You must be scribe and write him all down, so that when the others return from their work you can give it to them; then they shall know as we do.”\nAnd so I have written it whilst we wait their return, and Mrs. Harker has written with her typewriter all since she brought the MS. to us.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I observed that the Professor appeared to be on the verge of a breakdown, similar to his reaction when Lucy died, but with considerable effort, he composed himself and was completely steady nervously when Mrs. Harker came into the room. She looked cheerful and happy and seemed to have forgotten her troubles while occupied with her work. As she entered, she gave Van Helsing several typed pages. He reviewed them seriously, his expression brightening as he read. Then, holding the pages between his fingers, he commented, “Friend John, you already have much experience, and you, dear Madam Mina, though young—here is a lesson: never hesitate to think. A partial idea often came to mind, but I was hesitant to fully explore it. Now, with more information, I revisit that incomplete thought and realize it was not partial at all; it was a complete thought, albeit so new it couldn’t yet fully manifest itself. In fact, like my friend Hans Andersen's 'Ugly Duckling,' it wasn't a small duck-thought at all, but a grand swan-thought that will soar majestically when the time comes to try its wings. Look, I read here what Jonathan has written:\n\n'That other leader of his lineage who, in a later era, repeatedly led his forces across The Great River into the Turkish territories; who, when repelled, returned again and again and again, even if he had to come back alone from the bloodbath where his soldiers were being annihilated, because he knew only he could ultimately triumph.'\n\n“What does this tell us? Not much? No! The Count’s nascent thought understands nothing; therefore he speaks so freely. Your mature thought understands nothing; my mature thought understood nothing, until now. No! But another insight comes from someone who speaks without thinking because she, too, does not fully grasp what it means—what it *could* mean. It’s like chemical elements that are inert but, when they move and interact in nature’s process—then *pouf*! There is a blinding flash of light, stretching wide as the sky, which kills and destroys some, but also illuminates the land for miles around. Is it not so? Well, I will explain. To begin, have you ever studied the philosophy of crime? ‘Yes’ and ‘No.’ You, John, yes; because it is related to the study of mental illness. You, no, Madam Mina; because crime has not affected you—except that one time. Still, your mind functions correctly, and does not incorrectly generalize from a specific instance to a universal rule (*a particulari ad universale*). There is this peculiar trait in criminals. It is so consistent, in every country and time, that even police, who lack philosophical knowledge, grasp it empirically: that it exists. That is what it means to be empirical. The criminal always focuses on one type of crime—this is the true criminal who seems destined for crime and desires no other. This criminal does not have a fully developed adult brain. He is clever and shrewd and adaptable; but his brain capacity is not that of an adult man. In many ways, he has a child’s brain. Now, this criminal of ours is also destined for crime; he, too, has a child’s brain, and it is typical of a child to do what he has done. The young bird, the young fish, the young animal learn not through theory, but through experience; and when they learn to do something, that provides the basis for them to do more. ‘Give me a place to stand,’ said Archimedes, ‘and I shall move the world!’ Doing something once provides the foundation for a child’s brain to evolve into an adult brain; and until the criminal develops the goal to do something different, he will continue to repeat the same action every time, exactly as he has done before! Oh, my dear, I see your eyes are wide open, and the lightning flash reveals everything for miles to you,” for Mrs. Harker began clapping her hands, her eyes sparkling. He continued, “Now you must speak. Tell us two uninspired men of science what you perceive with those radiant eyes.” He held her hand while she spoke. His finger and thumb instinctively and perhaps unconsciously closed around her pulse as she talked, I thought.\n\n“The Count is a criminal, of a criminal type,” she said. “Nordau and Lombroso would classify him as such, and *as* a criminal, his mind is imperfectly formed. Therefore, when facing difficulty, he must rely on ingrained habits. His past provides a clue, and the single instance we know—which came from his own account—shows that once before, when in what Mr. Morris would call a ‘difficult situation,’ he returned to his own country from the land he had tried to conquer, and from there, without abandoning his goal, he prepared himself for a new attempt. He returned better prepared for his task; and he succeeded. So he came to London to conquer a new land. He was defeated, and when all hope of success was gone and his existence was in peril, he fled back across the sea to his home; just as he had previously fled back across the Danube from Turkey.”\n\n“Excellent, excellent! Oh, you exceptionally clever lady!” Van Helsing exclaimed enthusiastically, bending to kiss her hand. A moment later, he remarked to me, as calmly as if we were having a medical consultation, “Only seventy-two; and amidst all this agitation. I have hope.” Turning back to her, he said with eager anticipation, “But continue. Go on! There is more to say if you are willing. Do not be afraid; John and I understand. I certainly do, and I will tell you if you are correct. Speak, without hesitation!”\n\n“I will try; but please forgive me if I seem self-centered,” she replied.\n\n“No! Do not fear, you must be self-centered, for it is about you that we are thinking,” he insisted.\n\n“Then, since he is a criminal, he is selfish,” she explained; “and because his intellect is limited and his actions are driven by selfishness, he restricts himself to a single objective. That objective is relentless. Just as he fled back across the Danube, leaving his forces to be cut down, so now he is determined to secure his own safety, heedless of everything else. Thus, his own selfishness somewhat frees my soul from the terrible power he gained over me on that dreadful night. I felt it! Oh, I felt it! Thank God, for His great mercy! My soul is freer than it has been since that awful moment; and my only remaining fear is that in some trance or dream state, he may have used my knowledge for his purposes.” The Professor stood up.\n\n“He *has* used your mind,” Van Helsing stated; “and by doing so, he has left us here in Varna, while the ship carrying him sped through dense fog towards Galatz, where, undoubtedly, he made arrangements for his escape from us. But his child-like mind only foresaw this much; and it may be that, as always happens in God’s plan, the very thing the wrongdoer relied upon most for his own selfish benefit turns out to be his greatest detriment. The hunter is caught in his own trap, as the great Psalmist says. For now that he believes he is completely free from any trace of us, and that he has escaped with many hours advantage, his selfish child-brain will lull him into complacency. He also thinks that because he severed his connection to knowing your mind, you cannot possibly know his location; this is where he fails! That horrifying blood ritual he subjected you to has paradoxically made you free to connect with him spiritually, as you have done during your moments of freedom when the sun rises and sets. At such times, you connect by my will and not his; and this beneficial power for you and others, you gained from suffering at his hands. This is now even more valuable because he is unaware of it, and to protect himself, he has even cut himself off from knowing our location. We, however, are not selfish, and we trust that God is with us through all this darkness, and these many difficult hours. We will pursue him; and we will not hesitate; even if we risk becoming like him ourselves. Friend John, this has been a significant hour; and it has helped us considerably on our journey. You must act as scribe and record everything, so that when the others return from their task, you can give it to them; then they will know as we do.”\n\nAnd so I have written it all down while we wait for their return, and Mrs. Harker has typed everything since she brought the manuscript to us.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I worried that the Professor might lose his composure and have a fit—just as he did when Lucy died—but with great effort he managed to keep calm. By the time Mrs. Harker entered, cheerful and absorbed in her work as though she’d put aside her grief, he had regained his self-control. She handed several pages she had typed to Van Helsing, who examined them seriously but became visibly happier as he read. Holding up the sheets, he addressed us: “John, given all your experience—and you, young Madam Mina—let me give you a lesson: never be afraid to think. I often had a vague thought, but I was too cautious to explore it fully. Now, with more knowledge, I revisit that thought and see it was never just a half-formed idea—it was a full thought, just not yet strong. Like the ugly duckling from Andersen’s story, it turns out not to be a weak idea at all, but a powerful one ready to soar when the time comes. Listen: in what Jonathan has written, he mentions that another member of Dracula’s family, long ago, led forces into Turkey repeatedly, and even after being defeated, kept returning, sometimes alone, certain he would ultimately succeed.”\n\n“What does this mean? Not much, you may think. Neither the Count’s weak, childlike reasoning nor ours saw it before. But sometimes, as in nature when forces combine, a sudden revelation occurs—blinding but illuminating, exposing truths wide and far. Let me explain through an example: have you ever studied the philosophy of crime? John, yes, since it relates to insanity; Mina, no, except for your recent experience. There is a consistent trait in real criminals across all cultures: the true criminal seems destined for crime, focusing on one obsession. Such people are clever but not fully developed in intellect—like children, learning by repetition and experience, not by understanding principles. Our criminal, Dracula, is similar: bound to his nature and compulsions, he acts based on habit, not reason. Like Archimedes said, ‘Give me a place to stand, and I will move the world;’ when such people learn to do something once, they repeat it instead of progressing. Mina, I see you understand—your eyes are shining.”\n\nHe encouraged Mina to speak. She explained, “Dracula fits the profile of a criminal with an underdeveloped mind; in a crisis, he falls back on habit. His history shows that, when defeated, he retreated to regroup and returned stronger—just like now, he fled to safety back home after being defeated in London. His actions are single-minded and selfish, freeing me partially from his influence. I sense my soul is freer than it has been since that terrible night, though I still fear he may have used my knowledge while I was under his control.”\n\nVan Helsing confirmed her insight: “He has used your mind to mislead us, but his limited thinking may work to our advantage; his attempts to protect himself might actually aid us. He cuts himself off thinking that will hide him, but that isolation means you can now reach him in spirit, as you have before. Your suffering gives you a new power over him, something he’s unaware of. Unlike him, we trust in God and work together for good. We will pursue him without hesitation, despite its risks. John, this realization is important; write it down so when the others return, they are fully informed.”\n\nThus, I record this while we wait, and Mrs. Harker has kept detailed notes on her typewriter as well."

          "text_segment": "29 October.—This is written in the train from Varna to Galatz. Last night we all assembled a little before the time of sunset. Each of us had done his work as well as he could; so far as thought, and endeavour, and opportunity go, we are prepared for the whole of our journey, and for our work when we get to Galatz. When the usual time came round Mrs. Harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort; and after a longer and more serious effort on the part of Van Helsing than has been usually necessary, she sank into the trance. Usually she speaks on a hint; but this time the Professor had to ask her questions, and to ask them pretty resolutely, before we could learn anything; at last her answer came:—\n“I can see nothing; we are still; there are no waves lapping, but only a steady swirl of water softly running against the hawser. I can hear men’s voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars in the rowlocks. A gun is fired somewhere; the echo of it seems far away. There is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains are dragged along. What is this? There is a gleam of light; I can feel the air blowing upon me.”\nHere she stopped. She had risen, as if impulsively, from where she lay on the sofa, and raised both her hands, palms upwards, as if lifting a weight. Van Helsing and I looked at each other with understanding. Quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently, whilst Harker’s hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his Kukri. There was a long pause. We all knew that the time when she could speak was passing; but we felt that it was useless to say anything. Suddenly she sat up, and, as she opened her eyes, said sweetly:—\n“Would none of you like a cup of tea? You must all be so tired!” We could only make her happy, and so acquiesced. She bustled off to get tea; when she had gone Van Helsing said:—\n“You see, my friends. He is close to land: he has left his earth-chest. But he has yet to get on shore. In the night he may lie hidden somewhere; but if he be not carried on shore, or if the ship do not touch it, he cannot achieve the land. In such case he can, if it be in the night, change his form and can jump or fly on shore, as he did at Whitby. But if the day come before he get on shore, then, unless he be carried he cannot escape. And if he be carried, then the customs men may discover what the box contain. Thus, in fine, if he escape not on shore to-night, or before dawn, there will be the whole day lost to him. We may then arrive in time; for if he escape not at night we shall come on him in daytime, boxed up and at our mercy; for he dare not be his true self, awake and visible, lest he be discovered.”\nThere was no more to be said, so we waited in patience until the dawn; at which time we might learn more from Mrs. Harker.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "This entry is dated October 29th, written aboard the train from Varna to Galatz. Last night, we convened shortly before sunset. Each of us had completed our tasks as effectively as possible, ensuring we were fully prepared for our journey ahead and the work awaiting us in Galatz, based on our planning, effort, and available opportunities. When the appointed time arrived, Mrs. Harker prepared for her hypnotic session. Following a more protracted and intense effort by Van Helsing than was typical, she finally entered the trance. Usually, she responds to a simple prompt, but on this occasion, the Professor had to question her quite persistently before we managed to extract any information. Eventually, her response came:\n“I see nothing; we are still; there are no waves, only the gentle swirl of water running steadily against the mooring rope. I can hear men’s voices calling out, both close by and far away, and the sound of oars rolling and creaking in their locks. A gun fires somewhere; its echo seems distant. There is the noise of feet tramping overhead, and ropes and chains being dragged. What is this? There is a glimpse of light; I can feel the air moving upon me.”\nShe stopped at this point. She had abruptly risen from where she was lying on the sofa and raised both hands, palms facing upward, as if supporting a weight. Van Helsing and I exchanged knowing glances. Quincey slightly lifted his eyebrows and watched her intently, while Harker’s hand instinctively tightened its grip on the hilt of his Kukri knife. A lengthy silence followed. We all understood that the moment she could communicate was fading, but we sensed that speaking would be futile. Suddenly, she sat up and, as her eyes opened, she sweetly offered: “Would any of you care for a cup of tea? You must all be so tired!” We agreed to make her happy and readily assented. She hurried off to prepare the tea. Once she had left, Van Helsing stated:\n“You see, my friends. He is near the shore: he has left his box of earth. But he still needs to get onto land. During the night, he might conceal himself somewhere; but unless he is transported ashore, or the ship actually reaches the land, he cannot get onto solid ground. In such a situation, if it is nighttime, he can change his shape and can leap or fly onto the shore, just as he did at Whitby. However, if daylight arrives before he reaches land, then, unless he is carried, he cannot escape. And if he is carried, the customs officials might discover the contents of the box. Therefore, in conclusion, if he does not escape onto the shore tonight, or before dawn, he will lose the entire day. We might then arrive in time; for if he fails to escape by night, we will find him during the daytime, confined in his box and at our mercy, because he would not dare be in his true form, awake and visible, for fear of being found.”\nThere was nothing further to discuss, so we waited patiently until dawn, at which point we hoped Mrs. Harker might provide more information.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "October 29.—I am writing this while traveling by train from Varna to Galatz. Last night, our group gathered just before sunset. We had each done everything we could to prepare for our journey and the tasks ahead of us in Galatz. When the usual time arrived, Mrs. Harker got ready for her hypnosis. This time, Van Helsing had to work more intensely than usual before she went into a trance. Normally, Mrs. Harker would begin speaking with just a suggestion, but tonight, the Professor had to question her firmly to get any response. Eventually, she began to speak: she described seeing nothing but feeling stationary, with calm water moving softly against the ship’s ropes. She heard voices, oars creaking, a distant gunshot, and movement above her on the ship. She also noticed a light and felt a breeze. After saying this, she suddenly sat upright, lifted her hands as if supporting something, and then stopped. The rest of us realized her ability to speak was fading, so we remained silent. Suddenly, she opened her eyes and kindly asked if anyone wanted tea, as if nothing had happened. We agreed, and she left to prepare it. When she was gone, Van Helsing explained: \"You see, he is near the shore and has left his box of earth, but he’s not landed yet. During the night, he might hide or, if not carried to land or if the ship doesn't touch shore, he can’t set foot on land unless he manages to jump or change form as he did at Whitby. If he isn’t ashore by dawn, we might arrive in time to find him trapped in his box during the day, vulnerable, as he can’t move about safely in daylight.\" There was nothing more to say, so we waited patiently for dawn, hoping that Mrs. Harker might reveal more information then."

          "text_segment": "Early this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety, for her response in her trance. The hypnotic stage was even longer in coming than before; and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise was so short that we began to despair. Van Helsing seemed to throw his whole soul into the effort; at last, in obedience to his will she made reply:—\n“All is dark. I hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking as of wood on wood.” She paused, and the red sun shot up. We must wait till to-night.\nAnd so it is that we are travelling towards Galatz in an agony of expectation. We are due to arrive between two and three in the morning; but already, at Bucharest, we are three hours late, so we cannot possibly get in till well after sun-up. Thus we shall have two more hypnotic messages from Mrs. Harker; either or both may possibly throw more light on what is happening.\nLater.—Sunset has come and gone. Fortunately it came at a time when there was no distraction; for had it occurred whilst we were at a station, we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation. Mrs. Harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than this morning. I am in fear that her power of reading the Count’s sensations may die away, just when we want it most. It seems to me that her imagination is beginning to work. Whilst she has been in the trance hitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts. If this goes on it may ultimately mislead us. If I thought that the Count’s power over her would die away equally with her power of knowledge it would be a happy thought; but I am afraid that it may not be so. When she did speak, her words were enigmatical:—\n“Something is going out; I can feel it pass me like a cold wind. I can hear, far off, confused sounds—as of men talking in strange tongues, fierce-falling water, and the howling of wolves.” She stopped and a shudder ran through her, increasing in intensity for a few seconds, till, at the end, she shook as though in a palsy. She said no more, even in answer to the Professor’s imperative questioning. When she woke from the trance, she was cold, and exhausted, and languid; but her mind was all alert. She could not remember anything, but asked what she had said; when she was told, she pondered over it deeply for a long time and in silence.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "We waited this morning with intense worry for her words during her hypnotic state. Reaching the trance took even longer than the previous times, and by the time she finally entered it, there was so little time left before sunrise that we started to lose hope. Van Helsing appeared to pour all his energy into the effort, and finally, driven by his will, she responded: “It is completely dark. I hear water sounds, splashing at my level, and wood rubbing against wood, like a creaking sound.” She stopped speaking just as the red sun rose into view. We realized we had to postpone further attempts until nightfall. This is why we are currently traveling towards Galatz filled with anxious anticipation. We are scheduled to arrive between 2 and 3 in the morning, but we are already three hours behind schedule from Bucharest, meaning we won't get there until well after the sun is up. Consequently, we will have two more opportunities for Mrs. Harker to provide hypnotic messages; either or both might potentially reveal more about the current situation. Later.—Sunset has occurred. Fortunately, the setting sun happened when there were no distractions; had it occurred at a train station, for example, we might not have been able to achieve the necessary quiet and privacy. Mrs. Harker entered the hypnotic influence even less easily than she did this morning. I worry that her ability to sense the Count's feelings might disappear just when we need it most. It seems to me that her imagination might be starting to interfere. Up until now, while in the trance, she has kept strictly to reporting simple facts. If this trend continues, it could eventually mislead us. If I believed that the Count's influence over her would diminish at the same rate as her intuitive knowledge, that would be a comforting thought; but I fear this may not be the case. When she did finally speak, her words were hard to understand: “Something is departing; I can feel it moving past me like a cold draft. I can hear, far away, confused noises—like people speaking unfamiliar languages, the roar of falling water, and the howls of wolves.” She paused, and a tremor passed through her, growing stronger for a few moments, until finally, she was shaking as if she had a severe palsy. She said nothing further, even when the Professor pressed her insistently for more information. When she woke from the trance, she felt cold, worn out, and weak; but her mind was entirely clear. She could not recall anything she had said but asked what it was; when we told her, she considered it deeply and silently for a long time.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Early this morning, we waited anxiously to hear Mrs. Harker speak while in her trance. This time, it took even longer for her to fall under hypnosis, and by the time she finally did, sunrise was so near that we started to lose hope. Van Helsing concentrated intensely, and at last, under his direction, she spoke: 'Everything is dark. I hear water lapping at my level, and wood creaking against wood.' She stopped speaking as the sun rose, meaning we'd have to try again tonight.\n\nNow, we are traveling toward Galatz, anxiously awaiting what will happen next. We're supposed to arrive in the early morning, between two and three o'clock, but since we're already three hours late at Bucharest, we won't get there before daylight. This means we still have two more chances to receive hypnotic messages from Mrs. Harker; either one or both may give us further clues about the situation.\n\nLater in the day—sunset has passed. Thankfully, it happened when things were quiet, because if we'd been at a busy station, we might not have created the necessary peace and seclusion. Mrs. Harker was even harder to hypnotize than before, and I worry her ability to sense Dracula's thoughts is fading—just when we need it most. I've noticed that, until now, she's only described very simple things when in her trance; but now, her imagination seems to be influencing the visions. If this continues, we risk being led astray. It would be comforting if Dracula’s hold over her also weakened as her insights faded, but I doubt that’s the case. When she finally did speak, what she said was cryptic: 'Something is departing; I feel it pass me like a cold wind. I can hear distant, jumbled sounds—people speaking in unknown languages, powerful rushing water, and wolves howling.' After saying this, she trembled violently, overwhelmed for a few moments, and then would not (or could not) say anything further, even when Professor Van Helsing questioned her insistently. When she awoke from her trance, she was cold, exhausted, and weak, but mentally alert. She couldn't recall what she had said, so we told her, and she then sat for a long time, reflecting on it in silence."

Knowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance, Van Helsing began his passes earlier than usual. They produced no effect, however, until the regular time, when she yielded with a still greater difficulty, only a minute before the sun rose. The Professor lost no time in his questioning; her answer came with equal quickness:—\n“All is dark. I hear water swirling by, level with my ears, and the creaking of wood on wood. Cattle low far off. There is another sound, a queer one like——” She stopped and grew white, and whiter still.\n“Go on; go on! Speak, I command you!” said Van Helsing in an agonised voice. At the same time there was despair in his eyes, for the risen sun was reddening even Mrs. Harker’s pale face. She opened her eyes, and we all started as she said, sweetly and seemingly with the utmost unconcern:—\n“Oh, Professor, why ask me to do what you know I can’t? I don’t remember anything.” Then, seeing the look of amazement on our faces, she said, turning from one to the other with a troubled look:—\n“What have I said? What have I done? I know nothing, only that I was lying here, half asleep, and heard you say ‘go on! speak, I command you!’ It seemed so funny to hear you order me about, as if I were a bad child!”\n“Oh, Madam Mina,” he said, sadly, “it is proof, if proof be needed, of how I love and honour you, when a word for your good, spoken more earnest than ever, can seem so strange because it is to order her whom I am proud to obey!”\nThe whistles are sounding; we are nearing Galatz. We are on fire with anxiety and eagerness.\nMina Harker’s Journal.\n30 October.—Mr. Morris took me to the hotel where our rooms had been ordered by telegraph, he being the one who could best be spared, since he does not speak any foreign language. The forces were distributed much as they had been at Varna, except that Lord Godalming went to the Vice-Consul, as his rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of some sort to the official, we being in extreme hurry. Jonathan and the two doctors went to the shipping agent to learn particulars of the arrival of the Czarina Catherine.\nLater.—Lord Godalming has returned. The Consul is away, and the Vice-Consul sick; so the routine work has been attended to by a clerk. He was very obliging, and offered to do anything in his power.\nJonathan Harker’s Journal.\n30 October.—At nine o’clock Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and I called on Messrs. Mackenzie & Steinkoff, the agents of the London firm of Hapgood. They had received a wire from London, in answer to Lord Godalming’s telegraphed request, asking us to show them any civility in their power. They were more than kind and courteous, and took us at once on board the Czarina Catherine, which lay at anchor out in the river harbour. There we saw the Captain, Donelson by name, who told us of his voyage. He said that in all his life he had never had so favourable a run.\n“Man!” he said, “but it made us afeard, for we expeckit that we should have to pay for it wi’ some rare piece o’ ill luck, so as to keep up the average. It’s no canny to run frae London to the Black Sea wi’ a wind ahint ye, as though the Deil himself were blawin’ on yer sail for his ain purpose. An’ a’ the time we could no speer a thing. Gin we were nigh a ship, or a port, or a headland, a fog fell on us and travelled wi’ us, till when after it had lifted and we looked out, the deil a thing could we see. We ran by Gibraltar wi’oot bein’ able to signal; an’ till we came to the Dardanelles and had to wait to get our permit to pass, we never were within hail o’ aught. At first I inclined to slack off sail and beat about till the fog was lifted; but whiles, I thocht that if the Deil was minded to get us into the Black Sea quick, he was like to do it whether we would or no. If we had a quick voyage it would be no to our miscredit wi’ the owners, or no hurt to our traffic; an’ the Old Mon who had served his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for no hinderin’ him.” This mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition and commercial reasoning, aroused Van Helsing, who said:—\n“Mine friend, that Devil is more clever than he is thought by some; and he know when he meet his match!” The skipper was not displeased with the compliment, and went on:—\n“When we got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble; some o’ them, the Roumanians, came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which had been put on board by a queer lookin’ old man just before we had started frae London. I had seen them speer at the fellow, and put out their twa fingers when they saw him, to guard against the evil eye. Man! but the supersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous! I sent them aboot their business pretty quick; but as just after a fog closed in on us I felt a wee bit as they did anent something, though I wouldn’t say it was agin the big box. Well, on we went, and as the fog didn’t let up for five days I joost let the wind carry us; for if the Deil wanted to get somewheres—well, he would fetch it up a’reet. An’ if he didn’t, well, we’d keep a sharp lookout anyhow. Sure eneuch, we had a fair way and deep water all the time; and two days ago, when the mornin’ sun came through the fog, we found ourselves just in the river opposite Galatz. The Roumanians were wild, and wanted me right or wrong to take out the box and fling it in the river. I had to argy wi’ them aboot it wi’ a handspike; an’ when the last o’ them rose off the deck wi’ his head in his hand, I had convinced them that, evil eye or no evil eye, the property and the trust of my owners were better in my hands than in the river Danube. They had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to fling in, and as it was marked Galatz via Varna, I thocht I’d let it lie till we discharged in the port an’ get rid o’t althegither. We didn’t do much clearin’ that day, an’ had to remain the nicht at anchor; but in the mornin’, braw an’ airly, an hour before sun-up, a man came aboard wi’ an order, written to him from England, to receive a box marked for one Count Dracula. Sure eneuch the matter was one ready to his hand. He had his papers a’ reet, an’ glad I was to be rid o’ the dam’ thing, for I was beginnin’ masel’ to feel uneasy at it. If the Deil did have any luggage aboord the ship, I’m thinkin’ it was nane ither than that same!”\n“What was the name of the man who took it?” asked Dr. Van Helsing with restrained eagerness.\n“I’ll be tellin’ ye quick!” he answered, and, stepping down to his cabin, produced a receipt signed “Immanuel Hildesheim.” Burgen-strasse 16 was the address. We found out that this was all the Captain knew; so with thanks we came away.",

Aware that hypnotizing Mina was getting harder, Van Helsing started trying earlier than usual. It didn't work until the usual time, and even then, she was much more resistant, only entering the trance a minute before the sun appeared. The Professor immediately questioned her, and she answered just as quickly:\n\n“Everything is dark. I hear water rushing by, level with my ears, and wood groaning against wood. Cattle are lowing in the distance. There’s another sound, a strange one like—” She stopped, her face turning pale, then even paler.\n\n“Continue, go on! Speak, I command you!” Van Helsing urged with anguish in his voice. At the same time, despair was visible in his eyes because the rising sun was starting to turn Mrs. Harker's already pale face red. Her eyes opened, and we were all startled when she said, sweetly and with apparent lack of concern:\n\n“Oh, Professor, why ask me to do something you know I can’t? I don’t recall anything.” Then, noticing our astonished expressions, she looked at each of us in turn, a troubled look on her face:\n\n“What did I say? What did I do? I don’t know anything, except that I was lying here, half asleep, and heard you say ‘go on! speak, I command you!’ It felt so odd to hear you order me around, as if I were a naughty child!”\n\n“Oh, Madam Mina,” he replied sadly, “it proves, if proof is necessary, how much I love and respect you, when a word spoken earnestly for your benefit can seem so strange because it's an order to someone I am honoured to obey!”\n\nThe ship whistles are blowing; we are approaching Galatz. We are filled with intense worry and anticipation.\n\nMina Harker’s Journal.\n\nOctober 30th - Mr. Morris accompanied me to the hotel where our rooms had been reserved via telegraph. He was the most suitable person to spare from the main group as he doesn't speak any foreign languages. The team was divided much like at Varna, though Lord Godalming went to see the Vice-Consul. His status might provide some immediate assurance to the official, given our urgent situation. Jonathan and the two doctors headed to the shipping agent to get details about the arrival of the Czarina Catherine.\n\nLater - Lord Godalming has returned. The Consul is away, and the Vice-Consul is ill, so a clerk handled the standard duties. He was very helpful and offered his full assistance.\n\nJonathan Harker’s Journal.\n\nOctober 30th - At nine o'clock, Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and I visited Messrs. Mackenzie & Steinkoff, who represent the London firm of Hapgood. They had received a telegram from London, in response to Lord Godalming’s request, instructing them to be as helpful as possible. They were exceptionally kind and polite and immediately took us aboard the Czarina Catherine, which was anchored in the river harbour. There we met the Captain, named Donelson, who recounted his voyage. He stated that in all his life, he had never experienced such a remarkably smooth journey.\n\n“Man!” he exclaimed, “but it scared us, because we expected we'd have to balance it out with some serious bad luck, just to maintain the average. It's unnatural to sail from London to the Black Sea with a following wind the whole way, as if the Devil himself were pushing your sail for his own ends. And the whole time we couldn't see a thing. If we neared another ship, or a port, or a headland, a fog would descend on us and move with us, so that when it finally cleared and we looked around, we couldn't see a single thing. We passed Gibraltar without being able to signal; and until we reached the Dardanelles and had to wait for permission to pass, we never got close enough to anything to hail it. Initially, I thought about reducing sail and waiting for the fog to lift; but at times, I figured if the Devil was determined to get us into the Black Sea quickly, he was likely to do it whether we liked it or not. If we had a fast voyage, it wouldn't hurt our reputation with the owners or our business; and the Old Fellow, having achieved his goal, would probably be grateful we didn't slow him down.” This blend of simplicity and shrewdness, of superstition and commercial logic, intrigued Van Helsing, who commented:\n\n“My friend, that Devil is smarter than some people think; and he knows when he meets his match!” The captain seemed pleased by the compliment and continued:\n\n“Once we got past the Bosphorus, the men started complaining; some of them, the Romanians, came and asked me to throw overboard a large box that a peculiar-looking old man had brought aboard just before we left London. I'd seen them stare at the fellow and make the sign of the two fingers when they saw him, to protect against the evil eye. Man! the superstition of foreigners is absolutely ridiculous! I quickly sent them away; but shortly after a fog enveloped us, I felt a bit like they did about something, though I wouldn’t say it was specifically about the big box. Well, we kept going, and since the fog lasted for five days, I just let the wind take us; because if the Devil wanted to reach somewhere—well, he'd make it happen. And if he didn’t, well, we’d keep a close watch anyway. Sure enough, we had clear passage and deep water the entire time; and two days ago, when the morning sun finally broke through the fog, we found ourselves right in the river opposite Galatz. The Romanians were furious and demanded, rightly or wrongly, that I take out the box and throw it in the river. I had to argue with them about it using a handspike; and when the last of them got up from the deck holding his head, I had convinced them that, evil eye or not, my owners' property and trust were safer with me than in the Danube River. They had, mind you, put the box on the deck ready to toss it in, and since it was marked Galatz via Varna, I thought I’d leave it there until we unloaded in port and get rid of it completely. We didn’t do much unloading that day and had to stay anchored overnight; but in the morning, bright and early, an hour before sunrise, a man came aboard with an order, sent to him from England, to receive a box marked for Count Dracula. Indeed, the matter was quite straightforward for him. He had all his documents in order, and I was relieved to be free of the cursed thing, because I myself was starting to feel uneasy about it. If the Devil did have any baggage on the ship, I reckon it was none other than that!”\n\n“What was the name of the man who received it?” asked Dr. Van Helsing with controlled eagerness.\n\n“I’ll tell you quickly!” he replied, and, going down to his cabin, produced a receipt signed “Immanuel Hildesheim,” with the address Burgen-strasse 16. We learned that this was all the Captain knew; so, after thanking him, we departed.",

We were all anxiously anticipating the sunrise this morning. Because it has become harder for Mina to enter a hypnotic trance, Van Helsing started his hypnotic attempts earlier, but they only worked at the usual time—and even then, it was more difficult, and she yielded just before sunrise.

I hear cattle lowing in the distance. There's another strange sound like—” She stopped, turning pale. Van Helsing insisted she continue, though he looked desperate as the rising sun made Mrs. Harker’s pale face even redder. Mina suddenly opened her eyes and, in a calm and almost indifferent manner, said she remembered nothing. She had only vaguely heard Van Helsing command her to speak, which struck her as odd. When we reacted with surprise, she looked at us, confused, having no memory of what had happened. Van Helsing, saddened, expressed how much he respected her, explaining that his commanding words were purely out of deep care and urgency. Now, train whistles signal our arrival at Galatz, and we are all filled with anxious anticipation.\n\nMina Harker’s Journal.\n30 October.—Mr. Morris took me to the hotel where our accommodations had been reserved by telegram, since he could be spared most easily as he was not fluent in any foreign language.

He was very willing to help us as much as possible.\n\nJonathan Harker’s Journal.\n30 October.—At nine o’clock, Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and I visited Mackenzie & Steinkoff, agents for the London firm of Hapgood. They had received a telegram from London—which Lord Godalming had arranged—instructing them to assist us however they could. They were very courteous and immediately took us aboard the Czarina Catherine, anchored in the river harbor. We met the captain, Donelson, who described his voyage. He said it had been an unusually smooth journey—the best he’d ever had. He confessed that such good fortune made him anxious, as if something bad was bound to happen to balance it out. He explained they had an uninterrupted tailwind, as though the devil himself was pushing the ship, and any time they approached another ship, port, or headland, a fog would envelop them, hiding everything from view. They even passed Gibraltar without being able to signal, and aside from a required stop at the Dardanelles for clearance, they saw no one. He considered slowing the ship until the fog cleared but thought if fate (or the devil) wanted them in the Black Sea quickly, it would happen regardless. He said that a fast journey would be no embarrassment to the company, so he let the ship go as fast as possible. Out at the Bosphorus, some of the Romanian crew became uneasy and asked him to throw a large box overboard—a box loaded by an odd old man in London. The crew were quite superstitious, reacting with protective gestures at the sight of the man. The captain dismissed their fears but admitted that soon after, he started to feel unsettled himself, especially as a fog lingered for five days straight. The crew were ready to destroy the box, but he insisted on keeping it safe for the owners. Finally, at dawn two days ago, as the fog lifted, they found themselves opposite Galatz. Some crew demanded stronger that the box be thrown into the river; a conflict ensued, and the captain prevailed, stating he was responsible for the owners’ property. The box, marked for Galatz via Varna, remained aboard. That night, they stayed at anchor. Early the following morning, a man appeared with paperwork from England to receive a box for Count Dracula. Everything was in order, and the captain happily handed it over, relieved to be rid of it. Van Helsing asked for the man’s name; the captain produced a receipt signed “Immanuel Hildesheim,” with an address on Burgen-strasse 16. That was all the captain knew, so we thanked him and left."

His arguments were pointed with specie—we doing the punctuation—and with a little bargaining he told us what he knew. This turned out to be simple but important. He had received a letter from Mr. de Ville of London, telling him to receive, if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs, a box which would arrive at Galatz in the Czarina Catherine. This he was to give in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky, who dealt with the Slovaks who traded down the river to the port. He had been paid for his work by an English bank note, which had been duly cashed for gold at the Danube International Bank. When Skinsky had come to him, he had taken him to the ship and handed over the box, so as to save porterage. That was all he knew.\nWe then sought for Skinsky, but were unable to find him. One of his neighbours, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that he had gone away two days before, no one knew whither. This was corroborated by his landlord, who had received by messenger the key of the house together with the rent due, in English money. This had been between ten and eleven o’clock last night. We were at a standstill again.\nWhilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out that the body of Skinsky had been found inside the wall of the churchyard of St. Peter, and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wild animal. Those we had been speaking with ran off to see the horror, the women crying out “This is the work of a Slovak!” We hurried away lest we should have been in some way drawn into the affair, and so detained.\nAs we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion. We were all convinced that the box was on its way, by water, to somewhere; but where that might be we would have to discover. With heavy hearts we came home to the hotel to Mina.\nWhen we met together, the first thing was to consult as to taking Mina again into our confidence. Things are getting desperate, and it is at least a chance, though a hazardous one. As a preliminary step, I was released from my promise to her.",

He was a Hebrew man, rather theatrical in appearance, with a distinctive nose shaped like a sheep's and wearing a fez. His arguments became more persuasive when we added money – effectively doing the negotiating ourselves – and after some haggling, he revealed what he knew. His information was straightforward but significant. He had received correspondence from a Mr. de Ville in London, instructing him to receive a box arriving in Galatz on the ship 'Czarina Catherine', ideally before sunrise to bypass customs. He was then supposed to hand this box over to a certain Petrof Skinsky, who worked with the Slovaks who traded down the river to the port. He had been compensated for his services with an English bank note, which he had successfully exchanged for gold at the Danube International Bank. When Skinsky arrived, Hildesheim had accompanied him to the vessel and personally delivered the box to him to avoid any porterage fees. That was the full extent of his knowledge.",

He was only persuaded to talk after we offered him money—prompted by us—and after some haggling, he shared the important information he had. It was simple: he had received a letter from Mr. de Ville in London, instructing him to receive a box—which would arrive at Galatz on the ship Czarina Catherine—before sunrise to avoid customs if possible. He was to hand this box to Petrof Skinsky, who did business with the Slovaks trading along the river. Hildesheim was paid with an English banknote, which he converted to gold at the Danube International Bank. When Skinsky arrived, Hildesheim took him to the ship and gave him the box to avoid having to hire a porter. That was the extent of his knowledge.\n\nWe looked for Skinsky but couldn’t find him. One of his neighbors, who didn't seem to like him, told us Skinsky had left two days earlier, destination unknown. His landlord confirmed this story, saying he’d received the house key and rent in English money by messenger, between 10 and 11 the previous night. We were at another dead end.\n\nWhile we were discussing the matter, someone hurried in and breathlessly reported that Skinsky’s body had been discovered inside the wall of St. Peter’s churchyard, his throat torn as if by a wild animal. The people we were talking to ran off to witness the gruesome sight, with the women shouting that it was the work of a Slovak. We decided to leave quickly in case we were implicated and detained.\n\nOn our way back, we could not figure out exactly what was going on, but agreed that the box was probably already traveling by water to some unknown destination that we would now have to uncover. Heavy-hearted, we returned to our hotel and to Mina.\n\nWhen we gathered together, our first topic was whether we should share everything with Mina again. The situation was becoming dire, and although risky, it seemed to be worth considering. As a first step, I was released from my promise to her."

They can judge it; it is well to be accurate, and every minute is precious.\nMina Harker’s Memorandum.\n(Entered in her Journal.)\nGround of inquiry.—Count Dracula’s problem is to get back to his own place.\n(a) He must be brought back by some one. This is evident; for had he power to move himself as he wished he could go either as man, or wolf, or bat, or in some other way. He evidently fears discovery or interference, in the state of helplessness in which he must be—confined as he is between dawn and sunset in his wooden box.\n(b) How is he to be taken?—Here a process of exclusions may help us. By road, by rail, by water?\n1. By Road.—There are endless difficulties, especially in leaving the city.\n(x) There are people; and people are curious, and investigate. A hint, a surmise, a doubt as to what might be in the box, would destroy him.\n(y) There are, or there may be, customs and octroi officers to pass.\n(z) His pursuers might follow. This is his highest fear; and in order to prevent his being betrayed he has repelled, so far as he can, even his victim—me!\n2. By Rail.—There is no one in charge of the box. It would have to take its chance of being delayed; and delay would be fatal, with enemies on the track. True, he might escape at night; but what would he be, if left in a strange place with no refuge that he could fly to? This is not what he intends; and he does not mean to risk it.\n3. By Water.—Here is the safest way, in one respect, but with most danger in another. On the water he is powerless except at night; even then he can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolves. But were he wrecked, the living water would engulf him, helpless; and he would indeed be lost. He could have the vessel drive to land; but if it were unfriendly land, wherein he was not free to move, his position would still be desperate.\nWe know from the record that he was on the water; so what we have to do is to ascertain what water.\nThe first thing is to realise exactly what he has done as yet; we may, then, get a light on what his later task is to be.\nFirstly.—We must differentiate between what he did in London as part of his general plan of action, when he was pressed for moments and had to arrange as best he could.\nSecondly we must see, as well as we can surmise it from the facts we know of, what he has done here.\nAs to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sent invoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of exit from England; his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape. The proof of this, is the letter of instructions sent to Immanuel Hildesheim to clear and take away the box before sunrise. There is also the instruction to Petrof Skinsky. These we must only guess at; but there must have been some letter or message, since Skinsky came to Hildesheim.\nThat, so far, his plans were successful we know. The Czarina Catherine made a phenomenally quick journey—so much so that Captain Donelson’s suspicions were aroused; but his superstition united with his canniness played the Count’s game for him, and he ran with his favouring wind through fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at Galatz. That the Count’s arrangements were well made, has been proved. Hildesheim cleared the box, took it off, and gave it to Skinsky. Skinsky took it—and here we lose the trail. We only know that the box is somewhere on the water, moving along. The customs and the octroi, if there be any, have been avoided.\nNow we come to what the Count must have done after his arrival—on land, at Galatz.\nThe box was given to Skinsky before sunrise. At sunrise the Count could appear in his own form. Here, we ask why Skinsky was chosen at all to aid in the work? In my husband’s diary, Skinsky is mentioned as dealing with the Slovaks who trade down the river to the port; and the man’s remark, that the murder was the work of a Slovak, showed the general feeling against his class. The Count wanted isolation.\nMy surmise is, this: that in London the Count decided to get back to his castle by water, as the most safe and secret way. He was brought from the castle by Szgany, and probably they delivered their cargo to Slovaks who took the boxes to Varna, for there they were shipped for London. Thus the Count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this service. When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he came out from his box, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to arranging the carriage of the box up some river. When this was done, and he knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he thought, by murdering his agent.\nI have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the Slovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth. I read in the typescript that in my trance I heard cows low and water swirling level with my ears and the creaking of wood. The Count in his box, then, was on a river in an open boat—propelled probably either by oars or poles, for the banks are near and it is working against stream. There would be no such sound if floating down stream.\nOf course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but we may possibly investigate further. Now of these two, the Pruth is the more easily navigated, but the Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritza which runs up round the Borgo Pass. The loop it makes is manifestly as close to Dracula’s castle as can be got by water.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Mina Harker's Diary. October 30th, evening. They were utterly spent and low in spirits, so we had to allow them time to recover before proceeding. I told everyone to rest for thirty minutes while I caught up on all the records. I'm incredibly thankful for the invention of the 'Traveller's' typewriter and for Mr. Morris providing me with this one. It would have been a struggle to manage all this documentation by hand... I've finished the task. Poor, dear Jonathan, the suffering he must have endured, and what he must be going through now. He's barely breathing on the sofa, appearing completely collapsed. His brow is furrowed, and his face is contorted with pain. The poor man, perhaps he's deep in thought; I can see the wrinkles forming from his intense concentration. Oh, if only I could offer any assistance... I will do everything within my power. I've asked Dr. Van Helsing, and he has given me all the documents I haven't yet reviewed... While they are resting, I will examine everything thoroughly, and perhaps I can reach a conclusion. I'll attempt to follow the Professor's method and analyze the facts objectively... I truly believe, through God's guidance, I have made a significant discovery. I will retrieve the maps and study them... I am more convinced than ever that my insight is correct. My new conclusion is ready, so I will assemble our group and share it. They can evaluate it; it is essential to be precise, and every moment is vital. Mina Harker's Memorandum. (Recorded in her Journal.) Subject of investigation. Count Dracula's main objective is to return to his homeland. (a) He requires assistance to be transported back. This is clear because if he could move freely as he wished, he could travel as a man, wolf, bat, or in some other form. He obviously fears being discovered or interrupted while in the vulnerable state he must be in, confined to his wooden box between dawn and dusk. (b) What method of transport is he likely using? Eliminating options might help us here. By road, by rail, or by water? 1. By Road. There are countless challenges, particularly when leaving a populated area. (x) There are people; and people are curious and ask questions. Even a hint, a guess, or a doubt about the box's contents would be his undoing. (y) There are, or could be, customs and local tax officials to pass. (z) His pursuers might follow him. This is his greatest fear, and to prevent his location from being revealed, he has pushed away even his victim—me—as much as possible. 2. By Rail. The box would travel unattended. It would be susceptible to delays, and any delay would be fatal with enemies tracking him. It's true he might escape at night, but what would he do if left in an unfamiliar place with no safe haven to retreat to? This isn't his plan, and he wouldn't risk it. 3. By Water. In one aspect, this is the safest route, but in another, the most perilous. On water, he is powerless except at night; even then, he can only conjure fog, storms, snow, and summon his wolves. But if the vessel were wrecked, the running water would drown him, utterly helpless, and he would be truly lost. He could perhaps direct the ship to shore, but if the land were hostile, where he isn't free to move, his situation would still be dire. We know from the records that he was on the water; therefore, we must determine which body of water. The initial step is to understand precisely what he has accomplished so far; this might shed light on his next objective. Firstly, we must distinguish between his actions in London, which were part of his overall strategy during a time crunch when he had to make the best arrangements possible. Secondly, we must ascertain, as best as we can infer from the known facts, what he has done since arriving here. Regarding the first point, he clearly intended to reach Galatz and sent documentation to Varna to mislead us and hide his escape route from England; his immediate and sole aim was simply to get away. The evidence for this is the letter of instruction sent to Immanuel Hildesheim to clear and remove the box before sunrise. There was also an instruction for Petrof Skinsky. We can only speculate about these, but there must have been some communication, as Skinsky met with Hildesheim. We know that, up to this point, his plans succeeded. The *Czarina Catherine* completed its journey remarkably quickly—so fast that Captain Donelson became suspicious. However, his superstition, combined with his practical caution, inadvertently served the Count's purpose, and he sailed with the favorable wind through fogs and all, arriving effectively blindfolded at Galatz. The effectiveness of the Count's arrangements has been proven. Hildesheim collected the box, took possession of it, and handed it over to Skinsky. Skinsky took it—and here we lose the trail. We only know that the box is somewhere on the water, moving along. Customs and local taxes, if any, have been evaded. Now we consider what the Count must have done after his arrival on land at Galatz. The box was given to Skinsky before sunrise. At sunrise, the Count could resume his normal appearance. Here, we ask why Skinsky was chosen at all to assist? In my husband's diary, Skinsky is mentioned as dealing with the Slovaks who trade downstream to the port; and the man's comment that the murder was the work of a Slovak indicates the general animosity towards that group. The Count desired to avoid notice. My theory is this: in London, the Count decided to return to his castle by water, considering it the most secure and secretive method. He was brought from the castle by Szgany people, and they probably delivered their cargo to Slovaks who transported the boxes to Varna, where they were loaded onto ships for London. Thus, the Count was aware of the people who could provide this service. When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he emerged, met Skinsky, and instructed him on how to arrange for the box to be transported up a river. Once this was complete, and he was certain his plan was in motion, he attempted to eliminate any trace of himself, or so he thought, by murdering his agent. I have consulted the map and found that the rivers most likely to be used by the Slovaks heading upstream are either the Pruth or the Sereth. I recall from the typed transcription that during my trance, I heard the lowing of cows, water swirling at the level of my ears, and the sound of creaking wood. The Count, inside his box, was therefore on a river in an open boat—likely moved by oars or poles, as the banks are close by and it was traveling against the current. There would be no such sounds if floating downstream. Of course, it might not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but we can potentially investigate further. Of these two, the Pruth is easier to navigate, but the Sereth, at Fundu, is joined by the Bistritza, which flows up and around the Borgo Pass. The bend it makes is clearly as close to Dracula's castle as can be reached by water.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Mina Harker’s Journal. October 30, evening—Everyone was so exhausted, discouraged, and worn out that nothing further could be done until they had rested. I asked the group to lie down for half an hour while I brought my notes up to date. I feel very thankful to the inventor of the Traveller’s typewriter and to Mr. Morris for providing me with one; without it, I would feel lost doing this work with only a pen. Now my work is up to date; poor Jonathan—what he must have endured, and is still enduring. He lies on the sofa, hardly breathing, and looks completely collapsed, his face furrowed with pain and concentration. If only I could help him in some way...I will do whatever I can. I asked Dr. Van Helsing for any papers I hadn’t seen, and he gathered them for me. While the others rest, I will carefully review all the documents and perhaps reach a new conclusion. I’ll follow Professor Van Helsing’s example, considering the facts with an open mind. I believe, with God’s guidance, I have made a discovery. I will get the maps and review them. I am more convinced than ever that I am correct. My new theory is ready, so I will call everyone together and present it. They can judge for themselves; accuracy is vital, and time is of the essence.\nMina Harker’s Memorandum (entered in her journal).\nTopic of inquiry: Count Dracula’s main objective is to return to his home. (a) Someone must transport him, since if he had the ability to move at will, he could travel as a man, wolf, bat, or another form. He clearly fears being discovered in his vulnerable state, locked between dawn and dusk in his box. (b) Transportation options: Should we consider road, rail, or water?\n1. Road—This route faces countless obstacles, especially when leaving the city. There are too many people, who are often curious and might inquire about the box’s contents, risking exposure. Customs officials or checkpoints could also be an issue. Furthermore, his hunters might follow him, which he fears most. To prevent betrayal, he has even kept me, his victim, at a distance.\n2. Rail—No one is accompanying the box, so delays are possible, which would be disastrous with enemies pursuing him. Although he might escape at night, he would then be stranded without a haven. He would not risk that outcome.\n3. Water—This is the safest in some respects, but most dangerous in others. On water, Dracula has little power except at night and can only summon fog, storms, snow, and wolves then. If the vessel is wrecked, he would be lost in the flowing water, helpless. Even if he directed the ship to land, if it were unfriendly territory where he had no freedom to move, his position would be desperate.\nWe know from the records that he traveled by ship, so the key is to determine which route he took. First, we need to clarify exactly what he has done so far to predict his next move. \nFirst, we must distinguish between actions he took in London as a part of his escape when pressed for time, and what he has done at his current location. In London, he evidently planned to arrive at Galatz, but sent shipping documents to Varna to mislead us about his exit. His only goal then was to escape. Evidence for this is the letter sent to Immanuel Hildesheim to remove the box before sunrise, as well as the instructions given to Petrof Skinsky, presumably in writing. Skinsky’s involvement is proof a message was sent, although we can only guess its form. \nUp to this point, his plan has worked. The ship, Czarina Catherine, made a remarkably fast voyage, arousing Captain Donelson’s suspicions. However, the Captain’s superstitions and caution played to Dracula’s advantage, and he reached Galatz without detection. Dracula’s preparations were solid. Hildesheim retrieved the box and handed it to Skinsky, who then disappeared with it—after this, we lose the trail except to know the box is moving on water, having evaded any customs officials.\nNow, considering Dracula’s actions after landing at Galatz: The box was transferred to Skinsky before sunrise. At sunrise, Dracula could have appeared in person. Why choose Skinsky for the task? Jonathan’s diary mentions Skinsky’s dealings with Slovak traders on the river; an offhand comment about a murder being the work of a Slovak reflects local suspicion of them. Dracula wanted to remain isolated. \nI suspect that in London, Dracula decided the safest, most secret route to his castle was by water. He was originally brought from the castle by Szgany, who probably delivered the cargo to Slovaks who shipped it to Varna for London, so Dracula had contacts who could help now. Once the box was back on land, before sunrise or after sunset, Dracula emerged, instructed Skinsky how to move the box up a river, then erased his tracks by killing his agent. \nI checked the maps: the most likely rivers for the Slovaks would be the Pruth or the Sereth. In my trance, I heard cows lowing, water swirling at my ear level, and wooden creaking, suggesting the box was in an open boat propelled by oars or poles, struggling against the current with banks nearby. These sounds wouldn’t occur drifting downstream.\nIt may not be the Sereth or the Pruth, but we may investigate further. Of these two, the Pruth is easier to traverse, but the Sereth, at Fundu, joins with the Bistritza, which curves close to the Borgo Pass and Dracula’s castle—making it the closest water route to his home."

Now we are on the track once again, and this time we may succeed. Our enemy is at his most helpless; and if we can come on him by day, on the water, our task will be over. He has a start, but he is powerless to hasten, as he may not leave his box lest those who carry him may suspect; for them to suspect would be to prompt them to throw him in the stream where he perish. This he knows, and will not. Now men, to our Council of War; for, here and now, we must plan what each and all shall do.”\n“I shall get a steam launch and follow him,” said Lord Godalming.\n“And I, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he land,” said Mr. Morris.\n“Good!” said the Professor, “both good. But neither must go alone. There must be force to overcome force if need be; the Slovak is strong and rough, and he carries rude arms.” All the men smiled, for amongst them they carried a small arsenal. Said Mr. Morris:—\n“I have brought some Winchesters; they are pretty handy in a crowd, and there may be wolves. The Count, if you remember, took some other precautions; he made some requisitions on others that Mrs. Harker could not quite hear or understand. We must be ready at all points.” Dr. Seward said:—\n“I think I had better go with Quincey. We have been accustomed to hunt together, and we two, well armed, will be a match for whatever may come along. You must not be alone, Art. It may be necessary to fight the Slovaks, and a chance thrust—for I don’t suppose these fellows carry guns—would undo all our plans. There must be no chances, this time; we shall not rest until the Count’s head and body have been separated, and we are sure that he cannot re-incarnate.” He looked at Jonathan as he spoke, and Jonathan looked at me. I could see that the poor dear was torn about in his mind. Of course he wanted to be with me; but then the boat service would, most likely, be the one which would destroy the ... the ... the ... Vampire. (Why did I hesitate to write the word?) He was silent awhile, and during his silence Dr. Van Helsing spoke:—\n“Friend Jonathan, this is to you for twice reasons. First, because you are young and brave and can fight, and all energies may be needed at the last; and again that it is your right to destroy him—that—which has wrought such woe to you and yours. Be not afraid for Madam Mina; she will be my care, if I may. I am old. My legs are not so quick to run as once; and I am not used to ride so long or to pursue as need be, or to fight with lethal weapons. But I can be of other service; I can fight in other way. And I can die, if need be, as well as younger men. Now let me say that what I would is this: while you, my Lord Godalming and friend Jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the river, and whilst John and Quincey guard the bank where perchance he might be landed, I will take Madam Mina right into the heart of the enemy’s country. Whilst the old fox is tied in his box, floating on the running stream whence he cannot escape to land—where he dares not raise the lid of his coffin-box lest his Slovak carriers should in fear leave him to perish—we shall go in the track where Jonathan went,—from Bistritz over the Borgo, and find our way to the Castle of Dracula. Here, Madam Mina’s hypnotic power will surely help, and we shall find our way—all dark and unknown otherwise—after the first sunrise when we are near that fateful place. There is much to be done, and other places to be made sanctify, so that that nest of vipers be obliterated.” Here Jonathan interrupted him hotly:—\n“Do you mean to say, Professor Van Helsing, that you would bring Mina, in her sad case and tainted as she is with that devil’s illness, right into the jaws of his death-trap? Not for the world! Not for Heaven or Hell!” He became almost speechless for a minute, and then went on:—\n“Do you know what the place is? Have you seen that awful den of hellish infamy—with the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes, and every speck of dust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster in embryo? Have you felt the Vampire’s lips upon your throat?” Here he turned to me, and as his eyes lit on my forehead he threw up his arms with a cry: “Oh, my God, what have we done to have this terror upon us!” and he sank down on the sofa in a collapse of misery. The Professor’s voice, as he spoke in clear, sweet tones, which seemed to vibrate in the air, calmed us all:—\n“Oh, my friend, it is because I would save Madam Mina from that awful place that I would go. God forbid that I should take her into that place. There is work—wild work—to be done there, that her eyes may not see. We men here, all save Jonathan, have seen with their own eyes what is to be done before that place can be purify. Remember that we are in terrible straits. If the Count escape us this time—and he is strong and subtle and cunning—he may choose to sleep him for a century, and then in time our dear one”—he took my hand—“would come to him to keep him company, and would be as those others that you, Jonathan, saw. You have told us of their gloating lips; you heard their ribald laugh as they clutched the moving bag that the Count threw to them. You shudder; and well may it be. Forgive me that I make you so much pain, but it is necessary. My friend, is it not a dire need for the which I am giving, possibly my life? If it were that any one went into that place to stay, it is I who would have to go to keep them company.”\n“Do as you will,” said Jonathan, with a sob that shook him all over, “we are in the hands of God!”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Mina Harker’s Journal continued.\nAfter I finished reading, Jonathan embraced and kissed me. The others continuously shook my hands, and Dr. Van Helsing commented, 'Our dear Madam Mina has taught us once again. Her vision has shown us what we could not see. Now we are back on the trail, and this time success is possible. Our adversary is at his weakest point; if we can find him on the water during the day, our task will be completed. He has a head start, but he is unable to move faster because he must remain in his box lest his carriers become suspicious. If they suspected, they would likely toss him into the river, where he would perish. He understands this and will not risk it. Now, gentlemen, let us gather for our Council of War; here and now, we must determine everyone’s role.'\nLord Godalming declared, 'I will get a steam launch and pursue him.'\nMr. Morris added, 'And I will secure horses to follow on land in case he manages to reach the bank.'\n'Excellent!' the Professor approved, 'Both are good ideas. But neither of you should go alone. We must be prepared to use force against force if necessary; the Slovak men are sturdy and rough, and they carry crude weapons.' All the men smiled, as they were themselves carrying a considerable collection of arms. Mr. Morris stated, 'I’ve brought some Winchesters; they’re quite effective in a crowd, and there might be wolves. Remember, the Count took other precautions; he made requests of others that Mrs. Harker couldn't fully hear or understand. We must be prepared for anything.' Dr. Seward suggested, 'I believe it would be best if I accompanied Quincey. We are used to hunting together, and the two of us, well-armed, should be capable of handling whatever we encounter. You shouldn’t be alone, Art. It might be necessary to fight the Slovaks, and a random stab—since I doubt these men carry firearms—could ruin everything we’ve planned. We cannot afford any risks this time; we will not stop until the Count's head is severed from his body and we are certain he cannot be reborn.' He looked at Jonathan as he spoke, and Jonathan looked at me. I could see that my poor, dear husband was deeply conflicted. Naturally, he wanted to stay with me; however, the pursuit by boat was most likely the method that would lead to the destruction of the... the... the... Vampire. (Why did I hesitate to write the word?) He remained silent for a moment, and during this silence, Dr. Van Helsing spoke.\n'Friend Jonathan, this decision is made for two reasons. Firstly, because you are young, brave, and capable of fighting, and all your energy may be needed in the final confrontation; and secondly, because it is your right to destroy the very thing that has caused such suffering to you and your family. Do not worry about Madam Mina; she will be under my care, if I am permitted. I am old. My legs are not as quick as they once were; and I am not accustomed to riding for extended periods or pursuing as needed, or fighting with deadly weapons. But I can be useful in other ways; I can fight differently. And I am prepared to die, if required, just like younger men. Now let me tell you what I propose: while you, my Lord Godalming, and friend Jonathan travel up the river in your fast little steamboat, and while John and Quincey watch the bank where he might possibly land, I will take Madam Mina directly into the core of the enemy's territory. While the old fox is confined in his box, floating on the moving river from which he cannot escape to land—where he dares not lift the lid of his coffin-box for fear his Slovak carriers might abandon him to perish—we will follow the path Jonathan took, from Bistritz over the Borgo Pass, and find our way to the Castle of Dracula. There, Madam Mina’s hypnotic abilities will undoubtedly assist us, and we will discover our way—otherwise completely dark and unknown—after the first sunrise once we are near that ill-fated location. There is much work to be done, and other places need to be consecrated, so that this nest of vipers is completely wiped out.' Here Jonathan vehemently interrupted him.\n'Are you suggesting, Professor Van Helsing, that you would bring Mina, in her tragic state and afflicted as she is by that devil's illness, right into the mouth of his death-trap? Absolutely not! Not for anything in this world!' He was momentarily almost speechless, then continued, 'Do you understand what that place is like? Have you seen that horrifying den of hellish evil—where the moonlight itself seems alive with ghastly figures, and every particle of dust swirling in the wind is a developing monster? Have you felt the Vampire’s lips upon your throat?' Here he turned to me, and as his eyes fell upon my forehead, he threw up his arms with a cry: 'Oh, my God, what have we done to bring this horror upon us!' and he collapsed onto the sofa in utter despair. The Professor’s voice, as he spoke in clear, gentle tones that seemed to resonate in the air, calmed us all.\n'Oh, my friend, I wish to save Madam Mina from that dreadful place by going there. God forbid I should take her into that place carelessly. There is intense, dangerous work to be done there, which her eyes must not witness. We men here, all except Jonathan, have personally seen what must be done before that place can be purified. Remember that we are in a desperate situation. If the Count escapes us this time—and he is powerful, subtle, and cunning—he might choose to sleep for a century, and then eventually our dear one'—he took my hand—'would come to him to keep him company, and would become like those others you, Jonathan, saw. You have described their gloating expressions; you heard their vile laughter as they seized the moving bag the Count threw to them. You shudder, and rightly so. Forgive me for causing you such pain, but it is necessary. My friend, is it not a dire necessity for which I am potentially sacrificing my life? If anyone were to go into that place permanently, it is I who would have to accompany them.'\n'Do as you see fit,' Jonathan said, with a sob that shook his entire body, 'we are in God’s hands!'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Mina Harker’s Journal—continued.\n\nAfter I finished reading, Jonathan hugged and kissed me, while the others congratulated me, shaking my hands enthusiastically. Dr. Van Helsing said, \"Once again, Madam Mina has shown us the way. She saw what we missed. We're back on the right path now, and this time we might succeed. Our adversary is at his weakest and, if we can catch him during the daytime while he’s on the water, our mission might be accomplished. Although he's ahead, he can't move any faster. He must remain in his box so as not to arouse the suspicions of his carriers, who, if they found out, might throw him in the river and destroy him. He won't risk that. Now, let’s gather for our Council of War and plan each person’s role.\"\n\nLord Godalming offered, \"I'll get a steam launch to pursue him via the river.\"\n\"And I'll arrange for horses to follow along the riverbank, in case he lands somewhere,\" added Mr. Morris.\n\nThe Professor approved both suggestions but emphasized, \"Neither group should go alone. We may need force to overwhelm force. The Slovak carriers are strong and armed.\"\n\nThe men smiled, and Mr. Morris noted, \"I've brought some Winchesters—we may need them if there are wolves or danger. The Count was careful and took extra measures, so we must also stay prepared.\"\n\nDr. Seward proposed, \"I’ll go with Quincey. We're used to hunting together and, well-armed, can handle whatever comes up. Art, you shouldn't go alone either. We may have to fight the Slovaks, who probably aren't armed with guns, but any scuffle could ruin our plans. We must leave nothing to chance this time. We won't rest until the Count’s body and head are separated to make sure he can’t come back to life.\"\n\nHe looked at Jonathan, who glanced worriedly at me. I could tell he was torn—he wanted to stay with me, but he also wanted to be on the boat, likely the group that would finally destroy...the Vampire. (Why do I hesitate to even write it?) He stayed silent for a moment before Dr. Van Helsing addressed him:\n\n\"Jonathan, you are doubly needed. First, because you are young, brave, and can fight—and second, it’s your right to defeat the one who has caused you and your loved ones such pain. Don’t worry about Madam Mina; I will look after her if I may. I am old; I can’t run or ride as I used to, nor fight with weapons, but I can help in other ways and can face danger or even death if needed. Here’s my plan: while Lord Godalming and you take the fast steamboat up the river and John and Quincey guard the bank in case he lands, I will take Madam Mina straight into the enemy’s country. While the Count is trapped in his box on the moving river, unable to get out or alert his carriers, we’ll trace Jonathan’s path from Bistritz across the Borgo and go to Castle Dracula. Madam Mina’s hypnotic ability will guide us, especially near dawn when we're close. There’s a lot to do to cleanse the place and wipe out that nest of evil.\" Jonathan reacted passionately:\n\n\"Professor Van Helsing, are you saying you'd take Mina, afflicted as she is, right into that deadly place? Never! Not for anything!\" He was almost speechless with emotion and went on, \"Do you know what it’s like? Have you seen that terrible den, where even the moonlight is haunted by horrible shapes and swirling dust could become monsters? Have you felt the Vampire’s lips on your throat?\" He turned to me, saw the mark on my forehead, and cried out in agony, collapsing with grief. The Professor addressed him gently, his calm voice soothing us all:\n\n\"Jonathan, it’s because I want to save Madam Mina from that place that I plan to go. God forbid I would actually take her inside. There is important, dangerous work there that she must not witness. All of us, except you, have seen what must be done to purify it. We must act because if the Count escapes, being so clever and strong, he might hide for a century—and then, in time, our dear Mina would join him as those others did. You remember the monsters you told us about—their greedy smiles and cruel laughter? I’m sorry to remind you and cause pain, but it’s necessary. Isn’t it urgent enough for me to risk my life? If anyone had to stay behind in that place, it would have to be me.\"\n\n\"Do as you think best,\" Jonathan said with a trembling sob. \"We are in God’s hands!\""

I felt so thankful that Lord Godalming is rich, and that both he and Mr. Morris, who also has plenty of money, are willing to spend it so freely. For if they did not, our little expedition could not start, either so promptly or so well equipped, as it will within another hour. It is not three hours since it was arranged what part each of us was to do; and now Lord Godalming and Jonathan have a lovely steam launch, with steam up ready to start at a moment’s notice. Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris have half a dozen good horses, well appointed. We have all the maps and appliances of various kinds that can be had.

The Professor knows something of a great many languages, so we shall get on all right. We have all got arms, even for me a large-bore revolver; Jonathan would not be happy unless I was armed like the rest. Alas! I cannot carry one arm that the rest do; the scar on my forehead forbids that. Dear Dr. Van Helsing comforts me by telling me that I am fully armed as there may be wolves; the weather is getting colder every hour, and there are snow-flurries which come and go as warnings.\nLater.—It took all my courage to say good-bye to my darling.

Their willingness to spend has made it possible for their mission to begin so quickly and with such good resources, starting within the hour. Remarkably, within just three hours of finalizing the plan, Lord Godalming and Jonathan have secured a fully prepared steam launch, and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris have obtained several well-equipped horses. They have gathered all necessary maps and equipment. Professor Van Helsing and Mina plan to depart tonight on the 11:40 train for Veresti.

They will drive themselves as they cannot trust anyone else for this task. The Professor's knowledge of many languages will ensure they manage. Everyone, including Mina, is armed; Jonathan insisted Mina carry a large-bore revolver for her safety. Mina laments that she cannot carry one particular type of weapon that others have, presumably due to the scar on her forehead. Dr. Van Helsing reassures her she is adequately armed, especially considering the potential threat of wolves. The weather is growing colder, with intermittent snow showers serving as a warning.

Without their financial support, our little mission could never be set in motion so quickly or be so well prepared as it will be within the hour.

          "text_segment": "Jonathan Harker’s Journal.\nOctober 30. Night.—I am writing this in the light from the furnace door of the steam launch: Lord Godalming is firing up. He is an experienced hand at the work, as he has had for years a launch of his own on the Thames, and another on the Norfolk Broads. Regarding our plans, we finally decided that Mina’s guess was correct, and that if any waterway was chosen for the Count’s escape back to his Castle, the Sereth and then the Bistritza at its junction, would be the one. We took it, that somewhere about the 47th degree, north latitude, would be the place chosen for the crossing the country between the river and the Carpathians. We have no fear in running at good speed up the river at night; there is plenty of water, and the banks are wide enough apart to make steaming, even in the dark, easy enough. Lord Godalming tells me to sleep for a while, as it is enough for the present for one to be on watch. But I cannot sleep—how can I with the terrible danger hanging over my darling, and her going out into that awful place.... My only comfort is that we are in the hands of God. Only for that faith it would be easier to die than to live, and so be quit of all the trouble. Mr. Morris and Dr. Seward were off on their long ride before we started; they are to keep up the right bank, far enough off to get on higher lands where they can see a good stretch of river and avoid the following of its curves. They have, for the first stages, two men to ride and lead their spare horses—four in all, so as not to excite curiosity. When they dismiss the men, which shall be shortly, they shall themselves look after the horses. It may be necessary for us to join forces; if so they can mount our whole party. One of the saddles has a movable horn, and can be easily adapted for Mina, if required.\nIt is a wild adventure we are on. Here, as we are rushing along through the darkness, with the cold from the river seeming to rise up and strike us; with all the mysterious voices of the night around us, it all comes home. We seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways; into a whole world of dark and dreadful things. Godalming is shutting the furnace door....\n31 October.—Still hurrying along. The day has come, and Godalming is sleeping. I am on watch. The morning is bitterly cold; the furnace heat is grateful, though we have heavy fur coats. As yet we have passed only a few open boats, but none of them had on board any box or package of anything like the size of the one we seek. The men were scared every time we turned our electric lamp on them, and fell on their knees and prayed.\n1 November, evening.—No news all day; we have found nothing of the kind we seek. We have now passed into the Bistritza; and if we are wrong in our surmise our chance is gone. We have over-hauled every boat, big and little. Early this morning, one crew took us for a Government boat, and treated us accordingly. We saw in this a way of smoothing matters, so at Fundu, where the Bistritza runs into the Sereth, we got a Roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously. With every boat which we have over-hauled since then this trick has succeeded; we have had every deference shown to us, and not once any objection to whatever we chose to ask or do. Some of the Slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them, going at more than usual speed as she had a double crew on board. This was before they came to Fundu, so they could not tell us whether the boat turned into the Bistritza or continued on up the Sereth. At Fundu we could not hear of any such boat, so she must have passed there in the night. I am feeling very sleepy; the cold is perhaps beginning to tell upon me, and nature must have rest some time. Godalming insists that he shall keep the first watch. God bless him for all his goodness to poor dear Mina and me.\n2 November, morning.—It is broad daylight. That good fellow would not wake me. He says it would have been a sin to, for I slept peacefully and was forgetting my trouble. It seems brutally selfish to me to have slept so long, and let him watch all night; but he was quite right. I am a new man this morning; and, as I sit here and watch him sleeping, I can do all that is necessary both as to minding the engine, steering, and keeping watch. I can feel that my strength and energy are coming back to me. I wonder where Mina is now, and Van Helsing. They should have got to Veresti about noon on Wednesday. It would take them some time to get the carriage and horses; so if they had started and travelled hard, they would be about now at the Borgo Pass. God guide and help them! I am afraid to think what may happen. If we could only go faster! but we cannot; the engines are throbbing and doing their utmost. I wonder how Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris are getting on. There seem to be endless streams running down the mountains into this river, but as none of them are very large—at present, at all events, though they are terrible doubtless in winter and when the snow melts—the horsemen may not have met much obstruction. I hope that before we get to Strasba we may see them; for if by that time we have not overtaken the Count, it may be necessary to take counsel together what to do next.\nDr. Seward’s Diary.\n2 November.—Three days on the road. No news, and no time to write it if there had been, for every moment is precious. We have had only the rest needful for the horses; but we are both bearing it wonderfully. Those adventurous days of ours are turning up useful. We must push on; we shall never feel happy till we get the launch in sight again.\n3 November.—We heard at Fundu that the launch had gone up the Bistritza. I wish it wasn’t so cold. There are signs of snow coming; and if it falls heavy it will stop us. In such case we must get a sledge and go on, Russian fashion.\n4 November.—To-day we heard of the launch having been detained by an accident when trying to force a way up the rapids. The Slovak boats get up all right, by aid of a rope and steering with knowledge. Some went up only a few hours before. Godalming is an amateur fitter himself, and evidently it was he who put the launch in trim again. Finally, they got up the rapids all right, with local help, and are off on the chase afresh. I fear that the boat is not any better for the accident; the peasantry tell us that after she got upon smooth water again, she kept stopping every now and again so long as she was in sight. We must push on harder than ever; our help may be wanted soon.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The text begins with Jonathan Harker's journal entry from the night of October 30th. He is on a steam launch, using the furnace light to write. Lord Godalming is operating the engine, skilled from previous experience with his own boats. Their strategy, based on Mina's intuition, is that Dracula will flee via the Sereth and then the Bistritza rivers to reach his castle. They believe he will attempt to cross the land between the river and the Carpathians around 47 degrees North latitude. They are confident about traveling swiftly on the river at night because there is ample water and the banks are far apart, making navigation easy even in the dark. Godalming suggests Harker sleep, as one person is enough for watch duty. However, Harker is unable to sleep due to his deep anxiety about Mina's danger and their perilous journey. He finds solace only in his faith in God, believing that without it, death would be preferable to the current suffering. Meanwhile, Mr. Morris and Dr. Seward departed earlier by horse. Their plan is to follow the river from the high ground on the right bank, avoiding the river's bends. Initially, they have two assistants and spare horses (four horses in total) to avoid attracting attention. They plan to dismiss these men soon and manage the horses themselves. There is a possibility they may need to combine their efforts, and if so, they have enough horses to mount the entire group, including a saddle that can be adjusted for Mina. Harker reflects on the intensity of their quest, feeling the cold from the river and hearing the night's mysterious sounds. He feels they are entering strange and terrifying territory. Godalming then closes the furnace door.\n\nHarker's entry for October 31st describes the ongoing journey into the morning. Godalming is now sleeping, and Harker is on watch. The morning is very cold, but the heat from the furnace is welcome despite their warm fur coats. They have encountered only a few small boats so far, none carrying anything resembling the large box they are seeking. When they shone their electric lamp on these boats, the occupants were visibly frightened, kneeling and praying.\n\nThe journal entry for the evening of November 1st states that they have had no news all day and have not found the box. They have now entered the Bistritza river, recognizing that if this is the wrong route, their opportunity is lost. They thoroughly searched every boat they encountered. Earlier that morning, one boat's crew mistook them for a government vessel and treated them with deference. Seeing the advantage in this, they acquired a Romanian flag at Fundu, where the Bistritza meets the Sereth, and began flying it prominently. This tactic has been successful with every boat checked since then, ensuring cooperation and no objections to their actions. Some Slovaks told them about a large boat that passed them, traveling unusually fast with extra crew, before reaching Fundu. However, they couldn't confirm if it turned into the Bistritza. At Fundu, they found no information about such a boat, concluding it must have passed during the night. Harker feels very sleepy, suspecting the cold is affecting him, and acknowledges the need for rest. Godalming insists on taking the first watch, and Harker expresses his gratitude for Godalming's kindness to him and Mina.\n\nOn the morning of November 2nd, Harker writes that it is full daylight. Godalming did not wake him, saying he slept peacefully and was oblivious to his troubles. Harker feels guilty for sleeping so long while Godalming kept watch but admits Godalming was right, as he feels revitalized. He feels his strength and energy returning and is capable of managing the engine, steering, and keeping watch. He wonders about Mina and Van Helsing, who should have arrived at Veresti around noon on Wednesday. Allowing time for arranging transportation, they should be nearing the Borgo Pass if they traveled quickly. He prays for their guidance and help, fearing what might happen and wishing they could go faster, though the engine is already working at its maximum. He also wonders about Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris. He notes the numerous streams flowing from the mountains into the river, which are currently small but could be dangerous in winter or during snowmelt. He hopes these haven't hindered the horsemen. He hopes they will meet Seward and Morris before reaching Strasba, as if they haven't caught Dracula by then, they will need to confer and decide their next steps.\n\nDr. Seward's diary entry for November 2nd confirms they have been traveling by road for three days. There is no news, and little time to write even if there were, as every moment is important. They have only stopped to rest the horses but are enduring the journey well, crediting their past adventures. They are eager to push on and will not feel at ease until they see the launch again.\n\nOn November 3rd, Seward records hearing at Fundu that the launch proceeded up the Bistritza. He notes the intense cold and signs of approaching snow, which could halt their progress. If heavy snow falls, they plan to switch to a sledge, in the Russian style.\n\nSeward's entry for November 4th reports hearing that the launch experienced an accident attempting to navigate the rapids, causing a delay. Slovak boats are able to pass using ropes and skilled steering, with some having done so just hours before. Godalming, being mechanically inclined, apparently managed to repair the launch. With local assistance, they successfully navigated the rapids and resumed their pursuit. Seward is concerned the accident may have caused lasting damage, as peasants observed the boat stopping frequently after reaching smoother water. They realize they must press on with greater urgency, as their assistance may soon be needed.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Jonathan Harker's Journal details the group's journey by steam launch, led by Lord Godalming, who is skilled with such boats. They've determined that Mina's hypothesis about Count Dracula's escape route—via the Sereth and Bistritza rivers—was likely correct. They anticipate the crossing point into the Carpathians at around the 47th parallel. The group runs the launch swiftly by night, confident due to the wide riverbanks, though Harker finds it impossible to rest, worrying about Mina and taking comfort only in his faith. Meanwhile, Morris and Dr. Seward travel on horseback along the right bank to keep watch and avoid suspicion, ready to coordinate if needed. The atmosphere is tense and foreboding as they speed through darkness and cold.\n\nOn October 31, they continue their search; Harker takes watch while Godalming sleeps. It's very cold, but their search for Dracula's box among the boats proves fruitless. Locals are frightened when their electric light shines on them. By November 1, still having no luck, they switch to flying a Romanian flag to smooth interactions, allowing them to conduct searches without objection. They hear rumors of a fast boat with a double crew but cannot track its route. Harker experiences exhaustion and is relieved by Godalming during the night.\n\nBy November 2, Harker wakes up refreshed from a full night's sleep, feeling guilty but better for it. He handles the watch and cares for the engine while pondering Mina and Van Helsing's possible progress. He is anxious about catching up with Dracula and hopes to reunite with the horseback party before it's too late.\n\nDr. Seward's Diary notes the challenging overland pursuit; he and Morris rest little, focusing on rapidly catching up to the launch. At Fundu, they hear the launch has gone up the Bistritza. With signs of snow and possible delays, they consider resorting to a sledge if needed. On November 4, they discover the launch suffered an accident at the rapids but was repaired with local help, though now it seems to be faltering. Fearing that their companions might soon need assistance, Seward and Morris push on even harder."

          "text_segment": "1 November.—All day long we have travelled, and at a good speed. The horses seem to know that they are being kindly treated, for they go willingly their full stage at best speed. We have now had so many changes and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged to think that the journey will be an easy one. Dr. Van Helsing is laconic; he tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays them well to make the exchange of horses. We get hot soup, or coffee, or tea; and off we go. It is a lovely country; full of beauties of all imaginable kinds, and the people are brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full of nice qualities. They are very, very superstitious. In the first house where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the scar on my forehead, she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me, to keep off the evil eye. I believe they went to the trouble of putting an extra amount of garlic into our food; and I can’t abide garlic. Ever since then I have taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and so have escaped their suspicions. We are travelling fast, and as we have no driver with us to carry tales, we go ahead of scandal; but I daresay that fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind us all the way. The Professor seems tireless; all day he would not take any rest, though he made me sleep for a long spell. At sunset time he hypnotised me, and he says that I answered as usual “darkness, lapping water and creaking wood”; so our enemy is still on the river. I am afraid to think of Jonathan, but somehow I have now no fear for him, or for myself. I write this whilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horses to be got ready. Dr. Van Helsing is sleeping. Poor dear, he looks very tired and old and grey, but his mouth is set as firmly as a conqueror’s; even in his sleep he is instinct with resolution. When we have well started I must make him rest whilst I drive. I shall tell him that we have days before us, and we must not break down when most of all his strength will be needed.... All is ready; we are off shortly.\n2 November, morning.—I was successful, and we took turns driving all night; now the day is on us, bright though cold. There is a strange heaviness in the air—I say heaviness for want of a better word; I mean that it oppresses us both. It is very cold, and only our warm furs keep us comfortable. At dawn Van Helsing hypnotised me; he says I answered “darkness, creaking wood and roaring water,” so the river is changing as they ascend. I do hope that my darling will not run any chance of danger—more than need be; but we are in God’s hands.\n2 November, night.—All day long driving. The country gets wilder as we go, and the great spurs of the Carpathians, which at Veresti seemed so far from us and so low on the horizon, now seem to gather round us and tower in front. We both seem in good spirits; I think we make an effort each to cheer the other; in the doing so we cheer ourselves. Dr. Van Helsing says that by morning we shall reach the Borgo Pass. The houses are very few here now, and the Professor says that the last horse we got will have to go on with us, as we may not be able to change. He got two in addition to the two we changed, so that now we have a rude four-in-hand. The dear horses are patient and good, and they give us no trouble. We are not worried with other travellers, and so even I can drive. We shall get to the Pass in daylight; we do not want to arrive before. So we take it easy, and have each a long rest in turn. Oh, what will to-morrow bring to us? We go to seek the place where my poor darling suffered so much. God grant that we may be guided aright, and that He will deign to watch over my husband and those dear to us both, and who are in such deadly peril. As for me, I am not worthy in His sight. Alas! I am unclean to His eyes, and shall be until He may deign to let me stand forth in His sight as one of those who have not incurred His wrath.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "November 1st—We have traveled rapidly all day. The horses seem appreciative of our kind treatment, maintaining a good pace willingly throughout their assigned stages. Having changed horses frequently and consistently found the same positive results, we are optimistic that the rest of the journey will be straightforward. Dr. Van Helsing speaks little, telling farmers he is rushing to Bistritz and paying them well for quick horse swaps. We grab hot food or drinks and continue on our way. The countryside is beautiful, full of diverse natural wonders, and the people are courageous, robust, and straightforward, appearing to possess many admirable traits. They are, however, extremely superstitious. At our first stop, the woman serving us saw the mark on my forehead; she immediately made the sign of the cross and extended two fingers towards me to ward off the evil eye. I suspect they intentionally added extra garlic to our meal, which I cannot tolerate. Since then, I've been careful to keep my hat or veil on to avoid raising further suspicions. We are moving swiftly, and since we have no driver to spread rumors, we are outpacing gossip, though I imagine the fear of the evil eye will dog our steps all the way. The Professor seems indefatigable; he refused to rest all day, although he insisted I sleep for a considerable period. At sunset, he hypnotized me, and he confirmed I responded with my usual answers – \"darkness, lapping water, and creaking wood,\" indicating our adversary is still on the river. Although I am apprehensive about Jonathan, for some reason I no longer feel afraid for him or myself. I am writing this entry while we are at a farmhouse, waiting for the horses to be prepared. Dr. Van Helsing is sleeping. He looks utterly exhausted, aged, and pale, but his mouth is set with the determination of a victor; even asleep, he exudes resolve. Once we are properly underway, I must make him rest while I take the reins. I'll remind him we have days ahead and cannot afford for him to break down when his strength will be most crucial... Everything is ready; we are departing soon.\n\nNovember 2nd, morning—I succeeded in my plan, and we alternated driving throughout the night. Now the day has arrived, clear but cold. There's a peculiar heaviness in the air – 'heaviness' is the best word I can find; it feels oppressive to both of us. It's very cold, and only our thick furs are keeping us comfortable. At dawn, Van Helsing hypnotized me; he said I answered \"darkness, creaking wood, and roaring water,\" suggesting the river is becoming rougher as they travel upstream. I sincerely hope my beloved will not face any unnecessary peril; but we are in God's care.\n\nNovember 2nd, night—We have been driving continuously all day. The landscape is growing wilder as we proceed, and the vast peaks of the Carpathians, which appeared distant and low on the horizon from Veresti, now seem to surround us and tower before us. We both appear to be in good spirits; I believe we are each trying to encourage the other, and in doing so, we uplift ourselves. Dr. Van Helsing predicts we will reach the Borgo Pass by morning. Houses are scarce in this area now, and the Professor mentioned that the last horse we acquired will likely have to stay with us, as we may not be able to get fresh ones. He obtained two extra horses in addition to the pair we exchanged, so we are now using a makeshift four-horse team. The gentle horses are patient and cooperative, giving us no trouble. We haven't encountered other travelers, which means even I can drive. We plan to arrive at the Pass during daylight; we don't want to get there before. Therefore, we are taking our time and each getting a long period of rest in turn. Oh, what does tomorrow hold for us? We are going to find the place where my poor dear suffered so greatly. May God guide us correctly, and may He deign to watch over my husband and those we both cherish, who are in such mortal danger. As for myself, I feel unworthy in His sight. Alas! I am impure in His eyes and will remain so until He sees fit to allow me to stand before Him as one who has not incurred His displeasure.",

Having changed horses many times and been treated the same everywhere, we're hopeful that our journey will go smoothly. Dr. Van Helsing is brief in his explanation to the farmers, merely saying that we're hurrying to Bistritz, and he pays generously for fresh horses. We are given hot drinks before continuing. The landscape is beautiful, filled with all sorts of charms, and the local people are strong, brave, straightforward, and seem to have many good qualities. However, they are extremely superstitious. At the first stop, the woman serving us crossed herself and made a protective gesture when she saw my forehead scar, and I suspect she even put extra garlic in our meal, which I dislike. Since then, I’ve been careful to keep my hat or veil on to avoid further suspicion. We're making good time, and since we have no driver to spread gossip, we are outpacing any rumors; still, I'm sure fear of the evil eye will pursue us. Despite his age and evident fatigue, the Professor is indefatigable—he wouldn’t rest all day, though he made sure I slept. At sunset, he hypnotized me, and I reported the same vision as before: darkness, water sounds, and creaking wood; this means our adversary is still on the river. I worry for Jonathan, yet I feel strangely unafraid for either him or myself. I’m writing this while we wait in a farmhouse for new horses. Dr. Van Helsing is resting now; he looks weary and old, but resolute even in sleep. Once we set out again, I’ll insist he rests and let me drive, explaining that we'll need to conserve strength for what's ahead. Everything’s ready, we leave soon.\n\nNovember 2, morning—I succeeded, and we took turns driving through the night. Now dawn has come, though it's cold. There's a strange, oppressive feeling in the air that I can’t quite describe. Only warm furs make us comfortable. At sunrise, Van Helsing hypnotized me again, and I saw the same vision: darkness, creaking wood, and roaring water, indicating the river’s flow is changing as it moves upstream. I pray my dear one doesn’t face more danger than necessary—we are in God's hands.\n\nNovember 2, night—We've been driving all day. The landscape becomes more rugged, and the Carpathian mountains, once distant on the horizon, now tower over us. We’re both in good spirits, trying to lift each other’s mood. Dr. Van Helsing says we’ll reach Borgo Pass by morning. There are hardly any houses here now, and the Professor says this last team of horses will have to see us through, as we probably can’t replace them. He did secure two extra horses though, so we have a rough four-horse team. The horses are patient and well-behaved, causing no trouble. With no other travelers about, even I am able to drive. We aim to reach the Pass during daylight, so we're not rushing and taking long rests each in turn. I wonder what tomorrow holds for us. We're going to the very place where my beloved suffered so much. May God guide us, watch over my husband and our loved ones in their danger. As for me, I feel I am unworthy—tainted in His eyes, and will remain so until He allows me to be pure again."

          "text_segment": "4 November.—This to my old and true friend John Seward, M.D., of Purfleet, London, in case I may not see him. It may explain. It is morning, and I write by a fire which all the night I have kept alive—Madam Mina aiding me. It is cold, cold; so cold that the grey heavy sky is full of snow, which when it falls will settle for all winter as the ground is hardening to receive it. It seems to have affected Madam Mina; she has been so heavy of head all day that she was not like herself. She sleeps, and sleeps, and sleeps! She who is usual so alert, have done literally nothing all the day; she even have lost her appetite. She make no entry into her little diary, she who write so faithful at every pause. Something whisper to me that all is not well. However, to-night she is more vif. Her long sleep all day have refresh and restore her, for now she is all sweet and bright as ever. At sunset I try to hypnotise her, but alas! with no effect; the power has grown less and less with each day, and to-night it fail me altogether. Well, God’s will be done—whatever it may be, and whithersoever it may lead!\nNow to the historical, for as Madam Mina write not in her stenography, I must, in my cumbrous old fashion, that so each day of us may not go unrecorded.\nWe got to the Borgo Pass just after sunrise yesterday morning. When I saw the signs of the dawn I got ready for the hypnotism. We stopped our carriage, and got down so that there might be no disturbance. I made a couch with furs, and Madam Mina, lying down, yield herself as usual, but more slow and more short time than ever, to the hypnotic sleep. As before, came the answer: “darkness and the swirling of water.” Then she woke, bright and radiant and we go on our way and soon reach the Pass. At this time and place, she become all on fire with zeal; some new guiding power be in her manifested, for she point to a road and say:—\n“This is the way.”\n“How know you it?” I ask.\n“Of course I know it,” she answer, and with a pause, add: “Have not my Jonathan travelled it and wrote of his travel?”\nAt first I think somewhat strange, but soon I see that there be only one such by-road. It is used but little, and very different from the coach road from the Bukovina to Bistritz, which is more wide and hard, and more of use.\nSo we came down this road; when we meet other ways—not always were we sure that they were roads at all, for they be neglect and light snow have fallen—the horses know and they only. I give rein to them, and they go on so patient. By-and-by we find all the things which Jonathan have note in that wonderful diary of him. Then we go on for long, long hours and hours. At the first, I tell Madam Mina to sleep; she try, and she succeed. She sleep all the time; till at the last, I feel myself to suspicious grow, and attempt to wake her. But she sleep on, and I may not wake her though I try. I do not wish to try too hard lest I harm her; for I know that she have suffer much, and sleep at times be all-in-all to her. I think I drowse myself, for all of sudden I feel guilt, as though I have done something; I find myself bolt up, with the reins in my hand, and the good horses go along jog, jog, just as ever. I look down and find Madam Mina still sleep. It is now not far off sunset time, and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood, so that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep. For we are going up, and up; and all is oh! so wild and rocky, as though it were the end of the world.\nThen I arouse Madam Mina. This time she wake with not much trouble, and then I try to put her to hypnotic sleep. But she sleep not, being as though I were not. Still I try and try, till all at once I find her and myself in dark; so I look round, and find that the sun have gone down. Madam Mina laugh, and I turn and look at her. She is now quite awake, and look so well as I never saw her since that night at Carfax when we first enter the Count’s house. I am amaze, and not at ease then; but she is so bright and tender and thoughtful for me that I forget all fear. I light a fire, for we have brought supply of wood with us, and she prepare food while I undo the horses and set them, tethered in shelter, to feed. Then when I return to the fire she have my supper ready. I go to help her; but she smile, and tell me that she have eat already—that she was so hungry that she would not wait. I like it not, and I have grave doubts; but I fear to affright her, and so I am silent of it. She help me and I eat alone; and then we wrap in fur and lie beside the fire, and I tell her to sleep while I watch. But presently I forget all of watching; and when I sudden remember that I watch, I find her lying quiet, but awake, and looking at me with so bright eyes. Once, twice more the same occur, and I get much sleep till before morning. When I wake I try to hypnotise her; but alas! though she shut her eyes obedient, she may not sleep. The sun rise up, and up, and up; and then sleep come to her too late, but so heavy that she will not wake. I have to lift her up, and place her sleeping in the carriage when I have harnessed the horses and made all ready. Madam still sleep, and she look in her sleep more healthy and more redder than before. And I like it not. And I am afraid, afraid, afraid!—I am afraid of all things—even to think but I must go on my way. The stake we play for is life and death, or more than these, and we must not flinch.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "November 4th: This entry is for my dear and loyal friend, Dr. John Seward of Purfleet, London, in case I cannot speak to him myself. It might clarify things. It is morning now, and I am writing by the light of a fire that I have kept burning all night, with help from Madam Mina. It is terribly cold; so cold that the heavy grey sky looks ready to burst with snow, which will likely stay once it falls, as the ground is already freezing solid. The cold seems to have affected Madam Mina; she was unusually dull and withdrawn all yesterday, quite unlike her normal self. She slept soundly and frequently! She is usually so lively and active, but she did absolutely nothing all day; she even lost her appetite. She didn't even write in her small diary, she who is so diligent about recording everything. A feeling whispers to me that something is not right. However, tonight she is more vibrant. Her long rest during the day appears to have revived and refreshed her, for she is now as sweet and cheerful as always. At sunset, I tried to hypnotize her, but sadly, without success. The power has been weakening daily, and tonight it completely failed me. Well, let God's will be done—whatever it may be, and wherever it may lead! Now, to the events of the past day, since Madam Mina is not using her shorthand; I must write in my cumbersome, old-fashioned way so that our days are not left unrecorded. We reached the Borgo Pass just after the sun rose yesterday morning. When I saw the first signs of dawn, I prepared for the hypnotism session. We stopped the carriage and got out to avoid any disruptions. I made a makeshift bed with furs, and Madam Mina lay down, submitting herself as usual, though more slowly and for a shorter time than ever before, to the hypnotic sleep. As on previous occasions, the response was: 'darkness and the swirling of water.' Then she awoke, looking bright and lively, and we continued our journey, quickly reaching the Pass itself. At this point and place, she became filled with intense purpose; some new directing force seemed to manifest within her, for she pointed to a road and declared: 'This is the way.' 'How do you know that?' I asked. 'Of course I know it,' she replied, and after a pause, added, 'Didn't my Jonathan travel this road and write about it?' At first, I found this slightly odd, but soon I saw that there was only one such side road. It sees very little use and is quite different from the main coach road from Bukovina to Bistritz, which is wider, firmer, and more heavily traveled. So we took this road; whenever we came to forks—and we weren't always sure they were actual roads, as they were neglected and covered by a light layer of snow—only the horses seemed to know which way to go. I let them guide us, and they proceeded patiently. Eventually, we found all the places that Jonathan had described in his remarkable diary. Then we continued on for many, many long hours. Initially, I told Madam Mina to try and sleep; she did, and she succeeded. She slept the entire time; until, finally, I began to feel increasingly uneasy and tried to wake her. But she remained asleep, and I couldn't wake her despite my efforts. I didn't want to try too forcefully, fearing I might hurt her; for I know she has suffered greatly, and sometimes sleep is absolutely essential for her. I think I must have dozed off myself, because suddenly I felt a surge of guilt, as if I had done something wrong; I found myself sitting bolt upright, the reins in my hands, and the good horses were plodding along steadily, just as before. I looked down and saw Madam Mina still sleeping. It was now nearly sunset, and the setting sun's light spread across the snow in great, yellow streams, casting long, deep shadows from the steeply rising mountains beside us. We were going higher and higher; and everything around us was incredibly wild and rocky, as if we had reached the edge of the world. Then I roused Madam Mina. This time, she woke with little difficulty, and then I tried to put her into a hypnotic sleep. But she didn't sleep, acting as if I wasn't even attempting it. Still, I kept trying, until suddenly I realized both she and I were in darkness; so I looked around and saw that the sun had set. Madam Mina laughed, and I turned to look at her. She was now fully awake and looked healthier than I had seen her since that night at Carfax when we first entered the Count's house. I was surprised and uneasy at that moment; but she was so cheerful, affectionate, and considerate towards me that I forgot all my fears. I built a fire, as we had brought wood with us, and she prepared food while I unharnessed the horses and tethered them in a sheltered spot to eat. When I returned to the fire, my supper was ready. I went to help her; but she smiled and told me she had already eaten—that she was so hungry she couldn't wait. I didn't like this, and I had serious concerns; but I was afraid of frightening her, so I said nothing about it. She helped me, and I ate alone; and then we wrapped ourselves in furs and lay by the fire, and I told her to sleep while I kept watch. But before long, I completely forgot about keeping watch; and when I suddenly remembered that I was supposed to be watching, I found her lying quietly, but awake, and looking at me with such bright eyes. This happened again, once or twice more, and I actually got a good amount of sleep before morning. When I woke, I tried to hypnotize her; but alas! although she closed her eyes obediently, she could not fall asleep. The sun rose higher and higher; and then sleep finally came to her, too late, but so heavily that she would not wake. I had to lift her up and place her, sleeping, in the carriage after I had harnessed the horses and finished preparing everything. Madam Mina is still asleep, and in her sleep, she looks healthier and has more colour than before. And I do not like it. And I am afraid, afraid, afraid!—I am afraid of everything—even to think—but I must continue our journey. The stakes we are playing for are life and death, or perhaps something even greater, and we must not falter.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "November 4th—To my dear and trusted friend John Seward, M.D., of Purfleet, London, in case I am unable to see him, I write this. It may provide an explanation. I am writing in the morning, settled by a fire that I have kept burning all night, with Madam Mina helping me. The weather is bitterly cold; the sky is heavy and grey with snow that will, once it begins to fall, cover the ground for the entire winter, as the earth is already hardening in readiness. This change seems to have affected Mina; she has felt sluggish and unlike herself all day. She has been sleeping constantly—so unlike her usual alert self—barely doing anything and even losing her appetite. She’s made no entries in her diary, though she is ordinarily so diligent with it. I have a sense that something is wrong. However, she seems livelier tonight. Her long sleep appears to have refreshed her, as she is once again sweet and cheerful. At sunset, I tried to hypnotize her, but I had no success; the effectiveness has diminished with each attempt, and tonight I failed entirely. Still, God’s will be done, whatever that means and wherever it leads!\n\nNow for the record-keeping: since Mina hasn’t recorded today in her shorthand, I must do so in my own old-fashioned way, so that nothing gets left unnoted.\n\nYesterday, just after sunrise, we arrived at the Borgo Pass. At the first sign of dawn, I prepared for the hypnotism. We stopped the carriage, got out to avoid distraction, and I made a resting place with furs. Mina lay down and, as before, entered a hypnotic sleep, though slower and for a shorter period than usual. Again came the response: \"darkness and swirling water.\" Then she awoke, bright and rejuvenated, and we continued to the Pass. At that moment and place, Mina became inspired, as if guided by some force; she pointed at a road, saying, “This is the way.” \n\nWhen I asked how she knew, she replied, “Of course I know it. Didn’t my Jonathan travel this road and record it?” It seemed strange, but there was only one such by-road—rarely used, unlike the main road from Bukovina to Bistritz, which is wider, firmer, and more commonly traveled. \n\nWe followed this road. When we encountered other paths—some barely recognizable as roads because they were neglected and lightly covered by snow—the horses knew the way, so I trusted them and let them lead. Eventually, we passed all the landmarks Jonathan mentioned in his remarkable diary. We journeyed for many long hours. Initially, I told Mina to sleep, and she managed to do so, resting continually. Eventually, I grew uneasy and tried to wake her, but could not, though I didn’t wish to try too hard and possibly cause her harm, knowing how much she had endured and how vital sleep is for her. I must have drifted off myself, because I was suddenly jolted awake, guilty as if I had been negligent, and discovered the horses still steadily walking along, just as before, with Mina in deep sleep at my side. It was nearly sunset, and the sinking sun cast long yellow rays across the snow and the mountains around us. We continued climbing higher into the wild, rocky landscape, feeling as though we had come to the world’s end.\n\nThen I woke Mina—this time she awoke easily, but when I tried to hypnotize her again, she wouldn’t fall asleep, as if I had no influence on her at all. I persisted until it grew dark and found the sun had set. Mina laughed and looked at me, fully awake and looking better than she had since that night at Carfax when we first entered the Count's house. Though her bright, caring manner reassured me, I was unsettled. I lit a fire—we had brought firewood with us—and Mina prepared food while I unhitched and fed the horses. She had already eaten, she told me when I returned; she was so hungry she couldn’t wait. This worried me, but I chose not to frighten her and said nothing. After I ate, we wrapped up and lay beside the fire. I urged her to sleep so that I could keep watch, but I soon dozed off myself. Each time I awoke, Mina was awake, quietly watching me with bright eyes, and this happened several more times through the night. \n\nIn the morning, I tried again to hypnotize her, but even after she obediently closed her eyes, she did not sleep. The sun continued to rise, and belatedly, she did drift off, but so deeply that I could not wake her. I had to lift her into the carriage while she slept, prepare the horses, and set off. She continued to sleep, and her complexion looked healthier and more flushed than before, which disturbed me. I am truly fearful now—afraid of everything and even my own thoughts—but we must press on, for what’s at stake is not just life and death, but much more, and we cannot falter."

There are great, frowning precipices and much falling water, and Nature seem to have held sometime her carnival. Madam Mina still sleep and sleep; and though I did have hunger and appeased it, I could not waken her—even for food. I began to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her, tainted as she is with that Vampire baptism. “Well,” said I to myself, “if it be that she sleep all the day, it shall also be that I do not sleep at night.” As we travel on the rough road, for a road of an ancient and imperfect kind there was, I held down my head and slept. Again I waked with a sense of guilt and of time passed, and found Madam Mina still sleeping, and the sun low down. But all was indeed changed; the frowning mountains seemed further away, and we were near the top of a steep-rising hill, on summit of which was such a castle as Jonathan tell of in his diary. At once I exulted and feared; for now, for good or ill, the end was near.\nI woke Madam Mina, and again tried to hypnotise her; but alas! unavailing till too late. Then, ere the great dark came upon us—for even after down-sun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the snow, and all was for a time in a great twilight—I took out the horses and fed them in what shelter I could. Then I make a fire; and near it I make Madam Mina, now awake and more charming than ever, sit comfortable amid her rugs. I got ready food: but she would not eat, simply saying that she had not hunger. I did not press her, knowing her unavailingness. But I myself eat, for I must needs now be strong for all. Then, with the fear on me of what might be, I drew a ring so big for her comfort, round where Madam Mina sat; and over the ring I passed some of the wafer, and I broke it fine so that all was well guarded. She sat still all the time—so still as one dead; and she grew whiter and ever whiter till the snow was not more pale; and no word she said. But when I drew near, she clung to me, and I could know that the poor soul shook her from head to feet with a tremor that was pain to feel. I said to her presently, when she had grown more quiet:—\n“Will you not come over to the fire?” for I wished to make a test of what she could. She rose obedient, but when she have made a step she stopped, and stood as one stricken.\n“Why not go on?” I asked. She shook her head, and, coming back, sat down in her place. Then, looking at me with open eyes, as of one waked from sleep, she said simply:—\n“I cannot!” and remained silent. I rejoiced, for I knew that what she could not, none of those that we dreaded could. Though there might be danger to her body, yet her soul was safe!\nPresently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till I came to them and quieted them. When they did feel my hands on them, they whinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands and were quiet for a time. Many times through the night did I come to them, till it arrive to the cold hour when all nature is at lowest; and every time my coming was with quiet of them. In the cold hour the fire began to die, and I was about stepping forth to replenish it, for now the snow came in flying sweeps and with it a chill mist. Even in the dark there was a light of some kind, as there ever is over snow; and it seemed as though the snow-flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with trailing garments. All was in dead, grim silence only that the horses whinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst. I began to fear—horrible fears; but then came to me the sense of safety in that ring wherein I stood. I began, too, to think that my imaginings were of the night, and the gloom, and the unrest that I have gone through, and all the terrible anxiety. It was as though my memories of all Jonathan’s horrid experience were befooling me; for the snow flakes and the mist began to wheel and circle round, till I could get as though a shadowy glimpse of those women that would have kissed him. And then the horses cowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in pain. Even the madness of fright was not to them, so that they could break away. I feared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near and circled round. I looked at her, but she sat calm, and smiled at me; when I would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, she caught me and held me back, and whispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, so low it was:—\n“No! No! Do not go without. Here you are safe!” I turned to her, and looking in her eyes, said:—\n“But you? It is for you that I fear!” whereat she laughed—a laugh, low and unreal, and said:—\n“Fear for me! Why fear for me? None safer in all the world from them than I am,” and as I wondered at the meaning of her words, a puff of wind made the flame leap up, and I see the red scar on her forehead. Then, alas! I knew. Did I not, I would soon have learned, for the wheeling figures of mist and snow came closer, but keeping ever without the Holy circle. Then they began to materialise till—if God have not take away my reason, for I saw it through my eyes—there were before me in actual flesh the same three women that Jonathan saw in the room, when they would have kissed his throat. I knew the swaying round forms, the bright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuous lips. They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina; and as their laugh came through the silence of the night, they twined their arms and pointed to her, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were of the intolerable sweetness of the water-glasses:—\n“Come, sister. Come to us. Come! Come!” In fear I turned to my poor Madam Mina, and my heart with gladness leapt like flame; for oh! the terror in her sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told a story to my heart that was all of hope. God be thanked she was not, yet, of them. I seized some of the firewood which was by me, and holding out some of the Wafer, advanced on them towards the fire. They drew back before me, and laughed their low horrid laugh. I fed the fire, and feared them not; for I knew that we were safe within our protections. They could not approach, me, whilst so armed, nor Madam Mina whilst she remained within the ring, which she could not leave no more than they could enter. The horses had ceased to moan, and lay still on the ground; the snow fell on them softly, and they grew whiter. I knew that there was for the poor beasts no more of terror.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "November 5th, morning. I must be precise in every detail, for even though you and I have experienced strange things together, you might initially think I, Van Helsing, have gone mad—that the numerous horrors and the prolonged stress on my nerves have finally caused my mind to break. We spent all of yesterday traveling, constantly nearing the mountains and moving into increasingly wild and desolate territory. The landscape featured massive, imposing cliffs and abundant waterfalls, as if Nature had at some point held a grand, unrestrained celebration. Madam Mina continued to sleep deeply; despite feeling hungry myself and eating, I was unable to wake her, not even for food. I began to worry that the ominous influence of the location was affecting her, especially since she had been tainted by that Vampire 'baptism.' I told myself, 'Very well, if she is going to sleep all day, then I will certainly not sleep tonight.' As we traveled on the rough, old, and poorly maintained road, I bowed my head and drifted into sleep. I awoke again feeling a sense of guilt and the passage of time, finding Madam Mina still asleep and the sun low in the sky. Yet, everything had truly changed; the stern mountains seemed more distant, and we were approaching the summit of a steep hill. At its peak stood a castle like the one Jonathan described in his journal. Immediately, I felt both excitement and dread, for now, for better or worse, the end was imminent. I roused Madam Mina and tried to hypnotize her again, but alas! It was unsuccessful until it was too late. Then, before the deep darkness enveloped us—for even after sunset, the snow-covered ground reflected the departed sun, creating a long twilight—I unharnessed the horses and fed them in the minimal shelter I could find. Next, I built a fire, and near it, I settled Madam Mina, who was now awake and more delightful than ever, comfortably amidst her blankets. I prepared food, but she declined to eat, simply stating she wasn't hungry. I didn't insist, knowing it would be futile. However, I ate myself, as I needed to be strong for whatever was to come. Then, with fear gripping me about what might happen, I drew a wide circle around where Madam Mina sat, ensuring her comfort. Around this circle, I scattered pieces of the communion wafer, breaking it finely to create a complete protective barrier. She remained perfectly still the entire time—as motionless as a dead person; she grew paler and paler until the snow was no whiter, and she spoke no words. But when I approached her, she clung to me, and I could feel that the poor soul was trembling from head to foot with a shudder that was painful to witness. I said to her a moment later, when she had calmed down slightly: 'Won't you come closer to the fire?' I wanted to test what she was capable of. She rose obediently, but after taking a single step, she stopped and stood as if paralyzed. 'Why don't you continue?' I asked. She shook her head, returned, and sat back in her place. Then, looking at me with wide-open eyes, like someone just waking from sleep, she said simply: 'I cannot!' and remained silent. I felt joy, for I knew that what *she* could not do, none of those we feared could. Although there might be danger to her physical body, her soul was safe! Soon after, the horses began to scream and pulled at their ropes until I reached them and calmed them down. When they felt my hands on them, they whinnied softly as if in relief, licked my hands, and were quiet for a while. Many times throughout the night, I went to them, until the arrival of the cold hour when all of nature is at its lowest point; each time, my presence brought them calm. In the cold hour, the fire began to die down, and I was about to step out to add more fuel, as snow was now falling in sweeping gusts accompanied by a chilling mist. Even in the darkness, there was a certain light, as there always is over snow; and it seemed as though the snow flurries and swirling mist took on the forms of women with flowing robes. Everything was wrapped in a deadly, grim silence, broken only by the horses' whinnying and cowering as if in dread of the worst. I began to feel fearful—horrible fears; but then the sense of safety provided by the circle in which I stood came over me. I also started to think that my visions were products of the night, the darkness, the exhaustion I had endured, and all the terrible worry. It was as if my memories of Jonathan's dreadful experiences were misleading me; for the snowflakes and mist began to spin and circle, giving me fleeting, shadowy glimpses of the women who had wanted to kiss him. And then the horses cowered lower and lower, moaning in terror like men in pain. They were so consumed by fear that they couldn't even summon the madness needed to break free. I feared for my dear Madam Mina when these strange figures approached and circled around. I looked at her, but she sat calmly, smiling at me; when I started to step towards the fire to rekindle it, she caught me, held me back, and whispered, her voice as faint as one heard in a dream: 'No! No! Do not go outside. You are safe here!' I turned to her and, looking into her eyes, said: 'But what about you? It is for *you* that I fear!' At this, she laughed—a quiet, unnatural laugh—and said: 'Fear for *me*! Why fear for me? No one in all the world is safer from them than I am.' As I pondered the meaning of her words, a gust of wind made the flame leap up, and I saw the red scar on her forehead. Then, alas! I understood. Had I not, I would have learned soon enough, for the circling figures of mist and snow drew closer, but always stayed outside the Holy circle. Then they began to take on solid form until—unless God has taken away my reason, for I saw it with my own eyes—there stood before me in actual flesh the same three women that Jonathan had seen in the room when they tried to kiss his throat. I recognized their swaying figures, their bright, hard eyes, their white teeth, their rosy complexions, their seductive lips. They constantly smiled at poor dear Madam Mina; and as their laughter echoed through the silent night, they twined their arms together, pointed at her, and said in those sweetly tingling tones that Jonathan had described as having the unbearable sweetness of the water-glasses: 'Come, sister. Come to us. Come! Come!' In fear, I turned to my poor Madam Mina, and my heart leaped with gladness like a flame; for oh! the terror in her sweet eyes, the revulsion, the horror, told a story to my heart that was entirely of hope. Thank God, she was not *yet* one of them. I quickly grabbed some firewood that was nearby, and holding out some of the Wafer, I advanced towards them and the fire. They recoiled before me, emitting their low, horrid laugh. I fed the fire and no longer feared them, for I knew we were safe within our protections. They could not approach me while I was armed, nor Madam Mina while she remained within the circle, which she could no more leave than they could enter. The horses had stopped moaning and lay still on the ground; the snow fell softly on them, and they became whiter. I knew that the poor animals were no longer experiencing terror.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "5 November, morning.—I must record everything precisely, for although we have encountered many strange events together, you might initially suspect that I, Van Helsing, have lost my sanity and that the horrors we've endured have finally unhinged me.\n\nYesterday, we traveled all day, drawing nearer to the mountains and passing through land that was ever more wild and desolate, filled with towering cliffs and cascading water, as if nature itself had hosted a chaotic celebration. Madam Mina continued to sleep deeply the entire time, and although I ate to satisfy my hunger, I was unable to wake her, even for food. I started to fear that this place's deadly enchantment had taken hold of her, affected as she is by the vampire's influence. I told myself, 'If she must sleep through the day, I must stay awake through the night.'\n\nWhile we journeyed on the rough, ancient road, I nodded off with my head down. When I later awoke, feeling guilty and aware that time had passed, Mina was still asleep, and the sun was setting. The surroundings were changed; the once-threatening peaks felt farther, and we stood atop a steep hill, with, on its summit, a castle like the one Jonathan described in his diary. I felt both joy and fear, knowing the conclusion—good or bad—was close.\n\nI woke Mina and tried again to hypnotize her, but it was no use. Night began to fall, but even after sunset, the sky reflected on the snowy landscape, creating a long twilight. I tended to the horses, giving them shelter and food, and then built a fire. Mina, now awake and lovelier than ever, sat comfortably in her blankets near the blaze. I prepared food, but she refused to eat, stating simply she wasn't hungry; I didn't insist, knowing it was pointless. I ate myself, needing strength.\n\nFearing for her safety, I drew a protective circle around her position and scattered bits of the sacred wafer over it to keep her guarded. She sat motionless, growing so pale she was almost as white as the snow, and said nothing. When I came close, she clung to me, trembling so violently that it pained me to witness. Once she calmed, I suggested she come nearer the fire to test her limits. She obeyed at first, but stopped as if struck, then returned to her spot and said quietly, 'I can't!' I was reassured, for if even she could not cross the line, then none of our feared enemies could reach her soul, whatever their threat to her body.\n\nSuddenly, the horses began to scream and pull at their tethers until I calmed them, after which they quieted for a while. Throughout the night I checked on them, and each time my presence soothed them. Eventually, in the coldest, darkest hour, the fire began to die, and as I went to rekindle it, snow began to fall and a chilly mist swept in. Even in the darkness there was a faint light over the snow. The swirling snow and mist seemed to form the shapes of women in flowing garments. The air was eerily silent except for the frightened horses.\n\nI began to feel terrible fear, but regained a sense of security within our protective circle. I wondered if my mind was playing tricks on me because of exhaustion and anxiety, especially recalling Jonathan's horrific experiences. The swirling forms seemed to resemble the women who once tried to seduce Jonathan. The horses cowered in terror, but could not even break free, and I worried for Mina as the ghostly figures drew nearer. Mina, however, sat calmly and smiled. When I tried to fetch more firewood, she stopped me, whispering that I was safe within the circle.\n\nI expressed my concern for her safety, but she only laughed strangely and said, 'Why fear for me? None are safer from them than I am.' As I pondered her words, the fire flared and revealed the red scar on her forehead, and I understood. The ghostly women approached the circle but could not cross. Gradually, they became solid, revealing themselves as the same three women Jonathan had seen, with their alluring features. They beckoned to Mina, calling her to join them with their sweet, entrancing voices.\n\nTurning to Mina, I saw in her eyes horror and revulsion—evidence of her resistance and reason for hope. I brandished a piece of the wafer and advanced toward the spectres, driving them back as I refueled the fire. They could not breach the protections, nor could Mina leave the safety of the circle. The horses ceased their cries and lay quietly as the snow covered them. I understood then that their fear was over, even if their lives had ended."

          "text_segment": "5 November, afternoon.—I am at least sane. Thank God for that mercy at all events, though the proving it has been dreadful. When I left Madam Mina sleeping within the Holy circle, I took my way to the castle. The blacksmith hammer which I took in the carriage from Veresti was useful; though the doors were all open I broke them off the rusty hinges, lest some ill-intent or ill-chance should close them, so that being entered I might not get out. Jonathan’s bitter experience served me here. By memory of his diary I found my way to the old chapel, for I knew that here my work lay. The air was oppressive; it seemed as if there was some sulphurous fume, which at times made me dizzy. Either there was a roaring in my ears or I heard afar off the howl of wolves. Then I bethought me of my dear Madam Mina, and I was in terrible plight. The dilemma had me between his horns.\nHer, I had not dare to take into this place, but left safe from the Vampire in that Holy circle; and yet even there would be the wolf! I resolve me that my work lay here, and that as to the wolves we must submit, if it were God’s will. At any rate it was only death and freedom beyond. So did I choose for her. Had it but been for myself the choice had been easy, the maw of the wolf were better to rest in than the grave of the Vampire! So I make my choice to go on with my work.\nI knew that there were at least three graves to find—graves that are inhabit; so I search, and search, and I find one of them. She lay in her Vampire sleep, so full of life and voluptuous beauty that I shudder as though I have come to do murder. Ah, I doubt not that in old time, when such things were, many a man who set forth to do such a task as mine, found at the last his heart fail him, and then his nerve. So he delay, and delay, and delay, till the mere beauty and the fascination of the wanton Un-Dead have hypnotise him; and he remain on and on, till sunset come, and the Vampire sleep be over. Then the beautiful eyes of the fair woman open and look love, and the voluptuous mouth present to a kiss—and man is weak. And there remain one more victim in the Vampire fold; one more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the Un-Dead!...\nThere is some fascination, surely, when I am moved by the mere presence of such an one, even lying as she lay in a tomb fretted with age and heavy with the dust of centuries, though there be that horrid odour such as the lairs of the Count have had. Yes, I was moved—I, Van Helsing, with all my purpose and with my motive for hate—I was moved to a yearning for delay which seemed to paralyse my faculties and to clog my very soul. It may have been that the need of natural sleep, and the strange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me. Certain it was that I was lapsing into sleep, the open-eyed sleep of one who yields to a sweet fascination, when there came through the snow-stilled air a long, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke me like the sound of a clarion. For it was the voice of my dear Madam Mina that I heard.\nThen I braced myself again to my horrid task, and found by wrenching away tomb-tops one other of the sisters, the other dark one. I dared not pause to look on her as I had on her sister, lest once more I should begin to be enthrall; but I go on searching until, presently, I find in a high great tomb as if made to one much beloved that other fair sister which, like Jonathan I had seen to gather herself out of the atoms of the mist. She was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, so exquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which calls some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head whirl with new emotion. But God be thanked, that soul-wail of my dear Madam Mina had not died out of my ears; and, before the spell could be wrought further upon me, I had nerved myself to my wild work. By this time I had searched all the tombs in the chapel, so far as I could tell; and as there had been only three of these Un-Dead phantoms around us in the night, I took it that there were no more of active Un-Dead existent. There was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest; huge it was, and nobly proportioned. On it was but one word\nDRACULA.\nThis then was the Un-Dead home of the King-Vampire, to whom so many more were due. Its emptiness spoke eloquent to make certain what I knew. Before I began to restore these women to their dead selves through my awful work, I laid in Dracula’s tomb some of the Wafer, and so banished him from it, Un-Dead, for ever.\nThen began my terrible task, and I dreaded it. Had it been but one, it had been easy, comparative. But three! To begin twice more after I had been through a deed of horror; for if it was terrible with the sweet Miss Lucy, what would it not be with these strange ones who had survived through centuries, and who had been strengthened by the passing of the years; who would, if they could, have fought for their foul lives....\nOh, my friend John, but it was butcher work; had I not been nerved by thoughts of other dead, and of the living over whom hung such a pall of fear, I could not have gone on. I tremble and tremble even yet, though till all was over, God be thanked, my nerve did stand. Had I not seen the repose in the first place, and the gladness that stole over it just ere the final dissolution came, as realisation that the soul had been won, I could not have gone further with my butchery. I could not have endured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home; the plunging of writhing form, and lips of bloody foam. I should have fled in terror and left my work undone. But it is over! And the poor souls, I can pity them now and weep, as I think of them placid each in her full sleep of death for a short moment ere fading. For, friend John, hardly had my knife severed the head of each, before the whole body began to melt away and crumble in to its native dust, as though the death that should have come centuries agone had at last assert himself and say at once and loud “I am here!”\nBefore I left the castle I so fixed its entrances that never more can the Count enter there Un-Dead.\nWhen I stepped into the circle where Madam Mina slept, she woke from her sleep, and, seeing, me, cried out in pain that I had endured too much.\n“Come!” she said, “come away from this awful place! Let us go to meet my husband who is, I know, coming towards us.” She was looking thin and pale and weak; but her eyes were pure and glowed with fervour. I was glad to see her paleness and her illness, for my mind was full of the fresh horror of that ruddy vampire sleep.\nAnd so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, we go eastward to meet our friends—and him—whom Madam Mina tell me that she know are coming to meet us.",

After leaving Madam Mina safely asleep within the consecrated area, I headed towards the castle. The blacksmith hammer I brought from Veresti in the carriage proved useful; though the doors were open, I broke their rusty hinges off. This was a precaution against them accidentally closing and trapping me inside, a lesson learned from Jonathan's dreadful experience. Using the memory of his diary, I navigated to the old chapel, knowing my critical work needed to be done there. The air felt heavy and oppressive, almost like a sulphurous gas, which sometimes made me dizzy. I thought I heard roaring in my ears, or perhaps wolves howling in the distance. Thinking of my dear Madam Mina put me in a terrible dilemma. I hadn't dared to bring her into this place, leaving her safe from the Vampire in the Holy circle; yet even there, she would be vulnerable to the wolves! I resolved that my essential task was here, and that as for the wolves, we must accept our fate if it was God's will. In any case, death would bring freedom. This was the choice I made for her. If it had only been for myself, the decision would have been simple; being devoured by wolves is a better fate than becoming a vampire's grave! So, I decided to proceed with my work here. I knew I had to locate at least three graves containing active vampires; so, I searched diligently and found the first one. She lay in her vampire sleep, so full of life and seductive beauty that I shivered as if I were about to commit murder. Ah, I have no doubt that in ancient times, when such creatures existed, many a man who undertook a task like mine ultimately lost his courage and then his nerve. He would delay, and delay, and delay, until the sheer beauty and allure of the wicked Un-Dead hypnotized him, causing him to linger until sunset when the Vampire's sleep ended. Then, the beautiful eyes of the fair woman would open with a look of love, and her tempting mouth would invite a kiss—and a man is weak. And thus, one more victim would remain in the Vampire's thrall, adding another soul to the grim and horrifying ranks of the Un-Dead!... There is certainly a strange fascination, even for me, when I am affected by the mere presence of such a being, even as she lay in a tomb marked by age and thick with centuries of dust, despite the horrid smell similar to the Count's lairs. Yes, I was affected—I, Van Helsing, with my clear purpose and motive for hate—I was moved to a longing for delay that seemed to paralyze my abilities and clog my very soul. Perhaps it was the lack of natural sleep, combined with the strange oppressive air, beginning to overwhelm me. I was certainly drifting into sleep, the kind of open-eyed sleep that comes from yielding to a sweet enchantment, when suddenly, through the snow-silenced air, came a long, low wail, so filled with sorrow and pity that it jolted me awake like a trumpet call. For it was the voice of my dear Madam Mina that I heard. Then I braced myself again for my dreadful task and, by forcing open another tomb lid, found another of the sisters, the dark-haired one. I did not dare to pause and look at her as I had with her sister, for fear of being captivated once more. But I continued searching until, eventually, in a tall, grand tomb, as if intended for someone deeply cherished, I found that other fair sister who, like Jonathan, I had seen reconstitute herself from mist. She was so beautiful to behold, so radiantly lovely, so exquisitely sensual, that the very instinct of man within me, which compels some of my sex to love and protect one of hers, made my head swim with unfamiliar emotion. But thank God, that mournful cry from my dear Madam Mina had not left my ears; and before the spell could further take hold of me, I had steeled myself for my desperate work. By this time, I had, as far as I could tell, searched all the tombs in the chapel; and since there had been only three of these Un-Dead figures surrounding us during the night, I assumed there were no more active Un-Dead present. There was one larger tomb, more imposing than all the others; it was huge and nobly proportioned. On it was just one word: DRACULA. This, then, was the Un-Dead dwelling of the King-Vampire, to whom so many others owed their existence. Its emptiness spoke volumes, confirming what I already knew. Before I began the awful process of restoring these women to their true dead state, I placed some of the Holy Wafer in Dracula's tomb, thus permanently banishing him from it in his Un-Dead form. Then I began my terrible task, and I dreaded it immensely. If it had only been one, it would have been relatively easy. But three! To have to perform such a horrifying act two more times after the first; for if it was dreadful with the sweet Miss Lucy, how much worse would it be with these strange ones who had survived for centuries and been strengthened by the passage of time, who would, if they could, have fought for their vile existence... Oh, my friend John, it was truly a bloody, brutal business; had I not been strengthened by thoughts of other victims and of the living threatened by such a pall of fear, I could not have gone on. I still tremble even now, although, thank God, my nerve held until it was all finished. Had I not first seen the look of peace, and the joy that stole over her face just before the final disintegration, a sign that the soul had been saved, I could not have continued with my butchery. I could not have endured the horrid screaming as the stake was driven home; the violent thrashing form, and lips covered in bloody foam. I would have fled in terror and left my work incomplete. But it is over! And the poor souls, I can pity them now and weep, as I think of them resting peacefully, each in her full sleep of death for a brief moment before fading away. For, friend John, hardly had my knife severed the head of each, before the entire body began to melt away and crumble into its original dust, as though the death that should have occurred centuries ago had at last asserted itself, proclaiming loudly and immediately, \"I am here!\" Before I left the castle, I made sure to secure its entrances so that the Count can never enter there again as Un-Dead. When I stepped back into the circle where Madam Mina slept, she awoke and, seeing me, cried out in pain, feeling that I had suffered too much. \"Come!\" she urged, \"come away from this awful place! Let us go to meet my husband who is, I know, coming towards us.\" She looked thin and pale and weak, but her eyes were pure and shone with intense emotion. I was actually relieved to see her paleness and weakness, as my mind was still filled with the recent horror of that vibrant, ruddy vampire sleep. And so, with trust and hope, yet still full of fear, we travel eastward to meet our friends—and him—whom Madam Mina tells me she knows is coming to meet us.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "5 November, afternoon. — I am still in possession of my sanity, for which I am deeply grateful, though proving it was a terrible experience. When I left Madam Mina safely asleep inside the protective Holy circle, I made my way to the castle. The blacksmith’s hammer I brought from Veresti came in handy; even though the doors were all open, I broke them off their rusty hinges so that nothing — by malice or accident — could close them and trap me inside. Jonathan’s hard-earned lessons guided me; by recalling his journal, I found my way to the old chapel, knowing this was where I needed to do my work. The air was thick and stifling, smelling almost of sulfur and making me dizzy at times. Whether it was my imagination or not, I heard a distant howling of wolves or a roaring in my ears. I thought of dear Mina and felt torn; I dared not bring her into this dreadful place, but she was not entirely safe left behind, either. Still, I decided my duty was here in the castle. If the wolves attacked, it would be in God’s hands, and at least death would bring us freedom. For myself, the wolf’s jaws would be preferable to becoming prey for a Vampire. So, steeling myself, I got to work.\n\nI knew there were at least three Vampire graves to find and destroy, so I searched thoroughly and found one. The Un-Dead woman lying inside looked so beautiful and full of life that I shuddered at the thought of what I was about to do. Surely, in the past, other men faced with this horror must have lost their nerve at the last minute, delaying their task until hypnotized by the Vampire’s allure—giving in, and themselves becoming victims. Only a moment of weakness was needed for the Vampire to claim one more soul.\n\nI couldn’t help feeling the pull of this fascination myself, even as she lay in her ancient, dusty tomb, despite the foul smell characteristic of the Count’s lairs. I, Van Helsing, with every reason to hate, still felt paralyzed and tempted to postpone my grim duty. Perhaps fatigue and the oppressive air were affecting me, as I felt myself slipping into a trance-like sleep. Suddenly, a mournful, pitying cry cut through the quiet—it was Madam Mina’s voice, which snapped me out of it. \n\nGathering my resolve, I forced myself to continue, and by wrenching off more tomb covers, I found another of the Vampire sisters. I dared not let myself look at her for long, lest I be enchanted as before. Pressing on, I found the third sister in a grand tomb suited to someone greatly loved; she was astonishingly beautiful, almost impossibly so. For a moment, my instincts warred with my mission, but the echo of Madam Mina’s anguished cry kept me focused. I completed my search — it seemed there were no more than three active Vampires besides Dracula himself, whose grand tomb was empty, confirming he was not present. To prevent his return, I placed consecrated wafer in his tomb, banishing him from it for good.\n\nNow began the horrible work of freeing the women: had there been only one, it would have been easier, but facing three, centuries old and strengthened by years, was almost more than I could bear. If not for thoughts of those living in terror and those already lost, I could not have continued. I still tremble at the memory, but my resolve held, thank God. Seeing peace settle over their faces as they were released reminded me I was saving their souls. Otherwise I could not have withstood the gruesome sounds — the screeching as I drove the stake, the convulsions and blood froth. But it is finished, and now I can mourn those lost souls, glad that they found true rest at last; their bodies crumbled to dust as if death had finally claimed them after centuries.\n\nBefore leaving, I secured the castle so that Dracula can never return. When I returned to Mina, she woke, and, seeing what I had endured, implored me to leave that terrible place so we could go and meet her husband, whom she sensed was coming toward us. Though she looked pale and weak, her eyes shone with clarity. I was strangely glad to see her looking ill, so fresh was the horror of what I had just witnessed in the tombs. Filled with trust and hope but still afraid, we set off eastward to join our friends, and him, whom Mina said she knew was coming to find us."

          "text_segment": "6 November.—It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and I took our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming. We did not go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to take heavy rugs and wraps with us; we dared not face the possibility of being left without warmth in the cold and the snow. We had to take some of our provisions, too, for we were in a perfect desolation, and, so far as we could see through the snowfall, there was not even the sign of habitation. When we had gone about a mile, I was tired with the heavy walking and sat down to rest. Then we looked back and saw where the clear line of Dracula’s castle cut the sky; for we were so deep under the hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the Carpathian mountains was far below it. We saw it in all its grandeur, perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice, and with seemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain on any side. There was something wild and uncanny about the place. We could hear the distant howling of wolves. They were far off, but the sound, even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall, was full of terror. I knew from the way Dr. Van Helsing was searching about that he was trying to seek some strategic point, where we would be less exposed in case of attack. The rough roadway still led downwards; we could trace it through the drifted snow.\nIn a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I got up and joined him. He had found a wonderful spot, a sort of natural hollow in a rock, with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders. He took me by the hand and drew me in: “See!” he said, “here you will be in shelter; and if the wolves do come I can meet them one by one.” He brought in our furs, and made a snug nest for me, and got out some provisions and forced them upon me. But I could not eat; to even try to do so was repulsive to me, and, much as I would have liked to please him, I could not bring myself to the attempt. He looked very sad, but did not reproach me. Taking his field-glasses from the case, he stood on the top of the rock, and began to search the horizon. Suddenly he called out:—\n“Look! Madam Mina, look! look!” I sprang up and stood beside him on the rock; he handed me his glasses and pointed. The snow was now falling more heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was beginning to blow. However, there were times when there were pauses between the snow flurries and I could see a long way round. From the height where we were it was possible to see a great distance; and far off, beyond the white waste of snow, I could see the river lying like a black ribbon in kinks and curls as it wound its way. Straight in front of us and not far off—in fact, so near that I wondered we had not noticed before—came a group of mounted men hurrying along. In the midst of them was a cart, a long leiter-wagon which swept from side to side, like a dog’s tail wagging, with each stern inequality of the road. Outlined against the snow as they were, I could see from the men’s clothes that they were peasants or gypsies of some kind.\nOn the cart was a great square chest. My heart leaped as I saw it, for I felt that the end was coming. The evening was now drawing close, and well I knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till then imprisoned there, would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude all pursuit. In fear I turned to the Professor; to my consternation, however, he was not there. An instant later, I saw him below me. Round the rock he had drawn a circle, such as we had found shelter in last night. When he had completed it he stood beside me again, saying:—\n“At least you shall be safe here from him!” He took the glasses from me, and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us. “See,” he said, “they come quickly; they are flogging the horses, and galloping as hard as they can.” He paused and went on in a hollow voice:—\n“They are racing for the sunset. We may be too late. God’s will be done!” Down came another blinding rush of driving snow, and the whole landscape was blotted out. It soon passed, however, and once more his glasses were fixed on the plain. Then came a sudden cry:—\n“Look! Look! Look! See, two horsemen follow fast, coming up from the south. It must be Quincey and John. Take the glass. Look before the snow blots it all out!” I took it and looked. The two men might be Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris. I knew at all events that neither of them was Jonathan. At the same time I knew that Jonathan was not far off; looking around I saw on the north side of the coming party two other men, riding at break-neck speed. One of them I knew was Jonathan, and the other I took, of course, to be Lord Godalming. They, too, were pursuing the party with the cart. When I told the Professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy, and, after looking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible, he laid his Winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the opening of our shelter. “They are all converging,” he said. “When the time comes we shall have gypsies on all sides.” I got out my revolver ready to hand, for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came louder and closer. When the snow storm abated a moment we looked again. It was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us, and beyond, the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down towards the far mountain tops. Sweeping the glass all around us I could see here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger numbers—the wolves were gathering for their prey.\nEvery instant seemed an age whilst we waited. The wind came now in fierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us in circling eddies. At times we could not see an arm’s length before us; but at others, as the hollow-sounding wind swept by us, it seemed to clear the air-space around us so that we could see afar off. We had of late been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that we knew with fair accuracy when it would be; and we knew that before long the sun would set. It was hard to believe that by our watches it was less than an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various bodies began to converge close upon us. The wind came now with fiercer and more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north. It seemingly had driven the snow clouds from us, for, with only occasional bursts, the snow fell. We could distinguish clearly the individuals of each party, the pursued and the pursuers. Strangely enough those pursued did not seem to realise, or at least to care, that they were pursued; they seemed, however, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower and lower on the mountain tops.\nCloser and closer they drew. The Professor and I crouched down behind our rock, and held our weapons ready; I could see that he was determined that they should not pass. One and all were quite unaware of our presence.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "It was late afternoon on November 6th when the Professor and I headed east, the direction I knew Jonathan was coming from. We moved slowly despite the path being steeply downhill because we were burdened with heavy blankets and wraps, essential for staying warm in the probable cold and snow. We also carried some food provisions as we were in a completely isolated area, with no sign of human life visible through the falling snow. After walking about a mile, the strenuous going tired me, so I sat down to rest. Looking back, we could see the sharp outline of Dracula’s castle against the sky; we were so far below the hill it sat on that the angle of the Carpathian mountains was much lower than the castle itself. It appeared majestic, perched on a sheer cliff a thousand feet high, seemingly separated by a large gap from the adjacent mountains. The place felt wild and eerie. We could hear wolves howling in the distance. Though faint due to the muffling snow, the sound was terrifying. I noticed Dr. Van Helsing carefully surveying the area, searching for a good defensive position where we would be less exposed if attacked. The rough trail continued to descend, visible only as a track through the snowdrifts.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "November 6—Late in the afternoon, the Professor and I headed east, knowing Jonathan would be arriving from that direction. Even though the path sloped steeply downwards, we moved slowly because we had to carry heavy blankets and extra clothing; we couldn't risk being trapped in the cold and snow without warmth. We brought some food as well since the area was completely desolate—no signs of any homes could be seen through the falling snow. After about a mile, I was exhausted by the difficult walk and stopped to rest. Looking back, we could see the clear outline of Dracula’s castle against the sky; because we were deep below the hill it stood on, the massive Carpathian mountains looked far beneath it. It appeared majestic, perched a thousand feet up on a sheer cliff, separated from the neighboring mountains by wide gaps. There was a wild and eerie feeling about the place. Far away, we could hear the wolves howling—a terrifying sound, even subdued by the snow. Dr. Van Helsing searched around, clearly looking for a defensible spot in case we were attacked. The rough road continued downwards, visible through the snowdrifts.\nAfter a while, the Professor signaled to me, and I joined him. He had discovered a remarkable shelter—a natural hollow in the rock with an entrance between two boulders. He took my hand and led me inside: “See,” he said, “you will be safe here; if wolves come, I can face them one at a time.” He brought in our furs and made a cozy nest for me, then gave me food, encouraging me to eat. But the idea of eating was unpleasant—I couldn’t bring myself to try. Although disappointed, the Professor did not reproach me. He took his field glasses and stood atop the rock, scanning the horizon. Suddenly, he called out, \"Look! Madam Mina, look!\" I quickly joined him; he handed me the glasses and pointed. The snow was falling harder now, swirling in the growing wind, but between flurries there were brief moments of clear visibility. From our high vantage point, I could see far—out beyond the snowy waste, the river appeared as a black ribbon twisting through the landscape. Not far in front of us, though I wondered we hadn't noticed before, a group of horsemen hurried along, centered around a cart—a long leiter-wagon swaying side to side with the road’s bumps. Their clothing marked them as peasants or gypsies.\nOn the cart was a large square chest. My heart raced at the sight, sensing the end was near. Evening was falling, and I knew that at sunset, the being locked inside could escape and vanish in any form. Concerned, I turned to the Professor, but to my alarm he had left. Moments later I saw he had traced a protective circle around the rock, as we had done previously for safety. When done, he returned, promising, \"At least you shall be safe here from him!\" Taking the glasses again, he watched the field below. “See,\" he said, “they are beating the horses, rushing ahead.” He paused, voice hollow: “They are racing the sunset. We may be too late. God's will be done!” Another blinding storm blotted out the scene, passing quickly. He watched the plain again, then exclaimed, “Look! Two riders are following fast from the south. It must be Quincey and John. Take the glasses—quickly before the snow blocks our view!” I looked; the two must be Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris—neither was Jonathan. But looking further north of the group with the cart, I saw two more men riding at full speed—one was Jonathan, the other likely Lord Godalming. They too pursued the wagon. When I told the Professor, he cheered with excitement, and, after watching until another snowstorm hindered visibility, he set his rifle ready at our shelter’s entrance. He declared, “They are all coming together; soon we’ll have gypsies everywhere.” I readied my revolver too, as the wolves’ howls grew louder and closer. During a break in the snow, we looked out again. It was strange—heavy flakes fell near us, yet beyond, the sun shone brighter as it neared the mountaintops. Through the glasses, I saw small moving dots, singly and in groups—the wolves gathering for their prey.\nEach moment seemed to drag on as we waited. The wind blew with fierce gusts, spinning the snow around us. Sometimes we could barely see our hands in front of us; other times, the wind would clear the air momentarily, granting distant views. By now, we were so used to watching sunrise and sunset that we could estimate the time well, and knew sunset was approaching. It was hard to believe little time had passed before all the different parties neared our position. The wind now came steadily and bitterly from the north, seemingly pushing the snow clouds away, leaving only occasional bursts of snow. We could clearly distinguish the members of each group—the chased and the pursuers. Oddly, those being chased didn’t seem to notice or care they were being followed; they sped up as the sun continued to fall behind the mountains.\nAs they drew closer, the Professor and I crouched behind our rock, weapons ready. I noticed he was resolved not to let them pass. None of the parties had any idea we were there."

At the same moment Dr. Van Helsing and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them. Seeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and drew up. The leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of the gypsy party drew what weapon he carried, knife or pistol, and held himself in readiness to attack. Issue was joined in an instant.\nThe leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out in front, and pointing first to the sun—now close down on the hill tops—and then to the castle, said something which I did not understand. For answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from their horses and dashed towards the cart. I should have felt terrible fear at seeing Jonathan in such danger, but that the ardour of battle must have been upon me as well as the rest of them; I felt no fear, but only a wild, surging desire to do something. Seeing the quick movement of our parties, the leader of the gypsies gave a command; his men instantly formed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour, each one shouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the order.\nIn the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring of men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart; it was evident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun should set. Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither the levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, nor the howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their attention. Jonathan’s impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of his purpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him; instinctively they cowered, aside and let him pass. In an instant he had jumped upon the cart, and, with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the great box, and flung it over the wheel to the ground. In the meantime, Mr. Morris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of Szgany. All the time I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had, with the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and had seen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them, and they cut at him. He had parried with his great bowie knife, and at first I thought that he too had come through in safety; but as he sprang beside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, I could see that with his left hand he was clutching at his side, and that the blood was spurting through his fingers. He did not delay notwithstanding this, for as Jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest, attempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife, he attacked the other frantically with his bowie. Under the efforts of both men the lid began to yield; the nails drew with a quick screeching sound, and the top of the box was thrown back.\nBy this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters, and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, had given in and made no resistance. The sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and the shadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow. I saw the Count lying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from the cart had scattered over him. He was deathly pale, just like a waxen image, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which I knew too well.\nAs I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them turned to triumph.\nBut, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan’s great knife. I shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat; whilst at the same moment Mr. Morris’s bowie knife plunged into the heart.\nIt was like a miracle; but before our very eyes, and almost in the drawing of a breath, the whole body crumbled into dust and passed from our sight.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Suddenly, two shouts rang out demanding they \"Stop!\" One was Jonathan's voice, shrill with emotion; the other was Mr. Morris's deep, unwavering tone of authority. Although the gypsies might not have understood the words, the command's force was unmistakable, regardless of the language. Reacting instantly, they pulled back their horses just as Lord Godalming and Jonathan galloped up on one side, and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris arrived on the other. The gypsy leader, a striking man who sat his horse with the grace of a centaur, gestured for them to retreat and fiercely ordered his men to continue. His men whipped their horses forward, but the four men raised their Winchester rifles and issued a clear order to halt. Simultaneously, Dr. Van Helsing and I emerged from behind the rock, aiming our own weapons. Realizing they were surrounded, the gypsies tightened their reins and stopped. The leader spoke to his men, and at his word, every gypsy drew whatever weapon he carried, be it a knife or pistol, preparing for a confrontation. The conflict began immediately.\nWith a swift pull of his rein, the leader positioned his horse in front, pointed first to the setting sun near the hilltops, then to the castle, and said something I didn't grasp. In response, all four men from our group dismounted and rushed towards the cart. I should have felt immense fear seeing Jonathan in such danger, but the excitement of the fight must have consumed me too; I felt no fear, only a powerful, urgent need to act. Noticing our group's quick movement, the gypsy leader gave another command; his men instantly formed a chaotic ring around the cart, pushing and jostling each other in their haste to obey.\nAmidst this chaos, I saw Jonathan on one side of the circle and Quincey on the other, forcing their way towards the cart. It was clear their goal was to complete their task before sunset. Nothing seemed able to deter or even slow them down. Neither the aimed weapons and flashing knives of the gypsies in front nor the howling of the wolves behind seemed to capture their attention. Jonathan’s fierce drive and obvious focus seemed to intimidate those blocking his path; they instinctively recoiled and allowed him through. In a flash, he leaped onto the cart and, with seemingly impossible strength, lifted the large box and threw it over the wheel onto the ground. Meanwhile, Mr. Morris had to fight his way through his side of the gypsy ring. While watching Jonathan with intense focus, I had also, out of the corner of my eye, seen Morris struggling desperately forward and glimpsed the flash of gypsy knives as he fought through, being cut at. He used his large bowie knife to defend himself, and initially, I thought he had also gotten through unharmed. But as he sprang to join Jonathan, who had by then jumped off the cart, I could see him clutching his side with his left hand, blood spurting between his fingers. Despite this injury, he didn't hesitate. While Jonathan, with furious energy, attacked one end of the chest, trying to pry off the lid with his large Kukri knife, Morris frantically attacked the other end with his bowie. Under their combined efforts, the lid began to give way; the nails screeched as they were pulled out, and the top of the box was thrown open.\nBy this point, the gypsies, seeing themselves held at gunpoint by the Winchesters and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, had surrendered and offered no further resistance. The sun was nearly below the mountaintops, casting long shadows of our entire group across the snow. Inside the box, lying on the earth scattered over him from its rough fall, I saw the Count. He was deathly pale, like a figure made of wax, and his red eyes burned with that terrible, vengeful look I recognized all too well.\nAs I watched, his eyes caught the sight of the setting sun, and the hatred within them transformed into a look of triumph.\nBut at that very moment, Jonathan's large knife swept and flashed. I screamed as I saw it slice through the throat; simultaneously, Mr. Morris’s bowie knife plunged into the heart.\nIt was astounding; right before our eyes, almost in the space of a single breath, the entire body disintegrated into dust and vanished.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Suddenly, two voices shouted, \"Stop!\"—one was Jonathan's, filled with intense emotion, and the other was Mr. Morris's steady, commanding tone. Even though the gypsies might not have understood the words, the commanding tone was unmistakable. Instinctively, they stopped their horses. At that moment, Lord Godalming and Jonathan rushed to one side while Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris approached from the other. The gypsy leader, an impressive man on horseback, tried to ward them off and ordered his group to continue, but the four men raised their Winchester rifles and made it clear they should halt. Meanwhile, Dr. Van Helsing and I emerged from behind a rock, also pointing weapons. Surrounded, the gypsies stopped and listened to their leader, who gave a signal so that each man drew a weapon and prepared to fight. Confrontation was inevitable.\n\nThe leader quickly moved ahead of the group, gestured toward the setting sun and the nearby castle, and said something I couldn’t understand. In response, our four men jumped from their horses and charged toward the cart. Despite the risk, I felt only the urge to act—not fear. The gypsy leader commanded his men to guard the cart, and they gathered around it, clumsily but determined.\n\nJonathan and Quincey forced their way through the crowd from opposite sides, determined to accomplish their task before sunset. Nothing—neither weapons nor the threat of wolves—deterred them. Jonathan’s determination was so impressive that those blocking him moved aside, and he reached the cart, lifting a large box off and throwing it to the ground. Meanwhile, Mr. Morris fought his way through, blocking attacks with his knife, though he was wounded in the side. Unhindered, Jonathan tried to open the chest with his kukri, while Mr. Morris attacked from the other side with his bowie knife. Their efforts quickly loosened the lid, which came off with a screech.\n\nAt this point, the gypsies, overpowered and threatened by the raised rifles, surrendered and stood down. The sun was nearly gone behind the mountains, casting long shadows. I saw Count Dracula inside the box, pale and motionless, with hateful, red eyes that turned triumphant as he saw the setting sun. But then, Jonathan’s knife flashed, slicing through Dracula’s throat, while Mr. Morris plunged his knife into the vampire’s heart. In a miraculous moment, Dracula’s body crumbled into dust right before our eyes."

His castle was starkly outlined against the crimson sky, every section of its damaged ramparts clearly visible in the light of the setting sun. The group of gypsies, believing us somehow responsible for the count's sudden demise, turned and rode away without a word, fleeing as if their lives depended on it. Those who were on foot scrambled onto the wagon, yelling for the riders not to leave them behind. The wolves, which had retreated earlier, followed the gypsies, leaving us alone. Mr. Morris, who had collapsed to the ground, supported himself on his elbow, pressing his hand against his side; blood continued to flow between his fingers. I rushed to him immediately, as the holy barrier no longer held me back; the two doctors did the same. Jonathan knelt beside him, and the injured man rested his head on Jonathan's shoulder. With a sigh, Quincey made a weak effort to take my unstained hand with his own. He must have seen the distress in my expression, for he smiled at me and said, 'I'm truly glad to have been of any assistance! Oh, God!' he suddenly cried out, pushing himself up slightly and gesturing toward me, 'To die for this was worthwhile! Look! Look!' The sun was now right at the mountaintop, casting red beams onto my face, bathing it in a warm, rosy glow. Acting as one, the men dropped to their knees, and a heartfelt, solemn 'Amen' was spoken by all as their eyes followed his pointing finger.
